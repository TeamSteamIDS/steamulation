Early Access Review
								This game has all the tools it needs to be great.  They started out with a template that was very successful and have been tweaking it into a new game that offers different tactical options for the players to consider.  The good:1)  When I first played I enjoyed it so very much.  I could watch modern day soldiers fight and try to survive without me telling them to do simple things like ""duck behind cover when 50 dudes are shooting at you!""  The AI of each soldier knew to do that better than any previous incarnation of the MoW series.  2)  All the old goodies from the MoW series were part of the game.  Cooking grenades, stances for soldiers to stand, crouch or lay prone.  Accuracy modifiers stances as well as using cover.  The damage models of soldiers seem to be carried over as well.  It's a good system and works great for this game.  Love it.3)  Very stable game with a few eceptions.  Many of the MoW games have been plagued with OOS and disconnection issues.  Players dropping out of the game mid battle isn't something you have to worry about with this game.The Bad:1)  Units are locked by level.  Nobody likes it.  The developer has stated that they give players the tools they need to win with basic squads and only elite squads are locked.  This is a half truth.  The elite squads do have better stats but there are a few that are totally unique, such as the grenadier squad that has rifle grenades that can shoot soldiers who are behind cover.  There is no basic unit that can do that.  2)  Vehicles have wacked out damage models atm.  I'm sure they'll be fixed but it's game breaking to see a 6P50 technical snipe a humvee with twice the armor halfway across the map when the humvee needs to be at least half that distance to even damage the pickup truck that has no visible armor whatsoever.  When vehicles were introduced the game balance was thrown way off.3)  If you have no control points then your soldiers have no way to re-supply their ammo.  None.  To me this is giving the winning player even more advantage and seems a bit silly.  Also Anti-Tank infantry cannot resupply at all.  Once their rockets are used they are officially rifle soldiers and you have to BUY another Anti-Tank squad if  you need more tank busting done.  The ugly:All the players who loved MoW loved the Direct Control feature.  It's what made the game unique and made the game amazing to play.  It's a feature that no other RTS game has matched thus far.  Unfortunately it's also a feature that's being chopped up and sold as a lame imitation of it's former self.  When players who have supported the game cried out that they wanted back the feature that makes the game fun for them they are told that they are abusing god mode mechanics that give an unfair advantage.  Nobody agrees with this.  It does however take time to learn the Direct Control system and that is something that casual players do not like to do, invest time.  It would seem that the developer is catering to the casual crowd that loves facebook games and hello kitty.  They have told the old school hardcore player base who love the gritty gameplay that they're no longer  important in the CtA universe.  The playerbase that is important is the kind that blows huge chunks of cash on simplified games that have no depth whatsoever.  This guy bought (A)?  Ok buy (Anti-A).  He bought (B)?  Ok buy (Anti-B).  No more using skill to beat the odds, it's just a point and click adventure where you sit back and watch the show while giving vague orders to soldiers who can only perform one duty.In it's current state I cannot recommend this game.  It could be something amazing if the developer listened to the community about what they do and do not like.  However they simply add features in and refuse admit when those features are bad for the game.  This is a red flag for me.  It is a red flag for many others as well.  The player base went from 900+ online playing in multiplayer games to 180.  Whatever their vision for the game may be the fact remains that nobody wants to play a game that has dead multiplayer.  Nobody. "

Early Access Review
								For those curious: This game released in 2015 for the price of 30 bucks. The developers made a lot of the content gated behind insanely dumb progression (meaning you couldn't use all of the units in the base game until you played online) and instead of fixing it for those that purchased it, they went F2P and are trying to bilk more players out of money for the season pass. I've already submitted a refund request because I refuse to support a developer that would do this.UPDATE 4/10/17The developer responded to me saying the game was not free, to which I respectfully disagreed. Let me break down why, free or not, you should avoid Call to Arms:1. The actual extended content offered isn't that great. Differing factions don't offer really any unique properties beyond skins. 2. The content available after all unlocks are made is seriously not reflective of what the original videos, images, and descriptions show. It plays a lot like MoW, with little to no content that a typical RTS would have.3. Bad AI - even on highest difficulty, the typical AI tactic is to spam light infantry and hold easily defended positions, removing a layer of offline play and co-op play online because the AI is so bad.4. Developer involvement and response - most complaints are overlooked, and some are outright criticized. 5. Poorly implemented progression - Unlock other RTS games that will allow you to use all units and forces in offline sandbox play, Call to Arms gates your unit access behind XP that can only be gained by playing online.

Early Access Review
								I did like this game, i bought the deluxe edition and had some fun with it. Then things went to $|-|1T. Deluxe was promised as a full package with access to all future content. Lies. Apparently they decided to restrict things behind pay walls after all. The developers are complete scamming cowards. I have been permanently banned from all CTA discussions for 'offensive language'. I asked them a legitimate question regarding the season pass and they decided to delete my comment and not answer it, cos you know, they have my money, why would they care now? So I used 'offensive language' which was ONE cuss word. What a bunch of prissy little girls. The whole DLC policy is just ridiculous. As i said, i bought the deluxe edition, then there turned out to be an 'ultimate edition', then a 'season pass', the latter of which you need to buy DESPITE having paid for what they said, would include everything, to get future DLC. This is an early access game and they are already spewing out DLC's before the game is even finished. Even then, the game isn't that great, sure it's fun for a while but there's a distinct lack of content (which you need to pay further for), the community is toxic and combine this with a terrible cash grab policy and the most pathetic, cowardly developers going and it makes for a really bad game. They basically just P1$$3D on all the people that helped them with the kickstarter campagin and decided to milk it for all they possibly can. The thing that gets me though is the incredible ignorance of the developers. Ignoring questions, deleting comments, banning you because you said a naughty word. Man, what a bunch of scamming P(_)$$13S. Avoid this game unless you like paying for content you have essentially already paid for previously, terrible barebones single player and generic multiplayer matches that play out the same, countless bugs/issues and slow development where they basically just say words to make it look like something is happening.. Oh, yeah, i forgot to mention, they also introduced a new F2P policy, complete with glorious microtransactions! Un.Believable. Just pure wow. May as well be lighting your money on fire whilst they laugh at you with they're middle finger in the air. Scamming. Ignorant. Coward. P(_)$$13$. Worst developers on the planet. Horrible game that could have been great if it wasn't for straight up greed.Pro's - Perfect example of how to not market a game.Con's - The whole thing.			"

Early Access Review
								Cool game but poor business practices. I really regret supporting this game. Another good example of why to avoid early access. Reskin of MOWAS2 with significantly less content and factions which they make even worse by charging you separately for a campaign. Game will be made free to play as well so you can only image the paywalls they are going to add in the future which I bet will also effect people who already bought it. This really screws over people like myself who bought the game during early access and I have to apologize to anyone reading this as it is people like me, who buy early access, that make it even possible for developers to do stuff like this to their games. They have added vehicles, maps, game modes, and missions during early access. Maps are good, game modes are interesting, however the roster size is left to be desired. There are only two factions and there is a significant decrease in the amount of total missions we get with the base game. The UI at the begining of early access was also a complete copy and paste of MOWAS2 but they updated UI to give CtA it's own feel. Each ""sequel"" they release seems like it will get more and more stripped of content to charge you for it later. I wouldn't recommend supporting these developers while they make games in early access. If you really want the games they make then wait until they are finish products so you know what you are getting.Here is a simple comparison:MOWAS2 base game includes: 5 factions, a lot of units for each faction roster, a campaign for each faction with about 8 or 9 missions per without the DLC, good amount of maps, 5 game modes and co-op.CtA base game includes: 2 factions, a smaller unit roster, 1 campaign with around 10 missions, good amount of maps, 7 game modes and co-op. So they basically added 2 new game modes.What we should expect following this for CtA2 base game: 1 faction, an even smaller roster, half a campaign, good amount of maps, maybe more game modes if they can think of any but will probably start charging for them at this point.As the developers point out we shouldn't expect anything at all from them and therefore we would have no reason to be upset if they even gave us nothing. Because they didn't ""promise"" not to give us nothing so if they did give us nothing it wouldn't be a bad thing. At least that is what I take from our conversation in the comments. Like if GTA VI came with smaller map, less cars, less guns, less things to do but it is okay because we shouldn't expect the next game in a line to get bigger, better, and offer more - that is an unreasonable expectation apparently.If they want to make the game as content filled as MOWAS2 how do you think they are going to do it? They might add more factions but I bet charge you for each faction and then also charge you for each campaign for those factions.Easy enough to see the CtA base game is a complete waste of money opposed to MOWAS2 base game. This does not even take into account Red Rising mod. It is probably mods like Red Rising that make it so the developers think they can sell such a bare bones game. The modders will make the content for free and the devs will collect the fruit of that labor while also taking stuff that should be in the base game and selling it to you and jacking up the price in the meantime.Another good example of poor business practice is how they remastered the first men of war with money earned from this game instead of putting more work into this game. Even if it wasn't exactly like that, that is how it appears. It also appears they use early access funds to develop the GRM campaign which they plan to charge for. Otherwise how are they planning on developing it before they are actually making profit on a released game? That is time and money that should be going into their early access game, not DLC for it, in my opinion. Maybe they are not developing it right now but I highly doubt that.Update: Just realized this - Deluxe Edition comes with the first DLC free, which I assume is the campaign DLC, but they upped the price of the game by $5 without it leaving early access. Keep that in mind if you think buying the game is a good idea because they most likely just added in the ""free DLC"" price to it. I could understand upping the price after it leaves early access but it is still in early access and they up the price. Probably just because they decided to strip the campaign and sell it as DLC and to act like they are doing a favor for buyers ""by giving it free"" when they really are not. Like I said, poor business practices. Basically screwing over people who don't realize this price change.Update: They stated they are raising the price during early access to make people who bought it earlier than other early access buyers feel special for getting it at a cheaper price. I fail to see how this is good for any early access supporter regardless of when you bought it. Price shouldn't of changed during early access in the first place just because the devs feel you should of supported the game in X amount of time. The time you have to support the development of a game should be based on the early access duration as a whole, not incriments of it. But not only do they change the price but they try to pass it off as a favor. I will let you judge if you think that is a favor to you or not. I personally don't feel like it is. I feel like it is just screwing over any early supporter who just didn't supported it as early as me and is an excuse just to up the price during early access. I mean they are a business so by all means they should get money how they see fit. I just do not like the way they do business so I don't recommend dealing with them.Update: Game updates since writing this have just focused on 3rd person camera and controls. Another thing I don't understand. I thought I was buying a Top Down RTS. Now it is like a Top Down RTS/3rd person shooter hybrid. For a strategy player like myself this is just terrible. I wouldn't of paid for 3rd person even if they actually knew how to make 3rd person games.Update: If you have read this far then maybe you remember when I said they will collect the fruits of labor from their modding community? Well the F2P version is out and obviously you can't use the mods without paying for them first by buying the game. Great way to monitize mods. I suspect other game developers will take note and start doing the same thing. Someone has to pay for these FREE community mods. Why not you F2P users? The mods are the perfect bait to dangle infront of F2P users to get them to buy the game. I assume the DLC, reviews, and season pass are not strong enough selling points on their own to get you to buy the game.Oh, and there is a thread where Instinct literally disregarded all negative reviews as people who do not play the game.  Half the player base is reviewing his game in the same manner, complaining about the same thing, and he is just going to ignore all of them. Only positive reviews that are wrote for this game come from F2P users that didn't get screwed by these developers.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has the potential to be really great; however, there is one major multiplayer flaw by design.  Units are unlocked by level. This means that players just starting out are at a disadvantage to more experienced player not only because of the lack of experience but also because they do not have the same selection of units available to them. This just makes the learning curve even steeper. I'm not quite sure what the developers were thinking. That would kind of be like playing chess with one side having all the pieces while the newcomer only gets pawns.To those that say the one can simply play against bots: It doesn't make sense that one should have to skirmish against bots for 20+ hours to gain ""experience"". Bots don't play like people do, and if one thinks it is going to make one better at the game, then one is quite foolish. As far as changing parameters? Why have parameter to restrict access to begin with? The community isn't that large to begin with so all this does is make it less likely newcomers will stay when they are fighting against veteran players. What does it add to the mulitplayer experience? Eugen had this for Wargame: European Escalation, but then figured out that it was moronic and dropped it in the later two games.			"

								Bought the game as a long standing fan of the Men of War series with many hundreds of hours of game time.+Modern Setting (i like it)-Ruined the direct control feature that was to me the best feature of the entire franchise.-Really bad single player campaign mission & map design.-Really bad multiplayer map design with no ability for vehicles to manouver properly due to arbitrary blockers.-Unit lock.-Removal of buildable sandbags.-Odd unit choices (Arabs with T-80? Random Arm Show BMP?)-Counterbalance a long range grenade launcher on the US faction that will instantly blow up a technical with a WW2 bolt action rifle squad on the arab side.-Putting effort into making 3d models for A-10, Su-25, Mi-8, UH-60 and AH-64 which could have been spent actually fleshing out the factions.And last but not least, they made the game free to play with NO compensation for the people that actually bought the game.Contender for worst managed game development of the century.

I didn't buy this game to be conned into buying a Season Pass for content I thought I was already getting nearly 6 months after I bought the game. They justify this by saying they gave a 20% discount for 2 weeks to anyone who already bought the game... are you f*cking serious?			"

Multiplayer with AI.Not having to pay for those AI.Set in the modern era.Yes, yes and yes. --Serious--In its current state I would recommend this game. It has a well done AI for those who do not compete well in online matches like myself. The AI is actually a challenge on the higher levels and the game provide a small variety of maps. The small amount of time I have put into the game already feels well worth it.  Sadly there is only two faction as of now and it does seem the team is interested in making an addition to the faction but nothing was set in stone.The game has a test feature which I find is always over looked, It often causes crashes due to a overload of units but it is fun to experiment with all the units. Most of the voice overs are ripped straight from the previous games much like a couple sounds but so far the new sounds are fantastic and show great promise. I have only seen infantry combat and I believe that is all that is in the game as of now but this was enough to justify my purchase. This game shows great potential, this phrase can often ward of suspicious purchasers but this is a well done Early Access game. Little to no bugs and a very good showcase of what's to come.The graphics are very well done, some people are concerned this is a reskin but it looks like custom models and meshes have been done and that those comments are more anger than truth. The game modes are pretty familiar but the game does feel different.The third person mode works like a charm, like in men of war you are able to seamlessly transition and use the mechanic as much as you need.The guns and weapons feel a lot stronger, people die quicker and the game feels a lot less forgiving. In men of war charging right into a bunker and clearing it was a possibility, not in Call to Arms however. The enemy will kill your entire squad if you are not positioned right. Sometimes this gets annoying but it is realistic and great for strategy. Long range engagements can last for a long time and I feel this really sets the games mood and gives you or the enemy the ability to use it as a distraction.The inventory system is a basic rip from the men of war system but there is no blame. It is a good system that works flawlessly, along with the highlighting bodies and weapons hot keys/mechanic.I am unsure if the price is justified in its current state for people who are no hardcore fans but I believe in my own bias way that in its current state I made a wise purchase even if the game wasn't finished.The implementation of Workshop already is fantastic and people haven't waited to start adding new thing to the game. The tools to adapt the game are superb and if you owned any previous games by the devs you know what to expect, a quality and proffesional map editor.I have made several videos of the game which you can find here if you are still undecided: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzExFRZtGr851dUhdp6NbRirfhqIOczRm "

								I've never written a bad review on Steam before. Being a game developer myself, I really try to give dev's benefit of the doubt.. But this whole ""Developer Update"" news release every few months is total bs. The last ""real"" update, was I believe in August? (at least that's what the game files say.. Good luck trying to find the actual dates on their website..). And for a game that was supposed to be finished in ""October"", every new ""developer update"" they write (which all say the same exact things as the previous ones.. just replace a few words here and there to make it look new), is a joke. Definitely feel like we've been scammed. (and that's not even considering that most of us paid for this game in full.. A game that isn't finished, with a campaign that's never been released.. and now suddenly it's Free to Play?..)If it's free, check it out. But I wouldn't give them a dollar more.			"

								Having bought this game in It's early stages, i've seen how it's changed. To be honest I'm not impressed. I Really can't recommend this game in it's current state, it's unstable, unbalanced and extremely clunky. I'm a casual fan of the MoW series and to see a modern version had me excited (and i imagine a lot of other people too). But to call this a MoW reskin would be complimenting it. The core mechanical issues with the MoW series haven't been adressed and some aspects have gotten worse. To list my gripes, I'll start with the proggression system. To use many of the better units such as the Abrams, you have to first pour numerous hours into unlocking it, leaving you sometimes outgunned in MP matches. Various infantry units AI is abyssmal and often won't return fire on enemies. The depth-of-field (or lack of) makes it impossible to judge terrain. To top it off the devs seem to be adamant that they know best even when people offer insight into balance issues. If i could get a refund I would.			"

								Potentially a great game. As it stands developers seem intent on ruining it by introducing gimmicks in an attempt to diversify by changing the direct control into an inferior clone in the name of ""vision"" and ""direction"". In reality its an eyesore, hard to use, inaccurate, and entirely useless. The AI does a better job of shooting, making it entirely irrelevant. The Forums are censored, dissenting opinion is removed and people who disagree are banned. The developer in charge is a college clipboarder with no real world experience and an entirely toxic to the core individual. I love men of war and its game series but I cannot in good conscious reccommend this game to anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								First, let's address a central question that may or may not be in your mind as you're reading this review.CTA = MOWAS2 reskin?Effectively, yes.  The sounds of guns, tooltips of weapons, hints and tips in loading screens, UI, font choices for events (vehicle hull damaged/destroyed, penetrating hit, exp tickers when achieving kills etc), direct control of infantry and vehicles and the overall functionality of game mechanics are identical.So what gives?  To preface my actual review of the game and its content in terms of pros and cons (I mostly play RTS games and have racked up a few ten thousand hours across varying franchises), I'd like to open up a bit further about the whole Call to Arms / Men of War Assault Squad 2 mess.As you may or may not be aware, MOWAS2's development issues, while layered in part to incompetence from staff, can also be explained by the Ukraine Crisis, as a part of the development team were Ukrainians and, one of the main publishers of Men of War in the past has historically been a Russian company.  MOWAS2 is virtually unsupported today, and even during active development it was very apparent that the game did not build upon MOWAS1 in any way.  To me, a humble consumer, MOWAS2 seemed like a blatant cash-grab.  Mind you, I'm not a veteran of the MOWAS franchise, so I can largely forgive the nature of its development as I assumed the game would be developed past a certain point.  It was not.CTA blumbered out of no where and was in part funded by crowdsourcing.  The daily playercount as far as the consumer is concerned is from 40 to 50 people, with a spike of perhaps 15 people online at once (oh boy.)That was the preface, now on to the review of the product itself:Call to Arms is topical, it features a fictional arab fighting force (GRM) which you'd be forgiven for mistaking for ISIS, and a Gulf War era US military, though without Javelins.When considering multiplayer versus play (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4) the game's pacing takes place in 3 stages:Infantry,Mechanized,Heavy mechanized.Each of these stages lasts roughly 5-7 minutes, so your average game should not take past 20 minutes no matter the size, as the amount of resources given per player is a fixed amount (boring, in my opinion) and after incurring X losses you just stop getting income, period.There are no heavier tanks past the Bradley, BMP-3 and Stryker MGS, though the fact they want to implement the Abrams is almost painfully obvious.  AT Weapons are limited to the RPG-7, LAW and AT-4 rocket launchers.This is where any original ideas end.  The rest of the game and its mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played more than 5 hours of the MOWAS franchise, which is a let-down.  There are 2 arguments that are popular to excuse this fact, first:  ""It's only 20 dollars!"" and second ""It's in Alpha!"" To the first point, 20 dollars is a nice price.  It's genuinely what this game is worth if you intend on purchasing it.  To say that it's ""only"" 20 dollars is like saying that a cheeseburger is ""only"" 1 dollar - is it a bargain?  Or is it just the maximum amount of money the producer can ask without being scoffed at, at this point?To the second, and this is funny, CTA is actually more stable and better streamlined than AS2, which is just bizarre to me.  This 20 dollar title is better polished during Alpha, than MOWAS2 ever was after years of development.  I'd love to give CTA the benefit of the doubt in terms of developmental stage but I highly doubt it will ever become more stable than it already is.Pros- It's a cheeseburger, good value- More stable than the platform used to develop it (Assault Squad 2)- Better balanced overall in terms of infantry small arms, penetration values of AT Weapons and vehiclesCons- Its a cheeseburger, not a filet mignon- Already has achieved its full potential minus 1 or 2 units prefaction, and it's in ""Alpha""- A few desynch-inducing bugs- Tiny community- No new creative thought, it's same old mechanics with a new narrative- Elite infantry are far too good, infantry AI is detrimentally badCTA relies on its multiplayer component for replay value, without a community this replay value does not exist.  While I would like to recommend the game based purely on the fact that it's stable, relatively balanced and rewards skill and tactics (but only to a certain point, sadly, especially the BTR-80 can wipe out infantry armies in seconds at long distances), I cannot recommend it based on the fact it does not have enough players to give you, the customer, any reasonable replay value.This game needs around 10,000 active, daily players to be able to deliver what it promises.  However, due to being a MOWAS game and therefore having a learning curve that requires patience, it does not seem to have a very good retention rate for players.  People tend to buy the game, try it for 10 hours, and then never looking at it again so sales figures are deceptive.Should you buy it?  If you're a MOWAS fan and want to support the developer, yes.If you're an RTS fan who's looking for a new game to dedicate to, create content (YouTube, Twitch) or be part of a community, this is not the game for you.

Early Access Review
								Since there are a lot of negative reviews for this game and a lot of them are very dishonest, from people who barely played, I will write my own detailed review to balance it out.As a disclaimer I am a long time Men of War player with over 400 hours in MoWAS2 and even more in MoWAS. I played the original MoW, MoW Red Tide and MoW Vietnam. I talk from the perspective of a Men of War fan. Also keep in mind that this is an early access review. I cannot assess the full content of the game at the moment but it will come out very soon and is almost fully complete. Gameplay :To newcomers : Call to Arms is a strategy game with no base building focused on unit micro and positioning. Weapons are deadly and vehicles and infantry die fast. It has a dynamic and complex fog of war system which pushes reconnaissance and stealth at the heart of gameplay. It's a difficult game with a steep learning curve but very satisfying.To people who know MoW : For one the map design is excellent and the best I have ever seen in a Men of War game. Goodbye garbage maps like Workshop, Kanawa Mines, Heights, Canyon, Bog, Westland and countless others. The new maps are balanced and mostly designed around infantry combat which forces players to actualy be smart about their vehicle usage. Cover is finaly spread in a smart and balanced way instead of seemingly haphazardly as was the case in MoWAS. Every cover has a path to flank it and there are only few of those terrible open fields like there were so many in MoWAS maps. The maps are very detailed, with a lot of objects, some of them even featuring a dense urban environment or impacful terrain (hills, slopes etc). The map design alone makes this game worth it to me. There are currently 16 maps and they are all very good. To supplement this new emphasis on infantry in the map design, the infantry controls are now much smoother and much slicker. 3rd person controls replace the old direct control mod, which allows players to immerse themselves in the battlefield and gives them a new tool to deal with the now common urban warfare. Building are now more detailed with actual furniture to take cover inside. The mindless grenade spam has been toned down and positioning is now more important. While grenades can still be devastating they are rarer and it's important to use them properly. Elite marksmen were basicaly the only infantry worth calling in MoWAS2 but it's not the case anymore. The ability of basic infantry to provide good suppressing fire makes them useful again and calling elite is no longer a no brainer since they are not always worth the extra cost. The ability to heal wounded soldiers adds a layer of strategic decision to the all infantry combat as well which I greatly enjoy. Will you spend ressource on a unit with a medic and try to preserve your force or just call more canon fodder to replace the losses ? Both are viable and it's great. Shotgunners also went from a niche US unit in MoWAS2 to a usefull way to rat out dug in infantry.The new vehicle direct control and the removal of max weapon ranges makes combat vehicle a lot more skillfull and interesting. Vechicles have to be hidden and used carefully. This is impossible in most MoWAS2 maps because of their open nature and boring unimaginative terrain making armored warfare in MoWAS2 a simple race to the biggest tanks. While vehicles are more rare in CtA they are also more important and can turn into a double edged sword even faster than in MoWAS2.One of the downside is that there are only two factions in the game at the moment. However they feel and play very different. More factions will be added later, two variations of existing factions for free (if a paid user) and two more (Russia and Germany) in a purchasable DLC later on. Game modes :Assault Zone mode has been reworked to include more flags to capture, this makes the games more dynamic and tense and opens up tactical possibilities significantly. The possible strategies to control a majority of flags are now more numerous and unique. Combat mode was reworked. While you can still win by having more score than your opponent it is now also possible to win by capturing a well defended flag for each team. Ammo crates which add ressources drop over time around the map to force players to be active. Those improvements have made the mod much more interesting.In general there are more modes to the game but they are played less often, those include a 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 mode which results in crazy games !Icing on the cake, viscious bots can be added to play with in every game mod. They are very strong and very reactive and can be quite the headache to beat in the max difficulty. A great way to learn for new players or fill slots on bigger maps.I have not played the single player campaign, as usual it can be played in coop. From what I can see it actualy has constructed missions like in the first MoW instead of always generic assaults like in MoWAS2 but I cannot tell if they are good or not.Graphics & Sound : The graphics have been significantly improved. The game runs smoother, vehicles are as detailed as ever, and as I already mentioned there are way more objects on the map. The density and smart placement of said objects make the map feel like real places unlike a lot of MoWAS maps which feel alien and geometrical.Lighting, shadows, and textures in general have been improved. Explosions and shots raise dust that persists a moment like in a real battlefield. This dust actualy has a gameplay element as well by obscuring lines of sight, which is especialy crucial with the new 3rd person combat. Despite these improvements, performance have been increased all around compared to the previous games.Gun sounds are perfect, there isn't much more to say because it is really immersive and high quality. The voice acting has not changed from the past game and the arab faction is not voiced at the moment but devs said new voice acting would be added at release. Since they added everything they promised to add so far and even more I will trust them on that.The only area which is not up to par with the past game has been the music. The tracks are less enjoyable and feel more generic.Business model :A lot of negative reviews are complaining about the business model. I don't think those complains are justified. When it releases the game will be free to play. Free to play users will only have access to the two base factions, only in multiplayer, and will have to level up to unlock units. Paid edition players have access to the singleplayer, the two ""mini-factions"" and don't have to level to unlock units. New factions will be added later via DLCs, nothing wrong with that. There are also crates drops in the game. Those crates can be unlocked in singleplayer and multiplayer, they give access to cosmetic badges for your units and leveling boosts for Free to Play players. Nothing more. The devs themselves have answered those criticisms and I encourage everyone to read it :http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/127619582138185262Pros and Cons Pros :- Amazing maps.- Great sound and graphics.- Modern setting.- Improved gameplay. (over MoWAS)Cons :- The music is forgettable- Fewer units.- Only two factions at the moment.- Some maps are less destructible than the old ones.Overall the graphics are upgraded, the controls smoother, and the gameplay much improved. Going back to MoWAS2 from time to time I find it bland, unresponsive and slow. It's very difficult for me to go back to it now that I have played Call to Arms. Both because it's duller and simpler and because it feels slugish and unoptimized.			"

								I bought the game to support the devs long ago because MoW: AS was great. Call to Arms is still in Early Access, going free-to-play with microtransactions.  This might've been acceptable if the devs were up front with the community beforehand.  However, they only posted a (very condescending) ""fact check"" as a reaction to negative reviews, which makes them look even more like jerks.  Greedy and dishonest jerks actually.  I can no longer recommend that anyone buy-in to support this developer.			"

								This is a review of ONLY the single player aspect of the game.  I don't play RTS' on line, so if that feature is what you're looking for a review of, you'll have to look elsewhere.I'll make this short and sweet.  It simply isn't worth the price.  There isn't enough content in the single player game to justify anything beyond about $5.  At 9.5 hours played, I have cleared every single player mission on max difficulty.  A pathetic total of 10 missions in a single campaign, (three if you don't buy into their absurd collectors edition or whatever they're calling it), of such low quality that even the loading screen tips are torn straight out of MOW:AS, referencing panzerschreks and fausts, Sherman's and T-34's.  There are free mods for MOW:AS2 that offer better quality content without a pricetag.  I won't touch on the micro transaction absurdity in any length, or the choice to make a chunk of content free AFTER many people have paid for it, as those topics has been covered in detail by several dozen other reviews and comments, I'll just say that such things are NEVER a good idea, especially when a title is still in early access.All in all, based, again, on JUST the single player content, there are better options than this for your RTS fix.

								So far this game is good for its current state and I do recommend you get this game as it will improve over time, and with the soon introduction of vehicles in multiplayer will make it even better. The game mechanics are mostly the same with a few changes whit a new sub menu to clean up the UI but it really means that it takes longer to reach the repair key. There is also the introduction of fire modes to semi auto rifles and the introduction of flash lights on guns (annoying when you’re trying to do stealth on a dark map as you can’t turn them off). But over all you should buy this if you liked MOWAS2 and if you liked playing mods for it as well. (also the AI is still just as bad as MOWAS and a bit worse at sometime)			"

Never buying from you again.			"

Early Access Review
								!!!THEY REMOVED THE LEVEL CAP FOR UNITS - YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO RAGE ABOUT THIS!!!ALSO - Buy the 'Deluxe' edition for a few $$$'s more. This gives you an XP boost and free DLC when its released (2 new nations, probably missions and units as well).I've been playing the MoW series since 'Faces of War' - This game is just as good as any other in the series (ok, not quite MoWAS status yet; but I fully expect it to be there for full release!). AS2 was more of the same-ol-same-ol, whereas this is giving us a nice change in scenery and with enough support should end up awesome. In short, if you like MoW, or wargames in general, you will get your moneys worth. As a side note, I got this for friggin 80% OFF so for $5 I found an amazing deal...THE GOOD:- Same features as MoWAS+. ie, soldier inventory, direct control, AI opponents, etc - what make this series special!- Great setting (perhaps a little overused these days but its refreshing to see it put together so well in an RTS format)- Large variety of units - Each faction seems unique in both how they look and play- Decent GFX for a MoW game- AI is HARD, HARD, HARD. Even with ""Normal"" AI you will have an uphill battle- Super easy to setup a skirmish or small game- Fun MP- EDIT: I forgot to mention, I thoroughly enjoy the factions that are currently present. They're unique in both look & feel... US is more about specialized, experienced and expensive units wherease Opfor is all about quantity (and badass outfits)THE BAD:- Singleplayer is currently lacking; there are some campaign missions and skirmish but they still need a bit of polish before release. Early Access so no biggie.- Seems like they're already gearing up for paid DLC. I have a feeling in my stomach there may be some form of micro-transactions at some point as well (there is an unused Store button on their Main Menu. I could be completely wrong however, AND there are currently NO microtransactions yet)- A lot of stuff is reused from previous games in the series. Hell, the tips are still written from a WW2 perspecitve... Giving me tips about bazookas and panzershreks... but.. I'm in the Middle East... Animations are reused, probably sounds as well- Currently, as of Early Access, it's a slight pain to get a MP match going. This should change as more people join though- Seems like their main focus has been gameplay and whatnot so far; The menus, campaign, matchmaking, etc could all use a bit of polish. Again I expect a lot of this to be resolved once we get closer to release.(Early Access) FINAL VERDICT:7.4/10 - IF THE GAME ENDS UP AS I EXPECT IT TO AT RELEASE, and as an avid RTS fan, this will probably move up to an 8.5+ I'd fully recommend this for anyone who's enjoyed Men of War in the past. General RTS players will fully enjoy this as well.			"

								""Early Access is a fantastic opportunity for us as an indie developer."" - First lie of this game.Same as always, even more casual than ever.Men of War used to be such a sweet game, but got ruined over and over AND OVER with any expansions pack or whatever.This one is no different, Same bugs as MoW (THE ORIGINAL!!), some  new bug added. New Content is a mod at best, probably better modern mods for MoW:AS2 are available. Combat is stupid, ammo and inventory handling is more casual than ever. Building pathfinding and infantry use of it is worse than MoW (Which is really extrodinary that they managed to top that level of shitiness).Factions are unbalanced, ranges of vehicles is absurdly larger than infantry. Level unlocked vehicles (WAT WAT WAT).A.I.pathfinding  and broken physics result many times in your vehicles flying off, exploding or just stuck inside a tree.Sound is bad.Game modes are uninspiring or becoming a ♥♥♥♥♥torm really quickly.I can go like this for hours. If you want a good RTS, go back to Men of War.If you want a good modern-time RTS, just go back to World in Conflict.If you have 10$ and want to make a game developer happy with himself, buy this game and point out all the bugs and flaws. Maybe that will help.			"

								> pretty fun game. shares a bit of similarity between men of war series but also has alot of differences like a focus on individual infantry instead of vehicles with longer engagement ranges than in the men of war series and different ideas being put to the test. currently there is a lack of much content but its still very early in development so its a given that it will get more diverse over time. if you plan on playing some single player then get the deluxe edition as single player is only available to deluxe edition owners atm and I am unsure if it will ever come to standard edition owners. the multiplayer communiy is rather small like in the men of war series but there are alot of dedicated players and if the modding community is anything like it was for men of war plenty of great mods will be made for the game. all in all its a good game and in its current state I woukld rate it an 8/10 if you like smaller scale stategy games with more focus on positioning and strategy with the potential to be a 9/10 or even a 10/10 depending on how the devs decide to flesh it out during early access. Would reccomend for people who likes the developers previous games and those who like more personal real time strategy games who like a good bit of foresight to be used when playing their games.			"

								Buy game in what was essentially Pre-Alpha. Pretty sure Deluxe edition didn't even existGame only had like three units on each faction, rest unreleased. Play game throughout it's development.They decide to release DLC and Deluxe edition and microtransactions for crap before game is even finished.They decide to go F2p.They don't give those who purchased it any special stuff at all. TL:DR Bought an early access game. Game goes F2P and release pre-game release DLC. I don't get anything special for being a borderline pre-alpha purchaser of a F2P game.On other note. Good Graphics, good gameplay. Poorly marketed, released wayyyyyyy to early (it was pretty much concept art when I started playing) and then further screwed up by trying to release pre-completion DLC.			"

								10/10 - Would T-80U again.Call to Arms offers a tactically explosive thrust into Modern Combat that fans and modders of previous titles from DMS have been calling for. With an improved engine, modern battlefields, advanced weaponry, and various types of armor and infantry; nothing stands in the way. This game offers mod support that the community has made great use of in custom campaigns and missions with more on the way. Two factions are featured thus far: United States of America (USA) and the Global Revolutionary Movement (GRM) that both specialize in their own styles of play. This is one to with friends in co-op, or against online opponents. I was able to make my own custom mission and explain a bit more of the features here:GAMEPLAY:

								I bought this game in August 2015. Its now late December 2015. In the past few months all that has been added is a few token units and a zoom in feature on direct control that only works for vehicles. One of my most played games is MOW:AS2 with hundreds of hours on there. Thats a game I've enjoyed greatly, I'll demonstrate how the current version stacks up:The Good:The graphics are better.Combat is more interesting with more bullets fired, its done fairly well gun wise.The Bad:Grenades are clumsy and worse.Reloading at points is awful and casual.AT cannot reload ever. In fact the entire ammo system being dumbed down is a huge mistake.AT is also limited in scope and feels clumsy to use.Infantry are very expensive and few in number, a casualisation.You can only call in limited numbers of squad types with very few people per squad.The direct control mode is just a pain with only a few situational uses.The Ugly:NO TANKS YET WHATSOEVEROnly mods give you a half decent gameplay experience and I say half decent with a pinch of salt.The playerbase is about 5-10 people at most, good luck getting a game going ever.Its more a COIN simulator than an actual wargame. Do not expect MOW gameplay.Development has been extremely slow over the past half a year or so, the initial release was good with very, very little development since.If the issues are not fixed or development continues as this♥♥♥♥♥♥poor rate by March, I will be asking for a refund and will actively encourage others to as well.

								10/10 Call to Arms is a Real Time Modern Strategy military game that i have been waitting for in the men of war series.  For an Early Access game, it already shows a lot of promise. The game is  Pretty solid for early access.The game has Familiar controls, UI and combat for players of MoW. The game can be tricky to learn if you're new to the Mow series but once you get to playing the game more over time you will understand how to play the game. Despite some people and their opinions, I believe in this game. So far there are two Factions in the game the United States of America and the Global Revolutionary Movement that both specialize in their own styles of play. Also would like to point out the hate on the game ATM on how small the Online battles are people you have to realize that Modern battles arent fought with numbers like WW2 anymore its fought with technology and skilled small units. Over all ive played all MOW games and Im loving this game ! The SP missions for Co Op are well designed. Over all Digitalmindsoft never fails to impress me with their games and hope to see more games in the furture made by them . I would def Recommend this game to my friends and others which two of them have already pick the game up and are loving it we mostly play coop and vs bots which is soo fun ! Here proof of how much fun me and my friend have !

								You have to level up your faction to unlock new units is BS! This alone I wont reccomend this game to anyone. Why would you add such system if you have like 10 people in your lobby waiting to find a match. Game is basically dead. Sometimes you cant even join the only open lobby because of your rank being too low. Leveling is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Update: I suspected them to make it free2play... The whole leveling system sucks butt, lots of grind and all of this isnt needed with because lack of content. Adding crates to a RTS game, is disgraceful.Yet im still suprised for them turning the game into a free2play... There goes 30$ and sucks for the people who bought the delux.			"

								This game feels like a long series of small design choices that have resulted in a firm move away from the ""Men of War Assault Squad"" format that people had enjoyed for years and more twords a ""Half finished mobile game desperate for your cash"" layout. If possible, the developers should look for some kind of human morality restore point from about a year and half ago and roll everyone involved with this game back to that moral high-ish ground.Untill that time or the Pay-day like obigitory Dev post about how that the micro transactions are gone and in fact they were a wacky mistake ect. spend your cash elsewhere.

								Not sure what the fuss is about, lots of games in steam are from kickstarter and some crowd sourcing. Financial constraint is the main reasons that development is slow and unless those ppls who are complaining is paying over $100 to support the development i think it is fair that the developer is doing f2p a.k.a demo to maintain multiplayer functions. Right now its on sale to encourage ppls to adpot the game and increase the player base.I would rather buy call to arms which is slow but constantly pushing out updates(4 years) than, pay $15 for a dead game (1-2years) that the developer stop updating or just money grabbing. And moreover this is early access, many player who are not in game development industry does not know how time consuming it is to develop a games and I feel DMS is unlike EA which charged premium for their DLC.I don't think there is another game like this on steam, the closest is Arma3 and it's great game and call to arms is great as well its like a mini arma3.Sugesstions:- Right now artillery is absent in the game hopefully the developer can implement a call for artillery feature.- Need mobile AA such as pantir, m113 vulcan, avenger and manpad for anti-air battle- Flare for helicopter and aircraft- Attact UAV- UGV- Grenade lobbing from cover instead of running into near range- More vehicles e.g combat engineer recovery vehicle- Ammo cache drop- Supply drop- Base building would be very cool!

								Like a lot of people here who wrote a review, I am also a fan since the beginning of MoW. CtA is like many early access games out there that hasn't been fully finished yet where there's bound to be plenty of bugs & crashes here and there from time to time which is expected. But from what I can see so far from the several updates and patches to fix bugs, it seems like it's fully focusing on multiplayer so far and at the same time it's degrading every aspect of the general environment of the game itself. Game functions have been altered/changed without improving anything, they've been updating and adding/fixing issues but at the same time creating more problems and errors/crashes for the game, it's like when someone has a problem with their hand, they'll just cut it all off & add a prosthetic one on without finding a cure and it seems what they're kind of doing in a way.   Again, it is an early access game and many problems still needs to be solved by the help of gamers and such, but at the same time currently its not worth your 20 bucks on it unless you wanna pay to do the work for them in a sense. There's just not enough content currently in this game to be worth anyone to pay for it's price at all in my opinion,  even though I did right off the bat went for the Deluxe Edition for the SP experience, then again I only end up finding out you only get 2 Single Player missions and later only after patches and updates those missions become semi broken.    So conclusion is, if you got the extra bucks and wanna do the ""pay to work"" scheme then go ahead and get this game and help the creators find a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bugs and then report to them with minimal content to play with. But if you're not up to it, then what's left is to wait for the official release (Full Version) to come out and hopefully it'll be a lot better.			"

								Final thoughts of my first review back from, 6th of June 2016:In this state, Call to Arms is worth max 5€. Do not buy it for a full price, it would be a waste of your money. Game looks promising, but currently very average game and if you don't buy it now, you are not missing on anything. My Recommendation, buy it in 1 year from now.Now After several updates it is time for a new one:Half a year ago I was not happy at all how game looked and played. It was buggy and overpriced for what it was offering. But now the game actually is worth of it's full price, and future is bright for it.With implementation of 1st view control, the game value as a video game has jumped sky high. You can play this game as a normal/common strategy game, but at any time you can take a direct control of unit in 1st or 3rd person view mode. Unlike in MoW series were you only have control from ""bird-eye"" perspective. This new 1st/3rd perspective camera control work best with vehicles, while infantry control is still on very basics, it's not too bad,  it just needs some work on it in order to make it more ""smooth"", now point is not to make controls like in CoD or BF.I now love to play skirmish tank battle games, where mass of vehicles clash and you take control and you start destroying bunch of Abrams/T-80s. Good stuff.Now I recommed this game. It is starting to stand out from other games. Buy it and support the developers.			"

								It's an okay-ish game. Worth a good $10? Yes. Worth $25? Hell no.Basically a modernized version of Men of War; which I assume is a good thing since I've heard great things about MoW but haven't played any of the games. It feels a lot like basic Alpha rather than Early Access, but I'll detail that in a bit.Positives++ Sound. The audio in this game is great; the guns sound heavy and very realistic.+ Graphics. Game looks great if you can survive the horrid framerates.+ Units. The units are somewhat varied and their skill levels are easy to distinguish.= Vehicles. Vehicles are very detailed and have their own damage areas that have different effects on the vehicle when hit. Can't confirm that this is so much a plus for this game or just for MoW.Negatives-- Performance. Horrible framerate and response speeds. Running the game on minimum will get you around 40-55 FPS, but if you try to traverse the map too fast the game will stall and sometimes freeze.-- Text and UI. I hope you know exactly what each unit is, otherwise you're pretty much screwed. The descriptions of units and weapons are just the filename of what I assume will be the description's text document. Lets not forget that the game also recycles loading text from the MoW games in the loading screens.-- Rendering. Units will not render (become visible) unless they are pretty much in the center of your screen. You'll often see your units shooting at nothing, with only the blood textures on the ground to give any indication of what they're shooting at.-- Map. This is the real kicker; the zoom on this game is atrocious. You can zoom up very close to your units, or zoom out just enough to see 3/4 of a football field. Because of this horrible zoom matched with the horrible rendering, you'll be unaware of a lot of targets. The tanks and missile units will be capable of amazing range, so much so that they can shoot up to five times the range that you can zoom to. This needs to be fixed very quickly to ensure the player has more control over their armored units. NOTE: I can't confirm if this is an issue with this game or MoW.It's also worth noting that the game is also sold in a $35 pack that increases the rate in which you unlock units. Oh yeah, did I mention you have to unlock units?Only recommended to purchase at around $10.			"

								After seeing the video and watching some videos on youtube, I was excited about this game. I decided why not get it cause it looked great for a EA game. Turns out I was wrong...No single player, the quality of everything is poor compared to the videos I've seen (it's lagging even when I play a set up bot game), lag is everywhere from graphics to characters, the sound quality is worse then I saw in video, and although it claims 70 something people were in game, there was less then 12 people on the 'internet' with one game that I couldn't play in cause no one joins. Essentially what you see in the video here is what you get, but in a much much poorer quality. If I wanted to play something like this I'd just go play Company oh Heroes, the first game - it at least doesn't lag all the time and the quality is still much better.I don't like giving bad reviews, I believe I avoided ever doing so. But I can't help it as I feel I wasted money on this game. I was so disapointed between the videos I've seen and the few games I could actually play that I felt I had to make a review warning that quality of gameplay is nothing like in video; what you should expect is is older graphics, bad voice acting, and a super laggy everything. I honestly don't know what I wasted more of, my time or cash - guess time since I will be seeking a refund if possible (I've never tried before so im not sure if I can even get one for EA games, guess we'll see).Additionally. I forgot to mention that the last game I tried to enjoy lagged at one pan (I just tried to move over to another zone under attack) and the game frooze causing a massive crash of the game giving me a radical error message. I honestly don't know how these cool looking videos get made, but my experience with this game was the exact opposite of what I got.			"

								I think the review is broken they just make a negative review because they bought full priced/half priced and now it's F2P the F2P edition doesn't have a single player campaign mode so for me it's okay to buy (I bought when it's half priced) and when they make it F2P it's kinda make me happy, my friends can play with me without paying a cent because they really doesn't want to spend money for games, okay let me give quick review about this game:PROS:-The Graphics is good enough compared to other Strategy games-The Balance in Multiplayer is awesome (currently there's only 2 factions but there's another factions coming in the future) these two factions have their own advantage -There's a 3rd person mode and 1st person mode, yes you can control your soldier -The Developer is always bring a surprise in every big patch update-The realism system is good too, not as good as Men of War but it's pretty good-The Cover battle system is fantastic I just love how my soldiers shooting at enemy while in cover-If you have friends to play with, then you should do it, in my experience it's really awesome CONS:-The optimization is not good-The Developer are taking too long to release the update well the developer is a small team so I think I'm okay with that-at this time the price of this game is too high I recommend you to buy this game when it's on saleAt this very time I only can give this review I'll edit it when they update something or when I discover something in my eyes the majority of the negative reviews is only because their own problem, there are many differences between F2P edition and full edition they just doesn't appreciate that differences, if you still can't trust me look up for some videos of CTA gameplay in Youtube and research on your own, I hope this well help ya, have a nice day :)			"

								As a mature age gamer, i have to say this is the type of military strategy game i have been waiting for. Yes of course it has received a few negative reviews mostly related to the decision to go free to play. The game is free so give the free version a go and if you like it then why not support the games continued development and upgrade to the paid version. I paid for my copy and must say that i have certainly got my moneys worth since paying for it. Gosh i would have paid double for a game such as this. I am big on micro management of units at the tactical level but also want the ability to have a strategic view to guage the battle as a whole. This game offers both and comes highly recommended from me if you love tactical and strategic warfare. As I said earlier, give the free version a go, dont base your decision on a thumbs down or a thumbs up for that matter. It costs nothing to try and who knows you may like it enough to upgrade to a paid version. My 20 dollars i put down for my version is about 5 coffees where i live so hardly a problem. Come join us, the battlefield awaits and there are plenty of us that are more than happy to help you learn the more difficult aspects of Call to Arms. Lesson one - dont send your armour forward without infantry support or i will use your scrap to hide behind as i advance. Wonderful game devs and thanks for the hard work.			"

								What can I say? When this project was announced, I was very skeptical about modern combat, now that it's up to this point I'm glad this game turned out so well and complements the ww1 and ww2 productions made on the same engine (Gem2).Call to Arms portrays action and fast pacing combat. It has nice improvements in tech and quality... Most importantly it has Artem Gulega's tanks. This game is of excelent standard and has a bright future.			"

								Since it's on sale I'd gonna write this review. The game is good, as long as you farmed long enough to level your player level so you can use some actual decent units. You've seen my hrs, it's not I haven't played enough and complain, but to farm this far to have a actuall game? Why am I playing a MMO or what?So this NO is for those who want to have fun right after purchase. But if you are new, need to play ""some"" games against AI, which has no brain, just spamming expensive units everywhere, to learn how to play, go for it. It's your money, and who knows if it's going better later.			"

								Call to Arms is the spiritual (if not physical) successor of the Men of War franchise.Set in a modern setting, at this stage with the United States operating in the middle east against a generic Middle Eastern Force, CtA provides the same realistic and frantic setting we have come to expect of Men of War.The combat is quick, desisive and violent.You can feel the tension from the supression from larger weapons, and when your soldiers start dropping around you because you made the decision to move them from cover, you realise how badly your tactical decision has been.Limited singleplayer at this point.Multiplayer remains as good as ever with what I can only describe as 'condensed' battlefields, leading to more close quaters battle. Multiplayer responds well with the 2x2 Games I have tested. Very fluid run.Lacking some content such as further vehicles and units, but it is to be expected for this EA.If you have enjoyed any of the Men of War series...I strongly urge you to pick up this gem and support the EA, you will not be dissapointed.

								(Only have the Free to Play Version) Having played loads of MOWAS2 being able to play a modern combat versoin is something that has always been something I hoped the Devs or one of the awesome modders of the MOW community would do.It plays just like MOWAS and while still a bit basic you have access to infantry and vehicles and all the goodies that come with those, it has promise once it leaves EA and some of its DLC factions are added in.Free to Play Version is only Skirmish vs AI and some Multiplayer functionality so ignore neg reviews saying ""BAIT AND SWITCH"" or ""THEY MADE IT FREE2PLAY HURR DURR"" or my favourite ""THEY CUT CONTENT AND WE GET SH*T"". People get exactly what they payed for which is in the description that none of the neg reviewers obviously read.			"

								I love this series of games I just wish that they didn't run like complete crap. Multiplayer is almost impossible to get a game that doesn't eventually lag and I was just in a single player skirmish that slowed and eventually had to lower my settings from medium to low (on a OC GTX 970 and installed on an SSD) to finish the round with 3 ai players... makes no sense.If your a fan of the series and haven't pulled the trigger yet, don't. Until they patch a x64 bit version of the game or update the code to 2014 fps standards you'll have the same issues you've had in every other game made by these developers.  "

Early Access Review
								Note, this is a review for a still-evolving Early Access game.  I also paid a discounted price for the Deluxe addition when it was on sale, for $10.19.  I have played 133 hours since the time of writing this review.You really can't talk about Call to Arms without mentioning the 2014 game, Men of War: Assault Squad 2.  The comparison is a fair one given their similar price point (Deluxe CtA being about $5 more expensive), and that the games are quite similar in their playstyle and mechanics.  In my opinion, CtA should expand and improve on AS2 to justify the price and the further development.  Unfortunately at current state, it's simply not there yet.The big draw for me in AS2 was that it gave you the feeling of fighting a real war.  Masses of infantry charging the enemy, using realistic cover, suppression, and flanking tactics.  Rolling armour formations using highly lethal heavy weapons to smash the enemy.  And heavy artillery bombardment to disrupt enemy strongpoints.  Logistics was a concern, and while equipping every single soldier in a 10-man squad with a light machinegun was an option, that squad would soon be out of bullets.Whether by design or accident, CtA completely loses that feeling.  Instead, combat is reduced to a much smaller scale, because unlike in AS2 the player has a ""unit cap"".  This makes it difficult to get more than a handful of different units at a time.  You could, for example, get a squad of infantry, a MBT, and maybe a single resupply truck.One big problem that stems from this is that losses hit much harder.  Losing a MBT, for example, can be devastating because it was likely the only MBT you could deploy.  Whereas in AS2 losing a tank is not so painful because you probably had a few other tanks on the field.There's also no longer any heavy artillery in the game, with the only form of indirect fire being fairly weak mortars or rifle grenades.  This cuts down on the ""depth"" of a battlefield, where combat is shrunk to relatively close range.Logistics has been heavily dumbed down.  Each capture point comes with its own supplies, which means you can simply plop down your machinegun squad at the point and get lots and lots of bullets.  There is much less emphasis on logistics, instead relying on the tired random ammunition box trope.  In the same manner, inventory management has also been made less engaging, with a LMG and 1,000 rounds of ammunition taking up the same space as a sniper rifle and 45 rounds.In short, CtA leaves behind much of what AS2 created.  Again, perhaps that was the intent.  Maybe CtA was trying to model low-intensity conflict like what happens in Iraq and Afghanistan.But it isn't as fun.Now are there some things that CtA improves on?  Sure.  The new 1st person view from vehicles is a welcome change, removing many of those ""I didn't know that would block my shot"" problems in AS2.  The promised introduction of air units, like helicopters and ground attack aircraft, is something that AS2 (for the most part) didn't have.On the other hand there are many more downsides of CtA beyond gameplay.  The lack of factions, for starters.  CtA currently has two ""real"" factions and two more copy-pasted factions, which pales in comparison to the 5 unique factions of AS2.  Future factions in CtA would have to be purchased as DLCs.  CtA also lacks a significant playerbase, with less than a peak of 90, while AS2 has 2,000+ players.Maybe CtA will become a worthy successor to AS2 someday.  But because it currently much offers less at a greater cost than AS2, I cannot recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
Call to Arms is a Real Time Strategy military game. For an Early Access game, it already shows a lot of promise. I find it similar to Victory Command, which is better known as it was free for some time on Steam.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You have to control your units in order to beat other teams. You are slowly gaining point and with these points, you can buy soldiers, armoured vehicles and other units.Pros: There are already quite a few games like this one, but this one does not fail impressing me. The commands are easy to figure out, the whole setup is clear and you shouldn't find it hard to get into the game. This is really good for attracting new players (and making them stay, of course). I don't usually rank the Options menu that high in my reviews, but the quantity of things you can set is amazing. You can change values of pretty much anything when it comes to video, audio and controls. You can play singleplayer (with a little trick) and multiplayer. Surprisingly, there is always a certain amount of people playing this game, so you won't be the only guy in an empty server, as it happens to some games with that level of recognisability. The amount of tutorials is astonishing. There are more than 30 tutorials in several difficulties and about 40 tips to help you play.  I love the music in this game. There are multiple tracks, from orchestra music to choirs and they really fit the whole war scenery. The game is being regularely updated with maps, missions, bug fixes and improves. This is how an Early Access game should be developed! There is also Workshop support for more maps and missions. If you are into that, you can also use the Editor that comes with the game.Cons: The replay menu is, well, broken. After clicking it, I get a critical error in a few seconds and the game crashes. I believe, however, that this will be fixed eventually and I will correct my review when this is fixed. This has to be said: Store screenshots are not realistic. This is not how this game looks like. You have to own the Deluxe Edition to get access to singleplayer missions right now. Since this game is in Early Access, it is a bad idea to restrict access to one of the integral parts of the game. This results in less people testing it and might lead to buggier final product. The singleplayer campaign will be unlocked for normal buyers, too, when the game is out of EA.The final verdict:This is not a full product yet, but it is already filled with contend and fun. There is also workshop support for even more missions. The gameplay is filled with possibilities and it is very easy to learn. Despite having some bugs in Early Access, I definitely recommend this game for RTS fans.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								Please note: I paid for Call to Arms.If you are reading reviews about people being mad that they paid for the game and then it goes F2P, look, the developers made a decision to help save the future of the game. The game wasn't getting any- at all attention before this. Hardly any players whatsoever (Still though). Going F2P helped Call to Arms wayy more than it hurt it. People will always be salty about paying money to SUPPORT the game. After all, Early Access games ARE NOT COMPLETE, AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. So how the hell can you be mad that it went F2P when you have that knowlage?Call to Arms is a solid RTS game that is incredibly similar to Men of War. If you have played MOW you will feel RIGHT at home, in a more modern setting. Call to Arms is the only game I can think of that has RTS elements and First Person/3rd person elements too.(Kinda ends up feeling like an RTS arma at times)Call to Arms also has a non-aggressive micro transation system that pretty much does nothing. Theres no point to purchase anything. UNLESS YOU WANNA SUPPORT THE GAME.Well, I reccomend overall.Solid 7/10 from me.			"

								       Ok, first experience playing this game....of course as with any Men of War game first thing i do is download singleplayer missions...only to find out later that the free version doesn't have it. It should be the other way around, pay for multy, and make singleplayer free. So anyway i got in to a multiplayer match after getting kicked around by either russians or people who make lobbies for their friends but don't put a password, fuc*ing idiots!         After some time i finally get in to a match, only to realize its a lag fest, and if someone has a slow computer your match is F*CKED. No matter how strong the computer is , your units will slow down to a crawl and make it incredibly difficult and anti climactic to do anything. I really really really wished for this game to be something more, but in the end its crap, like most early acces games of this era.         I give thumbs down for some other reasons as well, but if i was to explain everything thats wrong i would sit here for a long time, writing this review is probably taking enough time as it is. TLDR : Spend your money and time somewhere else .			"

								Call to Arms is a real-time strategy from Digitalmindsoft, the developer from Men of War series with the latest being Men of War: Assault Squad 2.Generally, Call to Arms right is still in early access. I bought it as deluxe edition on sale. I would say this game is great with a lot of potential. Though it has undergo many changes that I would say kinda controversial, like the game has become free to play. Though the free to play version is different from the pay to play version, like the free to play is limited only to multiplayer, no editor, no missions and units need to unlocked by progressing.Gameplay wise, Call to Arms has the similar if not the same mechanic as Men of War: Assault Squad 2 but with lots of experimental improvements, like ammo are no longer carried separately in the soldiers inventory. Each handheld weapons now already include reserve ammo that can be resupplied. One of the most notable changes is the direct control system that slowly turning into third-person control, including the infantry control with the latest update. Flashbang grenade also present here but I've yet to see how it works. The rest is pretty similar to Men of War: Assault Squad 2 in modern warfare settings.Graphics wise, Call to Arms is very good. Many textures has been upgraded with 2K to 4K resolutions to make them looks sharper and better on bigger screen. Many special effects like explosion and fire has been upgraded since Men of War: Assault Squad 2, they look far better. Sounds also has been redesigned that now it feels better, but the implementation is not complete I think, for the short range or long range sound, ambient fire sound, stuff like that. Performance... it's good, just can use slightly improvements like the game likes to automatically downgrade the graphics at game start because of laggy and stuttering start after loading, even though the game runs good for the rest of the match.Call to Arms also has introduced the use of inventory system and Steam market items. So far items that included in this microtransaction are cosmetic things like emblem or logo for profile, and some xp boost item. These items can be traded or sold on Steam.Overall, Call to Arms has really great potential. Digitalmindsoft needs to focus on finishing the game instead of announcing more things that confuse people. Your last news update won't be necessary if you just follow your own roadmap. But I do recommend this.Rating 7/10			"

My only issue is how long it takes to load into a game against AI. I tried online, me and 1 other guy got in but then the game crashed on us both. Tried to stay just playing AI but the long load times just kicked me off this game.

								I really love the idea and concept but it plays so poorly. The A.I. always plays incredibly weird and every skirmish seems to go the same, combine this with only having two factions and the game becomes boring quickly. The single player campaign also plays rather boring in my opinion with generic missions and very plain gameplay that barely feels like a campaign.On the otherhand multiplayer seems quite boring as well. The game has balance issues and very hard and unforgiving gameplay making it often feel more like a game of luck. It's also quite hard to find opponents currently.The game does still get updated and worked on but it isn't very noticable, the content still feels the same as many months ago. The only thing I truly noticed was a couple new maps, but they get boring rather quick. Hopefully when the game releases next month a lot of new things will be added.All in all I wouldn't recommend this game right now, it feels too flashy and repetitive and you'll probably get bored after a few hours to then only play it once every month or so for an hour or two before it gets boring again. I really hope that the full release will make everything better but I am scared it will just increase the time before it gets boring by a few hours. Especially for this price it isn't worth it with what you get back in return.			"

								For some reason, I know that many people hate this game, I understand that. But I don't see anything major that could greatly make the game poor... except the Third Person Feature. But in my opinion, I think the Third Person is a great feature, I honestly think so, and if you're going to argue that it sucks. Go Ahead, least you can do it list the problems of this game.			"

								It is a ""meh"" game. Basically a MoW:AS reskin (As stated in a other review)I know the time I have in this game is little, and I am really picky with my games.  If I regret buying this as much as I do now, you might too. But hey that's my opinion.It seemed really exciting before I played it and was really hoping it'd be a awesome modern version of Assault Squad that would be a great challange. Not as great as I expected sadly. No I didn't set my hopes high. Honestly I would just ask you to stay away from this until... well... when it gets ""better""  "

								Easy way to wrap this up is it's just like MoW, except its a bit prettier, more stable, and it's modern warfare rather than ww2. So that means it's not very good takes the same old clunky interface, the same ol' dead brained a.i, and in addition you got the painful attempts of trying to take ground in any match hoping to god your ai are smart enough to stop and shoot back. Thing is you could work around this in MoW due to the unit types and weapon reliability giving you time to react and also alot of light vehicles to cover your troops. You don't have that here, here you have a garbage overpriced trucks and humvs and hordes of infantry to attempt to bury your opponent in. So you get this frustrating task of microing them to be of any use till you can take enough ground to win the game and camp like a pro. So the what we got here is an extremely outdatted game engine that just needs to die because of it's obnoxious incapability of providing the user with a reliable interface to make the game reliably competitively fun.

								I was very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off (for me and everyone who bought) because the game turned into f2p.But I have to admit the developers are working very hard in this game.Every mounth they send some new rework model, or announce updates about the factions that are coming.Nevermind the amount of the users dislinking the game. If you do like RTS, you should try it.PROS: everything that MoW used to offer - something near to reallistic battles experience+ the ability to control a single soldier/vehicle in 3rd / 1st personCONS: 1. they also imported MoW engine problems1.1 the most annoying is the multiplayer lag. Basically if someone in the match has a crap pc, everyone will lag with him. I never understood why they never fixed it, imho this can completely ruin your experience.1.2 you cannot reconnect in battle. A balanced match in this game can easily go up to an hour. If your game crash, if your internet goes down, you will be very upset.			"

								-Beta? Early dev build at maximum.-Gaming enviroment? A multiplayer lobby from the 90’s. No matchmaking at all. Most people do not even know they have to press the ready button. The host is your master, he owns you. If he is afk is your problem if he doesn’t like you, a bigger problem.-Population? Very few games, most of them are terribly unbalanced or with crazy settings.-Connection quality? Broken netcode without dedicated servers, game is a repetition of performance drop from player x….game freezes for 10 secs...-Fun?: none of my games ended in a normal way. Always a player crashing or leaving before the end.-Gameplay? it is essentially men of war assault zones extreme of AS2 (which nobody was playing …). 50 CP (you can afford a squad and a vehicle) and ridiculous tiny maps full of crates which make vehicle undrivable.-Direct control? Granade launch is broken: it sets you in a visual that you can only see s**t. The granade parabola is something ...omg. The new direct control is nickenamed “blind firing mode”-Portfolio? Lack of variety in the unit roster. Two factions only, and units do not offer specific abilities and game variety-Is this just a mod of assault squad? Maybe Yes but mods like red rising or cold war actually did WAYbetter than this. To me this seems a dumbed down assault squad.-F2p model? not a real f2p in the traditional World of Tanks sense. Free version is just multiplayer demo.-Tutorial? Could not find one.-Future? Still in early access but this is IMO not even anymore in development. Devs promise a miracle patch every month, but so far we only got a steam market.-Steam market? Can’t wait to spend 1000hours on this to trade 10 cents items. "

This could've been an amazing successor to Men of War: AS II, alas it's going to the money-grabbing side of gaming. smh			"

								I'm a fan of the MOW series and to be fair I was a bit worried that this game would fail in the same way Vietnam failed due to sloppy licensing to not so serious game studios.  Beware though that Call to arms is developed by the same studio that brought us some of the best games in the franchise (MOW Assault squad 1+2) which raises my expectations on this release. Been playing a few hours on the open beta now and just purchased the deluxe edition.The visuals, the gameplay, the sounds, everything is improved. Strongly recommended for everyone who enjoyed any of the previous MOW games and for any who likes tactical gameplay.			"

There is however lots of options for strategy.There is also a SP campaign for those less interested in MP. You need the Deluxe Edition to sample those missions now.On release Call to Arms will have 2 factions with an array of infantry and vehicles for each. New units are slowly still being added but I would expect more content post release as patches and DLC.Very fun and lots of scope in the future.			"

								I was very happy when I played Call to Arms for the first time I had my hopes up and the updates kept making me happy till they reached a point when they started removing a really unique and beloved direct control. I first thought they would have it coexist together till they completly removed it for vehicles. I don't even think they had asked the opinions of the community first that were actually supporting them with money but they didn't get the thing they wanted for their money and some people can't even get  a refund which is really sad. I came to a conclussion that I wont be telling my friends to buy Call to Arms and I will not be saying it is a great game till they have put in our beloved Direct ControlMy Opinion now: I think the game has made some good changes lately it is going to add more entities and it is adding some cool features. MP is starting too look fun too because a lot of people are buying CtA. Like Instinct said the Direct Control has changed that is not something I like but it doesn't ruin a good game like this.			"

								Solid Early Access release, very well optimized, runs and looks better than AS2 even on my toaster. What's in the first Early Access version as of 3rd of August 2015?-Multiplayer only for Standard Edition, limited to infantry combat at the moment, with vehicles being introduced in two weeks (you can check out the vehicles in the editor, but they are not balanced for online play yet). EDIT: A bunch of vehicles are now available in MP: humvees, armed pickups, strikers and btr-80s. Also they are not planning air vehicles for MP only for SP (this might change).-Deluxe Edition unlocks Single Player and the three SP missions available right now, with more missions being released during Early Access. Single Player will be available for everyone at the release.-If you don't want to play against other people, you can host games and play with bots, you will still gain XP. -You can create your own maps/mission with the GEM editor, identical with the one in previous DMS titles. The game has workshop support, a few custom maps and missions are already available to play.-Plenty of placeholders and missing features, everything you see is subject to change and it will be improved or replaced. You can check the Roadmap topic to read about the development schedule. Other factions may be added depending on the games success.Buy this game now only if you want to help the DMS make a better game. If you hate playing an incomplete game with bugs and what not, just wait for the official release (Q1 2016).IMPORTANT!CtA will feature a 3rd person view for vehicle direct control instead of the birds eye view perspective from the previous games. This feature was announced from the beginning (2013) and the devs are determined to make this change for CtA. They said they will release on official mod for the old direct control but it will not be in the game by default.			"

								I see that all of the top reviews are negative, and all primarily complaining about a single thing, Direct Control. I'll repost a few things I discussed in Rokko's review's discussion section, the review that is currently at the top.The old DC is still available! You have to click the button on the HUD, rather than press the Hotkey. In the bottom left corner there are four small boxes, stacked vertically: a skull and crossbones, a wooden crate, a blue/red man portrait, and an upward arrow type symbol (that is the top box). That last symbol is the direct control button. Just so everyone who hasn't played CtA yet is clear, the new direct control is the old one, but from a lower, fixed camera angle. That's about it. The idea is to make it harder to see enemies from across the map and hit them though multiple buildings when you wouldn't be able to see it in real life. It also gives the direct control a more action type feel. This is in keeping with the direction that CtA is moving as a whole with closer range infantry combat as the focus. There will be more additions to the new DC like a gun camera zoom mode, and no range limitations in DC to make up for the limited view. It will allow tank combat from a more realistic perspective, rather than the omnipotent, gods eye, hit everything from the old DC that was totally OP for people who were good at it. Keeping the old DC in would drive away new players for whom it is an awkward and somewhat ill-conceived system that gives too much of an advantage to veterans. In 4v4's I can cruise around the back half of the map with a GRM tier 2 AP technical and easily get a dozen Humvee kills with that one vehicle because I know how to use the old DC and the newer players don't. It is a game-breaking exploit that will drive away new players in frustration. Here's a thread where the developer covers their reasons for the change:http://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/0/537405286661241101/Their new style of DC is in development, whereas the old style is polished after many years. You can't know what the new DC will really be like on release, and it isn't fair to compare the alpha version of the new DC to the polished version of the old DC. It's not about liking the new DC as it is now, but appreciating that this is a new feature that will take time to get right, and that once they get it right they will phase out the old DC (a nice compromise I think).I can say the same for other missing features. As the road map on the CtA sticky covers, things like more vehicles, the inventory, menu, UI, HUD, more game modes, full single player campaigns, more multiplayer maps, voiceovers, animations, etc...are all in the process of being developed and changed. It's absurd to complain about missing features in an early access Alpha release where they straight up tell you that those features are not in yet, and even go so far as to give you a timeline for when they will be in:http://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/0/530646080847272442/On the whole, Call to Arms is an immense improvement on the Men of War formula. It focuses on intense infantry engagements, and emphasizes cover, flanking and actual tactics much more than previous MoW titles. The maps are tighter, more urban, and with much more thoughtful placement of abundant cover and positions to flank from. The graphics are better, and the overall feel is more visceral and engaging. I've enjoyed playing the multiplayer this past week more than perhaps any time playing MoWAS2. I just played a few rounds of assault squad for comparisons sake and was shocked at how lackluster it seemed. CtA is in early access Alpha and I'd already rather play it than assault squad.I'm writing this review because I know how important the top reviews are for a game to succeed, and how commonly people can be turned off of buying a game because of one internet troll's loud, ignorant complaining about something they don't understand and isn't yet fully implemented. I like the direction they are going, and I am excited for the eventual full release, and I would hate to see all that potential dashed to pieces because of low sales due to a few misconceived, negative reviews of the alpha version.

								In its current state, this game is simply not worth the 20 USD it's up for, there is only multiplayer as of yet, and as far as I have seen, the limits for each side consist of three spawnable squads, and six smaller fire teams, and one mortar unit, no vehicles, no special units, no heavy artillery. The game shows a lot of promise both from how it plays and the screenshots displayed on the page, so I do sincerely hope it develops to the point where it is a modern version of MOW, but as of right now, I do not recommend purchasing the game for the full $20.

								Pretty good game for early access ! Pros- Runs very smooth in RTS mode- AI is really good, can be a little to smart sometimes haha- Nice maps, good vis/graphics- Sounds are well done- 1st and 3rd person mode while controling 1 unit in an RTS game. AWESOME IDEA !!Cons- Laggy if to much is going on ( explosions, debris flying , lots of people shooting ) - Sometimes you cant see the enemy while playing, unless you look right at them- Explosions should be able to put holes or take down walls- Tank rounds are not strong enough. example. 1 tank round should destroy a normal truck with a gun mount on it- Few other things, nothing game breaking tho.All in all. For an early Acc game, this is very well done. I cant wait to see what gets fixed in future updates. And what other addins will be coming.  Id give this Early Acc game a 6/10. The whole not being able to see enemys sometimes is the biggest issue I had.			"

								Edit: Since this review, they have removed removed the level lock, one of my reasons for giving this game a bad review, though there is some other things they could change. Though its a step in the right direction!This game needs work. The experience i've had with it are buggy, it crashes on start up 60% of the time, and it feels like im playing a pre alpha when it's expected to leave Early Access in Q3 2016. Theres problems in the game itself in which I see it as a way to keep players playing the game by making you earn XP to use troops in each faction. Which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as theres the moment when you play with a higher level player and you get stomped when he pulls out a tank that you haven't even unlocked yet. This is completely unfair for those who start out, and the majority of the community from i've seen has been against it. Unless theres a way to disable it which I haven't seen. Theres also the 15 dollar incentive to get a slight ""XP boost"" to unlock the troops faster from the so called 'Deluxe Edition' with these GREAT features:>Receive an unique player profile badge >Receive an unique deluxe editon achievement >Receive a special icon for your player avatar visible to everyone during a match >Receive an outstanding HUD element visible while playing and recording matches >Receive a slight XP boost for all factions in multiplayer to unlock units faster >Receive access to Deluxe Edition emoticons for the global chatWhat a joke.

								My reaction to this game is relatively mixed. It is great to see a detailed RTS set on the modern stage, but it has so far left out some elements in MOW: AS1 and MOW: AS2. Most notably allowing me to build units during the skirmishes to meet my playstyle. While so far I'm not yet finished with all skirmish missions, and am only on the mission in which you command a tank, there has not yet been a scenario in which I can order my own units. Now that what I disliked is out of the way, I greatly appreciate the 3rd person effects for controling tanks, and personally hope to see it extend to infantry too. It makes it, in my opinion, far more emersive in combat, and would work far better with enhanced A.I. for your soldiers and theirs. Pros:Great GraphicsDetailed Modern Era RTSTraditional 3rd Person control feature for VehiclesFun storylineCons:Not yet complete, but not worriedNo unit purchasing, all units are given.No infantry traditional 3rd person setting "

As its own game i rate it a 6/10 if it were just a simple game not a sequal to a francise.			"

Call to Arms is another RTS masterpiece made by DigitalMindSoft. I am not one to moan about losing money out of this or that or moan about the game engine or moan about the graphics blah blah blah.  All of that doesn't interest me. The only thing that interests me is having the option to build my maps on a level where they are based around the idea of modern warfare and how the Gem Editor gives me that option using its tools & entities provided for making those such maps and Call to Arms specifically gives me that option. For that I thank you wholeheartedy.When Call to Arms was nearing its very first release I remember the frustrating times of trying to find some actual tutorials on youtube of using the Gem Editor. That's all I was interested in and only that and nothing else. Now of course youtube is crammed full of tutorials of making maps and I have since been enjoying watching them.Call to Arms now has reached a beautiful point where the first person mode is an absolute dream to use. From using the vehicles to the troops. Nicely done in my book. The game really has come a long way and for the most part DigitalMindSoft have stuck to their guns and dedicated themselves to building yet another quality game and still it builds gloriously through sheer determination, hard work and more importantly to listening to the Steam Community and taking into consideration their idea's and thoughts. You only have to read the Pinned Topics in the discussions based on Suggestions & Balance & the Wishlist to. That in itself should show you instantly how dedicated DigitalMindSoft are at producing a particular degree of excellence. Those topics can be viewed here http://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/Someone could turn around and ask me why don't I mention some negatives of the game. Well really I will leave that to others who want to moan about the graphics engine or the loss of money or that they want a refund or why dont  DigitalMindSoft do this or that. Whatever!! As I said up there in my first paragraph all I am interested in is how the Gem Editor gives me the option to build maps based around the idea of a modern warfare level. If you are someone who enjoys RTS games with the option to build maps on a military level using a Level Editor then I would recommend yourself to give Call to Arms a shot. So what if you don't like it and you feel you want a refund. Big deal for petes sakes. Think of all the money that you have wasted on going to the store and buying food that ends up in the bin. Money for cigarettes that is bad for you. Alcohol that is bad for you. Fatty foods that is bad for you. The list goes on n on. Buying Call to Arms is a one time thing only. End of!! How much are you going to lose if you don't like the game. Not as much as the amount of crap you have bought and has ended up in the bin I know that much.Oh! and one last thing if you are considering on buy Call to Arms then before you buy just take a wander round the Steam Community Workshop here http://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/workshop/ That should show you how worthwhile this game really is. Even the option of installing a modification is so easy peasy. Gone are the days of faffing around of where to put the files ect ect. Just hit the subscription button and you are good to go, but yes check out all the goodies on there that are kindly donated by the community itself. Good stuff m8.Call to Arms like the angel on my shoulder Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a real blast to play, especially using the Gem Editor. And the first person mode WOW!!...It just gets better and better.			"

								A modern standalone version of Men Of War. It does indeed sound awesome and the gameplay is also pretty interesting. However, this game is still in alpha/beta-version and it has been like that since 2015. There are new updates every now and then but the main problem is still around, even after a year. Now, I am pretty damn sure that my rig is way above the required specs, but I have yet managed to play a full session without crashing, and this happens regurlarly. I open the game, edit my settings/vid options, insta-crash. Tried doing it again, but then bam! Another crash...I open the game in safe mode, then I find out that my vid settings did actually get saved for whatever reason. I then proceed to a skirmish match, plays for like 20-30 minutes then crash.I open the game in editor mode, access violation error crashes after a bit.Almost reaching 2 hours, I immediately refunded the game.TLDR; The concept is nice, but the game is horribly broken.MoWAS is way better than this.

Also the ablity to call up amor support along with being able to proved better security in and around your base area.   I think if they do keep developing this right this game going to exceed the Assault 1 and Assault 2.   I have over 300 hrs on the assault 2 which in my veiw is a excellent military Rpg game. Looking forward to seeing the completed verison of call to arms.  Thanks guys for the great games.    For me medically I can play the call of duy type games because it mas me get dizzy and sick from the motion move ments so I Love the Assault 2 and Call to arms type games they great please keep them coming.

								I've been holding off reviewing this game thinking the devs would do things better but I see this beta, already asking for money on things that were promised already.The core of the game was removed very early on which killed it for me and many other players with the top down direct control from men of war series. It would not have been bad if they were posting ""We plan to remove this feature within a month"" but they said nothing and so I played this game happily up until the very second they removed DC. Then the game was broken, and not worth playing. and by then I was unable to get a refund from steam. So this was their first cash grab, get the old players to pay for a game they think they are getting but are not.When countless players sprung up in the discussions asking for direct control to be added back they were all banned from the forums. and the excuses they wrote were some of the most pathetic things you could think of. the one ban I got was for inciting negativity towards their game and using other games as comparisons. LITERALLY the point of discussion boards. You take one thing and compare it to another so you can figure out which is better or what needs to be changed.They would  go into posts my brother or I had made and trimmed out any over negative posts in a 20+ page post and not say a single thing. Which happened more than once. The devs have never once been nice or helpful, its always been hostility. If you get in their way they run you over(banned). Its their game sure but they've lied since the beginning and thats a big damn redflag that I advise everyone reading this to avoid.Once you see a game with microtransactions you know the game has lost all ability to hold itself up unless the game is literally built around the concept.

Early Access Review
								I've been holding off reviewing this game thinking the devs would do things better but I see this beta, already asking for money on things that were promised already.The core of the game was removed very early on which killed it for me and many other players with the top down direct control from men of war series. It would not have been bad if they were posting ""We plan to remove this feature within a month"" but they said nothing and so I played this game happily up until the very second they removed DC. Then the game was broken, and not worth playing. and by then I was unable to get a refund from steam. So this was their first cash grab, get the old players to pay for a game they think they are getting but are not.When countless players sprung up in the discussions asking for direct control to be added back they were all banned from the forums. and the excuses they wrote were some of the most pathetic things you could think of. the one ban I got was for inciting negativity towards their game and using other games as comparisons. LITERALLY the point of discussion boards. You take one thing and compare it to another so you can figure out which is better or what needs to be changed.They would  go into posts my brother or I had made and trimmed out any over negative posts in a 20+ page post and not say a single thing. Which happened more than once. The devs have never once been nice or helpful, its always been hostility. If you get in their way they run you over(banned). Its their game sure but they've lied since the beginning and thats a big damn redflag that I advise everyone reading this to avoid.Once you see a game with microtransactions you know the game has lost all ability to hold itself up unless the game is literally built around the concept. To be honest I could keep writing, but I hope this is enough to help anyone trying to make a decision because truly I cannot put anymore of myself into this game or these devs, I campaigned for so long trying to get them to fix this game right as they broke it and now look where its at?

								I wouldn't buy it in it's current state, no. It is a re-skin with a few changes for the worse. The DC camera is terrible, I really can't understand why they would screw it up so bad.I understand it's alpha but the way things are being released is moronic. The maps are locked to certain numbers of players so there is no variety. Balance is crap because they release things that can't be countered by the other faction. These things are driving players away so it's very hard to find games atm.All of this is not as bad as the dev's attitude. They don't listen to players and respond to requests by telling players to ""make a mod for it"". All advice or criticism is discarded in a spam riddled containment thread or locked.Stay far away for now.EDIT: This is the kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm talking about with the devshttp://imgur.com/7lt9FMU "

								Freely mixing players who have locked units with players who have unlocked units in games is bound to result in a skewed, long-term MP experience for everyone. It doesn't matter if I pay for the game or grind the progression system in free-to-play, I will still end up playing with or againt people with locked units, which is game-breaking for me.The whole paying community and DMS must have had  good reasons to remove the unit lock a few months ago. Now they are back to square one. :) "

								у меня 600 часов игрыя люблю эту игрулюблю своей непредсказуемостью + офигенно удобным прямым управлением юнитамидо этого тут отрицательный отзыв, но я не вижу смысла в негативе, я советую покупать ультра версию которая включает все фракции - это поддержка разработчиков- ведь разработка очень долгий процессДля меня игра в данный момент это как хороший фильм, ты его осмысливаешь, думаешь о нем.  Я играю с друзьями, на которых я могу положиться, это значит меня прикроют, прикроют мою спину, а я прикрою их.Да игра не идеальна, но разработчики пытаются сделать её идеальной, да патчи выходят редко, но по мне лучше стабильно работающий и без ошибочный патч, чем мусор каждый день.У меня нет лагов я играю на ультре в 3к разрешении.Чтоб у вас не было лагов надо папку steam  ставить вместе с Windows  на ssd диск это скорость и возможность быстрой загрузки.Также игра любит многопоточность и много битность шины видеокарты.У меня стабильные 4 палки без проседаний. Сейчас ребята используют Directx 11, но скоро на смену ему придет  12, поэтому стоит покупать видеокарты с поддержкой 12-го.Я проиграл в Mowas1  и Mowas2 больше 6к часов, но минус штурма управление, у Призыва к оружию  в начале оно сбивает с ног, а потом ты не можешь без него.Удобно, практично, отлично. РЕСПЕКТ АВТОРАМ ИГРЫI have 600 hours of a gameI love this gameI love the unpredictability + cool convenient direct control of unitsbefore there is the negative response, but I don't see a sense in a negative, I advise to buy the ultra version which includes all fractions it is support of developers - development very long processFor me a game at present it as the good movie, you comprehend it, think of it. I play with friends on whom I can rely, it means me will cover, will cover my back, and I will cover them.Yes a game isn't ideal, but developers try to make it ideal and patches quit seldom, but on me it is better stablly operating and without erratic patch, than a garbage every day.I have no logs I play on an ultra in 3k permission.That at you not logs it was necessary to put the steam folder together with Windows on ssd a disk it is the speed and a possibility of bystry loading.Also a game loves a multithreading and many bitnost of the bus of the video card.I have stable 4 sticks without flashes. Now children use Directx 11, but will succeed it soon 12 therefore it is worth buying video cards with support of the 12th.I lost in Mowas1 and Mowas2 more 6k hours, but minus storm control, at the Appeal to weapon at the beginning it forces down from legs, and then you can't without it.Conveniently, it is practical, excellent.

""Call to Arms"" is a good game.Try out the Free ""Demo"" if you are still in doubt, as it is not as Limited as you may think... and you could easily enjoy the free version by itself until the Official Launch.

They both work very well together.I would definitely recommend picking this up also, if you haven't picked up Men Of War Assault Squad 2, I would also recommend picking that up.			"

Early Access Review
								I give this game a recommendationFirst, I was very skeptical of this purchase. Digitalmindsoft has been known for releasing strategy games that had no to  little changes from its predecessors. One example is MoWAS 2 which was basically a upgraded graphically version of MoWAS 1 and a few new vehicles. They could have released it as a expansion but...anyways.After seeing good reviews of the game and a few bad, I decided to purchase the game.And I really liked it.CONTENTS AND MECHANICSAlthough it has the same basic mechanics of every Men of War game, the game feels complete to me mechanically wise.Any veteran MoW player can jump right in the game and can already learn the controls without having to go over a tutorial or manual again. The controls are really responsive. One thing I did not like are damage mechanics though. Infantry and machine guns kill too fast, soldiers barely recieve 5 hits from a SA when they die. Content is a strong suit of this game. Each model is accurately rendered and displayed. You literally can see the grooves of the M4A1 barrel. The content is still lacking though. There are only a few weapons and vehicles both air and land as of now although that is understandable since the game is still in Early Access.SINGLEPLAYER AND MULTIPLAYERI can't speak for the SP right now because I don't have access to it yet as I am not a deluxe user.MP in this game is balanced. Basically you have two factions, one consists of highly trained soldiers(US) while the other is a terrorist group that has a few elite units but really are just people who were given a gun and sent to war without going to the firing range(GRM). The US,although has really good units, comes at an expense of costs and fewer soldiers per unit. This is compensated by their skill in medium to long range combat and has good close combat units too.GRM on the other hand, although their soldiers are poorly equipped, has an advantage in costs and number of men per unit. They also excel in close combat where the few US soldiers could be decimated quickly. Their advance unit also has more advanced weapons and are more versatile.GRAPHICSGraphics are almost the same as MoWAS2 except maybe for that gritty look. Textures are of course in high definition and very well implemented.Mortar and grenade craters look very realistic. Weapon textures are also something worth looking at. Environmental props are also improved and really provide that sense of modernity. The number of objects on screen is also much more many than previous titles.Well, that's it for my review. I'll keep it updated as the game also updates.EDIT:Vehicles have been released in MPAlthough vehicle in MP is still limited(only a few light vehicles for now), they are really a game change. They have really good anti-infrantry statistics and can actually be a replacement for a squad or two. They might seem overpowered however they have an exposed gunner so a single sniper can take out a vehicle. They also perform poorly in close range as they have little time to react and move their turrets slowly.			"

Early Access Review
								Why I decided to give this game a thumbs down:I, like many others, only play single-player.Ironically though, if I wanted to play multi-player, I could now download the f2p version. But I don't want to play multi-player, so I have to pay. And if I pay, I expect to get a product that is at least worthy of the great MOW lineage.Yet what do I get for my money?  A very shoddy, unimaginative and boring sp experience. I’m half way through the campaign ... and I’m bored. There’s no serious tactical challenge, and not a single ‘memorable moment’.As CtA is still early access, I'm not going to go into the game mechanics except to say that they need a LOT of work.So, what, exactly do you get for your 40 Euro (when not on sale)?Multi-player = well, you can now download that for free, so I’m only going to focus on what you have to pay for. That leaves us with:Skirmish = fun for a while, but quickly gets repetitive, and definitely NOT worth 40 Euro.Campaign = absolute simplistic drivel on the level of CoD or Battlefield. E.g. the Blackhawk Down mission ... really!?! Is that the best you can come up with?Now, a new, or younger player, coming from one of the above cited games may be happy with the rather childish ‘campaign’, and perhaps that's what the devs are after. But for an experienced tactical player it's extremely unsatisfactory to say the least.Hence, the F2P dilemma: Multi-player = freeVery dull and unimaginative single-player = paidI can perfectly understand why a lot of people are unhappy about the situation, and would be compelled to express their feelings in a negative review. But here's what gave me the final push to write my own review: the patronising and arrogant diatribe posted by developer Instinct entitled Fact Check in which he dismisses anyone who writes a negative review about Call To Arms as a “hater” and admits absolutely no responsibility for the discontent expressed by a lot of the people who bought this game.Well done Instinct, you’ve earned yourself another negative review, the first that I have ever given on Steam!Now, prove to me that you can do better and I might change my mind.

								I recommend this game if you liked Men of War, or if you're looking for a tactical strategy game.It strikes the right balance between scale and function like the men of war series and also introduces some new things.Read futher for a very long extensive review.----As of right now, during early access, some pros over the older men of war engine the new one has.Better GraphicsBetter Syncing snapshots (I have not had a single desync at all)More Stable engine (I have not had a single crash at all, despite being alpha build)Less micro, the squads are smaller, offering the same type of gameplay, but doesn't require you to flood the map with infantry.Better string reference system (nice for modders)Some Cons:I don't like most of the map designs, this may be a personal preference, but i think the new maps have too much cover, and it looks silly that cities are flooded with single sandbags.I don't know what the final unit roster is, but currently it seems a bit lack luster, hopefully this will change. 1. The Balance  The Balance, is pretty decent, currently favouring USA, but tanks aren't implimented so this may change or even out. I'd still say I am not a big fan of the basic model, as it is right now.You have 2 factions GRM and USA, the GRM is nearly identical to the USA with the exception that everything they have is worse but cheaper, and they get 1 extra guy per infantry squad, though not support squads.This is boring to me, as all it means is that as GRM you lose more guys but generally play the same just slightly less effective, so far GRM does not have a single unit that is better than the US counterpart, you just get more. And I could give a lot of examples of this, but there is no need, because this is litterally all the thought there is put into it. Bear in mind, i am not saying it's unbalanced. i am just saying their balance model is boring, and not at all like in Men of War. 2. Realism  Right now there are many flaws in the physics and behavior of a lot of equipment, SPG-9 works like an RPG dispite being a recoiless rifle, and the speed of projectiles is dubious, I understand this isn't high on the list of things to get done. Luckily this is mostly quite easily changeable with mods, and when there is time to fix this it probably will. 3. Unlock System  Unlocks in mow2 were annoying, but they were kinda fast, and you could turn them off in custom games.In CtA you can't turn off unlocks, they are always on. The game punishes you for being good, since you get basically no XP for winning, but lots of xp for killing and losing units. Which means that long drawn out games that are basically a tie, will give you more XP than skillfully defeating the enemy by capturing and holding points.I really hope this will change, atleast so that unlocks are sensible, though i'd prefer them being removed though i understand some people like this sort of thing. 4. New Direct Control View  Is honestly not a problem, a lot of reviews seem to think it is, I am as much of a men of war veteran as the rest of them, but while i at first didn't like the system very much, i think it has a lot of potential.Firstly it looks cool, being down to earth. Secondly after the update to it, it is much easier to navigate with it, and i'd go as far as to say that it's more useful for urban fighting than the old direct control is, because with the new system you can actually see through allys.

								The game need a lot of work I'll say wait until is done before you buy because they may add more DLC on top of the season pass. Don't be a fool like me buying the Deluxe Edition to later be free to play an then a Ultimate Edition to purchase despite the game being a Early Access Game.Play it for free for now but I have a bad feeling about this game because of the in game market that can later end up as a pay to win but maybe in time I can be wrong. so if you buy the game now and later you're unhappy when the game it done.Don't say I didn't told you so.

								Very intresting game here good ol men of war style but instead of WWII it is the modern U.S. vs. GRM. Intresting things in this game include the ""flashbang"" that for some reason is named the ""anti-tank grenade"" why is this probably lazy devs, and some odd path finding which is something everyone can deal with and I recomending this game to anyone who likes stratigy minus the fact the AI has more MP then players every time and ends up geting at the start ussualy 2 squads. Multiplayer is a bit more balanced as you know (Most of the time) the player you are up against can't cheat and you both have the same CP and MP at the start of the game. Overall quite a good game in early developement hope the devs could keep up the good work and maybe one day rename the ""anti-tank grenade"" the ""flashbang"" 7.5/10			"

								Originally paid the full $30 for this game. It's now free to play and looks like it's going to die in early access. What a great developer. Edit: To quote 満貫 ""DMS made a bad game that flopped, because things that were requested werent implemented, instead old stuff got reused (AI, Replay - Airborne DLC, TPS gimmick - Iron Fist DLC, everything else came from AS2). Few new skins, models, maps made by a modder and not a professional and a triple a price tag.Yup, one more reason why the F2P probably was implemented in order to prevent refunds if they have a special cases with ""games with demos""			"

								Ok, so this is actually very similar to Men of War series.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoy it.  Its a modern take on MoW but with its own wrinkles.  I especially like the idea of controlling your own troop.  It brings added immersion to the game.  I look forward to seeing where they take the game out of Alpha and into full production.  Worth the buy @ $20, but you could wait for a sale time and get this at a really good deal too.			"

								Compared to other related strategy games this is one of my greatest. Being able to choose to command between one soldier and a whole unit is what makes this game unique, spreading your squad the way you like around objects out smarting your opponent. Also each soldier has his own amount and type of weapons u can use  which makes combat intense and unpredictabe. The speed of interaction between movement and combat makes the battles feel realistic. You can always control a soldier or vehicle in 3rd person if you wish to and use your aiming skills to defeat enemy units. A large amount of vehicles to choose from and graphics are amazing.			"

I strongy reccommend that you buy MEN OF WAR ASSUALT SQUAD 2 as it is 100000x better than this crap, It bothers me that these devs go to such measures to earn as much dirty cash as possible by slandering those that call this a bad game in an article and then do nothing about what we say. Read the reviews, understand the questionable crap that you do and support the community that supported your previous titles. Stop shaming developers of the 21st century by all this in game purchase and season pass baloney and develop a good bloody game before you find ways to rake in the cash.			"

								This game is like a barebones reskin of earlier Men of War games. Gameplay is the same but there is very little unit variation (only two factions with poor amount of unit variety), the performance is extremely poor because they have stretched the ancient GEM engine way too far and the development pace is glacial (new content is not added fast enough).This is one of those Early Access titles which will go from Alpha to Beta to Finished with very little changes and additional content. It simply makes no sense for the devs to invest in this game because it has received so poor reception and sales.Even if it cost $5 (which is most it should cost considering the barebones content) I couldn't recommend it because the performance is so poor, AI is broken and the multiplayer is a lagfest. The engine problems run so deep I don't think Digitalmindsoft can ever fix this game with the resources they have.			"

If you still feel the need for a somewhat modernized RTS just go with something from the Wargame series ( even the cheapest one is better than this )			"

								I really like where this game is heading. The gameplay is a lot more in depth than titles such as COH, you can turn the tide of a battle with a small squad of well equiped soldiers. The development team is small so the progress is slow but has started to pick up pace in the recent months. The gameplay is unique in the combination of FPS & RTS and with all the assets being constantly updated to higher quality, i have high expectations for this title becoming AAA in the future. The developers are active in the community it's just a shame there are so many negative reviews in regards to going free to play. The majority of bad reviews have nothing to do with the game just people throwing their toys out of the pram because they feel they have been ripped off, which isn't the case.			"

Apart from my request i guess the game is 9/10 just add More Vehicles and maybe more Factions but i dont know about that though.It would be cool if there were more:FactionsMaps Vehicles New AnimationsMore Units And maybe Battleships (Maybe)			"

								I play the free2play version and must say win or lose i've loved every battle so far. great game. sure the controls are a bit clunky once or twice a match but still had a blast. The Direct Control mode they are using of the time of this review was posted makes shooting with sniper rifles and AT launchers much easier then the top down before it( and I got 20 kills the other day with a sniper rifle in about 35 seconds).

Early Access Review
								The DigitalMindSoft(DMS) team responsible for the MenofWar(MoW)franchise's evolution, which has culminated in CalltoArms, is one of the most uniquely talented RealTimeStrategy(RTS) game development groups in the industry today. In the past; DMS along with their respective partner(s) BestWay and former publisher 1C have consistently managed to serve-up an amazing array of endlessly playable and constantly improving military-themed RTS titles built off successive improvements to the Gem game engine. I personally consider many of their classic games to be amongst my most favorite-going way back to the initial 2004 release of Soldier's:HeroesofWWII, as their particular brand of RTS delivers the best balance of entertainment, realism, & challenge possible in a PC-based RTS game. Moreover, the MoW franchise; from which CtA is the current derivative apex, has to be the best & most smoothly blended mix of action, tactical control, and detailed sophistication that I've seen yet from this truly fun-to-play family of games. CtA is the latest and greatest DMS expansion off the MoW platform, hands-down! It is certainly no exception to this group's legacy of PC-gaming epicness and I would highly recommend it to most players out there looking for something really special in an RTS game!  Like I said; CtA is a great game derived from an awesome franchise with proven potential, and it certainly has a brilliant Dev team at the helm, but finding success is gonna be an uphill battle because the franchise presents players with a double-edged sword in many ways and here's why:I think we can all agree that the mainstay of military-themed gaming tends to numerically favor the MassivelyMultiplayerOnline/FirstPersonShooter(MMO/FPS) arena; with so many more titles to choose from (such as: CallofDuty, WorldofTanks, RedOrchestra, etc...) then the less dominant RTS genre, ultimately CtA is at a disadvantage from the get go. RTS in general retains popularity somewhat on the outside-edge of the mainstream gaming world, taking that into consideration, in the past the MoWseries has appealed mostly to an even smaller, but highly dedicated, fringe community of the RTS-niche market; gamers attracted to a very specific type of 3rd-person RTS. The MoW franchise offered players something different from the average/popular/arcade feeling war-game RTS (of which similar titles would include: CompanyofHeroes, Blitzkrieg, etc); it offered truly great game immersion! CtA carries the torch, if you are willing to be patient and ride-out the steep learning curve, which unfortunately causes the MoWfranchise gaming experience to receive frequent misunderstood criticism. Although this will probably thus hurt CtA's chances in the mainstream, on the bright side, I can confidently say CalltoArms solves a lot of the previous MoWseries problems. Many of the glitches, weaknesses in playability, and areas in which the game generally needed tweaks are improving with each new developer's update released to CtA's early-access supporters (I personally went with the more content-rich 'Deluxe' edition for $30bucks American). Since CtA is currently in Pre-Release Alpha, it's is bound to be a bit rough around the edges; but the issues are steadily being addressed and refined almost weekly. Additionally, it's true that some general MoWseries drawbacks carry into CtA; a big one being that novice RTS gamers find it far too overly complicated, but for the most part, RTS is supposed to be more complex than say any FPS'er, and the MoW/CtA franchise is probably even harder to learn than your average RTS because the tactical breadth of options and wide scope of possible customizations results in near limitless options (which is supposed to at least partially mirror it's real world counterpart forces). Tactics is all about options! A lot like the game of chess, thus the expectation of 'user-friendly' andor ""ease of use"" are unfair criticisms IMO. Additionally, some seasoned RTS gamers (who can get past the more complex playability) think the franchise lacks/has always lacked a more finely-polished surface-level ""sex appeal,"" like that of its closest competitors, but I can assure you CtA looks great and is competitive with the most current game title's technology. CtA is definitely the sexiest looking, smoothest running, and most highly visually detailed MoW incarnation to date. I really do believe the mainstay of CtA’s detractors criticisms reflect the ""double-edged sword"" of RTSgaming; there is always gonna be a fine line between success and failure with these games when it comes down to how good an RTS game looks and how well it plays, CalltoArms excelles at both if your expectations are reasonable. Furthermore, it's relevant and necessary when considering CtA to also look back at it's predecessors for evidence of growth, and IMHO, the evidence of improvement in CtA is clear, and hopefully this will allow for greater mass-appeal. CtA is a very contemporary game, the atmosphere is relevant, the tech is modern, it’s faster paced than its ancestor games, it plays well, it is still loaded with options but not overwhelmingly so, it retains a modified version of the ‘direct-control’ feature so beloved of the MoWfranchise, and it is a very smooth looking game all around; so it’ll satisfy the small minority of hardcore MOW/RTS fans, as well as attract a wider fanbase who can adapt to it and appreciate its brilliant nuances.

								1800+ hours on MOWAS2 tells me the spiritual successor to one of my favourite games has to be good - at the moment this game is alright, but with its flawsThoughts, compared to MOWAS2:-Graphics: Better relative to MOWAS2, I can see that the devs have put a lot of effort although better graphics seems to have come at a cost-Music: Actually an improvement from the weird, techno theme from MOWAS2 -Fewer factions: i understand Germany and Russia will be released in addition to USA and GRM but the game is currently akin to just USA vs Japan in MOWAS2. -Mini-Map: Awful , the minimap does not display any geographical features and is a step backward from MOWAS2-Direct Control: the new 1st person shooter feature is a welcome change but I find it time-consuming having to direct control a grenade from a 1st person angle - there seriously needs to be a 3rd person option for direct control like in MOWAS2, maybe its because the concept is new but still, I would like the old direct control back.If you are interested, my MOWAS2 review is a lot briefer: http://steamcommunity.com/id/soldiersof45/recommended/244450/ "

								I bought Call to Arms because of my satisfaction from the other games of this development company like Men of War series or Faces of war. But unfortunately, I am not happy with that decision. Because Call to Arms has optimization problems. There is no voice actor, the team uses ex games' character voices. There is a few type units in each factions (ony two factions!). Therefore Multiplayer is not enjoyable.I hope they can fix these several issues, maybe than I can revise my comments about the game.			"

								This is my first review and its not exactly a game review but moreso for the strongest element of the game which is the game editor. This remains the singular reason for my purchase. The editor allows enough flexibility to craft a variety of scenarios / units / objects using a everything you see in the vanilla game. I started playing with MOWAS2 and was drawn more to the editor than the game. I think I have more hours within the editor than the game itself. Moving onto CTA was a simple progression to see how much more the game has developed and I consider it an endorsement of the developers behind the project. This is also the first Early Access game I've purchased (disclosure: I bought Battlefield 1 about 48 hrs to game release so I don't consider that)Negatives: For being the strongest element of the game, which is the editor there is an infuriating lack of official documentation on using it properly. I've watched enough sub-par Youtube videos and tried to reverse engineer maps to understand triggers / rands / zones etc. If there was an official documented guide to the editor, that would increase the ability for more people to create maps / missions and extend game life massively. My day job I handle business strategy and marketing for an entertainment company so this seems like an aspect that can increase customer adoption and visiblity. Truth be told, I want to develop a fully crafty scenario that requires no input from a player and to do everything I envision I need BETTER DOCUMENTATION. Also the AI can act a bit strangely but after playing you can understand the behavior enough to prepare for it. (damn, just found the part that tells me how many hours i put into each game...)			"

								If you have ever played Men Of War and thought this would be awesome with modren weapons and vehicles like I have.... Well here it is. This game is alot of fun I don't have a ton of time into it yet but the time I put in I enjoyed alot. There are bug's and the game still has some leap's to make before it's done. I think the worst problem I had so far is a tank got stuck trying to make a turn and it blew up because it got stuck lol. On a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 7.5 the only game I ever gave a 10 was Skyrim. There are alot of people Not Recomending this game because they say its to much money or that it has a season pass and extra content you have to pay for and all I can say to that is. Would you go to work for free? I understand alot of people also got screwed becase they bought the game some time ago and now its free and to that I understand the frustration its kinda like buying a game from steam then a week later seeing it 75% off. Just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ timing I guess but know that your money went into making the game. All in All a great concept and Idea I cant wait to see it finished.			"

								I had no problem playing this game about a year ago. It was great, but now there is this problem i've encountered. The game starts fine. it's when I want to play a custom or local skrimish game. When I load the game, it goes to 100% and then it doesn't do anythinng else. I wondered if it took more time to load than usual, so I let it sit. Came back around 5 minutes later and still didn't load. I was like ""ok"". So I went outside cut my entire lawn. which took about 2 1/2 hours. Came back still nothing. If anyone can help me that would be great. No I am not running any mods, and the game is up to date. I'm not very good with programming, so if thats what I'd have to do, I'm sure I'd mess it up more. Again if anyone could help, that would be great!			"

								This review is coming from a fan of past men of war games and im also just talking about the game and not any of the dev practices as you see in these comments.Call to Arms is the spiritual successor to the Men of War franchise with the devs taking a crack at modern warfare. If you haven't played the Men of War series go buy men of war assault squad 2 now! I truly belive even with all its flaws it is the best WW2 RTS ever made.Now this game is in early access and is free but i think i will be full priced when released so its kinda a nice free beta to try the game out. Right now you can only play online skrimish as 2 factions but you can host a game and play against bots if you chose (thank god for no bot DLC). Pros: -No Bot DLC (Nuff said)-Built in replay -Upgraded graphics-glorious direct control mode thats is a definite upgrade, if your a past men of war fan you will looooove it!-New gamemodes -A refreshed combat system (its not so much of the stalin approch where you can spam 4 squads of 8 guys and rush)-Squads are only 5 guys so you have to be way more careful and they aren't cheap so it becomes very intense -Game looks more professional the menu and home page are much better on the eyes-Pretty well optimized -Still has the same elements that made men of war good has a nice mix of new things but will still be familiar to old players and will be easy to pick up-Its funCONS:-Harder on your pc. You may be saying well duuuuh but if your coming from men of war 2 and your computer isnt the best i would try the game now before you buy.-The pathfinding oh gawd all mighty if they could have fixed one thing from the first games this would be it but nooo. It would be too much to describe but lets say its just as cancerous as ever and made me rage quit muiltiple times due to my squad running infront of cover and getting gunned down or me making my squad run accoss a street while a tanks busy and only 1 guy gets up and runs in a curved line and stops infront of cover and sits there and doesnt respond. I swear to god I have never had a bug turn me down so much. Cars have to reverse everytime time they make a turn even if its inopen area and take forever to go anywhere the only way to make them useful to to just direct control and ram them through barriers.  I could bear it in the first game but since you dont get as many guys or as much buying power losing guys to bugs is 100x  more fustrating losing just 2 guys kills half your squad and makes your goal insanely hard. By losing entire squads to bad AI is just UGHHHH!!!!  -Not a whole lot of people but hopefully that will change.- with all the different packages im scared that many games will not be open because people dont wanna pay $60 to get and extra team they will never use.- The fog of war is still bad -mostly alot of the same bugs the old ones hadFinal score 7.5/10 I am giving this games a thumbs up because its main issue i have is the pathfing and its in beta so i hope it will be fixed if so this game could go down will my favorites as long as it doesnt become pay to win which i am scared of at the moment. Just give the game a try if you like RTS game you will enjoy this.			"

								If you like men of war and want to buy this game then you need to consider a few things first.1. This game is still pending more updates and only currently has two factions in the game from the start, the others will probably be dlc.2. This game does not have quite as large a playerbase as the men of war games but it is sufficient enough.3. There is currently only one campaign and it's the US campaign, there will be a GRM campaign AFAIK4. The supply bags and stuff may seem like freemium content but there not, all they contain is xp boosts and clan tags,       vehicle eblems etc it's all just cosmetics. 5. Lastly I want to point out the devs didn't just go F2P on all of us, they made what is essentially a demo version which contains only online and no editor, user created content, no sp, they, like what the rest of us did, have to buy the game to gain access to these features. The original idea behind this was to bring more players to the online community as before I would only see 50 people online tops and now there's over 500 so it seemed like it worked.All in all if you like men of war and if you don't mind waiting for updates and playing a early access game then i say get it or get it on a sale as right now 32.99 is a bit pricey, but definitely a good game.

								Looking at the popular reviews for this game, deciding that maybe it's time to buckle down and say something for good, an encompassing theme for this review, the tl;dr and everything and that is: CALM DOWN.Seriously, the devs didn't magically release games this quick, it's more or less the same pace they're keeping at as it was in the past. People complaining about the lack of content, I imagine that the devs will work hard to make that not a truth anymore.As for some of the other common complaints such as money greedy, their feedback isn't appreciated, etc. Yeah, the public responses and management isn't that great, yeah they're relying on dated principles that while they see as fair, others see as (magically) unfair, yeah they might be too selective with what they wanted to do and other times too eager to jump on a bandwagon, BUT THEY'RE TRYING.They're trying to find ways to reinnovate this game compared to its predecessors such as the third person direct control usage (which in my opinion with some polish possibly better than the previous system), make it easier for people to start into (which let's be honest, the Men of War series are brutal in that respect) all while maintaining a relative brutal level of combat that reflects some level of realism.Also, before anyone even bring up that I'm bashing other reviews, I'll say this about the game currently: It's a great amount of fun. The negative, popular reviews aren't even indicative of how fun this game is, how good it is, or whatever. All the negative reviews go on about is how it doesn't meet their apparently made up, presumptuous list of criterias.It's good that it's free to play, it's bad that the F2P people have to deal with units locked behind (manageable, coming from warframe) XP walls, the AI can use some polishing as well (but really now, people are complaining about OP infantry? It's just straight up RNG, representative of real warfare), campaign portion can use some polish (it's friggin early access, you expect a full product?), movement/cover system can be made smoother (I imagine that it's on the dev's list of what to do), season pass move is unexpected, but forunately for the time being (and hopefully kept that way without provarecation) only features 2 single player campaign portion more than the deluxe edition, the faction you can play in multiplayer (albiet locked behind XP wall, again).If the devs provarecate again, lying by omission, fine, I understand people getting angry. That should not significantly sully this game's reputation to the point that people know it as that one game that could've been good but too much DLCs however.People should read carefully into the devs words and act accordingly is what I'm trying to say. Everyone messes up, including *cough* the steam community *cough* so give everyone, including the devs, a fair break.Now, finally, with all the disclaimers out of the way let's get to the fun part.When I first played this game, only vehicle third person direct control was a thing. I thought it was pree cool actually compared to the other men of war series because it felt more in line with being a part of the vehicle. I mean the dev response to the implementation of that change wasn't perfect but I like how they did it. Just the wording was not the greatest.Then only recently I found out that infantry third/first person control was a thing. I have to admit, I thought it would fail due to the previous times I tried directly controlling men only to find out they can't strafe. I was pleasingly proven wrong as they implemented that and strafe peeking became a (really good) thing. It can use more polish, but hey, better than DayZ's polish. The only thing I don't like is how much harder it has become to determine where grenades will land, it was much nicer in the previous system but not being able to see intuitively and from a bird's eye view of where grenades will land while directly controlling (and cooking) a nade in third person was a given.As well, maybe the first few times this game will go relentless. As you get used to it however, you start to see reason as to why fights have been resolved in a certain manner. It starts to become less and less so on the RNG (although it's still a prevalent element of it).As for people complaining about how vehicles can get easy shredded... well welcome to Vietnam. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but the point is, is that due to the urban setting there are a lot of opportunities for infantrymen to set up a nasty ambush that can destroy vehicles. Some people may say that a certain vehicle they paid so much for shouldn't get blown up by an infantryman that's so cheap, but someone has to have a fallback plan to have a chance at staying in the game. While RTSes are generally enjoyed due to the feeling of power via tactical planning, attention and/or doing stuff, sometimes the poor guys got to be thrown a bone. Want an expensive vehicle to not get blown up? Use infantry to screen, be careful of your vehicle's placement, mind the traps and your vehicle will eventually shred through everything that it's supposed to, being well worth the investment.The UI change is appreciated too, not much more to say about it. Gives Call to Arm a little something to distinguish itself from its predecessor, as bloodborne is to dark souls.Marketplace? Well, that part's entirely optional and if there's a part of the dev team that can't find anything else to work on while waiting for the other features to be made, but want to do something, then sure, that ain't wasted time. Just like how the KF2 devs managed it.The campaign, while very rough and not user friendly enough imo as there isn't any tips that shows or any tutorials, it's at least something and I can forsee it being developed to something great. I finished the campaign as of this review, managing to get past the bugs (such as the vehicle magically being blown up in the first mission by machine gun fire) and being able to enjoy the game for what it's meant to be.The skirmishes, the games vs AI, I know, it feels like your♥♥♥♥♥is getting insanely kicked the first time you go at it. With some practice however, they are beatable, and on a very consistent basis. Just because one game didn't go your way doesn't mean the others won't.I haven't tried the multiplayer however, mainly because I'm quiet and there usually isn't too many people wanting to play multiplayer.So there you go. Negative aspects discussed, positive aspects discussed, take your pick. Since so many people apparently trust reviews from people with few hours played in this game just because they pick on business practices, why don't you trust this one? What makes those reviews somehow credible as if they're written by experts? If that's credible, then may as well mark other dubious reviews as trusted ones. Maybe I'm just a person who had enough of negative nancies in the modern world and writing this review to let off some steam, but hopefully someone can gain some insight from this.			"

								Call to Arms is truly a great experience. Though it has recently gone F2P which has sparked a huge uproar, that is no reason to not recommend this game as the games core gameplay remains unchanged regardless of whether it is F2P or not. The gameplay is fun with friends, and there are always some “OH S***” moments. They continue to enhance what the Men of War series had. Though I wish they would continue to build upon those games as well.			"

They write a new post about "" you supported us blah blah"", ""empty servers are unfair blah blah"". If the servers are empty thats your marketing problem, thats your game development problem.Thats your EARLYYYYY ACCESSS PROBLEM.

								Please don't look at the bad reviews for making game free. To bad that they can't look into forums and look for more info about game At first when i saw the game i was very disappointed because it looked like MoW:AS2 but now when its free for Mowas owers and after trying the game out i LOVE IT! + Graphics are better but at the same time better pc is required+ More realistic and challenging gameplay+ 1st person for tanks and infantry are really usefull+ More game modes that are SUPER FUN ( Tank combat, Domination... etc)+ Units costs more and u get less of infantry ( that makes u think what u buying and play more tacticly)- There should be more Unis to buy like infantry ( right now USA can't buy really good units at the start ) - I find granade throwing in first person really hard- Only 2 playable factions for now ( i already saw the post about Germans beeing added )  - For MiniMap you only have red, green, blue colors and no real picture of the map itself while at the same time loading screen have map showedBad english i know :D "

								Love to play games that waste a lot of your storage space only to not work? Then this is for you!After spending an hour  downloading the game I had to fix multiple errors with runtime caused by the game not installing the files needed to run with C++. After reinstalling the game AND all of my C++ redist packages I finally got the game to work, or at least I thought. When trying to join a game you will get multiple errors until the game crashes and you have to restart CTA. Overall, a decent looking game with horrible programming.UPDATE:I have gotten the game working finally, so I will now write the pros and the cons of this game (Not including the issues stated before). Note that the issues I stated before still happen.Pros:-Addicting-Fun-Good mechanics-Good quality gameplay (Amazing for a F2P game)-Not P2W-Playerbase is mostly experienced players-Not many raging five year olds-Runs on older computersCons:-The multiplayer playerbase is small and consists of about 150 players.-The editor is confusing-You can't use mods unless you buy the full game (I consider this a small con)-Common exploit players use that causes the enemy team to fire extremely slow and move slow. Makes it near impossible to beat your enemy and needs to be fixed ASAP.Overall it is an amazing game if you ignore the many annoying issues you have getting it to work			"

								After spending many an hour on AS2 I brought this game with high hopes..... Unfortunately its failed to live up to any of them.Units locked until you ""rank up"", a campaign thats disintresting at best and a skirmish system that needs access to the internet to host a AI only match??They have taken features that worked in previous games and somehow managed to break them in this. Especially direct control, which now seems to be unable to fire more than a few metres in front regardless of where the mouse is pointing and an AI that is that stupid, that enemies can be stood next in front of them and theyll still ignore them....Atleast after all this they managed to fix the game breaking ""out of synch error"" on AS2 after endless complaints..I regret buying this almost as much as Cities XXL it really is a close thing..

								So very short review.  I downloaded the game it was on F2P so i said why not? As soon as I started it up, I was hit with the familiarity of a game i had played 100s of hours in before.  Just the loading symbol made me think instantly Men of War: Assault Squads 1 and 2.  Basically its a more modern version of the game.    I like the idea but the fact its just everything reskined with different maps bothers me.  Even the sounds are the same.  The Americans yell out the wonderful phrases as they always do, such as, ""For Uncle Sam!"".   I think they did a better job on the FPS mode for it with the zoom, but thats about it.			"

								Just like the Men of War series, but with some significant improvements to direct control and graphics.The new first and third person controls are amazing. The camera is now tethered to the unit you are directly controlling, and players can easily switch between weapons. For infantry, the movement is still a little sluggish, but players are able to use weapon sights to engage; a huge improvement. Night vision and thermal optics for certain vehicles. Still somewhat gamey, in that thermals have a limited use timer, with a cool down, but a step in the right direction. Hopefully, the developers will reconsider. The new depth of field really makes the game shine, and is a much welcomed addition to the graphics. A few things I hope the developers can look at alterting:1 - Weapon accuracy - Tanks shouldnt have as much dispersion on their main gun as they do in game. Compared to real life equipment, in game equipment is wildly inaccurate. This a far cry from modern equivalents.2. Weapon reload times (tank main gun) are entirely too long. The US standard is 6 seconds to reload a tank round, and the autoloader on the T-80/90/72 is 9 seconds.			"

								Just looking at the user reviews on steam for this game and honestly it really disappointed me. I mean for God’s sake, buy a game in early access and then slam it with bad reviews because it’s got problems as if it’s already released?This isn’t Day Z -which after all this time rightly deserves to be panned- and it is very early days.If you don’t like the game when its released then fine but to nuke it in early access -when the whole concept is supposed to be for people who want to help the game and its developers- is just vicious.I got problems with the game too (please for the love of God don’t release with that same old crash) but I'm having so much fun I haven’t as of yet gone back to MOW Asss 2.I'm getting used to the 3rd person direct control, and I’m having so much fun with infantry squad based combat I couldn’t care less about being forced to 'lock units by level' anymore. Perhaps won’t be a good idea to release it with this locked permanently but being forced into a certain play style does actually give one a chance to see that the game can be played and enjoyed in more way than one. Love the way the game looks and feels, love the Arabian music, and really do have much higher hopes for this game even than when I bought it. Some of the battles I had today were thrilling. I used a method of winning that I don’t think I’ve ever used in the past fighting away from his flags and mine in a far off corner where he ended up bleeding his army white trying to dislodge me in an attempt to get access to my last remaining flag. All the while I was saving for mortars and keeping what few recon men I had down. The result when these tactics work out is encirclement and happiness! If this game was ever able to attain the success which we all know MOW has truly deserved then that would only be a great thing for us in the MOW community. Massive success will bring greater resources to the development team which would make an even better game now or in the future. Why can’t we get behind it and wait and see and save the thumbs down reviews until after it is released? Anyone should be able to see it is early days and already is looking very promising. Anyway I’m going to give it a positive review for now to balance things out a bit, and I hope that anyone who agrees with me on this and wants this game to do well will do the same. I really hope that finally this game will end up knocking COH of its undeserved perch. If I think the game stinks on release I will happily change this review of course and I really hope the famous crash will not be present.			"

								I feel there is a need to defend this game from some of the unwarranted criticism due to it offering a free to play version.You know what the F2P version is?  Do you remember those discs you would get with StarCraft or World in Conflict that would allow your friend to install a copy of the game on their system, but wouldn't let them play the campaign or anthing, and was really just to play multiplayer?  Yeah, it's that.  It lets you play around with the game in a multiplayer/skirmish setting, but you are limited to that.The full version is everything the developers promised to their backers.  Take a look at this excerpt from an RPS interview in January of 2013:""RPS: So can you describe your plans for the game in some detail? What should players expect from it?Kramer: We’ve published a feature list on our website, but it really only represents the foundation we are building for launch. We will begin with two basic factions, i.e. the United States and the Global Revolutionary Movement, but we built the game to continuously add more units, varying factions and deeper scenarios.""What in there guarantees you that early access/crowd funding supporters will have access to any and all DLC for no extra cost?  What other games are you buying on EA or Kickstarter that offer that deal without it being expressly stated or as an additional tier/package you can buy?This game is exactly what I was expecting when I purchased it.  Taking the MoH:AS formula to the modern warfare setting.  It has the same depth as others in the series, and offers as much playability as them.  If you enjoyed MoH:AS(2), and you want to be able to use jets, helicopters, and all the cool high tech stuff from modern times, then this is what you are looking for.  End of story.			"

								Last time I played this it was a horrible mess that stuttered along and was pretty much unplayable, so I left it for a while to develop. When I came back to it after over a year it turned into F2P garbage. I'm glad my early access money went towards a free game where you can choose to buy extras lol.But with that said, it is the same company that has been rereleasing pretty much the same game for the last 11 years ever since Faces of War with a new campaign tacked on so you can't expect anything actually new from them to be stable right away.These lazy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥thieves were still using the same HUD complete with images of WW2-era infantrymen for the stance buttons until recently by the looks of it lol nevermind the same voices ever sinces Faces of War in 2006. gg

								Be sure to click that grey rectangle above to view the review with nicer formatting.Decent and very fun game (as you can see from my playtime). I'll also try to explain all the negative reviews a bit.What I like:Attention to visual detail. Graphics and authenticity are great and performance has been improved a lot.There are plenty of new game mechanics that didn't exist in MoW games (some for obvious reasons). Some being third person and the new first person direct control of infantry and vehicles (which is still WIP and a bit clunky right now), giving the AI control of mounted guns while you control a vehicle, helicopters (new), night vision, thermal/FLIR vision, building fortifications, and some more. The campaign is fun too (a con will follow later)Mod support (con there too, though)The game is not a generic RTS. It's very unique. Can't say more about it because it is that advanced. For instance realistic/authentic vehicle damage, direct control feature, some unique modes, etc.What needs work:Campaign lacks a point and a story. You just do missions. Kill people. Die. That's it.The game does have quite some bugs, one that I noticed that is obstructing you a lot while playing (direct control sometimes conflicts with grenade throwing and it's hard to get out of that).The AI is quite dumb still (in a previous major update they've improved it a little).The animations need work too,and voices are currently placeholders from MoW.I think the biggest weakness of this game is the lack of content:As of now, there are only 2 factions, some modes and a few maps. Some maps are unfortunately limited to modes which is a shame.Modding is nice, but I think there aren't enough people that are actually modding.One plus is that all the factions that will be added through DLC will be playable for free, you just have to unlock them through progress. Buying the respective DLC will let you play everything that faction has to offer right away, including a campaign, which is a exclusive to buyers of this DLC. We'll have to see how that turns out, though.Recent negative reviews:Okay, many people reviewed the game negatively because they've paid for the game months ago and now it suddenly goes F2P. While I do understand all the negative reviews being dropped here because of the new F2P, Crate and DLC policy, you can see that many of these people who rated it badly have either not played it in a long time, or have not played it at all really. Most didn't even bother to read the devs' statement and information about the differences of F2P, payed, Deluxe and Season Pass versions of the game. They don't even care about it, so why bother reviewing, the worst part being that they reviewed it without informing themselves, without even having any knowledge as to why it went F2P and what pros and cons it brings with it. They just picked up that a game people paid for went F2P, not doing any further investigation on this.I do agree that this was quite a risky and from a customer's standpoint shady move, but people were complaining about how little the playerbase is, so they just extended it by making a free to play version which only includes multiplayer and doesn't allow mods. I think this was actually a quite smart move because that way they extended the playerbase a lot so there are actually opponents and allies you can find. This topic is not that extremely complex, but still too complex for me to bother mentioning any more of it here. Everyone has their own opinion after all, but I think you have to give credit where credit is due. If you want to know more about this, read their Fact Check article, it contains all the information about this strategy that you need. There are also plenty of posts about it on the game's forums. "

								So my friend and I played through the campaign and it turned out to be ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ It gave us 2 snipers to take out at least 50 infantry, 3 PKM technicals, and a few urals. We had to use a silenced pistol which had probably 1 mag or something, and we ended up getting to the objective only to find out they laid an ambush with 2 squads. I guess its cool becauase they set up ambushes but Im pretty sure its just the dumbass level development. The next mission gives you 2 strykers(1 MGS and 1 .50) against 14 vehicles and 50 infantry. 90% of the map is just a ♥♥♥♥ ton of trees that block all your shots and barely any cover for the U.S. except the GRM because why not. This really reminds me of a cheesy Bollywood movie with the amount of enemies you face and the amount of support you have. I mean the missions are really cool and all but the engine and the way theyre set up just dont allow it. Also sometimes the gunners on vics just stare at the enemy because technology? Multiplayer is cool I guess. Kinda fun with friends but boring asf by yourself. Half the lobbies though are just AFK hosts that dont start the games. Overall this game is good, just wait for the development and refinements on the campaign. Also, I bought all the DLC and♥♥♥♥♥♥and I wanted to know if theres a way I could♥♥♥♥♥♥on my friends in multiplayer with A10s and Apaches. 7/10.This could all change (hopefully) in the future with the full release.

								Call to Arms had me hyped for quite a while before its release, which led me to but the Deluxe Edition the day of its Early Access release. I've played a bit of multiplayer (when I could find someone else who was playing) and spent some time in the single-player missions. This game is an attempt at a modern Men Of War, and does it well in some areas, but not so well in others. So far the campaign is a bit lacking and is prone to bugs/glitches, and in my experience (although limited) the multiplayer does not run very well. My recommedation for the average Steam member is to wait until a final product is released with all of the issues ironed out. In its current state I can't in good conscience recommend this game.Final Verdict 6/10			"

								Stay Away!Noted: This game is in Beta. But holy hell are the glitches and balancing just aboslute garbage.The Concept is fun.The Unit detailing is nice.The Gameplay mechanics are as you'd expect from a Men Of War style game, staying true to MoWAS2 Mechanics.The Balancing is garbage, it takes more than five 7.62 rounds from an AK to kill a US troop.... Now i'm no professional but i'm pretty damn sure ceramic plating couldn't stop five 7.62 rounds from 5 feet away... And if by chance, IF, they so happen to be able to at times, there's no god damn way in hell that guy is getting back up, picking up his rifle, and pew pewing more bad guys.Honestly stay away from this game until it's either fully developped or they add balance to the game.And if for some god awful reason you decide to buy this game anyways... Never play GRM Online. You will be kneeled over and man handled. "

								I've played 3 matches in this game and it made me uninstall & not recommend it:First match: after 5 minutes the game crashes. Second match: My abrams gets stuck in a bush , i mean sure maybe they hidden some OP tank trap that i don't know about in that bush but i doubt that.Third match: figured out that vehicles don't shoot other vehicles or if , IF they do they miss like 90% , then my soldiers miss more than a silver 1 in cs go. Now..i was pretty excited to see a Men of War-like game with modern setting but oh man.. this looks like a badly made mod... at least they should've not released it now. Thank god they made it free to play (online casual only/vs ai) so i wouldn't get tricked and paying real money for this crap.			"

								I've played almost every Men of War Series and this game has a decent similiarity to it, just a bit glitchy and unpolished, with much potential! Would be to the delight of RTS fans.However, to my horror, what i thought was payment for a full game has just turned into a free to play and one with a season pass. It is understood that developers have a livelihood but all i can say is that the early backers and supporters of the early access phase are now paying the price for the developer's poor planning. So much for the appreciation to the early backers. As wtih my experiences with other Early Access games, it usually pales in comparison to fully developed ones due to the incentive being given even before the job is done.

								After doing some research, it seems that the reason they have all this additional priced content content is because the kickstarter didn't recieved the full backing goal (This abviously provides them with the resources to perpetuate improving and fixing the game onwards)  yet they still decided to continue developing a free element of the game so that people who haven't played men of war could get a feel of what the game is akin to, supplementally for people who have played men of war series can play the game with a modern styilized approach. Considering that the game has the free-to-play element already contains all the realistic mechanics such as; bullet trajectory, armor piercing, bullet ricochets and weak spots that the base game has alongside with a decent amount of micro management if playing at a high difficulty/level, which sanctions for a more tactical and enjoyable experience overall. In my own anecdotal experience, I've found that I geneuinelly enjoy the free-to-play aspect regardless of me not playing the full version. Sure for the constrained budget they had the game can seem clunky at times with broken path-finding, animations and AI (at times).Lastly, as I haven't payed/played the full version of the game, this opinion is only derived from my experiences on the free to play element. However, I feel like the with the compatability of steam workshop the players themselves will begin to fix and ameliorate the game regardless of if devs decide to abandon the project. Withal, I'd just like to note that the deluxe edition, ultimate edtion etc. aren't compulsory requisites and just integrate what i'm assuming is: DLC, in-game items and season passes which many games have already done in the past and no-one has complained. Pros:- Visually and aesthetically pleasing (Graphics, modernized)- Tactical features and gameplay elements.- Very enjoyable when playing with friends.- Realistic mechanics.- Impressive first person mechanic (Direct control of units)- The factions vary to the point of having their own advantages and disadvantages (Unique).- The cover system is well designed and can make for some interesting fire fights.- Inventory system (The same system used in MoW)- Hardcore mode (Makes the game very challenging and realistic)Cons:- They same to be using the same engine as MoW (Men of War) which contained many bugs.- Buggy path-finding (A.I. can seem to get lost at times)- Lack of content (To be expected though)- Granade throwing distance seems to be very short and unrealistic.- A.I. can at times be borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Final verdict: 6.5/10I see a lot of reviews saying that they got scammed or that this is a fraud due to paying for the game and the game becoming free-to-play, I can't add to this, this is just my 2 cents :Duck:			"

								Now I know I know this might not be the best review as I have only played this game for less than a hour.  But here is my reasoning for the the thumbs down.  (Please note this review is of the games current state right now)   -  Now my biggest hate of this game comes from the amount of content in this game.  Now yes there is a editor and yes you can download maps off of steam  (Even though there isnt many).  And sure you can play multiplayer but its just not the same type of gameplay.  Now this content I am talking about is single player.  Little did I know you have to BUY the single player which is $15 dollars.  I wouldnt mind but $15 dollars for a single player campaign and a few extra goodies just isnt acceptable.  And I know its in earley access so not all the content isnt going to be in the game but no for the few missions of single player you have to BUY it.  I wouldnt mind but this game is in earley access and already there is DLC just to play a part of the game that shouldve been included with the full game in the first place.  Other than that the game is very fun and if you dont need a single player campaign and just want to 1v1 against AI or play against other people then that is fine and I recommend the game but if you are more of a single player guy than you will be disappointed.  -  Note this review is of August 29 2015 and things might change.

								If you like Men of War this game is for you. For me its a pretty challenging game (IF you play against a very good player or play on the manliest difficulty) I love the modern day combat I hope that in the future there will be more playable factions (I REALLY WANT A LEOPARD 2!!!!!!) I didn't notice any bugs when playing (cept that the game was telling me that the BMP T80 and abrams main gun is a kwk 43 88 and the  fact that 1 of the US AT rockets sucked d**k it bounced off the side of a BMP an I was like wah). It kind sucks that you have to pay extra to play the single player but they said when its finished it will be available to every one. You can also play skirmish against the AI now which you can't do in Assault Squad 2 unless you got mods so thats nice but I had a great time playing the game and look forward to future content (leopard 2? germans? plzzz??)

								Same Engine as all the other 1C games (Men of War, Faces of War, e.g.). Who liked the other ones will like this one too. Plus the great oppertunity to fight A++ orgininal US verhicles. The feel of the HMMWVs 50.cal feels great.The game feels a lot more tactical and is in my feel a little more fast paced than the games before.Anyone who liked the games before will love it. Anyone who enjoys modern era combat will have great fun with this game when its finished.I only hope that more units will come, f.e. Apaches, Blackhawks and so on. I am also afraid of the DLC politics. Right now, in order to play Singleplayer missions you need to buy the DLCs. Thats a no-go.Still hope the end result will improve. Worth buying right now for its relativly low price ;)			"

Before you begin to read this review, understand that this is my personal review of this game at the time I owned it! I am not going to account for new updates as I want to review the game as I played it! Finally, Call to Arms comes out after three years in development, what did we get as loyal Men of War fans and followers? A unfinished product that is far from completion. Let me explain...The  Pros... Overall Gameplay: The game is quite fun as it maintains the solid RTT elements of the World War II Men Of War games and the transition to the the Modern Era is decent. Assault rifles function properly and the micro-managing infantry combat feels like it's supposed to. Multiplayer: Game Modes in multiplayer are few, but fun to play against players. Small and few maps; they are well done, but are boring. The Campaign: Campaign I did not touch upon; but from what I saw and talked about with other Call to Arms owners. Its decent with some vehicles being used and the overall way the missions are done are in a combination with similar style to the campaign in the first Men of War and the Skrmish mode in Men of War Assault Squad 1 and 2. The Cons...The problems that occurred (and realizations) with me while playing is this game I boiled down into three things: 1. The lack of content: This game being in development for three years, I expected the game to have more Modern Vehicles, a variety of factions and amazing new features that bring this game to out-compete the original Men of War games. Well, I was wrong and the lack of content is awful. No tanks, APC's, supply vehicles,and the only ones you really get are a portable machine gun on a tripod emplacement (for both factions), a motor emplacement (again for both factions) and a humvee vehicle for the USA and a technical vehicle for the other faction. Speaking of the factions, there are only two! Again, both of the factions really only have infantry (With little variety) and only ONE vehicle! Another issue as I stated is the lack of game modes in multiplayer. Only from what I remember two-three? Assault Zones, combat and maybe one other. (Don't hold me to that on that particular complaint) Few maps make it to where multiplayer is a bore just like in Men of War Vietnam, with little to see and little to explore after playing the game two or three times. 2. Three year development hell: I am glad I did not back this game, as if I were a backer, I would demand a refund. The company raising almost 100,000 euros and then it disappearing to who knows where for three whole years, then having the guts to come on Steam demanding more money for their incomplete game! Thankfully did not back this game and I am very sorry for those backers who did not really see a finished product with the amount of time they had. Point being; What the ♥♥♥♥ did you spend that money on and why is there such little content! Again, three years is PLENTY of time to make a content filled game in this genre!3. Mods and Other Games with the GEM engine are FAR superior to Call to Arms: With mods like Red Rising, (which is about to become its own game), Battle of Empires: 1914-1918 and other Men of War titles are WAY better than this game. They at least have content and were done properly from day one. They had reasonable development cycles and were finished. I have been quite happy with Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and Men of War Assault Squad 2.  Those were well done games! (I hated Men of War: Vietnam and Men of War Condemned Heroes as they are a lot like this game when it comes to development). Also, when a mod can out-compete your new Modern day-based game, I just simply laugh! Other Thoughts...Some other nitpicks about the gameplay is that it's not too much different from Men Of War. Not very many new features or massive differences. Again, the Assault Rifles and other weapons are pretty decent and have a slight unique feel, but they are not this new amazing thing compared to the other Men of Wars. It honestly feels more like a ""Copy and paste, then lots of retexturing"" then a brand-new Modern Day RTT. One final thing that is outside of the game is how the developers take criticism within their community. Me watching from a distance on how they dealt with fair and reasonable criticism on their steam forums and on their website is very sad as all they do is show how poor their ability is to actually address these people who again have FAIR criticism on their games. They did not say; ""We will try to fix that"" or ""Can you elaborate more?"", they just simply banned these fans. Personally, I think this can seriously hurts them in the long run if they do not have a better Public Relations team that can connect with the community better on a personal level and help solve these issues instead of create drama. Conclusion...Overall, the game is FAR from completion, again, even though it's in early access, it's NOT an excuse. It's been in development for three years and had a crowdfunding campaign three years ago. Do not buy this game! You are wasting your money! Go help the Red Rising developers with their new game or go buy another GEM Engine based game! They are FAR superior products to this game.			"

								This game is a very fun mid level RTS. This allows the player to have great squad to platoon level control even with the ability to take over units and control them directly. This allows interesting things to happen that you don't normally get in a RTS like having a unit fire into cover because you suspect there might be enemies inside.Pros:- High detailed units- True Line of site- Ability to direct control units- Units have full kit: medic packs, grenades, pistols, minesCons- Non intuitive interface (makes sense after a few games)- mini maps are not textured			"

								Call to Arms,Is a type of game that uses the same engine as the regular Men of war franchise, but doesn't try to be just a mod.With that out of the way it's more easy enjoy the game as it is.The major problem with call to Arms is, like I already mentioned, that people comare it to Men of War games. Well, I can understand that, but it's just that Call to Arms isn't trying to be Men of War.Yes, true, many things are the same; like the selection of units and how you order new assets, but strategy wise it's an almost entire new game.If you like arcade like, semi strategic games, than Call to Arms might be your thing. Otherwise, if you're a hardcore fan of the Men of War games.. well, give it a try, but you'll probably feel smacked in the face.For me it's a thumbs up for now, but only because I think the game can become better and because the ingame store isn't a must do. You don't have to use it to play and enjoy the game.But to be honest, the current state of the game is far from finished and it really feels more like a mod for Men of War than a standalone game.Biggest issue is with the third person action cam. It looks okay, seems to react okay, but it also makes your unit a wandering piece of cannon fodder.Maybe, for smaller missions it's nice, but not for large scale battlefields.			"

								So I understand why some are upset about this game, going free to play may or may not be the right move. I think that the amount I payed for this game was well worth it even with it going F2P. Everyone is upset, understandably the company does not like negative reviews. Even if the company wanted too refund the game they could not. So the company has spent its collected money improving the game. I know I've personally given money to projects that gave up, This developer, even though there game is getting smeared, is not giving up that takes guts. I cannot ,reasonably, condem this developer for continuing work on a project many other devs would have written off. I'm going to pose a question, What would it require for this developer to regain your trust and your review again?			"

Early Access Review
 TL;DR  The game is perfectly playable in it's current state. Much of the gameplay is remeniscent of the Men of War series, which is created by the same developer. The factions are balanced at the time of this review, and there is one campaign that can be played both singleplayer or cooperatively. DISCLAIMER Call to Arms is in early access, and you should really consider if you want to actively support the game in it's early stages, or wait until the final release to purchase the game. Call to Arms  If you literally have no clue what CtA is, it's a modern RTS mixed with thirdperson shooter elements. It is developed by Digital Mindsoft, who have also created the games from the Men of War series. It currently contains the US Armed Forces and the Global Revolutionary Movement (GRM) as the two factions. Each faction consists of unique units, vehicles, and strategies. Currently the game only has a campaign for the US forces. The multiplayer is reminiscent of the Men of War series. Call to Arms also has workshop support, which massively increases the amount of content in the game. Thirdperson and Firstperson  Recently the game has gained a new thirdperson mode, allowing you to jump directly into the combat as one of your troops. It's still kind of buggy, but allows for much greater control. You can also go into firstperson as infantry by scrolling in. US Forces The US Forces include elements from the Army and Marines, with other assorted special operations groups. US Campaign  Currently the US are the only faction to have a campaign. All of the missions are well designed, and unique in their own way. The story, however, is pretty uninspired. The US is fighting the GRM for territory control. There is no voice acting as of yet, though it is planned. Overall, the entire campaign could use a lot of work. US Multiplayer  The US military is exceedingly effecient at defending ground that they already captured areas. Early on in a match the US will have an advantage as they can take and hold areas without letting an enemy capture the area easily. The US has a large assortment of vehicles and troops at it's desposal, allowing varied gameplay opportunites.Vehicles used by the US include: M2 Bradleys Strykers M1A2 Abrams HumveesThere are a few more vehicles and even a few variants of mentioned ones as well. GRM The GRM is a coalition of multiple Middle Eastern nations that use a combination of Soviet, modern Russian, and WWII weapons to achieve their objectives. GRM Multiplayer  The GRM use overwhelming numbers and hit and run strategies to defeat their enemies. They utilize anything from large groups of civilian militias and insurgents to smaller squads of more organized military troops and special operators. The GRM's early troops are much weaker than their US counterparts, but also have larger squad sizes. They mainly use Cold War era soviet weapons and vehicles.Vehicles used by the GRM include: T-80s BMPs BTRs TechnicalsAgain, as with the US, there are more vehicles and variants. Free to Play Version  The F2P version of Call to Arms like a demo with no time limit. It is multiplayer only, and does NOT have access to mods or the singleplayer campaign. Players in the F2P version also have to unlock certain units instead of having them unlocked from the beginning. Season Pass The season pass includes: A Minor Factions DLC and a campaign for the GRM. (This is included with the Digital Deluxe edition.) A Germany Faction DLC and campaign A Russia Faction and campaignTake a look at This chart[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com] to help decide what version best suits you. Community Market  The community market is simple, it allows players to purchase and sell minor customization items that will not effect gameplay. All market items can be unlocked ingame as well. End Thoughts  Hopefully that's a relatively clear outline of what Call to Arms includes. I gotta recommend it for the amount of effort the devs put in and for the modding community. That being said, what I like may not be what you like. Try out the F2P version before making any final decisions.			"

								I have put hundreds of hours into the men of war series and I think this is a solid game. The multiplayer is now free to play so I would definitely reccomend getting the free version. Although the game feels much like a reskin of Men of War: Assault Squad 2, it's still in early access so I am hoping that once the animations and ui are redone it won't feel like a mod anymore. There are only two factions atm, U.S. and the Resistance however they both play very differently and have there own unique strengths and weaknesses. There are no paywalls or anything of that sort. The only thing you can get from purchasing things are xp boosts or comestics but you earn packs after winning every match. Not once have I felt like I was at a disadvantage. Not to brag but I barely lose and have only spent 8 cents on the game,  giving me only cosmetics. Getting angry at the developers, claiming you got ripped off because part of the game is now free is like complaining that the game went on a sale for 75% off after you bought it full price. If you purchased the game soley for the multiplayer then that is unfortunate, but why should the game still cost money just becuase you bought it before it went partially free? I would definitely reccomend getting the free version, unless you like campaign, which probably isn't that great right now. You can also play against AI in multiplayer which is pretty much the same thing			"

								Early Access Review: Bought Deluxe edition before F2P version came out.Off hand I have to say it's a decent little game.The game has some decent strategy in the single player campaign.Graphics are good, audio could use a bit of work. (Mission statements being voiced, guns sound a bit off.)The single player could be fun once it has some work done to it; even in its current state it's playable & feels like a squad based RTS game.However the single player could really use some tutorial missions. Trying to figure out all the controls on your 1st go is difficult; I had to resort to looking at the key bindings just to figure out how to change the controls of the humvee because I got ""stuck"" in... direct control I think? I'd call it first person.Now the part the developers are crying about... the multiplayer.I don't doubt the multiplayer will be fun (I'll probably never play it as my friends don't play this type of game) since it shows various game modes that typical online shooter games have. Examples are deathmatch or hold flag areas.It also has built in LAN & AI support... something every game should have & something that will make this game a long lasting game... however I haven't tested it with out internet yet to ensure it doesn't need the central server to start. Dedicated server files that one could download & run separately would go along way in player confidence.HOWEVER.The multiplayer is most definitely pay to win. He who holds the most $ will win.The transactions, and I don't think you can even call them micro, cover all sorts of things... such as emoticons for chat, free experience, clan symbols etc.Prices range with a quick glance showing prices upwards of $6 CDN.At this point in time I do think the game is worth supporting; but buy it for the single player & don't bother with playing multiplayer with anyone who isn't a friend... the store takes the equality out of it.(Also when I tried playing it now the public lobby, which was joined automatically, had 33 players in it... none of whom said anything. Not a lively community off hand.)Over all: Recommend... get something with single player. Ask developers to post dedicated server files that don't require Steam to use.			"

Before you begin to read this review, understand that this is my personal review of this game at the time I owned it! I am not going to account for new updates as I want to review the game as I played it! Finally, Call to Arms comes out after three years in development, what did we get as loyal Men of War fans and followers? A unfinished product that is far from completion. Let me explain...The  Pros... Overall Gameplay: The game is quite fun as it maintains the solid RTT elements of the World War II Men Of War games and the transition to the the Modern Era is decent. Assault rifles function properly and the micro-managing infantry combat feels like it's supposed to. Multiplayer: Game Modes in multiplayer are few, but fun to play against players. Small and few maps; they are well done, but are boring. The Campaign: Campaign I did not touch upon; but from what I saw and talked about with other Call to Arms owners. Its decent with some vehicles being used and the overall way the missions are done are in a combination with similar style to the campaign in the first Men of War and the Skrmish mode in Men of War Assault Squad 1 and 2. The Cons...The problems that occurred (and realizations) with me while playing is this game I boiled down into three things: 1. The lack of content: This game being in development for three years, I expected the game to have more Modern Vehicles, a variety of factions and amazing new features that bring this game to out-compete the original Men of War games. Well, I was wrong and the lack of content is awful. No tanks, APC's, supply vehicles,and the only ones you really get are a portable machine gun on a tripod emplacement (for both factions), a motor emplacement (again for both factions) and a humvee vehicle for the USA and a technical vehicle for the other faction. Speaking of the factions, there are only two! Again, both of the factions really only have infantry (With little variety) and only ONE vehicle! Another issue as I stated is the lack of game modes in multiplayer. Only from what I remember two-three? Assault Zones, combat and maybe one other. (Don't hold me to that on that particular complaint) Few maps make it to where multiplayer is a bore just like in Men of War Vietnam, with little to see and little to explore after playing the game two or three times. 2. Three year development hell: I am glad I did not back this game, as if I were a backer, I would demand a refund. The company raising almost 100,000 euros and then it disappearing to who knows where for three whole years, then having the guts to come on Steam demanding more money for their incomplete game! Thankfully did not back this game and I am very sorry for those backers who did not really see a finished product with the amount of time they had. Point being; What the ♥♥♥♥ did you spend that money on and why is there such little content! Again, three years is PLENTY of time to make a content filled game in this genre!3. Mods and Other Games with the GEM engine are FAR superior to Call to Arms: With mods like Red Rising, (which is about to become its own game), Battle of Empires: 1914-1918 and other Men of War titles are WAY better than this game. They at least have content and were done properly from day one. They had reasonable development cycles and were finished. I have been quite happy with Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and Men of War Assault Squad 2.  Those were well done games! (I hated Men of War: Vietnam and Men of War Condemned Heroes as they are a lot like this game when it comes to development). Also, when a mod can out-compete your new Modern day-based game, I just simply laugh! Other Thoughts...Some other nitpicks about the gameplay is that it's not too much different from Men Of War. Not very many new features or massive differences. Again, the Assault Rifles and other weapons are pretty decent and have a slight unique feel, but they are not this new amazing thing compared to the other Men of Wars. It honestly feels more like a ""Copy and paste, then lots of retexturing"" then a brand-new Modern Day RTT. One final thing that is outside of the game is how the developers take criticism within their community. Me watching from a distance on how they dealt with fair and reasonable criticism on their steam forums and on their website is very sad as all they do is show how poor their ability is to actually address these people who again have FAIR criticism on their games. They did not say; ""We will try to fix that"" or ""Can you elaborate more?"", they just simply banned these fans. Personally, I think this can seriously hurts them in the long run if they do not have a better Public Relations team that can connect with the community better on a personal level and help solve these issues instead of create drama. Conclusion...Overall, the game is FAR from completion, again, even though it's in early access, it's NOT an excuse. It's been in development for three years and had a crowdfunding campaign three years ago. Do not buy this game! You are wasting your money! Go help the Red Rising developers with their new game or go buy another GEM Engine based game! They are FAR superior products to this game.			"

								Call to Arms is a good game and is a solid depiction of modern era combat.-disabling tracks on a tank immobilizing it without killing it or destroying the turret so it can no longer shoot.-enemies without cover get killed very quickly-vehicles and infantry must support eachother.-navy seals and other higher teared units are more equipped and have a better aim then othe units.There is still a lot to be done and the devs say that they are going to be adding air units into the game which would be AMAZING and I am really looking forward to it. Of course their are a few bugs but overall it is a fantastic game especially for early access.I have spent most of my time in the mission editor because the possibilites are endless with making my own missions.A fun thing to do is making a unit invincible and have them dominate everbody lol.

Early Access Review
								--- It's imperative for you to read this review fully if you wish to understand the negative ratings and state of the game. I'll try to be as concise as possible. ---Call to Arms (will be abbreviated C2A for future reference) is a real-time tactics game based in the modern era of warfare. Players (currently) take control of two factions, the US and the Global Revolutionary Movement, or GRM, who are reminiscient of various militant groups in the Middle East. The game is currently in a stable early alpha.Veterans of the Men of War series will be familiar with the controls and layout, as they are very similar. To newcomers of the franchise, however, it may take some time to get acquainted.---------Do keep in mind, this is early alpha. Virtually all content is subject to change and many things are missing. Any points suffixed with ""(EA)"" should be noted as common issues with early development games and not typically representative of what the finished game will be like.Pros;- excellent stability for an early alpha. MoW's engine has been much improved and runs much smoother.- very nice graphics- regular updates- already a large Workshop presence- acceptable troop balance- vanilla multiplayer maps are quite fun- multiplayer AI are actually quite challengingCons;- small selection of multiplayer maps (EA)- multiplayer unit lock (I'll come back to this)- only light vehicles to choose from, few units in general (EA)- MoW's signature direct control mode is broken (I'll come back to this)- current singleplayer missions are deluxe-owners only (EA)---------Regarding multiplayer unit lock; currently, 8 units are locked by multiplayer ""rank"" for each faction. These are the 3 top tier infantry squads, the 3 top tier specialist squads, and the top two light vehicles. (For the US, in order, those would be Marines, Rangers, SEALs, Grenadier Team, Marksmen, Heavy Snipers, the M2HB humvee and the MK19 humvee. For the GRM, in order, it would be Guards, Pasdaran, Assassins, Shotgun Team, Rifle Squad, Heavy AT team, the Kord Technical and the SPG Technical.)This is a non-issue for multiple reasons. Namely, none of these units are necessary to compete or win in multiplayer. While they certainly are a great help, it's far from impossible to win without using them.Another reason is the ease in unlocking them; not only can you rank up without having to engage in PVP thanks to AI, the amount of time it takes to unlock them is extremely short. You can get the 3 top tier infantry as well as the two top tier light vehicles by level 9. Playing at 50% exp gain, that took me roughly 10 games.Finally, ranking up isn't necessary if you would rather not; there is a Workshop mod that disabled the unit locks if you so choose.On top of all of that, this system is subject to change and may be removed by the time the game releases.Whining about this point in the reviews is simply complaining about the lack of convenience and ease, honestly.---Direct control is the major point most negative reviews cite. Previously, it allowed you to take control of any unit directly with a free cam. However, in C2A, this feature has been changed, fixing the camera in a third person position just above and behind vehicles and infantry (when using the toggle button, E). For infantry, you can circumvent this issue by holding control, which allows you to move the camera where you please.Admittedly, I am not a fan of this new camera. In my opinion, while it certainly looks nice, it causes aiming issues for vehicles. However, it is far from a deal breaker and like many things, is subject to change.---------In closing, Call to Arms is an excellent game and a fresh take on the MoW franchise. Currently, though, players and prospective buyers should note that this early alpha game is far from finished and may have less than desirable features. Additionally, the most can only be gotten out of it currently with a friend or two to play multiplayer with.Recommendation?: If you previously played any MoW title, are an RTT/RTS junkie or don't mind testing early alpha games, I would highly suggest this game. If you hav $20,00 to spend, I would buy this.			"

								Call To Arms is a advanced strategy singleplayer-multiplayer game , where you play as two different countrys, and doing objectives in dozen firearms in a 3rd person action mode.The games offers, Domination, Last Man standing and cooperative. The game as a very open-mindet structure of units. If you have a group on etc. 8 marine squards, then you can click individually and move them arround. This gets really handy where other strategy games doesn't allow such a open mindet feature, where you get the feeling of having 100% control of the situation (even if you lose). The game also have alot of torturials for the different part and tactic of the game, if the individually player get's lost. I have to say, that i didn't do any torturial and just jumped into it where they have designed the game to get a quick overview of the game. Sadly, this game does not offer any kind of singleplayer yet.If you like advanced, moderen strategy games in 3rd person, with heavy units either agens AI or online players, then this game is for you.Here is a demo:

Assault rifles function properly and the micro-managing infantry combat feels like it's supposed to. Multiplayer: Game Modes in multiplayer are few, but fun to play against players. Small and few maps; they are well done, but are boring. The Campaign: Campaign I did not touch upon; but from what I saw and talked about with other Call to Arms owners. Its decent with some vehicles being used and the overall way the missions are done are in a combination with similar style to the campaign in the first Men of War and the Skrmish mode in Men of War Assault Squad 1 and 2. The Cons...The problems that occurred (and realizations) with me while playing is this game I boiled down into three things: 1. The lack of content: This game being in development for three years, I expected the game to have more Modern Vehicles, a variety of factions and amazing new features that bring this game to out-compete the original Men of War games. Well, I was wrong and the lack of content is awful. No tanks, APC's, supply vehicles,and the only ones you really get are a portable machine gun on a tripod emplacement (for both factions), a motor emplacement (again for both factions) and a humvee vehicle for the USA and a technical vehicle for the other faction. Speaking of the factions, there are only two! Again, both of the factions really only have infantry (With little variety) and only ONE vehicle! Another issue as I stated is the lack of game modes in multiplayer. Only from what I remember two-three? Assault Zones, combat and maybe one other. (Don't hold me to that on that particular complaint) Few maps make it to where multiplayer is a bore just like in Men of War Vietnam, with little to see and little to explore after playing the game two or three times. 2. Three year development hell: I am glad I did not back this game, as if I were a backer, I would demand a refund. The company raising almost 100,000 euros and then it disappearing to who knows where for three whole years, then having the guts to come on Steam demanding more money for their incomplete game! Thankfully did not back this game and I am very sorry for those backers who did not really see a finished product with the amount of time they had. Point being; What the ♥♥♥♥ did you spend that money on and why is there such little content! Again, three years is PLENTY of time to make a content filled game in this genre!3. Mods and Other Games with the GEM engine are FAR superior to Call to Arms: With mods like Red Rising, (which is about to become its own game), Battle of Empires: 1914-1918 and other Men of War titles are WAY better than this game. They at least have content and were done properly from day one. They had reasonable development cycles and were finished. I have been quite happy with Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and Men of War Assault Squad 2.  Those were well done games! (I hated Men of War: Vietnam and Men of War Condemned Heroes as they are a lot like this game when it comes to development). Also, when a mod can out-compete your new Modern day-based game, I just simply laugh! Other Thoughts...Some other nitpicks about the gameplay is that it's not too much different from Men Of War. Not very many new features or massive differences. Again, the Assault Rifles and other weapons are pretty decent and have a slight unique feel, but they are not this new amazing thing compared to the other Men of Wars. It honestly feels more like a ""Copy and paste, then lots of retexturing"" then a brand-new Modern Day RTT. One final thing that is outside of the game is how the developers take criticism within their community. Me watching from a distance on how they dealt with fair and reasonable criticism on their steam forums and on their website is very sad as all they do is show how poor their ability is to actually address these people who again have FAIR criticism on their games. They did not say; ""We will try to fix that"" or ""Can you elaborate more?"", they just simply banned these fans. Personally, I think this can seriously hurts them in the long run if they do not have a better Public Relations team that can connect with the community better on a personal level and help solve these issues instead of create drama. Conclusion...Overall, the game is FAR from completion, again, even though it's in early access, it's NOT an excuse. It's been in development for three years and had a crowdfunding campaign three years ago. Do not buy this game! You are wasting your money! Go help the Red Rising developers with their new game or go buy another GEM Engine based game! They are FAR superior products to this game.			"

								Call to Arms seems like a pretty neat Military ARTS styled game. Having only played the free to play version I can understand some of the things the paid players are upset about. That being said, that should not influence new comers away from atleast trying the game, and seeing for themselves if they like it.			"

								Don't waste your time. Yeah this game has some pro's, but honestly It'd be better being a 100% F2P Overhaul for MOWAS 2, because although I heard that this isn't a ""mod"" of MOWAS 2, it is damn well close enough to being one. Also I forget and I think MOWAS 2 was $30... maybe $40, but that game has WAY more content than this p.o.s. I mean think about it! You're paying $30 for TWO countries with a limited amount of units, way smaller than MOWAS 2. You can make the argument that the workshop will improve that, and I will agree b/c I was bored with MOWAS's content after a few days (but there was still more than this game), but in MOWAS 2 you at least get a very playable vanilla game... Call to Arms, you're essentially paying $10 for the actual game and the other 20 for the workshop content that is deperately needed.			"

								The game has had it's ups and downs, I can spend so much time in the games editor and just playing multiplayer with a group of friends against ai. If you are in to RTS but you don't like base building, this is the game for you. Cap flags/points, earn spending points, buy new units to send to their iminate death! I think the game is finally through it's worst part, the developers are sometimes slow but when that update finally comes, it hits hard and hits well. I've been following these guys for a while now and there is one thing you must have when following devs like these, which is patience. Patience is what almost everyone requires, but doesn't have. People stopped being patient, started being greedy, and think about themselves instead of the devs and the game. Don't get this game if you don't like a good time consuming RTS, and don't follow the devs if you don't have the patience. My view on this game is pointed towards the devs, it's pointed towards the game and the game only. This game is a solid 8/10, I rarely find bugs and glitches, and they are never game breaking. The reason I rate 8/10 is because I can't describe how many times I've broken a mouse over a tank or truck tapping into an object and go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ing fly to the moon only for it to land on its back and be useless. It hasn't so much lately, but I still find time to time a humvee slowly hitting a barricade and then procede to sink into the ground. Not really the devs fault, so much it is the engine.			"

								A very promising Early Access game. Call to Arms (CtA) feels a lot like a more improvised AS2 as of now, and seems to be more focused on infantry-based combat, completely changing up AS2 gameplay.More chanthe inventory system has changed quite a bit, and is easier to use. The sounds have improved greatly and I've noticed important graphical changes that really stand out to me, such as different/advanced textures, bullet/explosion effects and such.So far, Call to Arms really sticks out to be a possible successor to AS2, and I believe it definitley deserves some investment.

								Ok im biased since i lucked out after buying the game I had realized quickly i was better off just going and playing MOWAS:2 red rising mod and refunded it (In my opinion MOWAS 2 is still the best game this developer has released and by golly is MOWAS 2 a good fkin game and has a great modding community) I feel the majority of the ""recent"" complaints arent real complaints towards the game its just how they got scandaled right now this game doesnt have the biggest playerbase so pick it up while its free and tell the developers what needs some major improvement and if they dont listen (which during the beginning they were not and then i had a much more negative opinion of the game) The game functions semi well and its still a solid RTS game and a free game is a free game pick it up try it out and if you find a problem make it known dont go off in silence forever holding that complaint personal if it needs to be fixed added or changed then tell people you feel that way forums exist for a reason			"

								I am a big Men of war assult squad 2 fan love to play it, this is that with a better ability to take control of a tank or person.  Not a fan of the modern war, world war two all the way.  I will play both MAW for the WW2 and this for the ability the play as the players easier.  I only play in the editor, love making up my own battles.  Have fun, cannot go wrong with free also.			"

								This is Assault Squad 2, made look like game about modern military and dumbed down.- For many guns munnition is gone - it is now virtually attached to the gun as a counter. Still seems that troops can sometimes share these ""virtual munitions"". But there have been strange behavior with munition in Assault Squad games before, with troops not using their equipped munitions and shooting from some infinite source instead.- You can't do anything with troops helmet any more. It was Assault Squad trademark - helmets that could be shot off enemy head. Now they are strictly part of the unit model.- Engine still is unable to handle different munitions for the hand guns. M16 with grenade launcher can't shoot standard munitions. Just grenades.- Western weapons can not be customised. For this era game it is silly that You can't change sights, underbarrel extensions and other options.- Ability to build field fortifications seems to be gone also.Don't buy this game unless it has a decent discount. This is Assault Squad 2 mod with features removed, not a new game.			"

								Awful, in it's current state. I have had Humvees, infantry and even Bradley's just look blankly at a target (a technical usually) and just let it kill them. Just now I was in the second mission, and an entire squad of infantry just blankly stared at a technical (they had ammo and could easily kill it) as it ran through a wall and killed all of them.I also absolutely HATE the new direct control camera, I can't really get good vision in it, but that's my problem.Do not buy until these are fixed.Edit: It's been an entire year and this problem *still* hasn't been fixed. Still not recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my 3rd and final revision to my review for the game Call to Arms. I first reviewed it fairly early in its development (July 31st 2015) and then again, a year later, after a few anticipated updates came out. (August 16th 2016) As it stands now, the “hot topic” is the games decision to go Free 2 Play whilst introducing numerous micro-transaction based add-ons. This has no bearing on my final assessment towards the game. I will admit that I am not crazy about these new developments, I do agree that going Free 2 Play was almost necessary at this point. It has an extremely small player base, and as someone who exclusively plays online only this became a major issue; not the only issue, but a significant one. The game is rather dull. I find it uninspiring, unimaginative, repetitive, and generally lackluster all the way around. It is lacking. Two Major factions, neither very impressive or thought out, units that seemingly only differ in name, maps that are lackluster and overly cluttered in a nonsensical fashion. Sound effects that are more annoying then immersive; the list just goes on and on. Bottom line is it just doesn’t offer much. In some areas quantity is lacking and in other areas (most) quality is lacking. No one plays the game. As stated above the player base is extremely small, even with sales of up to 80% the game has failed to gain traction. If you play single player this won’t really effect you in any way but it killed the online community. Some may say going F2P will remedy this issue, I personally think the game is lacking too much in other departments to merit popularity but only time will tell. As the game is now free, try it for yourself, my opinion is just that, an opinion.			"

You essentially use your teams and the environment to gain an advantage on your adversary and destroy them before they do the same to you.  I've only played a single skirmish so far, but I had a ton of fun!  This seems to be exactly what I've been looking for in a thinking man's strategy game.  Definitely recommend so far!			"

Early Access Review
								(3/27/17) Edit: Recently bought the game, before this edit I still recommended the game as a free version. Now that I bought it I still recommend it.This game is like Men of War Assault Squad 2 but is even more fps like.There are only 10 missions only for the US faction and most of those missions suck/are boring, the capture objectives type missions are basically non-existant which to me was the best part of MOWAS2.  The coolest thing about this game is that it has an enhanced 3rd/1st person camera that was featured in the tank battle map of MOWAS2 but alot of people here think that is the worst thing about the game. I think it is cool, you can play the game like an early 2000's fps (sort of).The stupid unlock system for units where you have to play over like 1000 games seems to be in Call to Arms too which is bad. I would say it is worth $30 bucks if you get all the dlc for free (which this company loves dlc). I'm pretty sure I and other players who play this casually will get over 100 - 200 hours in this easily. I wouldn't shell out $60 bucks for this though, only buy it on sale for the price everyone else paid for it ($30 bucks).Will continue to edit throughout time.			"

								The game itself looks quite professionally done, high quality sounds etc but the simple fact that you have to buy a season pass in an RTS game, that it has loot boxes IN AN RTS game is just wrong. The devs have gotten greedy and for it, they don't deserve the loyalty that so many fans of MoW:AS show them.			"

								First and foremost... Let me say that, dont listen to the amount of reviews. While writing this, the Recent/Overall Reviews are both ""Mixed"". Main reason is, idiots that bought the game went and whined. Because of this little idiotic outburst from kids who doesnt understand the term ""review"", the game is hardly populated.Download the game, Play couple of matches against A.I. then against players, and make an actual review.I have to say... I was personally about to skip this game from tests because of the ""Mixed"" reviews...Now to the actual review...The game is surprisingly good for an Early Access Game... The F2P version of the game only includes MultiplayerSkirmish (VS.A.I.), Tutorial (Which is really nothing else than 1v1 against an A.I.) and thats it... But its enough for me from EAG thats F2P. The full game consist of again Campaign, Coop, some ""faction unlocks"" (i dont know) and access to Workshop (Tho I think theres a way to bypass this... Dunno). 30€ to get these unlocked is not worth it currently... So this list is pretty much ""Pros/Cons"" compressed.The A.I is really random, and the unit movement and coding is a bit ""oh for ♥♥♥♥s sakes.."" kind of coding.With ""random A.I."", I mean A.I. that doesnt seem to play logically or strategically at all. They seem to spawn units in a pretty simple order and move them randomly to points where they are surely gonna get annihilated. Or they cap a point and defend it by just standing there for no reason, making it easy for you to just rush in from the sides. They flank themselves (As in, they leave the point, go around the point to their side of the compound, and re-enter from their side) which usually gets most of them killed by my Marksmen or Sniper ambushers... Any armored vehicle is easy to break by literally just rushing it from 2 sides at the same time (Works most of the times), then take cover on the vehicle itself and throw some nades inside and hit the deck.A.I. difficulty doesn't seem to be ""Extreme"" when set to. Its more like Hard with extra-bit of resources.Playing against players should be something you should do after getting to know with the basics. Youre probably gonna get ravaged couple of times, but just ask some tips and they should give you some (as long as theyre not some asian or russian idiots)And thats pretty much it... The game is something you should play and learn if youve been a fan of MoW's. At first it might feel like its a full reskin of the game, but bear with it.			"

								Same type of deal as Men of War, a highly granular RTS with a lot of robust mechanics and features.Difference here is that it's set in modern times and features some improvements. Tanks get tracked on terrain if you aren't careful, direct control works more like a TPS rather than a isometric shooter now, ammo management is entirely different, amongst some other changes mostly minor QoL stiff.A lot of negative reviews due to the devs halfway through the development cycle creating a season pass for DLC. Devs made it explicitly clear there would be no DLC released while the game was still in early access, and that everybody who bought the game was going to get all the factions for multiplayer, but people like to be outraged about nothing I guess.I recommend the game when it releases if you enjoyed any of the Men of War games.

								I've tried many of the MoW type games and not really enjoyed them. So far this is proving an exception.A big factor for me is the ability to include AI players in multiplayer games, essentially giving me the singleplayer skirmish mode I so longed for in the other Men of War type games. The sounds and graphics are way more polished than what I had seen from the other titles but in some ways this only draws more attention to the clunky old animations left over from the older games.I absolutely love this game's take on the Men of War direct control system. The version in this game is much more intuitive and immersive, though it only affects vehicles right now. It is to be hoped that these changes make their way to the control of infantry as well.As someone who hates playing things online, I profoundly resent the levelling system which does not allow you to use more advanced units until you've reached a certain level that, as I understand it, requires ranked online play. It should be possible to use all units if you're not playing online.			"

								Call to arms revisited. So having sunk a ton of hours into the multiplayer of call to arms and being a huge fan of the men of war series in general I will try to explain my experience. While the game is clearly not done as most of unit discriptions still say squad1,squad2 ect. the game is a little confusing as you are really unaware of what units are good , and what they do exactly. the game balance needs some work and arguebly the GRM are the best faction. Having better units means nothing to experienced players when overwelming firepower is the asnswer to almost all your porrblems. The pricing is my main arrguement it just costs too much for the usa to really compete and countless times I have swarmed or been swarmed by sheer numbers. The counter is play really good, better then your opponent. which isn't really fun. One mistake can find you behind on the buys and next thing you know vehicles are in play and you don't have any AT. but this goes for both factions. Veterans of men of war will find it's basicly the same old game. However those players ususally suck, and wont take the time to see the differrences in tactics and gameplay. War has changed, the importance of position is everything and finding the perfect flanking cover is the key to not watching your men get gunned down immediately. It's like all the inf have mg 42s and moving around is easier said then done. The new direct control feature is flipping terrible, and ai pathing really needs work. but these things are being slowly addressed and fixed. I recommend this game, if only to kill you one time in multiplayer because the community is split between god like players and the worst players on earth. This game is something different it's not men of war with new skins, its men of war with a modern theme. People give them♥♥♥♥♥♥for using the same game engine as mowas2 but at least it's not the same maps same units, it's unique and fun in it's own right. So buy this game, maybe not now but in the future, when it's more complete. You might hate it but jsut remember you suck and getting better takes time. See you on the battlefield ♥♥♥♥♥es.			"

								Over the past fews months this has been in early access, some have critized this game as being essentially ""Men of War: Assault Squad: Modern Assault Mod: The Game."" I can see where that comes from, but I don't see it being the case. I just feel I should lend some thoughts on the game so far.The ModYes, it certainly does look like the Modern Assault mod for Assault Squad 2. However, it is simply not a mod. Go here if you want to see it for yourself: 


Modern Assault 
A Workshop Item for Men of War: Assault Squad 2
By: Vora_bat

			Modern modification (ex modern pack) for Assault Squad 2. Current development status: FROZEN Size: 700 mb Includes: - 2 single player missions - 9 refactored multiplayer maps - 2 multiplayer factions (USA vs Russia) - A...		


 There are plenty of vehicle, weapon, and soldier assets made for the mod, but they are just not the quality you will get out of a dedicated studio. The maps and some assets are repurposed, so eastern and western European structures appear in a modern setting more often than not. Not to say that architure doesn't exist in present day. You could say that is just the theater of war for a specific battle, but a mix of original and recycled models, assets, and such can you only get you so far. Digitalmindsoft takes the great concept and presents it in full force. The mod's development is also frozen, so don't expect more content and improvements out of it any time soon.The GameThis is a game, therefore it includes things you would expect of a game. All of the assets are professionally modelled, recorded, and maintained. A full-fledged modern campaign is in the works. It has dedicated servers, courtesy of SteamWorks. It will be featuring a secret-services themed DLC, which will be available to those who purchase the game in its early-access state, free of charge. That, on top of game engine, interface, and mechanics improvements. So on and so forth. In terms of unit count, you can expect that of Men of War games: plenty of diverse units, weapons, vehicles, equipment, and, in this case, weapon accessories. So, flashlights, lasers, silencers, and the like. You also make use of a nightvision view for when the map cycles to night. You can also host local games against AI, which was sorely lacking in previous games. That is a plus from me.SummaryDigitalmindsoft is going out on a little limb here in publishing this game themselves, but I think they have faired well so far. They have been consistent, responsive, and rather frequent with their Dev Updates. Their 14th Dev Update was March 11th, and they have made great strides in asking the community what we want next (what vehicles, modes, etc.), implementing new graphic technologies, improving multiplayer competitivness (in terms of gamemodes, I don't care for the leveling system), releasing the missions of the campaign for testing for those who purchased the Deluxe Edition, and all around keeping us informed as to where our money is going in this critical time for the game. There has been controversy over things like the 3rd person control mode, bullet damage models, and the like, but it all seems to be leading to the betterment of the game.Truely, with games these days often having a retail cost of $60 (RTS, FPS, etc), its, previously $20 price, now $25 price is still rather generous, if I do say so myself. And, I don't know about you, but I have always wanted a modern version of Men of War, and it grants that wish pretty well. Last time I checked (5 months ago), there wasn't a very high multiplayer population, but maybe that is because it is still in early access. That is not too detrimental for me, because you can now host local lobbies with AI, which is a good time, and I primarily play these games for the campaign. Still, some may not take very kindly to this. Nonetheless, It still maintains that unique Men of War RTS DNA, and I just think this game deserves a bit more love from the community.			"

								Having great hopes for this game, I am a big fan of the MOW games, and this game is in the same style and feel, except the units are modern compared to the WW2 units in the MOW games, it is a fresh breeze amongst all the WW2 titles out there. a modern strategy game in the same spirit certainly have it's place, unfortunately there isn't much content yet to make it interesting to play for any longer time. but since the game is under developement more content will be added eventually. at the current state, it is not worth the full price in my opinion, but if you can get it on sale then go for it. because when the games is finnished you will be sorry you didn't buy it that day when the price was redicilously cheap. if you like the MOW games, you will like this game, just be prepared to wait until more content are added. when I first bought this game I was a bit disapointed I must say, what? is this all? it was really only one map to play at the time, more things is added and the games gets smoother to play each time they update something, I want to see a single player campaign as well as more skimrish modes, the same way the MOV games was. then this game is really going to kick♥♥♥♥♥ you can have fun playing the skimrish charts in the mean time. there is also some player made maps to download if you get bored.

								It's a great advance on the Men of War: AS2 platform.An RTS with an acceptable level of first person shooter options. Fantastic models and diversity in the unit roster.The engine is a little clumsy and the AI is pretty poor. This game still has huge potential and I hope they can take it further. It's already come an impressive distance from the early access it began with a couple of years ago. I'd love to see a fleshed out Coalition force eg. ISAF involved countries. Also I understand that helicopters and other air assets are on the way. Very excitingThe campaign as of this review is a little bit short for the price tag. Only a few of the battle so far allow you to flex any real strategic might and the others are small story driven events with only a handful or one lone soldier.Good game 7.5/10 "

								(Purchased full version)Overall this game is promising and really fun. I really like the editor, which was hard to navigate at first, but thanks to a few youtube videos became much easier. This is the kind of RTS I wish all games had and I really like the ability to take command of any unit on the battle field and go into the third and first person controls. The campain is still in development and both the voice acting and grammer need some polishing. I am really looking forward to the new factions comming out and really hope they continue to add new units and structures to be used in the editor.			"

								I bought this game during the recent steam sale, I cannot believe how cheap it was. Under 7$ for one of the best rts games I have ever played, admittedly it is missing some polish, and could use other factions/more units. Even that said, I would have paid full price if I heard of it sooner.Tactically very sound and graphically very pretty(Though has some stutter issues). This game is a micro managers wet dream. The ai in this game is a real challenge as well. Playing the Co-Op gamemode evacuation can come down to just a few soldiers, causing you to micro manage your medics and have your riflemen improvise and pick up other units weapons to use against them.Thats right, in this game every soldier has an inventory, not every UNIT, but every individual soldier. This allows you to go as far as to pick up spare rounds, bandages and grenades, you can also manage the inventory of vehicles. You can split these units up how you see fit, garrisoning them in seperate buildings to create firing arc's etc. Controlling units individually is also a thing, simply hold control and you are in for some serious gameplay. Use every truck, tank, and individual to the fullest by firing manually on targets, this allows precise firing on various buildings etc. Not to mention it is a huge breath of fresh air to see a unique feature like this added to rts games. A bit of action combat essentially adds another layer to the game, especially in multiplayer when some guy is precision sniping your vital mg's and medics.All in all the game is worth full price, and most I have run into from the steam sale would agree. Played for many hours yesterday and I am about to boot this up again! Defnitely worth a buy if you are a fan of tactical rts and teamwork.			"

								Playing this RTS is really fun and the ingame unit UI is similar to ""Men of War"" but there are still so many issues I have with this game. I've had this game since it was released on steam as a pre-alpha or whatever they call it and I had high hopes for this game but after many updates...1. The main menus is so cluttered that I almost always want to quit as soon as I open the game.2. Creating a local/online skirmish has so little options and is tucked away in the bottom left corner of the screen while the rest of the screen is cluttered with stuff... Literally I have to squint at my 32"" desktop screen to try and select the few options when setting up a game.3. You cant change the draw distance in game. This means that all you know is that there are some units over there but you have to scroll over to the area to see what it is. Not to mention that you can't change this in the settings...4. It has workshop support but is so hard to use and navigate to activate the mods that its not worth it. For some reason in the lastest version that I just played you have to go to settings and then click on the ""mods"" tab, then move the mods you want to activate from the deactivated list to activated list and hit accept...? Why can't it be at the top of the main menus like the other tabs? Why does it have to be hidden way back in the settings? Not to mention the settings button is hard to see because the main menus is so cluttered...Now Good things about the game:1. AI are smart and very fun to play against2. The cover system works and you can send units to take cover in buildings3. Everything is highly detailed!!4. The unit UI makes sense because it is exactly like 'Men of War'5. The campaign is fun. Not anything revolutionary but fun.In short, game play is your typical RTS and most RTSs are fun but if you hate cluttered UIs or main menus then gl hf dd.			"

								Up-dated review Jan/8/2016. Current build of the game is playable, however, In order to play any mods you need to revert to a previous version of the game. at this stage though it's very buggy but it is alpha still. It seems like Instinct has started listening to veteran players about issues in game which is awesome and the fact that IMO the best modder for this franchise is now on the dev team # SirHinkel this game could shape up to be pretty epic.Review in depth (this is still a work in progress game so I will write a final once it is finished)Gameplay: Single player is super fun, Missions are bugggy but playable some balance needs to happen still such as            insane rates of fire for bmp/bradley and fix the hit boxes on some of the aiming with direct control. The new direct control: is pretty buggy still IMO it's worse than the original, however, you can use your mouse wheel to zoom into a kind of 3rd person view and can literally snipe anything on the map making direct control aiming soo much easier. I still think that it should be optional to use both I know I would like the option to switch between the two for movement and for shooting ( the new system makes it tricky to position and fire on the move) AI behaviour and pathing: Much better than MOWAS2 however you better have your anti tank units on hold fire or they will waste their precious rockets againts infantry. The new grenade system is fun, it shows the arc of your throw. Some balance needs to happen and some realism issues are abound too. such as there are no infantry units at least in the US Army that uses smg's I was in the Infantry for 10 years. Stealth has never been a strong point in the game if this is going to be a thing I suggest making the mission specific units more accurate or powerful to negate the derpy AI behavior when attacking or moving. Vehicles still take the worst paths available such as driving over weapons or ammo boxes. Infantry still has horrible pathing but oh well. Inventory and ammo re-supply system: It's been dumbed down, but the new version isn't too bad the ammo for the weapon is actually in the weapon so the automatic re-supoply fills it up instead of putting individual rifle/MG ammo in your inventory. The Auto re-supply as had an overhaul and works a lot faster so you can get your precious elite units back on the line quicker. I miss the old system but this new one grew on me and I like it now too.Graphics: actually looks better and runs better than AS2. I run this game on a mid-range normal person computer so it's playable on medium settings or higher for textures without the extra sprinkle options. and to be honest I would rather be playing a video game then doing this new age VR stuff anyway. I'm sure when I get Oprah rich and can offord a 3000$ rig I will change my tune. Mod support: Currently broken and have to play on a previous version of the game so it's un-playable unless you revert.Multiplayer: Level lock and honestly I hate MP in strategy games unless it's a co-op mission so read other  reviews for in-depth MP aspects of this game. Overall: This game still has a lot of potential and good enough that I had to change my intial negative re-view to a positive.			"

I preordered giving my moneys for development of this game 1 and a half year ago, bought the deluxe edition and now i have to buy the season pass to gain access to all of the future features of the game..... really? this is not good! why should i give to these devs my moneys in future for the next game early access? looking at these bad policies that are make me feel being fooled to just have given my trust and support to these devs!I won't change my review on the game because the game is good but about current policies about: season pass-ultimate edition and deluxe edition early adopters i would give a huge NO! just because you fooled us devs!

								Call to Arms to an Modern RTS set in the middle east, made by the devs of the wonderful WW2 Men Of War RTS titles.I highly recomend this for men of war vets, and stratgey fans. Fast paced and crazy multiplayer with plenty of alluah akbars to be done as the GRM (They are pretty much a playable ISIS faction). Though as of writing this review the singeplayer is yet to be finished as well as some aspects of the multiplayer. So if you wanted to play his game for a singeplayer than you should wait untill its out, or buy the Deluxe Edition which as some playable yet still uncomplete singeplayer missons. But if your in for the multiplayer like me you will be exicted to know it is decently well balanced and a blast to play with wonderfully designed maps perfect for flanking and other avenues of attack if your stuck in a choke point. The maps are also nice to look at and great fun to use in the games editor which (though takes time to learn) alllows you to desgin your own missons and even maps. (Or just do what I do and have murica airstrike everything after a staged ambush). 8.5/10 would Allauh Akbar again.			"

								Very cool already! If you like Men of War then you certainly will like Call to Arms! Of course it's no finnished experience yet but already so much fun to play! It's in alpha, you know. There is a limited number of players in MP so far. But that will change after it's release. But I have to say it's kind of tough to play. I have the impression that the difficulty level got raised a notch. But it's really rewarding if you succeed because you move tactically and position your soldiers carefully.The graphics are really nice, too! I love the detail and overall look of the vehicles. And even the infantry looks cool. I already love Men of War AS2 and I will love this one, too!I have to admit, if they somehow bring the graphics of MoW:AS2 to the CtA level I would buy it again!CtA is a definite recommendation to buy.

								There is nothing differentiating this game from Men of War. Nothing at all besides Call to Arms being in modern times. Aspects of the UI are pulled directly from MoW, pictures and graphics are pulled right from Men of War as well. The cover system and game play are exactly like Men of War.These glaring problems can all be put down to it being an Early Access Game sure, but that still screams that the Devs are too lazy to make their own game.It's a good game, it's gameplay is simple to understand if you have played Men of War. The controls of vehicles are a little odd, but it has potential.Is it worth almost 30 dollars? No. A huge resounding NO! I'm glad I got this game during steam sale. Because it's worth the fraction of the full price I paid for it.Just go buy some of the Men of War games, they are actually playable, you can understand what's going on, and they are actually complete. Then when this game is complete, and those stolen elements are replaced with unique elements this game might be worth while to get.			"

								This is my first review and I must say I really really do love the game but you do get the occaisonal disconnects from servers and such. As for server population, it is usually quite low. There are always less than 300 people in game when I am on and sometimes it can take a while to find a game room to fill up. The game is decently optimized (though the graphics aren't super beautiful) and I'm able to run it at high/ultra settings with AA off at 1440p with an r7 360 at 40+ fps. The gameplay that i've been able to play has been fun and AI isn't horridly stupid so that's good (though sometimes they take the path right into the line of fire when there is another way behind cover). For a game in early access it has a decent amount of content and there are plenty of mods out there to make it more exciting such as more maps, ""tactical"" mode to make it a bit more challenging, etc. I'm excited to see what comes and I hope more people will play so servers are more populated! And I hope the devs will fix the occaisional crashes and disconnecting issues.			"

								Pretty good RTS game if you enjoy an immense amount of micro management. Graphically it is about as good as any other modern RTS on the market, that said, it runs very smoothly with only a few hiccups during MP (could be the host issues though). The MP is very fun although I am not very good at it. I am looking forward to the addition of vehicles and whatnot, but I  would like to know if there are plans to release other factions? Right now it is USA vs. GRM (ISIS?), I would like to see Russia, Britan, and the Bundeswehr.			"

								As some one who loves the devs behind the Men of War Games, this might sound Bias. So, to start the formula is the same in principle as the other MoW games, even in its Alpha state the game shows significant polish and refinment from the last iteration AS2.Guns now act as a sub invitory item holding a cache of ammo in the gun, rather than ammo stored loose on the unit.Vehicles how have a forced camera position, and while abit wonky for those of us familiare with the MoW games befor.

								I like the game all together its something different to the usual RTS games even thou it has most of the men of war placeholders and features it doesn't really matter like the devs already said alot of it is subject to change soon it will have its own style and features which is something i look forward to seeing. the gameplay is a little different for me because i'm use to the men of war gameplay normally all i hear is rifles going off and tigers and shermans killing each other now it fh scars and ak 47s going off humvees and BTRs firing and trying to see who blows up first. the only thing i wish to see is a better campiagn becuase the men of war campiagn was crap reskins of each other which was a major let down in this game i wish to see the USA have their own campiagn and the GRM have theirs. now one or maybe two more thing i need to say before i stop my babbling 1: to all the people who say its just a reskin of men of war catch yourself on because i bet you've only looked at the screenshots and judged it there and then without even trying it which is where i have the right to call you idiots yea sure it a little over price for a early access game and is still in alpha this that money that you spend on this game helps it grow and it also allows you to adapt and grow with it. 2: I'm in college and i've always had the dream to make a game like this since i first started playing games my first ever game that i played was battlefeild 1942 and i was 4 years old lol my dad couldn't figure out how to fly the planes but i could with just using the keys and the mouse lol and then i taught him how to fly the planes and then he told all his work friends how i did it and then all started flying the planes just like me lol but as i got older i discovered RTS games and became the greates commander that ever lived lol joke anyway i hope this game becomes bigger and better with more factions buildings maps ect... and one more thing i hope i get to work for Digitalmindsoft someday oh and to anyone who reads this sorry i couldn't shorten it with 21st century slang that all the kids use these days because i was brought up the old school way which is better lol. oh and one more thing the direct control 3rd person mode is a little different and unusual i know alot of people find it annoying and useless i find it to be intresting even thou it gets me killed half the time its kinda fun it gives off that kinda realistic feel.

								Right now it plays like Men of War... with BIGGER GUNSModern setting means infantry wields assault weaponry putting out a lot of fire and vehicles are all large caliber weapon platforms on wheels with different kind of shells, guided missiles and smoke launchers.Plus the recently added (and heavily WIP) Armored Warfare is a MP game mode that is all about controlling tanks, with infantry taking only a secondary role. Direct control was also improved for that - now you can control your vehicle almost through first person perspective, arcade-style, which is pretty fun.The one major downside is still there however - you need to grind levels to unlock the better stuff. And even then the way the game is currently balanced in usual game modes it's nearly impossible to see a tank, unless you actively idle for reinforcement points. But where's the fun in that?Overall however the progress devs have made with this game is quite promising.			"

								***Update***Just got Men of War: Assault Squad 2, and it's amazing!  Defenitely recommend getting that game until Call to Arms is finished!Call to Arms is also great, and has the potential to be even better than MoW: AS2, but as it stands now, the current maps and missions can only hold one's interest for so long.Both are great games, and both should be owned.  Great job by the creators of these games!*Original Post*Pros:The AI doesn't seem to magically know where your unspotted troops are, so It's possible to setup actual ambushes and flank enemy positions without them already having troops aimed in on you (unlike WarGame: Red Dragon, where the AI sends troops straight towards your Command Vehicles hidden way off in the coner of the largest maps in extremely dense forests).The combat is very close to realistic without being too realistic (ex: higher caliber weapons will take out enemies with one or two good hits.Distance and hit location affect the effectiveness of projectiles (ex: a bullet from 100m will do less damage than one from 10m, and one bullet in the leg will not kill an enemy).Uses RNG, so the weapons don't have pin point accuracy every time (ex: squads can sprint or crawl from cover to cover under enemy fire and possibly survive.Most units carry medkits and can heal themselves as long as they're not incapacitated.Each unit can be controlled individually for better placement.Being able to manually control a unit from 3rd person is great (vehicles can be controlled in 1st person too).Cons (most of which maybe resolved in the final release):Balancing.  GRM is definitely superior to the USA.Riflemen don't shoot at vehicles that should easily be penetrated by bullets like technicals.Riflemen don't shoot at manned turrets even though you can manually aim and kill the gunners.You can literally spawn 1 technical at the beginning of the round and take out 4 AI players with just that vehicle.  Spawn a small squad after that, and you can cap their base.In Annialation, spawn points and bases are too close to the main battlefield.  Most matches can be won very quickly by capping the enemy base after whiping out their first few squads.Battlefields should be larger to accomodate the use of the modern weapons, especially for the vehicles.Some of the current maps have too much crammed together in small areas (ex: the middle area of the airfield and military base have way too many objects placed closely together...no room to strategically place troops).Use of artillery seems pointless at this point as the maps are too small to use it effectively.Don't know if much can be changed about the AI, but it just send troops straight towards objectives rather than going from cover to cover; so you can easily mow them down as they charge accross the open towards the objectives (They do however utilize cover once they get to the objective).It can be tricky trying to place troops on upper levels of buildings.My thoughts:Even in Alpha, this game is amazing.  I can't imagine how much fun it'll be once it's finished.  I didn't have Men of War...just saw Call to Arms by chance on steam and started reading up on it.  I was an avid fan of COH and was hoping this would fill the void...and it has.  At only $30 for deluxe...CtA is definitely worth it.  Hell, I'd pay $60 for it!  Great game!I've fiddled around with the editor a little as I'd like to eventually create my own maps and missions, but it will take time to be able to do that.  I can see the replayability of this game being virtually endless.I'm assuming the Multiplayer lobby doesn't have many players at the time since it's still alpha but hopefully that'll change.Even while still under development, it's one of the best strategy games I've ever played.  It took me about 2 days to understand how to play.  In all honestly, both CtA and MoW: AS2 are a must have as they both cover completely different times very well.  However, if you can only get one of them now, I think MoW: Assault Squad 2 would be the better buy.After watching Pixel playing MoW: AS2 with his buds, I'll definitely be getting it...hope CtA progresses to be just as good.

								This is my Early Access review of the game so far: I absolutely love it! The units work well and I am excited to see what the future holds. Remember, this is an Early Access game and none of the content within it should be considered finished until the full release. I will say though, the content the game currently has is great and I would imagine it can only get better. If you are/were a fan of the Men of War series you won't be disappointed with the current state of the game. Enjoy!			"

								I recommend this game, its great fun, struggling with finding multiplayer servers here in Australia but I like to play the AI anyway.Buy it so that it advances faster. Make sure you buy the deluxe and download Sir Hinkels Campaigns fo SP fun.What can I say, the developers frequently update the game but it is totally playable and doesnt crash, they are just adding functionality weekly.A typical mission.Choose US start off with Marksmen to keep the enemy at bay. Kill enough enemy to get another squad, choose some US Assault team and storm the flag, move marksmen up to cover you from new enemy forces.Kill enough enemy to get another squad of Marksmen to assault another flag, try and get your assault squad to help them, get pinned down by enemy toyota with cannon on the back, pick some US support AT Troops, sneak up and blow up the Toyota, assault the flag, get another Marksment squad to cover you.What, enough points to get a Humvee, get humvee, take control by pressing Q and drive into enemy guns blazing, get blown up and die. Get another Hummer and hold back providing fire support, get another Marksmen squad over to flag 1 to support battled troops running low on ammo, kill enough to get another squad, Marines, hoohar. Storm the third flag with marines humvee and assault squad.Hold out...10/10 - would request the game adds ""hoohar"" button so I dont have to shout it every time I move them.			"

								I love the Men of War series. But so far this feels like a reskin through and through. There is much improvment over the Assault squad games, but it feels almost Identicle to AS2. And, Just like AS2, I am unable to reliably play the game. Both Call to arms and AS2 both crash randomly, lag out randomly, and outright freeze all the time. I get a billion notices that ""video quality has been reduced to improve performance"" while I play, if I even get through a game.  Crank it to Minimum...just as laggy, just as freezy, and have to close it out.However, I do see enough change in direction with the game mechanics to justify a new game. Hopefully it will become the best Men of war game yet. Or Perhaps this is a new series as the MOW moniker has been dropped.  Overall, I still recommend the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I really like this game, still there are some issues.+Realism+Cool Graphics+Extremely detailed maps,objects,people+Fun Multiplayer with a lot of mods (+CO-OP CAMPAIGN)+A huge variety of weapons, vehicles and troopers+Map Editor-The game is heavy (for your device)-AI is not really smart (not exactly your opponents the AI, but the soldiers themselves-Lack of animations (animation for steady-look around/interact with weapon etc.)-Lack of voice acting- the campaign advicer does not talk, only subtitles and the phrases that the soldiers use are really annoying and not many-A lot of glitches that can ruin you the game like:       -If a car with a mounted weapon (highly used vehicle) is empty and you want somebody just on the gun you need 3 soldiers-first enters and goes to the driver seat, second becomes the sergaent of the car and the third goes on the gun and then you mount off the 1st and the 2nd       -If you have a damaged vehicle which has no crew in it and you want to repair it-the vehicle moves by vibrating and slowly going on a random position, so if you put an e.g. engineer to repair it and he sits by the vehicle, he soon gets glitched in it's hitbox and killed by the vibration even if the vehicle is moving in other direction (shortly the vehicle kills the repear time very often)-There is melee fighting but it is extremely stupid. They have knives which are only for throwing and do nothing-There isn't enough information about the squads you are purchasing e.g. it says Defensive Squad, yeah but what does it do, what men does it contain? It really has one medic which is extremely important and I think a machine gunner with the rest being just normal soldiers. Now those issues seem little, but if you play the game you will see they will bug you out. I still recommend the game, I had real fun while playing it and really enjoyed the AI opponents in skirmish. If you have a friend to play with, I highly recommend to play the cooperative campaign as it is real fun.			"

								A good game. High potential. A bit laggy and have some bugs ofcourse. I don't recommend it for people who don't enjoy RTS modern warfares(And for those who have anger problems for bugs and lag). The game doesn't deserve the full price 'yet'. But definetly worth to buy at a discount. Developers are nice and respond your issues as soon as possible. They keep updating units. I don't think they will abandon this game at all. Modern day units. Armored vehicles, sodiers, aircrafts. You won't find another strategy game having this much units and all fully controllable. Air warfare actually is very good but since the maps are not that huge, you cannot apply the real speeds of the aircrafts and they seem a bit weird while flying. But as I said, no way you can apply those speeds in a strategy game having slow ground units.Same/Similiar engine as Men of War(MoW) series but improvements of graphics and ofcourse the direct control engine make this game a unique one. This will be an epic modern warfare strategy game once it is completed.Hope it helps. Buy it & enjoy!			"

								This game has a lot of potential, I see a lot of people complaining about the amount of content vs price, and what they dont understand is that buying into an Early Access game is effectively investing in the potential that the game has, and directly financially supporting the developers so that they can make it happen. I love the level of detail in this game already, and I'd love to see that expanded upon. At time of writing, there's not a massive amount of variety, but the building blocks are there for some really ground breaking gameplay that has been missing from the Military RTS for too long.			"

								Very good game, like MOWAS 2, but modern and more technology, plus a third person vehicle direct control, and with a mod I have, with infantry too, which will be implemented later in vanilla. As an early accsess game, it is awesome and with a lot of potential, however, there is a bug for me that the voices in campaign in the boxes (ex. the player), don't have sound, but the soldiers too.10/10 for me, you should buy this.Edit:I'm having a problem, I've played 8 unranked games, have gotten no exp, and I still can't play ranked matches, which it says you can after five UNRANKED games, please fix this bug, as i am stuck on lvl 1 with now exp, when I should be at least level 3 or 4			"

								Open Beta Review Update:The game now has a Free2Play option, but it requires grinding for units and lacks singleplayer.  In addition they have added microtransactions, as more and more developers are on Steam.  On one hand I see F2P being good for boosting a dwindling population, but doubt it will last for long.As a deluxe edition supporter I don't have to worry about grinding for units, and get a couple extra factions for free.Development has certainly not been fast by any means, but a lot of the changes since early access, til now, have been quite nice.  Including improved vehichle controls and camera, more units and vehicles, and just general improvements to the game.I look forward to features such as individual unit/squad control. However, I feel if the game doesn't see some growth/sales, features like this may get cut.Overall this company is struggling and it's blindingly obvious. The F2P release is designed to encourage those users to buy XP packs in game, instead of having to buy the entire game.			"

								First off I'm very disappointed so far with this game. However for the right price I will buy any MOW game and 8 dollars for the deluxe edition is a fair price. So why am I disappointed? Well, it's mostly due to the fact its MOW AS 2 and 1... in a modern tone. Think Red Rising but lower quality. That's the thing about Call to Arms it feels like a very good mod for AS. Expect the game deals with stupid AI issues the biggest one is vehicles will often engage units with either extreme force or none at all. Often I have lost a Bradley simply due to the dumb thing not attacking the technical with an SPG on it as it fires point blank at it. That or the Bradley will fire everything it has at the thing. Its almost insane how something that feels so mod like doesn't have a semi competent AI for a MOW game. (Note I have not tried online matches so this may just be a single player issue). That brings me to the next part the single player missions are boring after one play through and there are tons of small issues. (One which is very minor but is in black hawk down the pilot isn't a pilot he's a desc/units/etc...) Why is it that a modding community can do so much better at making a modern MOW with AS 2 then a company being paid?Now the good of the game.If the AI decides to be responsive then the fire fights are quite entertaining. Visuals and models are also nice to look at (Red Rising looks better but still a positive)Game hasn't crashed yetnew direct command is kinda cool but would prefer to be able to switch to old camera (checking what I damaged only to need to realign my shot gets very annoying)Still in Early Acess (Might be positive?)Overall Great game to get on the cheaps, If you own AS 2 just play Red Rising its overall a better experience currently but could change depending on how they continue with the game "

								This game is fun really only for RTS fans. I play many RTS games and I've played almost every game in the Men of War series. This game reminds me of Men of War, more specifically Vietnam with its lacking content but over all fun to play. The game is pretty much a reskin of Assault Sqad 2 and it doesnt hide that very well. Its a solid 5.5/10 for me, take it or leave it, good weekend time killer and multiplayer is decent but not of AS2 quality. Buy on Sale if you have the chance otherwise, wait until the game progresses and take another look.			"

								25$ is a bit much, so pick it up when its ont sale.Other than that this is a really fun game. I hate Most strategy games because they feel like you aren't a high expirienced player, playing against other just as good players. they just feel like a resource race to see who can build their army faster.Call To Arms is different in the sence that instead of just sending units in and hoping you placed them in the right spots for the fight. You can take controll of an individual, and aim/move/fire leaving you feeling like you are actually made a difference in the firefight.Playing 3v3 with some freinds and each game was around 40-60 mins. and alot of it was pretty fun.The controls are kinda iffy tough. Its really fun to take aim and shoot, but its pretty hard to do anything else with them.Tanks are really well balanced. They can dominate the game but one well placed rocket scores you tons of points takes them out pretty easy.			"

Overall if you love the Man of War Series, keep his game in mind until its full release. Its definatly a mutch better conversion, has more spirit from Man of War and is technically more up to date than Battle of Empires ( wich also has his charme).(PS before smack: please ignore the lame playtime that is showed here, cause Steam dont counts it in offline mode )			"

								In a nutshell: ARMA III meets Company of Heroes 2 behind the Men of War Engine..... get ready to Lock N'Load. First and foremost, I purchased the Deluxe Edition and as such get the goods that come with it. It is free to play with the minimal gaming experience devoid of extra factions and customization. I have no problem with this as I like the developer and I like the game; thus I bought it. To all those butthurt individuals out there, they obviously didn'r read what is in the F2P version.I really enjoy this game not only becuase of the credibility of the Men of War franchise but also becuase Call to Arms brings the game time-period 21st century. That being said, if you have played Men of War then you are fully aware of what this game is and what it can be. If you are new to the Men or War franchise as I was when I purchased it, then you need to be ready for a potentially punishing (yet tremendously satisfying) learning curve regarding weapon ranges and their potential to devastate both armoured and soft targets. The name of the game is find cover and fire and maneuver ladies and gentlemen; if you don't get this concept then learn it quick! Overall, great game and I highly recommend it to any person that has a love for RTS and realistic gameplay.			"

								This game is a modern day men of war you can say and its 10/10 it doesnt feel the same cuz the new engine its on it feels a bit better and the gameplay is smooth it runs so good it doesnt crash as much as it would in mowas 2 if you have mods in and they frequently update after update they put so much effort and they listen to what you guys want and ever since i heard it was coming to ealry acess i got it from then it made big steps like adding in tanks to adding new maps, also its not a as2 reskin the explosions are better effects are better the whole ui is nothing like the old games i recomend this game to all rts players and people that are fans of the men of war series.

								I had really high hopes for this game. Belive me when I say, I wanted this game to be a sucess. I wanted to love it, hell I paid the full price for the delux version when this game was a concept. That way before this was even in steam. I think I paid like 60USD or something. Why? because I loved MoW and wanted to support the devs as they tired to make a new game.However, this game has been nothing more than a dissapointment. And it doesn't seem to get any better by the day. I've given up hope on it. Looking at the direction they are headed lately (F2P, P2W...) I think they are focusing on the wrong stuff.Also, this is the one and only negative review I've ever written on Steam (I own a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of titles). That should say something.			"

Early Access Review
								I won't go into great detail with this one, I'll try summarize my opinion, if this review is vague please scroll down or up for a better more detailed review, currently I'll give this game as much effort as I see fit to warn the masses of it's issues.Graphics - The Graphics are just fine in my opinion, but then again I run the game on the lowest settings because if you experience any sort of frame rate drop the game automatically lowers the graphical settings to the point where if you're playing at 100% maxed out settings you can go so low as to have 1% lowest settings. Irregardless the graphics also seem to be fairly taxing for a simplistic type of game, when it comes to the other MoW games I own I usually only experience frame rate drops when I'm in the midst of an entire town exploding due to artillery and rockets soaring all over knocking buildings and blocks of structures down.Gameplay - This one is gonna be pretty broad so bare with me, The game play at it's core is like any other MoW title, heck it reminds me a lot of MoW Assault Squad 2, which is a good thing considering that's probably the best MoW game (At least in my opinion.) but here's where things get complicated, it reminds me at it's core of the good ol Assault Squad 2 game, but it plays differently enough that it's noticable, and not the good kind of noticeable. When you try to manually control a vehicle you may as well kiss your FPS goodbye as you'll be giving up your standard view for a third person view, to be expected, but you'll have an absolutely hideous hud that looks like it was ripped from the Abrams Tank's internal view from Battlefield 3, there's a huge disgusting sight with bright green bars all over making it rather impossible to even see what you're looking at, in addition you're locked in behind the unit camera wise, you HAVE to play the manual control like this, it's atrocious and it hurts to do it so I just use vehicles by telling them to fire on specific spots and hoping the AI can do it since I can't. As for infantry I believe they're mostly untouched but in all honesty I barely even think to use infantry since they auto aim and kill everything in seconds usually so why bother. Besides the third person manual control aim looking garbage the gameplay itself feels... unfinished (obviously) but even more so for a game that's in early access, this game has been in early access for a year or two now at least and it's made... ""progress"" and it just feels like gameplay isn't the main focus though I know it is, reading the patches they've turned the game around at least partially but the game itself is still pretty bare bones and not very entertaining, the worst part probably in my opinion is the sound design.Sound Design - Yup this was bound to happen, so the sounds ""for the most part"" sound okay, if you're not used to actual gun sounds some of these will sound fine to you, but if you're a hardcore gun fanatic (which I am not) you'd notice there are distinctly♥♥♥♥♥♥sounds for AKs, M4s etc. Vehicles sound ""okay"" I just wish the American's APCs didn't sound like they were powered by the same Jet Engine the Abrams has. Moreover the voices are absolutely garbage, they literally ported the U.S. voices from any of the MoW games over to this, and can someone inform these clearly not American devs that Americans don't shout ""FOR THE MOTHERLAND!"" as their battle cry, it's a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and insulting. And can you guys actually get a real American English speaking voice actor for this, because whoever that guy is you can practically hear his accent breaking as he tries to keep in American.Units:Vehicles - Well I'll hand it to them, they put two different types of Abrams tanks in the game, kudos for that, but the real issue is, to get even one, is gonna cost you an arm, a leg and about half your brain in in game resource points, you'll have barely enough to call two more squads of infantry. Also can someone explain to me why a T-60 can knock out an Abrams from the front? cause I'm almost certain that's viably impossible to do from any angle. Other than that there is so major imbalances between vehicles for instance a humvee with an M60 feels a lot more like a pickup truck than the pickup truck feels with it's PKM. In addition no aircraft, unsurprisingly, all those screenshots you may have seen?, yeah those are just part of the background don't get hyped you can't use a blackhawk to drop airborne to my knowledge. Infantry and support teams - Machine gun team? what's that? cause it's not in this game. Yeah were you expecting some burly American with an M60 or maybe a .50 cal tri pod on either side?, no?, just me then. Infantry come in a couple of flavors: Common infantry like riflemen in the U.S. Army, Pre Elite infantry like the U.S. marines, and scummy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t way too powerful needs to be nerfed camo'd invisi super accurate invulnerable infantry aka the terrorist Assassin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. AT troops consist of about 3-4 standard riflemen and one guy with the AT rocket launcher, either RPG or AT4, now for some weird reason the AT4 is only a one shot one use rocket which means once the U.S. AT guy is out of his launchers he's down to being infantry, and no you can't rearm these guys with trucks, you can resupply ammo from trucks so long as they aren't explosives, oh but he's something handy if you get an APC it comes chock full of AT4s, at least three of em for the U.S. so if you want more rockets for the AT guy, either go kill him off and get another AT Squad or waste all of your resources on a useless APC to get three more. And don't get me started on the types of tanks and how A modern era main battle tank can be taken out by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand cranked turreted Russian hunk of♥♥♥♥♥♥like a T 60.Lastly the game's playerbase! - Where is it!?, where is everyone?, am I the only one here?, yeah it's barebones no one plays this online as they shouldn't, the game isn't great, it's no wonder no one bothers to play it, it's a hassle to play the damn thing and to find someone competent who wants to play to the end is very rare.Last last thing, yes yes it's got a single player mode, you can click the misleading ""online"" session and throw bots into a match like most everyone does so that they can at least play a full game. Oh and the campaign is misleading what it means is a nigh impossible single mission which teases you to the possiblity of two or three more missions behind it but when you need to manually fire using that horrible hud in third person, yeah no don't even bother it's a pain physically to play. Summary : Not worth it currently, it's updates every now and then and in huge patches which is good, but right this second the game just has so many problems with it.			"

								i play men of war alot. i think the initive that the ai take depending on the enemy and situation was amazing. betwwen men of war and company of heroes its hard to pick the best game.  now moving on to this game. i tried so hard to have high hopes, i tried so hard to ignore bad reviews and enjoy the game. here is the problem. the game is broken. the enemy ai are either a. overpowered or b. stay at they spawn point with an absurb amount of vehicles. the vehicles are practically useless. an abrams tank should not die by an armored car with a 20 mm auto cannon.  the direct control feature is pointless. your charcter either attempts to walk backwards on fail to aim at all resulting in your swift death.Prosmodern setting.modern weapons.freeCons:every single thingbuggy aiun responsive ai teammates and enemiesoverpowered enemy aiai in generalforget single playeryeah basically everything is wrong. The verdict? skip this game. save yourself the trouble and stick to men of war trust me on that.now now if you are one of those but i like modern vehicles and i like a realistic setting i got great news for youhere are 3 modern rts games done rightWorld in conflict: i cant stress how great this game is.company of heroes with the modern combat mod. oh whats that? never heard of it? ok well picture company of heroes literally reskinned with modern units and vehicles.and wargame for those who like to massive managenow on a side note. this game has so so much great potential but it falls shorti recommend dropping the fps direct control and stick with the overhead view.more urban environmentsmore vehicles weapons and unitsrewrite the whole ai........ just use men of war and reskin it with modern units for godsake. Do us all a favor. "

How cheap can you be? And there was alot of annoyements with AI, as usual.Vehicles not shooting towards the enemy unless micromanaged, and they get confused between targets and just go back and forthfirst person has in vehicles been CHANGED, not IMPROVED.As in when those times you actually want the old MoW style, seeing from above, but steering as it would be first person, you cant. Its super annoyingIts cheap game, so... Its up to each one to determine if its worth it, but... I was just dissapointed.			"

Now, we have to pay an additional $16.99 for DLC to an Early Release game.... and $27.99 for a seasons pass... to an early release game that we bought ages ago.So ask yourself... do you want to pay $$$ to a developer that seemingly rewards their ""early adopters"" by charging us more $$$ for DLC to a game that is STILL early release?

Red Rising was made modification from workshop was made way earlier than this game.Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t season passes...

First of all if you like tactical rts games - this is the real thing :) Just got to give this a positve review! I don't do this often - but I think most of the recent negative reviews are not legit. (I usually don't support any kind of dlc crap or f2p or even pay to win!)  The fact that it is f2p now is great! It means much more players on the servers and a growing playerbase - everybody can try the games multiplayer for free.	 Which brings players to mp, is a nice demo and even solidarity! I own the fullversion and paid for it two weeks before the change to f2p. I don't regret it! I can use the workshop, the games editor and can access the singleplayer and multiplayer. Market seems fine - no pay2win here. All in all the EA is well done, maybe lags some content and has its flaws but even without new ui, sandbags :/ more nations and stuff it feels great and the final version will easily be the best title of the Series when it comes to solid gameplay :)As an old school gamer who played every mow and related title I must say it is the best quality gameplay running on the engine. I modded a lot back in the days, therefore I must admit development goes slow (should be 1.0 allready^^) but for a small indi dev. its ok to be late if the quality of the product is fine.( And no there are no AS2 mods that well coded with hd models (not ripped off from other games!) Pathfinding for example is a mess (vets remember the suicide blitz^^) even in AS2, its much better in CTA and will hopefully be flawless in the final version. Same for balancing. So nothing to worry I will even buy the DLC to keep'em going...Good Job DMS!CheersTo the latest bad reviews from players with play times like a few hrs what is up with you guys - honestly? --> complaints about empty servers but against f2p !!!--> ""I paid - so I want my money back! - 'cause it is f2p now"" (just a hint try reading dev notes! It can help!) --> without even understanding the f2p model or the market system you are complaining about --> and finally all this while swallowing real scammy business models from the major publishers...❥ :steamhappy:			"

								""FREE VERSIONWe think you should try before you buy! Grab the game for free and play multiplayer matches or skirmishes versus bots. Furthermore, you can unlock all multiplayer units in the free version via the progression system. In case you want to enjoy singleplayer or Workshop content, then you can upgrade your game to full version any time!""well for me this is a great way to do EA, Early Access is and always was a chance but also an opportunity for developers to show what they can do but also recieve some cash input while they progress through a given game, now like this given users a free chance to test and play for me you get the best of both worlds, but maybe some then won't go on and pay, as we all like stuff for free, so how it will develop into a full paid game only time will tell, for me i'm not sure still of online as i don't like them and when i say them, i mean online in general, so normally stick to single player versions, which isn't part of the free version in this, so maybe i should have read up more before download 10gb, so my mistake, but must admit i like the format and layout, the UI and drop straight in and it all works, and is easy to pick up makes me feel that this will and should do well, but yes there's already a loaded market in this type i know, and maybe this doesn't add in anything new, well that i don't know, as like i said, it's not my sort of game either, but would i recommend it, well yes i would as for free what have you got to lose really? yes gets my vote and a thanks developers and i wish you luck, if you ever do my sort of wargame, i'd buy it and support you any day with this sort of work and format...

								Regardless of the F2P, I like this gameIt's a RTS game combined with TPS. Units can either be controlled like any other RTS or controlled directly. When vehicles are under direct control, it feels like playing the modern World of Tanks, and the UI is pretty well developed, at least for me. As for the infantry direct control mode, it seems that the game cannot run smoothly but perhaps that's because my desktop is not powerful enough.For the upcoming updates, hope the new factions can be added asap and devs really need to hurry. This game has been at the Early Access stage for ages.			"

Early Access Review
								Once again, the GJW's (Gamer Justice Warriors) are out in force trying to tank a good game by flooding it with negative reviews based on one business decision, and mentioning nothing of the game itself.  This always happens when developers make some decision that players disagree with, and in this case the GJW's are even further off-base than usual.First, I have to address the thing that all of the negative reviews are harping on: no, they did not rip anybody off by suddenly going F2P.  Just stop.  The play options in the free version of CtA are adequately limited.  Most F2P models are so much worse.  Just be glad it isn't like CoH2 where you have to spend about $1000 to have all of the factions and leaders.   But more importantly, this is a good RTS with original concepts, and the developers deserve to be supported for making it.   You don't have to buy it in EA, but any fan of RTS or military games owes it to themselves to at least check out the free version.  If you see yourself playing it for 100 hours or more, pick it up on a sale.  Like now.  With the current drought of good and original RTS games, RTS fans need to support games like this.  I liked Grey Goo, but I want to see new things in the genre.  I doubt very many people are going to play hundreds of hours on the free version without ever wanting to play co-op, single player, or user-created content.  But if they want to, so be it.  You still have everything you paid for.  Just be glad they're trying to bring more people into a dying genre.  For that purpose, it's actually a great model.  I'm willing to pay $20 for the full experience because I love single-player RTS.  Not to mention, because I believe in supporting developers who make games I enjoy.  But I have no problem with F2P models that work, and I could see this model being very successful for an RTS multi-player game.  Would DOTA and LoL be as big without F2P?   I should mention I am aware of the MoW series, so I know that CtA is not a completely new and original thing.  But MoW is how old now?  It's time for an update, and there aren't a lot of developers making a serious effort in the RTS arena.  Even fewer are offering an RTS with direct unit control and seamless transitions from birds-eye to 3rd, and all the way into 1st person camera.  There area a couple of games doing similar things, but none of them are pulling it off in a mil-sim setting like CtA.  The modern mil-sim aspect is something I really appreciate.  Nothing against fantasy or medieval settings, but we don't get a lot of strategy games with a grown-up, realistic feel.  In CtA, the men are proportional to their surroundings, and all of their actions have detailed and specific animations.  For example, when a soldier is bandaging himself, he looks like he's bandaging himself.  When he's taking cover, he looks like he's taking cover.  Etc, etc.  They use weapons and vehicles that are authentic to their real-life counterparts.  Overall it's a very cohesive and authentic look, just needs a bit of polishing.  Another knock against the game I've seen is that it's a ""dumbed down"" version of MoW.  I don't think that's the case at all.  It may appear that way because it's still in EA, but the unit controls are still plenty deep.  To be honest, I thought the controls in MoW were far more complex than they needed to be, and not very intuitive.  It was the biggest barrier keeping me from playing them more.  The controls in CtA are much more streamlined and intuitive.  I was actually able to jump into a skirmish and play without having to consult the keybindings for 10 minutes.  Granted, I still had to check them in order to be effective, but they are much more digestible.  Caveat emptor, I will say the game still feels like an Early Access game.  But... it is, so I won't thumb it down for that.  There is some work to be done with optimization and generally polishing things up, but the core gameplay is there and it's fun.  I have been starving for something like this, and CtA is doing a great job of scratching a very particular itch.  I usually tend to write too much, so I'll try to cut it off here.  Bottom line: any fan of RTS or military games owes it to themselves to at least check out the free version.  If you have any interest in these games, I'm confident you won't be disappointed.  If you don't like the game, you can let us know why in your negative review.  I can understand dogpiling on somebody like UBISOFT for some of the stuff they do, but the GJW's are out of line this time.  This game deserves some love from the RTS community, in the form of upward thumbs and units sold.  The fact that it has ""Mixed"" reviews right now is a mark of shame on all of us!  Shame!  Shame!  Shame!  Shame!			"

								I've played Call to Arms for a short time, I know it's not enough to make a fair judgement of a game that is actually a mod to Men of War:Vietnam, I found this out when one of the soldiers yelled out ""For Uncle Sam!"" That's the same line in Men of War:Vietnam. I could have easily played the real Men of War game than this, but this game does come with a nice look for a game and it's not at all bad, it's impressive for a mod that's for sure, only wish that everyone else could see it. Though, most of the reviews were people who've most likely not even played Men of War, this is a good alternative to it at best. Seeing as the game plays just like Men of War if not better with a First Person mode when controlling a soldier, easily switch from third person to first, though it's a little...clunky. The soldier doesn't happen to fire about half the time when you fire, sprinting is jagged as well.Now, the game is fun, yes, but it still has some things to fix, which is what you can expect from an Early Access game. I'm sure it will be fully fleshed out once it's fully complete.			"

I wouldnt mind it at all if there was any sort of tutorial implemented but there isnt. If  you go for this game without giving a cent, for now at least, you end up with a game that only has the ""custom game"" option, no tutorial, no way to actually learn how it works, what all those units do, specialise in...etcetc.Edit: ive been told by the devs that there actually is a tutorial in the ""extra"" tab ...Ill check this out and maybe change my review taking this into consideration.

								Don't know enough about this yet to make a decision?Its a top down styled rts which has features a akin to that of games like Commandos 3. Variable camera angles and the ability to take command of your soldier individually or a vehicles and correct its aim for better accuracy in exchange for a loss of perspective on the larger scale battle. This is where Command and Conquer meets Commandos with a squirt of Company of Heroes. If you like games like ARMA 3 and Company of Heros this is the hybrid for you. It literally feels like you were to put Commandos' character contol into the engine of Company of Heroes within the evironment of the Arma 3 RHS mod. Some of the more intimate character commands are a but tricky and less responsive than to be desired but for it's current state ad an easrly access feature it has enough controlability and content, not to mention the already growing Workshot Content, to warrant several hours worth of addictive gameplay per session. As someone completely new to the franchise, this is a refreshing game with a unique mili-sim / sector control / conquest / survival cornerstone to its foundation. Worth the money to pay for it in its current state. As mentioned there are bugs and some frustrating mechanics for individual unit functions but we can only hope they will be smoothened out. == pro's & cons ==My biggest con about the game  is that this may not be for friends who live far apart to play together. When I was uploading to my youtube channel whilst playing this my entire lobby suffered lag that would cause the game to stop momentarily, quite often, when my ping surpassed 350ms. When not uploading and having enough free bandwidth to keep my ping below 80ms there were no issues. I havent tested any further ranges of ping between.My biggest pro woul dbe that to play this with your friends is one of the most interesting and engaging games to participate in as a team. Roles can be given or you can just play it your own way. Theres are so many playstyle possibilites for this. You can choose to just control a small group of specialists and leave the rest of the companies within your force to be managed by your team mates or you can choose to have a little bit of everything. Do you prefer to play the sniper elite or the vehicle company or do you want to play them all?I reccommend this game, for its target audience; which would be people who want a milisim / rts  or as close as they can get to it.

								Its more than a modern men of war and shows so much more potential to be a great game, Having much fun and the maps aren't bad either The Dam is a particular favourite reminds me of C&C Generals. The textures are great and craters actually look realistic though in some parts a bit to clean needs a bit more of a weathered look that I expect will be perfected as the game progresses. I bought the deluxe edition can't be happier I'm going by the logic you get what you pay for that's how much of an optimist I am, yes the AI is a little dumb, but its first days of early access its expected. Its your choice but I don't reccomend listening to the negative comments I dare say they put negative comments on everything, if you want a finished game wait till it's finished.EDIT.			"

								Get it if you're a fan of the MoW games and always wanted a modern era game from the MoW series, it's still in early access but I haven't encountered a single crash or a bug that made the game unplayable.The biggest issues I found with the game was the AI and its pathfinding, sometimes enemy or friendly AI will get stuck in places or completely stop moving their vehicles mid-game, but nothing too bad as the vehicles could still fire at anything that moved into their range.The current units look pretty good with a lot of detail, both infantry and vehicles, animations are a bit lacking and could use more polish, but again, it's an early access title, saying that doesn't mean much since everything still needs polish.Hopefully through out the development the game will lose more and more of the MoW look, like the UI and voice lines are straight from the MoW series so the game still gives a sort of feeling that it's just a modern era mod for the MoW games instead of being a full game of its own.if you're interested in the game, then get it, it'll help the developers finish it properly, too many early access games are being abandoned by devs these days, but at least these guys are ready to go through with it, they interact with the community, answer questions on the forums and even made me reconsider my opinion of the game as my previous review was negative.

And from what i have tried there is no quick map select. so i cant click on a point off the map and go there i have to drag the mouse over and by that point my men are dead. after more time with the game my opnion has not improved. my units die even with supior cover. when they make contact they just stand in the open insted of moving to the cover i sent them to. and even if healing the units it does nothing. throwing graneds is pointless because your guy sprits out of cover to do it. given this is early access it has time to improve.

								Ever since this game has been advertised, I considered it a very likely purchase. I enjoy the MofW series myself, and thought that a modern version would be interesting. Nothing beats a classic humvee ambush ! :PI definitely recommend this game to those who like excellent strategy and a refreshing take on modern military RTS.			"

								If you like to MICROMANAGE EVERYTHING in a whole battle then this game is for you, if you like intelligent soldiers who can take orders without running directly into enemy fire , all on a single line, then this game is probably not for you.crashes a LOT in current beta.			"

								Get it if you're a fan of the MoW games and always wanted a modern era game from the MoW series, it's still in early access but I haven't encountered a single crash or a bug that made the game unplayable.The biggest issues I found with the game was the AI and its pathfinding, sometimes enemy or friendly AI will get stuck in places or completely stop moving their vehicles mid-game, but nothing too bad as the vehicles could still fire at anything that moved into their range.The current units look pretty good with a lot of detail, both infantry and vehicles, animations are a bit lacking and could use more polish, but again, it's an early access title, saying that doesn't mean much since everything still needs polish.Hopefully through out the development the game will lose more and more of the MoW look, like the UI and voice lines are straight from the MoW series so the game still gives a sort of feeling that it's just a modern era mod for the MoW games instead of being a full game of its own.if you're interested in the game, then get it, it'll help the developers finish it properly, too many early access games are being abandoned by devs these days, but at least these guys are ready to go through with it, they interact with the community, answer questions on the forums and even made me reconsider my opinion of the game as my previous review was negative.

								not saying the game is bad, i just think there are better startgey games out there. I dislike the fact that i cant click on a group of soliders and send them somewhere. insted it only selects one solider. the layout for new units isint the great either. and your units just die way to quickly. And from what i have tried there is no quick map select. so i cant click on a point off the map and go there i have to drag the mouse over and by that point my men are dead. after more time with the game my opnion has not improved. my units die even with supior cover. when they make contact they just stand in the open insted of moving to the cover i sent them to. and even if healing the units it does nothing. throwing graneds is pointless because your guy sprits out of cover to do it. given this is early access it has time to improve.

								For being in early access, this game is great. The previous bugs of vehicle combat, not being able to look up when in direct control of a vehicle, and various other issues have been resolved. So far there is a full roster of infantry units with multiple light vehicles and two medium vehicles, an IFV and a ""medium tank"" per faction. Even though the selection is small, as is to be expected, everything is well balanced. So far i havent found a glitch, big or small. Cover works well. AI seems greatly improved over MOWAS, never played AS2. Instead of having to rearm each unit with specific ammo types, units near ammo crates automatically refill their small arms ammo. I do not think that grenades refill, but im pretty sure that RPG and other forms of AT rounds do. Will test this theory. Also most AFV's have the ability to resupply infantry ammo and most come with three AT rockets which is nice. There are a couple really good player created missions, namely SirHinkels. His missions were very well polished, challenging but balanced, and exceptionally fun to play. All in all, I'd say that this game is definitely worth getting, and should be on everyones radar.			"

Early Access Review
								Dispite the fact i own all the MoW titles, soldiers and most of the outhergames these guys have produced in the past i was a little put off bythe large amount of neg reviews in the community hub. most of theso-called early acess games i have tryed in the past have been blatentmoney grabs. I have followed the development and have now installedthe free multiplayer function. I do see progress being made, slow, butprogress none the less. This alone puts it far ahead of the ""outher"" early acess games, most of them anyway. A couple of things however that stop me paying full price right now are1. Reports that you have to P 2 W now the multiplayer is free.2. I have acess to very little actual content so it is hard to formulate an informed opinion regarding content, present and future.3. the progress is very slow, only 2 factions, limited units for those factions and a limited amount of maps.4. You have to buy ""gold edition"" to get the single player op's.5. changes to the ""direct conrtol"" feature that did NOT need changingfrom MoW AS2.Now here is what i do like.1. the same great gameplay on a well known game engine.2. The units that are there work well, Vehicles work well, MOSTLY.An abrams getting stuck on a light pole or tiny rock is amusing forthe FIRST TIME ONLY.3. So far (for me) these guys are a ""trusted"" company.4. The game modes for the most part work well andco-op missions are smoother as you actually get the units you orderinstead of being randomly spawned to ANY player on your team.5. Dev's that are active in the game and the forums is not onlya good thing but quite rare these days.In summary, I DO like this game. If it were finished i would pay the full price,that being said there are NO guarentees that it will ever be finished.I love the intensity in combat, As a former member of the ADF I appreciate the way ranged weapons work and the few indirect fire weapons seem to workproperly too. many games either nerf them to useless or make them wayyyyto op. Auto grenade launchers ARE really that good. AT weapons work ok when theunit remembers they have them.....From what i can see most of the issues are to be expected of an early acess gameso it is unfair to list the multitude of bugs in-game right now as faults in the gameas i am sure they will be resolved eventually. That last word... Eventually is the mainreason i will NOT pay full price right now. Whats next, early acess hamburgers? would you order a burger and pay for it months before you want it or need it, How about a car? I think letting people play multi for free is a smart move, the game will fail without a strong playerbase this is why i think it costs too much for what you get right now.Also the early acess dev's that came before you have not helped, Early acess has come  to mean ""cash grab"" for many.I am going to give a tentative recommend for this game, based on pedigree mainlyand the small but solid content i see so far.

								Well to start, everyone looking at this should be aware that it is in an alpha, problems will occur. However, I have only ran into 1 so far: an invincible enemy soldier.  Pros - Is probably one of the few if not the only modern strategy game where the only strategy isn't to make fourty of every unit and just throw it all at the enemy's base. You must use caution and use your units wisely.- Kind of goes with the above statement. Armored units are not abundant, you cannot throw armor at the enemy like in ""World in Conflict"" and hope you win. With that being said, World in Conflict is still a very good game.- Ammo: In the original Men of War and Assault Squad 1, you had to drag ammo to each individual soldier, this gets tiresome when you have an entire army to re-arm. In Call to Arms, soldiers are automatically rearmed when close to an ammo box, no more pointless dragging.- Realistic units and weapons: Has many up to date firearms and vehicles. Should please gun nuts and vehicle gurus alike.Cons- Currently limited in terms of actual gameplay, only 4 SP missions currently, and a few more MP maps. but it is still in alpha so it's not that big of deal.- Audio: Currently uses Men of War's voices and weapon audio (cant say for all weapons). Again, hopefully this will be changed in the beta or final release.- Bugs: have only ran into 1 bug (invincible enemy) not that big of deal but I did have to restart the map.- Workshop- currently a lot of the workshop content is unusable as they need to be updated, but that can change at any moment.To finish, it is a great game for a person wanting a modern strategy game that doesn't involve spamming 30,000 tanks and attacking the enemy. You will need to strategize. Also, GET THE DELUXE VERSION, save yourself $5.00 and just get the deluxe to begin with. I would strongly recommend this game to my friends.			"

								Now forgive me for not playing any of the MOW games.But, this game does have it's potential of becoming a really good and fun one.I understand this game lacks content which it does and the ranking system is totally bad, i.e you gain units to use as soon as you level up to a respective level.One more issue is about the lag, I'm running a 960 and I experience FPS lag sooo much while playing any MP mode level.Why I reccommend this you ask?Well, this game does have it pros and its cons, but after some work It can be a really fun game.So before getting this game, give it sometime to work it out, but the choice to get it is upto you.

								Same good old Men of War, but set in modern day themePros:Great graphicsThey finally made the camera look where your turret is aiming (Vehicle ""Direct control"")Better animationsCons:The game is in Alpha state and crashes regularlyNot much tech (yet): 3 Tanks, a few APC's and carsOptimisation isnt good, i can run most of recent games on High-Max settings with a smooth stable 60fps, but here i get fps drops and stutters, but keeping in mind that its Alpha, it will probably get fixed closer to releaseThe game looks good so far, but at its current state, its too early to buy it, i would recomend to wait till the release			"

								The game is great so far and I feel it was worth the $32.99 CAD that I paid for the deluxe edition but that doesn't mean that there are no bugs or anything that can be fixed for instance I'm not saying this is a bug but the infantry seem to be almost bullet proof an example of this would be that if you spawn a humvee .50 cal. you can unload an entire magazine on a squad of infantry and they take little to no damage now I don't know if this is intenional or just something that wasn't noticed but if you look at MoW AS2 (another great game) that doesn't seem to be a problem at all, that is all for now but if i find anything more I will update.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun RTS experience that won't be botherd by minor things such as this 10/10			"

								I really wanted to like this game, but I sadly cannot recommend it at this point. 3/10Don't let the screenshots fool you, it's essentially a modded version of MOW: Assault Squad, updating it from WWII to modern day. While that may sound cool, you can already do this... with mods.. that don't cost $20. (Remeber when Steam tried to charge for Workshop items?)It's also in extreme early access, so all you can do is play small infantry battles with crappy AI, or try your luck at matchmaking (which crashes the game half the time). I'm sure this will improve with time.I've been following the developer blogs for a few months, and while they do have great 'plans' for the future, I'm not convinced it's enough to open my wallet for.

								Why these guys decided to change the mechanics compared to MOWAS2 is beyond me. The modern concept is great, but the problem is their idea of the new mechanics are just terrible because it turns the game into a 3rd person game with applying strategy instead of maintaining a RTS style like the previous. I cannot recommend because it is nothing like the originals which in my opinion are the best of the series because of their simple mechanics and dynamic game play. So DONT NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RTS BECAUSE YOU WONT FIND THAT HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE THE 3RD PERSON STYLE STRATEGY GAME!			"

								Well I don't know what happened to my first review for this game but whatever.So where to begin. Lets start with the F2P thing as people currently don't understand it. The F2P version only incudes multiplayer, not the campaign nor does it work with mods, if you pay for the game you get all of this and the fact that you know you are supporting the developers create this already amazing game.Next, onto the new update. There have been lots of new and cool features added into the game. Now you are able to play as the infantry in 3rd person which is really fun and I enjoy it alot. The also upgraded the textures and graphics from what I can tell. It also runs smoother now, I mean it ran smooth before but now there is now problems whatsoever.Now the season pass, I myself have not purchased the deluxe edition nor the season pass but I do plan to. Basically the deluxe edition gives you early access to stuff while in the beta as well as some items to show that you own the deluxe edition. And the season pass, the Devs have confirmed that they will not be releasing DLC during early access, however once the game is finished they plan on releasing new campaigns such as a Russian and German campaign as DLC. It is much like what Rainbow Six Siege did, if you purchase the Season Pass you will recieve betas for the new DLC as well as the fully finished DLC early. Not a bad deal if you ask me.And finally the game itself, graphically the game looks really well done. The UI looks really cool and it feels like a modern version of MoW: AS2's UI. And with the recent update the textures as I said before have all be upgraded. Soundwise the game is pretty good, the music is really well done and the weapon fire sound like their realife counterparts. Now for the real question, ""How does the game itself play out?"". Well the answer to that is simple, it is much like MoW: AS2. It is very obvious that this is a modern version of MoW: AS2 which I really like. All is all the gameplay is very fun and well done. Congrats to the devs for making this game as great as it is.Final Rating: 9/10My main reason for not giving it 10/10 is because of a current lack of content but hat can be expected with a game in early access. Once more content is added in I will update the review. I highly recommend this game.			"

								came back to rewrite this, i been playing the crap out of this after initially being disspointed. i had to remind myself that this is in fact early access, so the lack of content is no longer surprising. the combat is hard but rewarding. using actual tactics like support by fire, flanking, bounding etc actually leads to victory. so lets do pros and consPros:- attention to detail is pretty neat. in the real world US army support units (aviation, transport, etc) often still get issued m16a4's while front line grunts will have m4's. this holds true in call to arms. - using tactics leads to victory. support by fire, flanking, bounding etc. actually help you win. you dont just simply send in all your troops onto the X and let it play out. - the games seem fairly balanced most of the time- gameplay is just flatout fun- the market place already has content, so it shows the potential for a good community Cons: - for some this might be a con so i will list it, not using tactics will lead to your demise. if you dont want to micro manage your units then this game is not for you. if you dont, you will probably loose a lot. - its early access and thus it still lacks content. no vehicles in at the moment so its strictly infantry combat- no singleplayer campaign, just MP pvp. you do have the option to enable bots though so you can setup singleplayer matches in a multiplayer environment.

Early Access Review
								An interesting take on Men of War, there are a lot of great new features, and a couple of controversial ones. It's still pretty early in development and thus fairly rough around the edges, but this is an established company with a proven track record; Not some sketchy indie dev. For better or worse, the game WILL reach a completed state at some point. Gameplay wise, if you're familiar with Men of War, it's more of the same, though not quite a straight reskin. Infantry combat is faster and more micro intensive, troop numbers are considerably lower, and the Special Unit category is entirely missing(Which has it's own pros and cons, most notably it's impact on the pacing of multiplayer, especially in 1v1). Overall, despite some of it's more glaring downsides(Namely unlock progression, a gimmick forced in to the series at Assault Squad 2 and carried over despite loads of outcry, as you've probably read from a sea of negative reviews by now.), I can't help but recommend it. It's Men of War in a new setting, a refreshing break from the constant shilling of WW2 that most war-themed games seem comfortable to graze in endlessly.Pros:-UI improvements-Better take on direct control for vehicles.-New setting allows for more creativity and diversity.-Fairly tight and balanced. Could easily become competitive if nurtured properly by the developer.-Various 'quality of life' improvements over Assault Squad.-Combat is more than just a reskin. Has an entirely different feel to unit behaviour.-Vehicles are extremely satisfying to use, and come with new quirks and weapons unique to the time frame.-More interesting campaign missions(That are playable in coop)-Reshuffling of unit hierarchy. No more cheap autocannon spam.-No more Brandenburgers(This is a selling point all of it's own. Seriously DMS, those things are beyond broken in AS2)-No more Brandenburgers 2: Electric Boogaloo. No seriously, ♥♥♥♥ these things.Cons:-Unlock Progression. Terrible, utterly terrible post-2007 gimmick shoe-horned into every multiplayer game in existence. Has absolutely no place in an RTS and will 100% kill the matchmaking if it's mandatory for ranked play like in AS2. Forces everyone to play lobby matches to turn it off in Assault Squad.-Currently no option to turn off Unlock Progression even in lobby matches. Forces everyone to grind like some Korean MMO or Call of Duty. Seriously, no one wants this, DMS.-As with all RTS games, Barrier to entry is high if you don't have the patience and humility to learn and tank a few losses early on. Lack of a tutorial of any sort exacerbates the issue, with Unlock Progression being a cheesy means to slap a bandaid on the issue by restricting what units you can buy.-Units have no descriptions, but have their specification stats filled out. How hard is it to take an hour to type in 2-3 sentences per unit briefly explaining what they are/what they do? Especially after taking the trouble to fill out their stats. Buying units is guesswork when you're first learning, unlocks or no, just to find out what equipment they carry. I recommend starting a solo match in test mode.-Still a heavy work in progress. Don't come in expecting a finished product needing a few tweaks here and there. It's got a long way to go before it catches up to it's precessors in content, and with only two factions, it's going to need a MUCH larger unit roster.Even with all it's problems, I've had a positive experience. As it exists now, however, I'd only recommend it for RTS or Men of War enthusiasts. It's got a long way to go before it properly competes with others of the franchise, let alone the genre.			"

								If you love the mow series you should give call to arms a try,though single player and vehicles are not yet available you can still takem for a test run using SirHinkels mod in multiplayer,though the game is lacking some spit and polish as of yet it gives you a good feeling as to what the finished product will be and i had fun fighting a modern war game for a change(i confess i missed my Tiger while fighting off those darn t80's).Waiting for the finished product may be a good idea unless your really into this type of game but so far so great and it will only get better,in my humble opinion of course.UPDATE After all the updates and polish this game is definitely a must get and the mods are really good,its worth the price for SirHinkels mod alone!

								Although buggy,since in beta,I really suggest this game.Pros:The Modern Era introduces two factions,GRM and USA. With Workshop,people prepare for more factions soon. The amount of editing the creators have done in order to create this is impressive,with new AI,animations,vehicles,and more. Also,I have begun using helicopters. Those REALLY Need work however. Both factions have had alot of work for texturizing and making it feel modern instead of a ww2 reskin. I have not experienced any crashes in game.Cons:Only one con,which is really picky-ish. A few buildings are not texturized.			"

								This game is very amazing. I will not lie. it took me a few days to get it to work, but it was worth it. People may call it a clone of Men of War, but its not exactly. It is in its way a unique game. The problem in this game is that getting it to run is complicated. I had to look up old forums and stuff to figure it out. I will leave a small how to get this game to run in the review. This game needs alot of work to become great, but i can see it becoming a great game on steam. Just know as soon as you download the game will be a pain in your♥♥♥♥♥and say no untill you get it what it wants. So now ill do my best to explain how i got it going, I don't take credit for the methode, because i looked up how to on the forums. this is just to save you time if your even reading the reviews. 1. Check you computer in update center for any OPTIONAL updates. I emphasize this because the materials required to get the game are not considered essential updates.  Download the ones that say somthing like (redist.x64) or (redist.x86) NOTE THAT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE UPDATE NOT THE WHOLE NAME so you may have to do some reading.2. Once you have done that, you must go to your computer files go through this path (It may not be exact as mine if you have moved files around)    Files / C drive or OS (C:) / program files / steam / steam apps/ common / Call to Arms / _common redist / vcredist / 2015 / vc_redist.x64.exe or the other one vc_redist.x84.exerun the vc_redist ones as admin to make it workIt may also tell you if you tried to start the game through files and not steam that you are missing a file calledapi-ms-crt-string-1l-1-0.dll   or   api-ms-crt-convert-1l-1-0.dll    or   api-ms-crt-runtime-1l-1-0.dllI had to download the first 2 from a website called opendll.comyou just need to enter the missing file into search and then add download at the end. It will not be at the top but be somewhere on the first page of the search list. I would leave a link, but it woudn't let me enter in the review for whatever reason.At this point you MAY have to extract it (I didn't for some reason) I don't think you have too so it is if you are able to or not. When done extracting or not extracting at all, simply drag the file into your Call to Arms folder. It should work. If it does not you can look up the forums and find a better answer. I just wanted to help anywone so that way you don't have as much struggle as I did. Hope it does end up helpful.			"

Early Access Review
								Alright, lets do this boys. Where do I begin?I wish I learnt my lesson before supporting Digitalmindsoft by purchasing the Early Access. See, they also developed a game called Men of War: Assault Zone 2 and ripped off everyone who supported them from the Early Access to Release to Deluxe Edition to Complete Edition to Remaster. This time its worse.At first the game was announced to be Pay 2 Play, but a year or so later it changed to Free 2 Play. One can imagine, that anyone who was only interested in multiplayer was disappointed because not only did they dish out 30$ for a free game, but the game plays and is bad. If that wasnt enough any and all negative critisism was dealt with a wave of forum and in-game chat bans. Just wow.We could speculate whether it was studio's financial situation due to bad reputation or changes that were made in contrast what the community was looking for.Do not support bad marketing and developing practices. If we all as gamers say no to such kind of behaivour, then we will have better games in the future, instead of yearly releases of reskinned garbage like Call To Arms is.#boycottdigitalmindsoftFood for thought: http://imgur.com/a/zNQXVEdit: 27th of March 2017Wanted to make sure I wasnt being unjust in my reviews on the game and base them off of personal experiences when dealing with DMS.Sadly the game still wasn't what was initially advertised - a next level RTS experience with direct control set in the modern day. Game played even worse than some mods for AS2.THE GOOD:* NoneTHE BAD:* Aesthetics were unfinished and unpolished (everything on ultra)* Animations were glitchy and unfinished* Gameplay was glitchy, choppy and unfinished* Models were unfinished and unpolished* Sounds werent finished either, but the gameplay and aesthetics were so bad that I ignored the sounds* RTS Mode turned the game into a sub-par RTS game and with the FPS gimmick its a sub-par FPS game - making it all and all a sub-par game.You want modern FPS? Get Arma III.You want modern RTS? Get JTF - Joint Task Force.There probably is a long list of games that are superior to this, but those are the first that come to mind.Do note this:/*Why Early Access?“Early Access is a fantastic opportunity for us as an indie developer. We believe, that our players will provide the most valuable feedback that we can collect.”and later they addedHow are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“What matters to us is that you are enjoying the game. Needless to say, that feedback is the most valuable tool to improve our game. We have an open ear to the needs of our community and we are eager to craft an extraordinary game. Even if you may end up with a game that is not perfectly tailored to your needs, you will still have a wide range of modding tools available to forge your very own experience.”*/Well no♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sherlock. With Unity, Unreal Engine 4, Lumbermill or countless of other game engines I could forge my very own game and make sure competent people were handling the community instead of buying this game. Again, EA backers paid for direct control and other features, not FPS and 4k Textures. This game is long forgotten by the time 4k becomes a norm. Why spend backer money to develop useless gimmicks and future proofing instead of improving the core gameplay, matcmaking, ai, etc? Oh its because its the easiest way to bill new customers for a triple a title without actually doing any work.PS! Yet to confirm whether the ""FPS DIRECT CONROL"" was just an implementation of ""IRON FIST DLC"". Still no clue why legacy direct control was removed, even though EA backers backed the project for that reason.PPS! For those who would like to see how the game was initially advertised (2015) as and why it got the backing from the AS2 community:

								Analysis in EnglishCall to Arms Is a revolution in strategy games?In part, the game offers big differences with other titles (COH, etc), offers a system of interesting toppings, a variety of acceptable vehicles and modes of interesting games.I like strategy games, is it advisable to buy this game?By the time No, it lacks a lot of content to keep up with the competition, so far only if you want a slow game, and somewhat aburrido.La slowness with which it develops the game is huge, to make a point even if you have two jeeps escuaron ATT 1 (with missile launchers) can stop you all the offense, I think when air units (Little Birds for example) are included will be a very interesting game.Why did you buy the base game and the deluxe edition?I admit pirate game, opens played about 15 HS and only to see a version of date thereof and fall in love, is an addictive game and Steam Workshop (which gives you much more content) and buy the deluxe edition just to support developers because I have many expectations in the game.This is a summary analysis, the game has potential, I recommend you to wait before making the purchase as it lacks a long way, but all you have now, is better than some other games ""Full""I have so many ideas for the game, if the developers are interested can talk with me with Steam-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Analisis en Español¿Es Call to Arms una revolucion en los juegos de estrategia?En parte el juego ofrece grandes diferencias con otros titulos (COH,Etc), ofrece un sistema de coberturas interesante, una variedad de vehiculos aceptables y unos modos de juegos interesantes.Me gustan los juegos de estrategia, ¿Es recomendable comprar este juego?Por el momento No, le falta mucho contenido como para estar a la altura de la competencia, por el momento solo si buscas un juego Lento, y un tanto aburrido.La lentitud con la que se desarrolla el juego es enorme, para tomar un punto, aunque tengas 2 jeeps con 1 escuaron de ATT (Con lanzamisiles) te pueden parar toda la ofensiva, creo que cuando se incluyan unidades aereas (Little Birds por ejemplo) va a ser un juego muy interesante.¿Porque compraste el juego base y la deluxe edition?Admito que piratee el juego, abre jugado unas 15 HS y tan solo con ver una version desactualizada del mismo ya me enamoro, es un juego adictivo y con steam Workshop (que le da mucho mas contenido) y compre la deluxe edition solo para apoyar a los desarrolladores porque tengo muchas espectativas en el juego.Ese es un analisis muy resumido, el juego tiene potencial, recomiendo que esperes antes de hacer la compra ya que le falta un largo camino, pero por todo lo que tiene ahora, es mejor que algunos otros juegos ""Completos""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

								So i got this game durring the sale, and it still wasn't worth it. I can run the majority of RTS games on the maximum graphical settings, but this just killed my PC i was getting about 20 FPS on minimal settings. The controls were as you'd expect but when it came to controling any unit; it felt like trying to control a disobedient elephant. i'm having this refunded as there are better RTS i could be spending my money on. And yes i understand that this is in alpha status and will be worked on but as of currently i'm not willing to put my faith in it.			"

								Men Of War, NO! This game is the new revolutonary version of what has been created before! This game is in our modern era, where the USA Army is fighting the ISIS, into a new set of a units and tanks, maps and graphics, the lag might be a problem that everyone encounters, but that's no problem! Think that this game is in Early Alpha and it's this amazing.And for those who bought the game and then it got free, check out how many players play Call To Arms now! You will see a major number in the players that are in matches and in rooms, you will see a big player base when you will join the game, you will love to play multiplayer with a bigger number of players, that's why, this game is Amazing! Men Of War, not all people can buy it. It might be 5 euros, but not all of us are having them.So with all respect to the players who read this review, if i said something wrong correct me in the comments section.			"

								I would wait for a sale and get the game. If you like Company of Heros then you will ike this game. Remember that this game is still in beta so there will be issues. The biggest drawback is that there isn't really a tutorial and you're just expected to know what to do. If you just let your units defend themselves then you will always lose so you better take direct control of some units so that you can strategically take out targets. Its pretty fun for the price but would like to see a more friendly UI.			"

								Call to Arms is a very good stgrategy game. With a good mix of fast-paced action, calculated tactics, and a high level of detail and customization, you'll be absorbed into it right away.The only problems I've encountered so far is that my game recently began to not start up. It will act like Steam is launching it, but then that window goes away and the game's status goes rapidly from ""Running"" to ""Syncing"" and then quickly goes away. Also, on the second mission for the USA, I can't pick up the intel after I kill the tribal leader. Please help!Improvements I'd like to see:*Farther zoom-out function, maybe a tactical map (a bird's eye view of the entire map)*The ability to toggle whether soldiers will stay in place, but run from a grenade then go back to where they were*Rechargeable support options (i.e., artillery, airstrike, care package, paratroopers)*Airial units*Field guns (i.e., artillery guns that you have to spawn and then manuever into place, rather than off-screen support artillery)*Errectible fortifications (i.e., sandbags, roadblocks, barbed wire, etc. can be removed by engineers or destroyed)*Anti-Tank/Vehicle mines (can be set/removed be engineers)*Anti-Personel Mines (can't be seen by enemy, but can be found and removed by ""minesweeping"", an ability of engineers)*C4 (or other remote-detonation explosives, can be removed/set by engineers)*Better accessiblity of buildings and their rooftops*Medic units (units that give an automatic health recharge effect to soldiers near them and are able to revive fallen soldiers)			"

								I've changed my opinon on this game somewhat.It's still an overpriced Men of War spinoff,  and I still hold firm that DIgitalmindsoft has no idea what they're doing when it comes to implementing features nobody asked for.  A marketplace economy for smileys is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.That being said the quality of the models is pretty good,  the sound is OK, spare for bad voiceovers that are from the original Men of War game from like 2007.. The direct control function is very cool,  it's always been in the MOW franchise but they took lenghths to improve it,  the way the game works means that the direct control function isnt that great,  but if you're familiar with MOW and how it used to be,  it's a big improvementall that aside though, I cannot reccomend this game as it's a very aquired taste,  and DMS has a horrible track record with me.

								If they can sell it for 20-30 dollars it worthy of a critique.Whilst this game defiently has potential I cant help but wonder if it will be ruined.  In men of war assault squad 2 at the time of this review, the game is incredibly laggy in multiplayer if anyone has a bad PC, there are OOS (kicks one player or sometimes just ends the entire game) and some outdated tank/infantry models.  At this time I believe that they will never fix the probeloms and that any atempts to speek out about it will be banned/removed immediately.  I would say wait 2-5 months after this game's FINAL realese to get it.			"

								Aside from the whole free to play thing, I don't really mind it.I do mind the lack of effort in some of the gameplay mechanics. They're talking about creating new factions and the like when they haven't even finished the current two factions.The AI is also much dumber than it is in the game this game is obviously a player made modification turned stand alone game. Most of the maps are quite unfinished and some of the items that appear to be used as cover for your soldiers don't even work. I get they want to balance things, but making the player's soldiers have the awareness of a potato doesn't make sense. You have to order your soldiers to kill each individual enemy for them to even make an attempt to kill them. Otherwise the AI will walk pass your soldiers who are behind cover and easily kill them like they're shooting non moving targets.			"

								Decent foundation for a potentially good game. Lacking in polished content right now, but still a fun experience as is.The reviews surrounding the F2P version are almost entirely from toxic individuals who don't even understand how it works conceptually--which is as a limited version of the multiplayer only. To decry that is ridiculous as it's only a measure to strengthen the multiplayer userbase. Full game content is still locked behind paying for the full game.			"

								If Call to arms was a Kebab sandwich (paid 5€ for the game), that's what the negative review you got for this game would look like- There is meat inside and killing animals is very bad- The bread is made of cereals and killing cereals is very bad- You can eat it only from one side, how stupid is that- You have to pay to eat- There are strange smiling people that takes your money before giving you the sandwich- You can not always sit down- It's open 24/7 so it's probably illegalI could go on forever, if you don't understand why the game is bad you are a wise one because it's not bad at all. It's not a copy paste so what's wrong?The more i play the more i feel those negative reviews comes from competitors because it's total non sense. DMS is LISTENING and ANSWERING to whatever message you post. Plus, the communication during early access was excellent (see news) and deadline are respected (read the early access stamp). In order to enhance the player base, DMS took a radical decision by turning the game into F2P (a limited version compared to paid one), didn't know how to receive that but in the end i don't see negative point. We'll see when it's out.So yeah, go ahead, downvote the review and go very far from this game. The community is great and we don't need angry people around. I'll keep playing this mostly negative game and i don't care. Your review means nothing, no arguments just salty people who probably bought no man's sky.For the rest, join us, you'll keep coming back to enjoy the modern theme warfare, a unique engine for a unique game.

								I'm not usually a person that writes review, but I thought a should with this one. It's not very detailed, but oh well.... :PI have been waiting for Call To Ams for a few months now, and it certainly delivers. Many will tell you 'It's just Men Of War'. But it's not. Just because it is an RTS, and I will admit that some things are similer, but who cares?There a few bugs, but what can you expect? It was only publicly reliesed yesterday! :)Also: you can blow some ISIS dudes up with a .5010/10			"

If If there are soldiers into the container when he was found, then the enemy will fire to him rather than detours and shot .

								i just bought this game yesterday on the sale for 5€. and i went and played some skirmishes pve, and thought to myself why i bought this. but then i tried some multiplayer pvp, and i got to understand the game mechanics a little bit more, and the possibilities this game has. and i can't say i regret spending the 5€ one bit.pros:-a lot more in depth strategy game than you'd inititally think-the direct unit controll brings a whole other level of tactical gameplay to it. especially in pvp.-game has decent graphics and performs well. no perfomrance issues so far.cons:-very small player community. hardly multiplayer matches going on. (at the time this was written. not sure how it is now)-untis don't have natural movement to them, they just stand around as frozen, which makes the game look a little bit dead.-too many russiansoverall i'd recommend this game much! especially since it needs alot more players for pvp. so get it!-EDIT-performance is good until you go into 3d person controll. at least with max to- almost max settings. (on a 980ti)			"

								Call to Arms is a tactical country invasion game that involves you as US Marines who gun down countless waves of hajis with Bradleys and Abrams while they cower behind their Soviet era tanks and trucks with machine guns strapped on to them.US MARINE FIGHT STYLE: Most usually take cover behind almost anything, move in tactical stances while always keeping an eye on the enemy movements. Humvees and Bradleys always kept evenly spread out so that there is no collateral damage if one is destroyed. Very orderly and neat formations.GRM FIGHT STYLE: Can send out trucks and really old tanks occasionally and they have ground forces that will periodically run at you violently spraying with AKs and Skorpions. Unfortunately don't have vests covered in explosives.Play on Easy or Normal and have a great time annihilating the prehistoric vehicles and suicidal troops, or play on Heroic and have the tables turned so that this time YOU'RE the one running and crying as 2 hit AKMs shoot explosive rounds that banish your Marines from the earth realm, and into an eternal purgatory. Hard is sort of a balance between these things, so I recommend that you play it.Overall this is a fantastic game. Buy this game if you want to cry, laugh, get angry at Heroic, feel better playing Normal, or just want a tactical RTS experience that will enthrall you for hours at a time.P.S. devs u aint slick adding them goats we all know what hajis do with them goats in they spare time			"

Side note none of the mods I chose off the workshop even worked. and they were some of the most popular! And there promise to make it less like Men at War is not kept, recycled interface, cover system, ammo, squads,...really recycled everything from Men at War.  And did a horrible job with it all.			"

								no content, after 2+ years of development there are no vehicles in game. absolutley no progress made on netcode, no engine upgrades. one player with a bad connection or performance still slows the game to a crawl. what this means is that when ivan from vladistovok running the game on a ti-83 plays with you, your game will run just as slowly as his does.key series features like individual soldier inventories have been ""nerfed"", you can't pick up helmets anymore for example. the body armor item has been removed as well, despite this being a game set in the modern era. direct control, a major selling point of the previous games, has been effectively removed because the developers felt it was ""unfair"". if you played the previous men of war games and appreciated the depth these two changes should be enough to scare you away. the developers have force-enabled unit lock, there is no way to disable it. if you're new to the series, unit lock is a ""feature"" the developers have put in meaning that the game plays like a F2P mmo, think war thunder. you can expect a 100+ hour grind before you unlock everything and yes, the higher tier units are better and yes, you will be forced to play against them despite not having them unlocked yourself. you may find yourself trying to kill an M1 abrams with a BMP-1, unable to call in your own tanks because you have not unlocked them yet.  the developers have fallen short in virtually every area relevant to long-term series fans. the major problems the game had in 2009 are still there. the best way to describe this game is as a flawed but ambitious full-conversion mod - but mods don't usually cost money. the final insult from DMS isn't the game, though. it's their behavior outside of it, where they've gone so far as to make a VAC banned cheater their community manager.

								I honestly don't know if I should love this game or hate it. In many ways, the fact that it's been in pre-release since the Land that Time Forgot and shows no real sign of moving forward is a big part of my problem. The DLC of course is another as in order to play multi-player or skirmish you have to buy the enhanced edition, I mean Jesus. On the other, it offers a realistic though limited in terms of units combat experience. The units are very detailed, but mostly pointless in terms of gameplay. There are future plans for DLC, but nobody has a set release date and unless you buy the season pass for extra money you won't have access to the big ones. I like playing it, but overal it's a bit of a let down.			"

								You really can't seem to make a game that will acually work can you? I had hoped that this game would be an improvement on it's predicessor, Men of War: Assault Squad 2, but that is not the case. It is litterally a rehash of the same garbage game. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is good and the level detail is impressive. That is, when the game ACTUALLY WORKS! Like it's predecessor, Call to Arms is prone to frequent crashing and bugs that are consistent with that of an Alpha or Beta version of a game. Perhaps the saddest fact is that this game literally has 1/10th the content of its predicessor and with the Red Rising MOD, MOWAS2 has at least 50 times more content. Thats not an exageration. Its also free. So, in summation, this game is a Lemon.			"

This and many more are the questions i will answer in this review.Let's begin with the lobby, a modern design that totaly doesnt look like every youtube tutorial on how to make buttons that don't have a plain color - really good looking. I especially like the loading bar in this game cause it does totaly not look like the Windows Vista taskbar - original design. At all does the UI feature some fancy features, just like the global chat where you can say ""WTB GF"" and pray for someone to answer your offer. Or you just look at the list of players who are online - sometimes it does even show when a developer is playing the game. It's realy nice to know that one of these VAC-banned gods is playing at the same time i do.Now about the gameplay, it mostly evolves arround beeing too low level to call in any units that can harm the enemy, or you get simply kicked out of lobbies for beeing too low level - maybe this new gameplay system is a bit hard to understand for the casual gamer, but as their CEO allready said, just go grind exp by killing bots! The bots are a good addition to the game, they mostly just throw infantry into your line of fire till you run out of ammo, what seems to be their primary tactic - really well implemented. Additional features:-impenetrable T-80 front hull-helmets cannot fly away anymore when hit, because they are glued to the soldiers head now (big improvement!)-you may pay 23€ for this masterpiece!-there is an epochal ammount of -> 2 <- factions - that are enough to have a battle with -> 2 <- different factions fighting each other!Negative Aspects:-I can't give the developers more money for this masterpiece...Even though i have listed all these positive aspects, i really cannot recommend the game because the 9/11 DLC won't be free content - you will have to pay for it additonal 9.11€. :(			"

Early Access Review
								As of the time that I am writing this review (which I never do) the game is horribly broken. I watched many youtube videos of the gameplay and really thought I would like it. I tried to like it, looking past the cons I really wanted to like it. Its almost a solid RTS.Pros:Graphics were good to me, not cartoony like most RTS'sChallenging game play (During a skirmish things could change in an instant based on cover)Variety of units that seemed to be better or worse at certian thingsCons: (where to begin)*Paid and Downloaded only to find the single player non-existant. Attempted to verify download and still nothing. (Be nice if the description said something other than Multiplayer BS with special gift for the deluxe version)*Skirmish options basically limit what YOU can build. Numerous times I changed to only infantry (learning the basics due to no single player) and guess what? I can only make infantry but little do I realize I have about 5 humvees and 3 tanks attack my position.....maybe I forgot to make sure to unclick that option? Nope only infantry units SHOULD be available. *0 tutorial on how to do anything in the game, I learned more from the youtube videos prior to purchase than the game ever showed me*Difficulty settings mean apparently nothing in this game. Set on Easy (again learning how to play because no single player or tutorial) got crushed. Ok lets level the playing field with AI allies to help on same setting as opponet, got crushed again.  Lets see how Heroic Allies does against the 1 easy opponet, Yup Crushed Again. Turned the opponet to Heroic and got the exact same gameplay level as on easy.*Creating a map is great , but why is it so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to upload it and play it? Literally the first game I've paid for on steam and this is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I get. Not sure how/where all the Youtube videos came from but it is definately not this build of the alpha. Overall listen to the negative reviews about this alpha and wait for it to atleast turn into beta (Although that doesn't seem to happen anymore on steam) Likely the first and last time I pay for an alpha version			"

								A BIG NO!Why?There is no tutorial, well yes there is but its not interwoven into the gameplay u need to look it up, so there is no learning curve there dismissing time and attention away from gameplay plus u need to have excellent retention to remember any of it.Community frown upon newcomers quickly label them as noob l2p all that tired old jazz. Wont help and wont let u into ""they're""game further more u cannot play singleplayer in the traditional sense unless u buy the ""deluxe"" edition witch is the same as the regular but unlocked.This really limits you're gameplay to custom maps filled with bots witch can be fun but tedious upping skill lvl of these AI makes it challenging, but that's about it. Last thing get you're refund in quick before you're checked it out more then 2 hours  (which is next to nothing)or haven't given up on it just yet giving it might come in 2 weeks. <- it over in a wink then u lost you're money.so in all save it for a more deserving game.

								Early access means they can change the game how they want to and what you pay for is the product at the time. Nobody ever said you had to buy it. Read the disclaimer before buying a early access games next time.But it deserves the negative reviews that are ACTUAL reviews. The game is filled with bugs and has little content. Dont bother to buy the game, the singleplayer is boring and repetitive. Just get the multiplayer for free and play with friends.			"

								This game ruined the most important feature in Men of War History. Direct Control, without it the game is extremely basic, you have little to no tactical skill left. They implemented some horrible mockery of direct control that jitters around even when zoomed in and makes accurate grenade throws impossible, they then defend this as it would make the guns OP!♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the developers have honestly ♥♥♥♥ed up on this one and until they realize it and start implementing some changes, this game can burn.Don't ♥♥♥♥ing touch this game, just play Red Rising in Assault Squad 2 because ♥♥♥♥ me this game is poor.

								This game is a joke, i got the deluxe edition as at the time it was the best package and they promised that everything would be part of this package. One of the reasons why I got this package is to play all the single player mission as I really enjoy MOW BUT Guess what NO you need to pay them more, they switch everything changing it to free to play adding a season pass and adding ultimate edition. Doing that, now you have to pay them more money to get something they promised you in the start. guess what you can suck my balls i am not going to support a company that does business that way. don't waste your money as they will screw you over the first chance they will get.

								This is not even a review. Read the comments! It's a disturbing display of stupid troll posts from at least one internet hack that's been spamming every single positive review he could find, masquerading as a person that has an IQ over 25. Hopefully, the comments from my older review will remain and everyone can see the idiocy in the comments section. Idiot #1 deleted all his idiot posts but idiot #2 doesn't even have enough brains to do that. But then, maybe I'm giving idiot #1 more credit than he deserves since he thought it was a good idea to carry his idiocy over to Imgur to make sure that even more people see what a butthurt little child he actually is.Really, this is the mentality of at least two people (Who I am not convinced aren't the same person. Their writing styles and posting habits are nearly identical.) crusading against this game. There's no reason to think that they don't represent the mentality of a hell of a lot more of them.A message to you people that think because you play Assault Squad a lot this game was made especially for you: You are not special and the game would exist with or without you ""ponying up the dough"". A hell of a lot of people bought this game that don't kiss the ground the Men of War franchise walks on and you all need to put on your big boy pants and come to terms with that. How do I feel about the game? Well, you see my logged hours and you can take it or leave it. What I've played of it was fun and it was well worth the $8 I paid for the Deluxe Edition on sale. I only care about the singpleplayer though. Multiplayer may as well not even exist as far as I'm concerned. Do I know a hell of a lot about the game? Nope, nor do I pretend to. I'm pretty much done buying Early Access games because they're cheap and then playing them so much I don't care about them anymore when the full releases rolls around. I'll pick it back up after that happens but as it stands now, if Steam thinks two hours is enough time to decide if a game is worth the money logic dictates that 2 hours is enough time to decide whether I ought to recommend others spend their money on it, too.You don't like that? You can't strain out anything better than to harp on my logged hours? Kiss my ♥♥♥.			"

								Still needs some work, but i like the game. I like these games with the level of detail and control like all the men of war games but noneof my friends like these games(COH fan boys), i dont think they will like this one aswell.Likes:Models look greatWeapons work greatMuliplayer is fun with friendsTrue Stragetic gameDislikes:Animations are stiff and jaringGroup & Single Unit AI needs more intelligence (They feel stiff and dumb, too much micro for basics maneuvers)More ""fluid"" game mechanics, animation, ai, gameplay. (Like all the men of war games it feels too clunky, the reason my friends dont like playing )Give it as a option if not everyone likes that thing that want to micro everything, i really wish my friends like this over coh but this game is frustrating with dumb ai. Give it some soul.Coh ai interaction has a better feel, its not perfect and in some ways cant be compared but it works and enables you to engage more as a commander.I want to play as commander, not a corporal telling guys exactly where to stand, but having that abillity is great. But i dont want to do that all the time, want to focus on the larger battle at hand.All these things might change.. but if you look at all the men of war games that this is based on, they all suffer from the same thing. Some like it, but i want to help the game improve not just serve fan boys. More people playing will be great, they just need to tweak their formula. But here is to hoping they might improve those things this time.			"

								Previously I gave this game a thumbs down. Because it introduced nothing new to the previous men of war titles. But now this changed drastically. The Visuals are still not the best of the genre but the performance is now outstanding since the engine update and the game introduced a first person / 3rd person perspective for vehicles and infantry. This give the game a whole new level of immersion and depth. If you´re a hardcore strategy enthusiast I definitely recommend you to support this game.			"

								===========LATEST REVIEW NOV 30 2016========The devs heard our cries and made a whole lot of improvements. Do give this game a try, but you'll need a quite capable machine to really enjoy it at the fullest.===========PREVIOUS REVIEW================Really liked this game, the direct control of your units is freaking awesome. But the levelling system is completely bullcrap like others have mentioned. I rarely play offline as I don't have the time, mostly I like jumping in to my own customized battles quickly in skirmish during office lunch breaks and just have fun blasting tanks off. But the locked units seriously turns you off.I know this is Early Access, and I hope the levelling unlock unit mechanism would change. And the game could do more in terms of optimization before it leaves Early Access.Until then, I don't recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Well I am truly sad and salty with this title now. As such I am modifying my initial early review and if you are interested in reading why, read on.I have slept on this for a few nights, to make sure I not just raging but no, this is not right. The Devs recent ""fact check"" whilst at the same time defensive, aggressive and patronizing is a thinly veiled attempt to cover the fact that the Devs have taken the decision to release the game  devoid of content; such content only being accessible by making a further purchase of DLC. To placate early backers there is a free ""allied"" pack containing little in the way of any major new factions which again will not be available at release.This is managing supporter expectations very poorly and when you consider the effort and feedback supporters have made, to be hit with this put down, it is just wrong if not in breach of UK consumer law. The devs will no doubt claim that early backers at no point had it represented to them that the game would contain X amount of content or that it would be X type of game. It was implied, with reasonable expectation and samples that the product would contain more content than is being released under the early access, as an updated and improved successor to MOWAS2. In real terms, very little from the changed from early Alpha (tanks and vehicle were added) though the title has mutated into a poor FPS and which in MP is very much a infantry kill fest ala COD on an RTS scale. I just hope that (prayer to Gaben) Modders fix this game and make it what fans of the series wanted it to be. The current multiplayer is unbalanced and frequently suffers from performance drops. The creates a fustrating experience trying to get a game from an already dwindling player base and when you do, results in poor matches with exploits abused.Whilst I like the engine, aspects of the game (what of it there is), as it stands I can only recommend the free to play element. The single player is not worth purchasing and the DLC based on what it offer is not either. Frankly this content should have been in the game to begin with. If a game of the year comes out with all the content that the game should have had, on sale, then yes get the game. If you see this studio developing EA in future, steer well clear.3/10			"

								It's been a while since i've played the game since I found it wasn't nearly complete. Now that I come back to it, i've noticed that it's gotten much better and I might start to play it more. My one issue is that they seem too be focusing too much on the multiplayer and not so much the single player missions. But what they have done in the multiplayer is very interesting and seems to have a lot more in store for it. I really want to see some interesting single player missions though that get really intense.			"
