												Seeing as I have about 10x -30x  the hours of any other reviewer in playing this game, I guess it's time that I say something about it.Lots of people have already described what it is. I'm going to say a little about getting the most out of the game.First, think of it more as a 'Garden' that you just leave running in the background, and come back and tend to every so often. For me, that's about every 20mins or so. At first, you need to unlock all of the descriptions for the different plant and bug types, so that yo know how they interact... what the feed on, how they reproduce. To do this, you need to keep that plant/bug alive for 5000s straight. I'd recommend focussing on the Moulds first (OK, some of them are Carnivirous, worry about them a bit later, then) and pretty well ignore bugs altogether early game. Why? because The wrong bug can easliy wipe out an entire species or 10 of Mould.If you have a Mould or bug that keeps dying, for no reason, it's probably Carnivorous, and has no food. Try reintroducing it once you have a bigger eco system running.I have yet to create a balanced, self sustaining system. It involves quite a lot more than you might think, actually. Right no I am in the middle of Terraforming to create separate Mini-Biomes, so that I can introduce several complementarty species that can rely on each other, and hopefully not wipe each other out.This is the appeal of this game, it's preject with a view to the long term, kind of like making Bonsai.It's always interesting when the planet decides to throw something random in the mix, though.

												Albeit very simple looking and nothing all to flashy. Earthtongue is a unique Vivarium Simulator that does manage to have some complexity to it. The key word that drives this game is experimentation. What lifeforms are suited to each other and which are absolutely horrible for each other. You will use your powers of intervention to poke and prod the ecosystem to a stable state. While Earthtongue doesn't have much in the way of tutorials. It isn't hard to grasp the basic ideas and goals. Earthtongue isn't a game you can really win or lose at either. If you feel the need to burn everything and start over. That option is always available to you. Perhaps you want to see how many species you cram on the planet. What you do, and how you go about it, is all up to you. No matter what you decide it will more then likely take time and patience. Which makes Earthtongue a great game to have running in the background. Occasionally checking in and making sure everything is going well. Luckily there is a handy game speed option to match whatever playstyle you prefer. If your more hands on, jack it up to max speed. If you wanna check it occasionally leave it on normal. In all, its a fun little game and family friendly. I did a Let's Play/First impressions on this game! Come check it out if ya like!Big thanks to the developer for this great game!Hope you enjoy.

												Pretty cool and unique little gem here. I've enjoyed watching over my world and observing it grow while intervening where necessary. At first my I didn't have much but managed to grow an environment with about 7 or 8 different species. Unfortunately I wasn't managing it well and eventually saw my ecosystem nearly collapse. with only two fungi left and all my bugs gone. However, I manged to bounce back. Once I got a grasp on how the various bugs and fungi interacted, I soon found myself with a healthy enviornment with mushrooms and fungi, plenty of roaches and beetles, mantis to eat them, saw my first spider come in and grow into a little spider society a little away from my mountains with my mushrooms and flies. It bounced back completely, much more diverse and more individual creatures and it felt like I had accomplished something. Earthtongue has a nice balance of being able to interact with the world enough to guide it, but you're not expected to micromanage every single thing. Sometimes I would move a mantis over to a high populous area, or make sure my beetles could thrive elsewhere while their numbers increased, and of course the interventions that tick off every number of years. I feel like a gentle guiding hand to this world and it's a unique experience that I recommend trying!			"

												I suddenly found myself in the care of a planet in some far reach of space.The more time I spent with this planet, the more attached I grew to its inhabitants.I remember an era of pure blue, the mushrooms and beetles spanning miles and miles. Few could dispute their claim to this world.Little by little, the yellow slime took over... Then the spiders came. It barely resembled the world I once knew. With them, the world had taken a different shape.I wanted all creatures to share this planet. I'll admit, I've interfered a lot. I just want to see them thrive. This is the task I've charged myself with. Whether I achieve it -- if the powers that be allow me to achieve it -- is a different story...But I won't give up.			"

												Earthtongue is a fungal ecosystem simulator.I bet you've never heard of that before. Well... unless you were a mycologist.Earthtongue is unique in that it's less of a game and more of a simulator with limited interactions. It still has some minor goals (unlocking journal entries) but everything is largely freeform and open-ended for how you decide on what you want to do with your little fungus world. A fully diverse ecosystem is a thing of beauty and playing Earthtongue will teach you to appreciate the balance such an system requires. It'll show you just how fragile the ecosystem around you -- just like on this simulated planet -- really can be.While its a great little simulator, and I can easily recommend Earthtongue, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Its for people who liked games similar to Mountain or watching Breve 3D Evolution simulations. Earthtongue is for people who like watching aquariums full of fish, or ant farms. People who want more interaction with their simulation games -- such as those who play Dwarf Fortress, or SimCity -- probably won't enjoy this nearly as much.			"

												Forgive me if I ramble a bit, I don't write many reviews!I bought Earthtongue a few days ago, and while I've already unlocked almost all the reseach journal entries, I really enjoyed what I've been playing!I'm not normally a fan of micro-managing simulation type games, but I think that's exactly why I've been enjoying Earthtongue?? You don't necessarily HAVE to manage anything, you can just let the ecosystem manage itself. That's exactly what I ended up doing most of the time, just watched how the bugs and plants spawned and interacted with each other. I did use the intervention mechanic to speed things along by changing the landscape a bit to make sure bugs didn't get trapped, and to spawn random plants and bugs in spots I thought needed some more life. I loooove the art style. It's all very, very simple pixels, but I think it works great for the type of game this is. All the bugs and fungi are very distinct from one another, and fun to watch move around the landscape. It's all very colorful as well, never boring to look at. That's also one of the reasons I enjoy Earthongue. It's very soothing to just kinda look at and mess with things every once in a while. I had it on while I was at work, and everything moving around combined with the music was just very calming and almost hypnotizing! And I can have it on in the background while I do work, come back to it after a bit and see what happened while I was gone! It's all very fun in a way that I guess I wouldn't describe as a game, but you CAN definitely play it like one. It has that micro-managing, and everything interacts with everything else in specific ways, so figuring out how to keep everything alive has a fun factor all its own!If there's anything negative I have to say, I guess that it's just VERY HARD to get that last journal entry! I know I can wait for interventions and form the land and then wait more to spawn the specific things I want, but I didn't feel like I ever wanted to play it that way. That's just me though, I'm sure if I took the time I could form the world to be very specific I could get that 28 diversity, but honestly, I love the degree of randomness to the world, it makes it more interesting to see things unfold.so yeah, tl;dr the game has a cute art style and very fun micro-managing mechanics, and I personally find it to be a very soothing experience to just let the world unfold, spawn random stuff, and see how it affects everything else!

												I originally played this game on Itch.io and really loved it. The pixel art is lovely and the music is soothing :)There aren't any tutorials or instructions, although there are journal entries with specific information on each fungus/insect that are unlocked after a species survives for a long enough time. This means that the player will need to observe the behaviours of the insects and fungi in order to determine how to properly care for them. Some are herbivores, some carnivores - some fungi even eat bugs.Balancing the ecosystem is both challenging and rewarding. A species can easily die off if they over-consume their food source, for example. Some insects are bad at climbing terrain and may get stuck in an area with no food.The player is given Intervention points which replenish over time, and allow them to add insects or fungi, change the weather, or alter the terrain. Choosing a random insect, fungi, or weather effect to add is significantly less expensive than choosing something specific, but of course the player receives less control over what will be added to the ecosystem when it is randomized.Insects can be picked up and moved by the player, allowing them the option to manually balance the ecosystem. Fungi, however, cannot be moved.Earthtongue can be addictive to play, but also fun to just leave running while I do other things. It's exciting to come back and see what has grown, which populations have survived, or which species have gone completely extinct ;)			"

												Self-sufficient ecosystem generator, zen-style clicker game (that you non-click not to spoil the balance), an ever-absent God simulator, a process to run in the background forever - I just love this thing, where pixellated darwinian race for survival looks at first like a mess of colors, but whoever learns to distinguish the creatures' ways of life will observe epic triumphs and tragedies in vivo. Really, not every active game captures my attention for tens of minutes like this one, and surely not every involved gameplay gets me so emotionally connected. At some point you get to know facial expressions of worms when they feed, then you try to help a strange shroom to inhabit a hole naturally separated from a swarm of hungry bugs... Basically it's just a tomagochi gadjet upscaled in which you can do interventions every so often, but they barely do any good - just small turbulence whirls on the face of eternity, the best way to play is just look at the screen in the evening and maybe make bets on species to make it through the night, then turn off the monitor, and get totally surprised after sleep.10 TOTALLY UNJUST species extinctions out of 10!!!

												I think this game has been seriously under-appreciated. People are looking at this game and expecting more than it promises. This is not a fast-paced sim. Even at it's highest speed setting, massive interaction with the enviorment takes a while. However, that is all this game promises. It is a FANTASTIC ""aquarium"" style simulator. You watch a planet gros and interact with itself, change over time, and you can institute big changes, that might take sometime to devlope. This is a wonderful game for turning on in the background while doing other things and popping in to see how things are going, or just watching for a while when you're bored. Very calming, very awesome. There is a slight learning curve, as there is a very small tutorial and some of the tools are not completely described, but this is a game about experiementation, and it pull off everything it promises to do phenominally. This has kept me very well entertained, and continues to do so.			"

												As an ecosystem ecologist, I have love for Earthtongue. Many know that I value games that 'bring something new to the table', and Earthtongue is just brimming with a fresh new idea.Essentially,  you manage an ecosystem with controls akin to a clicker-style game. You could think of it as managing a terrarium or fish tank. It's not perfect by a long-shot, but what it sets out to do, it does well. You build up a currency that is based on time and total biomass (or so I read). Things come into the system randomly, or you can spend this currency to bring specific things in. There are synergies, like in real life. The goal is to control cycles. You have herbavores? You better have food for them. An invertebrate died? Might as well move his dead body to the garden so the nutrients end up back in the soil there.The scope of the game isn't huge, but there is *certainly* enough content to justify the measly asking price. There are multiple worlds (ie. backgrounds), and a whole slew of mushrooms and bugs.If this sounds like your jam, just go for it. "

												Earthtongue is a game about ecology and discovery. And bugs, which is always good.It has a slow, meditative feel to it, which is in no way meant to sound bad and in every way meant to encourage the purchase if, whether out of pure curiosity or the serious enjoyment of complexity-within-simplicity, you would like to experience the broad brush strokes of intervention in an active and alien bio-system. You are an entity lingering over a strange, nutrient-rich landscape with the ability to drop insects and fungi. (Already riveting stuff!) The flora and fauna run on guidelines, within themselves, and with the intention of survival and procreation. Some combinations mesh well, others are at odds, and some develop symbiotic relationships. The beetles, for example, are territorial and won't hesitate to attack other insects. However, they leave a lot of carcasses (theirs and their enemy's) along the ground, which is useful for flies to munch greedily upon.The setup relies less on action and more on re-action. You push and pull the flow of creatures at a meandering pace, more intent on watching the What and the How than trying to force your agenda. Like a real terrarium of sorts, the experience is in dropping one or two new objects and waiting, or even just checking back in an hour. As you learn what makes every creature unique, the entity will write in-game logs attempting to detail them in ways that you might not have noticed. This datalog adds a touch of flavor, a pinch of tutorial, and a dash of tangible accomplishment to an otherwise fend-for-yourself style of gameplay.Earthtongue is an experience that doesn't require much of your time or your attention, but it has a richness that will have you quietly watching, maybe scratching your head, maybe nudging a beetle in the right direction, or maybe just smiling.

												Earthtongue is a great simulation game about gently guiding the ecosystem of a mysterious planet. You take the role of an observer, watching fungi and insects live and die. Occasionally you can intervene and bring in a new species of fungus or bug, changing the ecosystem. The art is very cute and minimalistic though still very colourful.Earthtongue isn't your average game, and it does ask that you carefully balance some complex systems, but that's a fine thing. You're rewarded with a thriving world and intriguing research journals along the way.The game was also made by one man, which is very impressive.Update: This game is still good. Please play it.			"

												Earthtongue is BASICALLY a terrarium simulator but it's so much more than that!  With the journal entries adding a deeper narrative and user-driven choices it's hard not to recommend it.  There's a very steep learning curve and that can be a major turn-off for a lot of people, but for gamers in this day and age I think it's very refreshing when a game doesn't hold your hand and tell you how to do everything off the bat.  Experimentation is key!  There's not much in the way of permanent consequences as you can simply start a new world if your current one is off to a shaky start.GIVE EARTHTONGUE A TRY!

												This is nice. I feel relaxed to watch my pixel-molds grow around the landscape, and to watch my little pixel-bugs eat molds and each other.As others said, it's more like an entertaining screen saver. (Like Johnny Castaway, long ago on an OS far, far away.) But you can interact with this for a moment and then let it continue simulating the behaviors of each different organism.There are also a few workshop mods at the moment. Those give different environments and different creatures to play with. I feel like those mods give other interesting opportunities to see how the mechanics interact over time.Most of my playtime is just letting it run in the background. I check on it every 30 minutes or hour, and observe what's changed and what different combination of life has grown in my terrarium. It's a neat toy and I like playing with it.			"

Because that's pretty much what Earthtongue is.This is a quietly interesting sim that works best as something to quietly tinker with in the background. You could try to micromanage it further, but I enjoy it most when I just pop in occasionally to check how things are going.Sometimes that means coming back to discover a towering pile of roaches cannibalizing the bodies of their fallen brethren.

												This review is an analysis of how the ecology functions and entertains you.  It will point out quirks that you will learn as you play for hours on end. It covers the base game-world, but the resources that you manipulate in the game has patterns and limitations, and will appear in any game module.Working with the game ecology and finding the in and out of sustainable systems, i want to say the ecosystem is flawed, and the 2d nature of the game is part of the reason. The game life finds local maxima to survive and will burn out over time. Life in this game works like wild fire burning dry trees, leaving behind ash for the next generation to regrow. Maybe this fire analogy is an accuracy way to expect how life will NOT continue to thrive without considerable maintenance by the user to 'fuel the fire' of this system.To support the system there are two resources: water and nutrients. How these resources move in the ecosystem limits how plant-like life grows: Rules of water is simple and less critical to life, water refreshes at the lower layers as ground water, and very rarely by rain, life and time drains the water, some life depends on water more than others, the top of mountains are dry and only some plants will naturally migrate and survive on hills.  There is no way for the user to improve the desperation of water without continuous work of manual rainfalls. How nutrients replenish in the system, is ideally, by nutrient falls from the air. This is like another rain, but it is governed by rules the user must explore and he can enhance. There is a max cap or nutrients in the system that will fall before it stops and it can be increased by the user, but the amount of time and work to saturate the entire land with even falls automatically is unclear and possibly unachievable when compared to the volume of the land that is slowly increasing.  It is the scarcity of nutrients which will kill your ecosystem overtime because of limits how nutrients migrate. The dead rot and emit nutrients back in the surroundings. The living can move and die somewhere else, then rot and make that new land fertile.  The rules how nutrients, as a particle and in  this 2d space, is what limits life in local maxima of good condition.  Nutrients will over time sink deeper in the ground, and be inaccessible to  all but few plants with the right roots to reach, plants that by chance may never grow above these deep nutrients, and in this a world stacked with deep vertical tiles. Nutrients do not move off tiles on its own, and i am sure, never spread horizontally on its own, this limit of motion is what forces only local healthy sub-ecosystems;  be it intended or a flaw i do not now, but do not expect drainage from ground water to help move nutrients along the world, and happenstance to hot spots of life that need it.Instead to move and fuel nutrient short term and as a buffer, within supporting life the time of random and a slow nutrient fall hits; you need swarms of creatures feeding and rotting above plants. The creature ecosystem has balancing problems. Ideally there are diminishing returns feeding  nutrients down the food chain, where the loss appears back into the falls, but there are errors of positive feedback; flies and corpses on top of sticky-like plants was one, but was patched; but know where there are dead-eaters stacking, there is a deadlock of nutrients being looped and disappearing in that mini system and not spreading around and hopefully reappearing in the falls somewhere else.Likely, when the measure life is high in local spots, there are dead zones somewhere else, and like the wild-fire analogy, plants will burn out without fuel from the falls, life will die, and the unique life count will drop down to zero, without your help.   Don't expect life in this game to be self sustaining , expect everything to burn out because resources that fuel this strange life: water and nutrients, do not migrate naturally in the ground, diminish within food chains, and slowly and randomly drop from the sky. Everything burns down like this dying planet. "

Sometmes, I would just like to have everything going on, on a single screen. The ability to choose the size of your world, anywhere from one screen's worth of terrain up to what is currently the standard world size would be something I wouldn't object to, to say the least.

												Not so much a game as an experimental, observational lab where you can conduct various experiments with bugs and fungus and note how they all respond to the environment and each other. Minor tweaking is the order of the day. You subtly change the environment by introducing new lifeforms and controlling the weather. Then you sit back and observe. A meditative experience, perhaps.Definitely not a game for everyone, given that it's rather slow, doesn't contain a lot of instructions or feedback, nor have any particular goals to work towards beyond those that you define for yourself, but I'm quite enjoying it so far and would recommend it if you're looking for a slow paced game that's something out of the ordinary.

												Good in theory, and I enjoy the way the ecosystem has a lot of complex behaviors in it.  It's just not quite sure what it's trying to be.A desktop aquarium/terrarium would need to be reasonably interesting to look at, no matter what adjustments the player makes or how long they leave it alone -- but, Earthtongue requires constant maintenance by a skilled hand in order to keep your ecosystem going.A management / sim game would need to have a reasonable amount of challenge -- but, your actions would need to have easily understood effects (creature descriptions / names / behaviors are not explained until after you've had them on-world alive for a very large amount of time -- you have to guess it all by observation), and your actions would need to be the determining factor in whether you succeed or fail.  In Earthtongue, new species are added to your sandbox at random, every few minutes -- so you can't set up any kind of specialized environment, random things you might not want (like predators, animals in general, invasive species, etc) constantly invade, especially if you aren't monitoring it 24/7.There are other genres that this game sort of fails to hit the mark for, but those are the big ones.  I guess my #1 problem is that the game forces you to micromanage to keep everything from dying off, but it doesn't Let you micromanage because you have a limited amount of moves per minute.I may keep playing to poke around figuring out what all the creatures do.  If I can find a decent write-up of how the ecosystem works though, that'll be the end of my interest.On the plus side, it's very pretty, very peaceful, and the first time I accidentally sent a meteor shower I didn't want was Very Memorable.

There is a bit of a learning curve, but discovering what everything is by playing around and tinkering with it is part of the fun. Solid sound track.

												I bought Earthtongue on sale and it was well worth it. Less of a game, and more of a relaxation simulator. Full price? I couldn't recommend it.1) You do not actually have to ""play"" the game  -  but the two times I let it run by itself almost everything died.2) It is very relaxing to spread spores in an attempt to diversify.3) The music is Atari 2600 quality and easily turned off. Personal opinion: The music is sh*t.There is no ""WOW"" factor. You will never (or at least very rarely) see an overgrown, colourful, thriving planet teeming with life. That was the impession I got from the video. But it rarely happens. I will recommend Earthtongue if you buy it on sale. Its relaxing. It is fun tryng to balance your molds and insects. Perhaps, like me, you will care about a snail for the first time in your life - and maybe you will shed a tear when Wilbur the Snail dies, and his species goes extinct.I miss my little slimy friend.Its relaxing. Its beautiful. Thought-provoking. Not actually a ""game"" - but, then again, not everything needs to be a ""GAME"". "

												Don't be fooled by my playtime: I've actually spent quite a lot of time in this game off of Steam. Earthtongue is not the kind of game I usually play, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. Depending on your personality there are several different ways to play Earthtongue. I inititally was much more controlling, trying to feed my bugs to each other and moving bugs to sources of food. However when I want to relax, I simply let the game run. Sometimes I leave the game in the background for 5-10 minutes and let life play out without my influence. It's fun to return to the game with lots of intervention points to spend and new fungi or bugs in place. Earthtongue is like watching an terrarium, except you have some control over the inhabitants. The soundtrack is great and the experience is unlike any other game I own on Steam. Plus it's only $5.			"

												A pleasant little ""vivarium game,"" in which your only real task is to watch the rise and fall of various fungus and insect species on a sunless planet. The game encourages you to try to build a diverse, sustainable ecosystem, rewarding the successful preservation of species with detailed journal entries about their behaviors. As you play more and more -- and catalogue more and more species -- you're also treated to some additional journal entries that reveal something like a backstory, showing who/what you are, and why you're watching the game unfold. A charming pixel aesthetic and a soundtrack that seems like it's straight out of the NES round out the package.Gameplay is a relatively passive affair compared to other ""build-and-watch"" games, like SimCity. You can reposition bugs and fungus spores at will with a click of your mouse, but for meatier tasks (reshaping the planet tile by tile, introducing new species, summoning rain or lifeform-eradicating meteor showers, etc.), you are charged ""intervention points,"" which build up over time. Consequently, a good chunk of the game consists of making something happen, sitting back and watching the effects, and then making another thing happen a little while later. You can accelerate the rate at which you accrue intervention points by having more biomass on your planet (i.e., more fungi and bugs crawling around at any given moment), and you are also given three speeds (and a pause button) for making time pass more quickly.The forced passivity of Earthtongue is at once a good and bad thing. On the plus side, it encourages you to observe and strategize, knowing that time is another resource to manage, and your absence from the world another factor to account for as you play. It makes for a far different gameplay experience than you might be accustomed to seeing. On the negative end, it's sometimes irritating to have to sit around doing nothing while waiting to save up enough intervention points to perform several major maneuvers in succession.Aside from what gripes the game's setup may entail, I've noticed a couple of issues with the game itself. First -- and worst -- is slowdown. When my planet is absolutely crawling with wildlife, the framerate suffers noticeably, and sometimes a portion of the planet won't even have loaded by the time I pan over to it. Second is the slight difficulty involved with clicking and moving things. Some spores are so tiny that you'll click one by accident as you try to pick up a bug, and you'll have no idea you're dragging the spore along as you frantically try to click anything else.Even with these complaints, I can assure you that I've never once felt frustrated playing Earthtongue. It is as close to a zero-stress experience as I've ever had. It can be mildly irritating to have one of your bugs or fungi face extinction, but you can always re-introduce them later for a few intervention points. If you don't like how your planet is turning out, you can always wipe out its population with a meteor shower, or start over entirely with a single button press. There are no failures in Earthtongue -- only setbacks faced on your way to a goal that you yourself set.I recommend this game enthusiastically and without hesitation. Play it because it's a neat game. Stick with it because it's an experience.			"

												Earthtongue is a really relaxing terrarium game.  It's something nice to leave on in the background for a while.  If you've ever played The Sims or any small-scale simulation game, you'll know you get strangely attached to your little simulated world.  It's yours!  Nobody else will have quite the same interaction with their world, and that makes it really special.If you're looking for a really deep, directly engaging game, this probably isn't going to scratch that itch.  Earthtongue is a game that's at its most fun when you check in on it every now and then, tweak a few things, poke at your mantises, cross-pollinate a few mushrooms, and then leave again.There's an update coming out pretty soon that'll add user-made customizable gardens, which is a REALLY cool addition.  If you're on the fence right now, that update should probably push you over.  Also it's just five bucks.  C'mon.  Skip coffee tomorrow morning and grab a copy.			"

												Much like caring for a terrarium, you can leave it to its own devices or take a hands-on approach to ensure a good balance of life. In this case, insects and fungi interact with each other, each in unique ways, so the balancing can be quite challenging.Recommended for some downtime, for while there is little second-to-second action, reaching a balanced world can be tricky and requires some good thought.

The pixel art is simple but charming  and the game is very relaxing. You can micromanage and try to ""collect"" all the creatures and keep them alive, or treat it more like a digital ant farm and watch life happen.Video review/let's play:

												This game is really relaxing and fun, but you have to like these kinds of games. It's quite amazing how many of the bugs and fungi have evolved to assist each other in surviving, such as a bug with an immunity to a dangerous fungus for example, and this bug has evolved a specialized stomach to spread this fungus around to help the bug keep a steady supply of food with minimal competition (the bug can eat this fungus, where other bugs have difficulties).I do however have one complaint. What is with this game's achievements? I'm thinking maybe it was intended to be as relaxing as possible, so the achievements were made to appear after the game is closed? We should at least have the option to change this, I hate having a mass amount of achievements unlocked at the wrong time, and displayed all with the same exact timestamp and not when I actually got them.If you like peaceful ""Fishtank Screensaver"" type games, with minimal interaction, check this game out. Seriously, this game makes me feel like a god, and I love all of my children. I found out, you aren't actually a god, but you are infact the soul of the planet. "

			The Ecosystem keeps growing, but am I really affecting it? While the game does have some good ideas in a sandbox nature, the fact is that it fails to really teach the player about it.		

+:-Complex rule sets that if you can get to understand and exploit, may lead to a very circle of life kind of simulator.-Components that work off of each other to get the ecosystem going. -Experimentation section can work for those who don't want to be handed things. -:-Lack of tooltips and information to start the game really hampers the experience, especially when unlocks are tied to keeping the organisms alive....which may only happen if you get lucky considering the rules. Can be infurating.-Too little detail in interventions as you basically experiment (wasting resources) to see what they do at first. -Letting the game play out without your intervention seemingly has only a little bit difference then you playing with it: which makes you wonder why you are playing. This could lessen over time, but to stay around, you're going to want more then what the game gives you. -Lack of tutorial and letting journal entries attempt to guide you doesn't do the job in terms of a tutorial. Wants you to experiment, you need to slightly nudge in the right direction.-Would have like to have seen an evolution mechanism of some sort. -Sound can get to you after a while.While I appreciate the effort from the one man team on a game that has obvious complexity to it in a simulator nature, the fact is that I had major problems enjoying the game due to the lack of end user feedback or tools to truly understand what is happening in the game's environment. You'll sit there either touching or not touching the environment, and noticing that there's not a lot you can do to really create your own world seemingly, you're only slightly infleuncing what's going on. There's a lot of complex rules seemingly and someone who's willing to experiment with the game may have a lot of fun of it. But the lack of seemingly true tools to test things out really Killed the game in the end for me.			"

YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Earthtongue 

			Views: 15		

			Today we look at Earthtongue, an indie ecosystem simulator. We turn our planet from a deserted wasteland to a deserted wasteland with a small pocket of life (come on, we didn't have that long to work...		

Earthtongue is a fun, mostly hands off ecosystem simulator. You start off knowing nothing about what you're doing and you slowly have to learn the rules of the different species through experience and research notes in game. The players role in the ecosystem is two fold, in my experience. Firstly, the player has to introduce the species that will populate the world. Secondly, you will try to maintain the ecosystem. This is done by adding nutrients and water as well as moving bugs and spores to new areas. Most of the game is spent just watching the species cohabitate the once desolate planet.I've had a lot of fun with it. I've had planet destroying swarms of locusts (a couple hundred in total) that I proceeded to exterminate and completely collapse the worlds ecosystem. I've built massive fungal forests occupied by only spiny slugs, spiders, and wasps. I've fixed a massive overpopulation of herbivores by dropping voracious mantises on them, leading to a massive overpopulation of mantis. Everytime I enjoyed myself and learned a bit more about how to balance the ecosystem.I would recommend the game if you want something to waste away the time with. It really is a lot of fun to watch.			"

												I was hoping for something that was a nice combo of chill + world management. It kinda ended up not being what I hoped on both fronts - but I think it still might be fun depending upon what you want.To start out you have to spend points (""interventions"") to spawn random plants, bugs, etc by category. They drop into their world and just do their own thing, you have no control.As you spawn stuff, it goes into your list of stuff you've seen, where you can see details - certain bugs feed off certain plant types, etc. To build a thriving ecosystem you have to spawn in specific things that are compatible with eachother.So for me having to look at a list to determine what worked well together was a little less chill than I was hoping, but at the same time having zero control over everything else was too little world management for me. I don't think it's a bad game, it was just almost-but-not-quite what I enjoy.It does work well as sort of a world-aquarium type thing. If you don't mind looking at the list of life + compatibilities to plan out what you spawn in, and just watching your life forms go about their business, then I think you'd enjoy it.			"

												Earthtongue is a quiet game about a quiet world where nothing much really happens.For some, this will be a beaming endorsement to run away from this game. But for others, such as myself, that sentence just piqued your interest.To go into more detail, Earthtongue is a small terrarium, where you are something of a diety with influence over the daily goings-on. You can either actively try to control and balance the ecosystem, or - as I did - simply let the simulation play, and check in periodically to see how things are going.So, there are two ways to look at Earthtongue: It's either a fantastic little experience to poke around in, or it's a waste of money with no gameplay. Know where you fall before you purchase, and you won't regret your decision.			"

You have to attempt to maintain stability, so it's kind of a cute little struggle to save your favorite valley from swarms of herbivores.The music is nice at first and sometimes while playing, only with certain songs. It gets a little old after a while.The journal entries and descriptions have a really nice feel to them, so I definitely like that aspect. With a bit more content, and longer progression, not just waiting, this game could be absolutely fantastic.Anyways, I definitely like it, so get it whether it's on sale or you've got money to spend or.. yea.
