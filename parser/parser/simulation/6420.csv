												If someone would ask me ""Is this a good game?"", my answer would be: ""Well, ... its how the big boys do battle!"" You dont know what im talking about? If you should play this game, you will. :)Imagine this: You are the Captain of a Heavy Cruiser. You are in a space fight. Its your ship against two others. The difference: Your ship is not very manoeuvrable. Its a large vessel. The term ""Heavy"" is no coincidence.The two enemies are smaller, Less powerfull, but more manoeuvrable. So, Captain! Give some orders! What are we going to do? You decide to go straight in. Shields up, Weapons up! Give them everything we got! After a short time, you will realise, that this may not be very effective. Well, Captain. We need a new plan. Decide! ""Plan B:First, we are using our lasers! Target for their shield device. Without shields, they are helpless.""Here we go. We are firing. First hit. Second hit. Minor damage to their shield device. Looks good. Then, our lasers stop firing. Why? Because, as mentioned, the enemies are more manoeuvrable than we are. They got behind your ship. And they keep firing. (Note: The good thing is, you dont have to press any buttons to turn your ship around. Your ship will do this for you. Tell the ship where to go, and it will do so. Because if you would also have to navigate while fighting, this would turn into a mess ..... unless you are George Takei) But here we go. Your Ship-AI activates your thrusters (Yes, you can see them doing so and it looks great). Your ship turns around. Target in front of us. First hit. Second hit. Third hit. Your lasers keep firing! HAHAHA! TAKE THIS YOU B*******!  What?...... no damage?  Why? Well, the enemy ship did just turn around. The shield device is located at the top. Your lasers DID hit the target, but the wrong side. The lasers have no effect on the Hull and there is no shield device at the rear of that vessel. The enemies keep firing. ""To Hell with them! Launch the Fighter Squadron!"" ""But Sir, they .....""""ATTACK!"" (Note: Fighters and Bombers are very effective in destroying devices. And they are fast. Rotation of enemy ships does not bother them) Your fighters are going in. ""They wont know what hit them!""Well .... your Officer tried to warn you. They have a laser flak system. Perfect for ........AI Voice: ""Fighter Squadron lost!"" Did i mention, that the enemies kept firing? Now you may say: ""What kind of idiot would do that?"" I would say: ""Vice-Admiral Norbank!"" :) You will see. There are a lot of things that can go wrong. Most of the time, it is your fault. But you will learn from your mistakes.After reloading, you will take down their flak and launch your fighters, or you will focus on their engines so that they wont be able to outmanoeuvre you. Shields of the first ship are down? Let your laser aim for the devices of the second ship and activate your hull damaging weapons to finish the first one. There are a lot of possibilities.There are situations, when you need a lot of patience. Even when flying trough space. Your ships wont charge in an instant after you gave the ""Move"" command! They are Heavy Cruisers with Fusion Engines! What do you expect?It will take two seconds to heat up, then your ship will start moving. Simple rule: The bigger they are, the slower they move. Last words: The Mission ""The Fight for Earth"" was one of the most entertaining missions i have ever played in a Space-Sim. And it was one of the hardest missions in this game. (Dont worry, you WILL restart the mission if you play it for the first time)Advice: Dont start with the highest difficulty level. You wont stand a chance. My opinion: Yes! It is a good game. I had a lot of fun playing it. It is not a perfect game but it many good moments, it is entertaining (very important for a game) and it has an awesome ""Final"" Battle.Therefore: 6.5 out of 10.			"

												I came across Nexus - The Jupiter Incident while searching for a game that would give me the feeling of commanding a capital ship in space battles that I used to enjoy in Star Trek Online before that game became the treadmill grinder it is today.  I can honestly say that this game nails capital ship combat, far better than any game I have played before.Ship maneuvering feels solid.  It feels like you are actually commanding a ship with mass, and not something like a fighter.  Don't expect to be moving fast or nimbly.  A great touch is the fact the game designers put a lot of though in the design of the ships, putting breaking engines in front as well as smaller engines around the ships that fire when the ship is adjusting course or holding position.  It's nice to see a game where ships actually follow the laws of physics and don't just stop like someone pressed on the brake.Because of the pace of the ships, this game is a lot more focused on tactics than other strategy games.  You have to really pay attention to your mission onjectives and thus ship loadouts, as picking the wrong setup can lead to mission failure easily.  There is a learning curve due to the level of complexity in targeting and ship management, but it is not intimidating.A bonus with this game is that is moddable, so if you wish you can command a Battlestar or even one of the destroyers from Babylon 5.  I would recommend playing the vanilla game through first before trying out the mods.  If you are really into tactical strategy games involving capital ships, you can't go wrong picking this title up.  Casual fans of RTS games may want to wait until it is on sale though because the learning curve may frustrate some.			"

												A rollicking good 25 hour space opera. The tactical battles are difficult but fun and upgrading your ships with new goodies is gratifying. It's even fun to hate Admiral Norbank, who has got to be one of the biggest asses ever put into a video game. The gameplay is unique in that you have a relatively small fleet of large, powerful capital ships that do not maneuver quickly and have multiple weapon systems. They have a weight to them that feels awesome.There are a lot of tools available for modding the game but precious little has been done with them... not sure why. I got the game for $2.49, figuring for that price I could hardly go wrong. I was completely stunned at what I got and I can't figure out how I managed to miss this gem. Even if it isn't on sale it's worth every penny. If you like Sins of a Solar Empire or Homeworld then I can't imagine how you wouldn't like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident. Oh... and the Angelwing is simply an awesome craft that you can hardly help getting attached to.I've seen a lot of bad reviews that complained that the game wouldn't run or that it crashed a lot. I'm not sure what their issue is but I can say that Nexus ran fine on my system (Windows 7, Intel CPU, Nvidia GPU) and I never crashed once while playing. On my original playthrough, the game lost some key bindings when I alt-tabbed out and it didn't have any Steam Integration, so I couldn't use shift-tab to access messages and whatnot. I also had to create my own desktop shortcut, as the game wouldn't run via the Steam generated desktop shortcut. The in-game videos also ran choppy from time to time, which was odd. ALL of this has been fixed with a recent update. Current generation resolutions are supported, it has Steam Integration, and the videos now run smooth as silk, though they are somewhat low res when compared to gameplay resolutions of 1920x1080 or higher. The game always looked good but now it looks better than ever! I'm finding myself just as captivated with the story, visuals, and gameplay on my second playthrough as when I first played it. Simply astonishing! If you have been on the fence about getting Nexus, don't wait another moment.Hint: Read the manual. It won't take long, as the information is very concise, but there are some nuances to successful navigation (how to create your own navigation points), using all your weapons (how to attack multiple targets at once), and managing systems that you won't get from the in-game advice popups.  :)			"

												Great and intense space battles with cruisers, destroyers, fighter carriers and other heavy class battleships.  Real time with pause -gameplay works ok and reminds me of old Interplay classic game ""Star Trek: Starfleet Command"". During a battle, various weapons and resources play differing roles. Lasers and other beam weapons are used mainly for disabling enemy devices. Large missiles are slow and can be shot down with small fighters or FLAK-systems but have massive blast radius. Gatling guns, rail guns, plasma weapons and torpedoes are for hull destruction. Energy bombs are used for anti-shield purposes. Weapon power generators. Sensor arrays for detecting enemy equipment, ECM systems, ECCM systems!! And your battleship can hold few squadrons of small fighters, bombers, gunboats (or shuttles packed with space marine commando teams).Visually game still looks very good after all of these years! The game difficulty can be pretty frustrating.. Even beginner difficulty level is really hard. Players who donâ€™t manage their fleets very carefully are going to find themselves in pretty terrible situations, fast and brutal!Some useful keyboard shortcuts (not explained in tutorial mode during first missions):[ N ] - Yes! You actually can create custom NAV points![ S ] - Select all fighters and other smaller craft.[ A ] - Select all large ships.[ CTRL ] + [ S ] - Select all fighters from selected large ship.[ M ] - Manual control panel on or off. [ R ] - Repair panel on or off.

												This is one of the games you can refer to as a hidden gem, largely ignored but actually quite incredible, which is a terrible shame. Metacritics and the score is mainly bashed down due to the learning curve and massive technical aspects.Mission briefings give you fully explorable solar systems, with impressive lighting looking akin to something from KSP.Ship explosions look really good, there's no magically disappearing models, and they even launch escape pods.The ships can be disabled as well and proceed to drift in space (but can still be destroyed)Ship systems are fully modular, which is a crucial aspect of the game campaign, these systems can be targeted and disabled as well. (shoot all engines and the ship stops).Ship movement looks far more real and is far, far less arcade like than the vast majority of mass produced space RTS you find today, they even have small directional engines on board that are fired when the ships turn.The learning curve is indeed very steep, but if you can overcome the vast technical aspects the game offers you'll find yourself a space combat RTS which is Homeworld tier good, it really is worth a try, and this is a game from 2004.

												Wow. Well, I don't even know where to start with this game. I first played it when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it right away. The game is difficult, so at that time with hardly any experience in the field I got stuck pretty early in the game, specifically the scout ship mission.Boy was I in for a ride 7 years later. Everything is just the way I remembered it. Controls are a bit rough around the edges, but it is what would be expected of battleships. Aside from that and a slightly flawed AI, there is nothing I can't recommend in this game to those who love sci-fi. The story is well laid out, no particular flaws. Battles are sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, harsh and unfair, and I can't even start explaining the frustration in the last battle mission (Not to be confounded with the last mission).Yet here I am, 14.5 hours into the game, finishing it for the first time. There are no words to describe my satisfaction, along with my sadness of it ending and the dismay of not ever being able to see a sequel to this magnificent masterwork.As a note to the developers, who might never read this review, thank you for such a great game. It's an element which shaped my imagination beyond most books. Definitely placed along my all time top 5.			"

												it is a classic one, a real classic. I first stumbled on it was few months after its release.i bought the original CD pack & played for some time but due to having a low performance pc, it soon get abandoned.then only few months ago destiny has brought me to it again in Steam.i was really surprised that after such long years it's still available. so without any further thinking i bought & installed into my new pc. It was a superb game back in 2005 when i still have the CD pack & it still is a great game now in 2015.i spent hours & days on it, offline mode. It's awesome, the gameplay, the story, the designs of the ships etc etc.it's simply the best game i've played in its category.			"

												Everything i wanted from a space combat game. THe story is surprisingly enthralling and the combat can be, while difficult to master, quite precise. I enjoy the pause feature allowing for a far more tactical approach to combat. I havent played the MP but if the quality of the single player is anything to go off of i would highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to scratch the space combat/sim itch. Think Empire at War's space combat meets the strategic free space movement of EVE...			"

												The best tactical space battle sim/game out thereYou have control over all systems in the ship!Here comes a long paragraph you should readThe ship behaves like it would in real life if it existed, the thrusters fire and it accelerates to its cruise speed, it even overshoots a bit then cuts the thrusters and uses reverse thrusters to slow down THEN re-engages the forwards thruster to maintaine cruise. When the ship is trying to manuevar around and obtsacle or around an enemy you wil clearly see it firing its reaction control thrusters to spin it or strafe around. The greatest part is if you install auxiliary engines like deflection engines or combat drives then the ship uses main thrusters to get close to the enemy and engages the combat drive and you see it spinnign and dancing around the enemy to make it impossible for them to target specific devices of your all thr while destroying what ever system you have targeted with its own weapon. I like being able to decide what kind of ship I want to fly, for example I can set it up to be deivce killer, get close and knock out there weapon generators and shields with my lasers and bombard them with torpedoes or fit it with bubble energy shells which drains shields then destroy the hull with either torpedoes or mass drivers. If you want to be a bad â™¥â™¥â™¥ you can equip battleship grade weapons on you little ship like long range CRISIS energy torpedos which (if they hit) will utterly destroy the enemies shields (they can be dodged easily if the enemy has a combat drive equipped), after dropping the enemies shields launch some BIG BANG EM missiles and watch as the brightest explosion you've ever seen destroyes there hull (if their flak system didnt shoot down the missile). Most later missions you get some small ships with a torpedo boat and ofcourse your own unique flag ship, you get to allocated resource points for each ship being able to decide what each will focus on, you could for exmaple have the small quick and agile ships focus on taking down devices like shields and weapons of an enemy with lasers which bypass shields so your torpedo boat can come in and annihalate them or have all of your ships work in unison to bombard their shields with energy shells after which they, in unison, wreck the hulls with mass drivers. I've literraly been playing this game since 2004 and have never gotten tired of it, even with online being down. Its just so good, theres nothign else which comes close to the realism of the zero-g physics which you will clearly see. Theres no game out there that has the cinematic feel this one does, you just sit there as these large capital ships lumber around slowly firing thrusters left and right trying to maneuver around each other to get the best firing position, you will never see any other game that has the same shield ddynamics this one has, a projectile comes towards you and it just smashes in to your bubble shield, the shield reacts, you see magnetic distortion in it as it stabalizes then dissapears and recharges. You wanna be faster? just allocate more power to the engines, you want shields to recharge faster? just give em more power, wait your out of stored energy? turn off support systems and your engines and let the storage batteries recharge. I've played this game dozens of times, and will play it more and more, its just sad that nexus 2 never got the funding it sohuld have, maybe the creators waited to long to bring it back... Only a select few know about this game, shame.			"

 Just WOW!I all ready lost hope that I would ever use this words ever but here it is. NEXUS is the best tactical space combat strategy game I EVER played. Yes it has couple of bugs and there are thing or two that they could make better but as concept and following execution of that concept just WOW. So let me put it together for you. You are commander of group of capital ships (from one up to ten) starting from corvets all the way to battle cruisers. You do not produce you do not collect resources or any of that crap. You have your little fleet and task front of you. Now that seem pretty dull when you say it but once you get trough the controls (strongly sugget to play tutorial) you find out that you can control each subsystem of each ship and that is freeking awesome!Having limited resouces (means ships) giving this game completly diferent dimension. You will think twice to send your destroyer class against two frigates only to see it blown up. There are no reinforcements there is no help comming and in freezing cold of space noone will hear you scream. You will learn to utilitaze your power creating diversions and new strategies depending from ship to ship. And you will cheer your self for every mauver that put you one step closer to victory.Now as I did finish all the praises there are as usual some problems as well. Tutorial is ok but still suck. Learnig curve is so steap it puts 90degree angle to shame and menu with hud is ...... well bit chaotic. Graphics are Ok but keep in mind that this was made 2004.Frankly I still dont understand why the sequel did not come to live or why someone didnt made remake of this beutiful game.All and all I would sumarise like this. If you like Kerbal space program this is for you, if you like tactical games with anal attention to detail like men of war this is for you, if you like capital ship battles and your secret dream is to be like Commander Bill ""Husker"" Adama and have your own Battlestar this is for you. If by any chance are so mentaly damaged like me and like all those things you will be in heaven I can promise you that.Verdict as fan 10/10Verdict as objective player 8.5/10			"

												Nexus The Jupiter Incident is one of those games that you wish had gotten popular simply because it deserves a sequel and copycats. It is a stunningly atmospheric game with highly complex, yet easy to use space combat. It is a Space Opera in the truest sense of the word.You start the as spaceship captain Marcus Cromwell in command of the Stiletto out on the fringes of the solar system on patrol. Things quickly pick up speed however as aliens, wormholes and other outside forces conspire to put you smack dab in the middle of an epic conflict between various hostile alien armadas and a lost remnant of humanity. As you progress through the game your own fleet grows in size and power, new characters join your side and you will often get little role playing elements in the missions letting your chose how to proceed.Although from the outside Nexus might look like a classic space RTS in the same vein as the Homeworld games the similarities are limited. In Nexus you command a small flotilla, each ship is named and upgradeable. Should one of your ships be destroyed it will be gone for good and you will be that much weaker in missions ahead. You progress through a series of linear missions, each one putting your fleet in a small area of space with primary and secondary tasks to complete. To accomplish this you must use your fleet and their abilities as best you can. Each ship having a number of different controls allowing you to maximize it's efficiency by directing power to various systems, commanding fighters, bombers and gunships, or using various different weapons when appropriate.In terms of difficulty Nexus provides a somewhat uneven experience, although most of the missions that involved fighting are balanced and challenging the ones that involved stealth tends to be nothing more than an exercise in frustration leaving you reloading your save game repeatedly until you get it right.Graphically the game is absolutely stunning. Space has never looked this beautiful, from the asteroids you pass by to the ripples in your shields when they get struck everything in this game oozes atmosphere. In terms of sound Nexus is a very quiet game which only adds to the immersion and experience of silent space although a good soundtrack playing on your stereo whenever you boot up this game is something I can only recommend.Some bugs and the lack of anyone playing the multi-player, even at release, are the only other negatives I can think of. A decent selection of pretty high quality mods greatly extends the life expectancy of this game.All in all, Nexus The Jupiter Incident is what you want from a tactical space opera, it hits on almost every mark short of the multi-player aspects and provides an absolutely stellar experience filled to the rim with atmosphere and tense space battles.

												AN ONE of a KIND... An almost REAL Capital Ship Simulator!I played this game when it really came out. I was impressed. The idea has NOT been bypassed yet.But let's take things from the start. With what you could compare this game... Star Trek Starfleet Command, Star Trek: Bridge Commander, Star Trek: Legacy or Homeworld series? NONE of them.What you'll see in this game. Capital ships fighting each other in most cases. There are 6 races in the game: The Vardrags, the Ghosts, the Gorgs, the Raptors, Humans and the Locust. Each one with different ships, classes of ships and they are many and their own weapons and technologies. When you go on a battle you have to configure every ship.A ship has power source(Reactor), two or three engines(travel engine,secondary engine and combat engine),pairs of weapons on each side,shield, ECM and ECCM modules,fighters and commandos slots, extra batteries that refill from the core extra power supply,individual distribution of energy to every system.The idea... Yes... We've seen many movies and some of us played many sci-fi games. We've seen pilots that can see the space through some kind of glass and guidance of the ship directly. Lies... Those are not going to happen in space battles. Only cameras can give a line of sight, radars and when a ship is in combat in many cases is its computer that decides how to move, because it's faster. But don't worry. You'll see the ships from outside. The ships as presaid have pairs of weapons in each side able to fire in 180 degrees in each axis. The ships have many subsystems as I said upper. Every ship turns itself around itself hiding its subsystems and turning every gun to the opponent until the other one is loaded again. That's why the ships computer does control the ship in automatic mode. At the same time every ship tries to keep a good distance to the opponent for no collision and to shoot at him where it needs.EVERY ship has 4 Modes of reacting.    -The complete auto mode that is the main mode. In this stasis the ship completely automates everything. It does NOT overeact to make a difference and it is based completely to the ships main configurations. The ship will try to attack an enemy with all the weapons NEEDED.   -The fighting one that delivers the most power to the weapons. Like the Auto mode but it will fire with every weapon possible and maybe overload the weapons so to fire quicker.   -The Defensive or Guarding mode delivers more power to shield and engines, so the ship can hold. Only NEEDED weapons will fire in EVERY target.ALL THE UPPER MODES WILL FIRE A DIFFERENT TARGET ONLY WITHIN RANGE AND ONLY IF A WEAPON IS LOADED AND THE MAIN TARGET IS NOT AVAILABLE. YOUR SHIPS SHIELDS WILL BE LOWERED AFTER THE BATTLE AND IF OTHER SHIPS ARE IN GREAT DISTANCE. THEY WILL BE RAISED AGAIN IN SOME DISTANCE BEFORE AN OPPONENT.This is extremely bad in some situations because they need time to recharge in FULL capacity.   -The MANUAL mode. This will be the permanent mode when you'll play a bit. Believe me there is NO other way. You can aim every target individually within distance, enable or disable every system and overload whatever you want.(Overloading systems make them more efficient but they drain the batteries or make other systems work lower or none at all. If there is NOT enough power it will be automatically set to normal for the ship to work. Take EXTREMELY CARE with this function. It makes the difference in battle but sometimes you may lose if your ship fails you)You will be able to make priorities in system repairs if a system have been disabled in this mode.There are 3 different types of weapons   - Energy weapons are the MOST used in every ship. The most of them are Shield Disablers but there are some Hull Destruction weapons too. They have unlimited power that comes from the ships Core. The usage distance is low.   - Ammo or Missile weapons are limited and are HULL destructive. Not usable with opponent's shields ON. Usage distance low too.   - Artillery weapons. High Explosive weapons that are LIMITED and can damage HULL even through opponent's shields but NOT much. It is about the ship class too. Completely destructive if the opponent's shields are down. Usage distance GREAT so don't wait a ship to fire artillery next to the opponent. It will try to make a GREAT distance first.  Customization of a ship is important. Every ship dependant of its class has several slots for enything. Maybe can have two power cores if the first fails or destroyed, two or three engines, several pairs of weapons ,batteries and special slots. You have to know what you'll use the ship before you configure it. It depends on the way you play too.  Generally, the large ships configuration has shield disablers and ammo and artillery weapons. Because of the great mass and the limited movement of theirs they'll try destroy the opponent instantly. They also have great HULL and shields. But because of their great mass and limited movement their subsystems are totally exposed to smaller ships and maybe fighters.  So small ships those fighters and commando ships but if the ship has no flak weapons to destroy them automatically they can be the success in a battle. Flaks are also destroy missiles, bombs, torpedoes and generally artillery weapons. It's a MUST to have at LEAST a pair in every ship.  Smaller ships like frigates have better movement but are weaker in MASS, shields, in the amount of weapons and  destructive power. Though they are much valuable.Imagine a frigate with a very strong energy core and great engines. You'll see that it will dance all over the opponent without him being able to destroy it, while the frigate will aim directly to the subsystems. Imagine now a large ship without shield disablers. Their ammo weapons will be for nothing if they can NOT penetrate the shields. Imagine now a large cruiser without engines. Funny? It can't hide its subsystems and it can't turn its weapons against you... So it's completely vulnerable because the next system you'll destroy is the shield one. And then GAME OVER ...In combat the most ships use their secondary engine or the combat engine. Very few times in collaboration with the travel engine as it is for travelling large distances. The secondary and combat engines are the ones that turning the ship around all the time. So, if you don't install one on a ship you'll see it can have an efficient fight even with every possible weapon ON.As you can imagine here this is NOT a normal game you've seen. The developpers tried to catch reality in most cases. A great masterpiece in simulation gaming.And now let's go to the cons...  -The game is a little buggy. In many cases does different things but NOT so much for not playing it. The feelings after that game will be... WELL , try it and tell me.  -Another one is the Multiplayer thing. They made a game SO GREAT but without Multiplayer support. To get to the multiplayer you have to follow the online guide through Steam. Say a THANKS to this guy. Well done to him. But let's go to MORE...  -Not many maps for Multiplayer. There are very few and without AI the most of them so .. with an OLD game that its public is limited you'll find yourself trying to play WarCraft 2 or 1 nowadays with an internet human player opponent. Sit and wait till... tomorrow? or more?  -Individual waypoints of a ship. Yes, they forgot to make a fix here. There are times that I want to make the ship take a course that I want. Better battle, hiding in asteroids or whatever. In Multiplayer it would be a VERY HELPFUL advantage. But NO, it does NOT exhist.  -Completeley lack of saving or remembering the configurations done in multiplayer.STILL THE BEST CAPITAL SHIP SIMULATOR EVER..................................			"

												Classic game with a classic challenge, not like many of the modenr command and control sims coming out where you simply need to have the biggest gun. Here you need to have the right gun for the right job and make sure you fit it first. you also need strategy, what worked last time may not this timeis a great gam, the story i personally find a little slow, but the gameplay is amazing. I spent ages trying to remember the name of this game after having played an old pc demo cd beck when i was a kid and couldnt afford it. suprised it wasnt abandonware, but regardless was worth every cent.

												Nexus is a rare beast of a game, a tactical Starship combat simulator where you command small numbers of Warships and lead them into battle. There is no grand empires to build or Starfighters to command, rather you are thrown into the cut and thrust of ship to ship combat where a wrong decision on where to allocate your ships limited power supply or what device to target can have disastrous consequences. Though an older game, the graphics are still as amazing as they were when it first came out with the eye-candy of stars, planets, moons and asteroid belts. Nexus covers a topic that is sadly rarely covered in video games and is all the better for it.If you like seeing capital ships pounding one another in the vast reaches of space, then this game is for you.

												Do you like RTS games? Do you like space games? Have you played FTL, and did you like it? Do you like Star Trek? If your answer to any of those questions is 'yes', you should pick this up. If your answer to ALL of those questions is 'yes', you'll probably love this game.Yes, it's nearly 12 years old. Doesn't matter. The interface seems a little complicated, but it's actually fairly straightforward. Yes, the AI can be a bit dimwitted at times, but the game plays very well. For a 12 year old game, the graphics are fantastic when turned all the way up. I'm running everything at max, 1920x1080, and even with VSync enabled, I'm riding a constant, comfortable 144fps to go with my 144hz monitor and my GTX-970 is barely lifting a finger. Sound quality is pretty decent too, even if the voice acting is a bit overly dramatic. So far it's running fairly stable on Windows 10, about 5-6 missions in.Is the game worth $10? Yes. Is it worth $2.49 on sale? Absolutely, no question. Pick it up.Full disclosure: I also played this game when it was brand-new back in 2004. The game honestly feels like it plays better now than it did back then.			"

												One of the best spaceship strategy games, I've played.Campaign is good with different variety of missions.Manually manage the ship's system such as setting the strength of your shield, speed of your engines, set different targets to your weapon or disable different systems so that you can power your weapon/shield/engine pass 100%. But you can only customize the insides of your ship.Haven't tried Multiplayer			"

												The game is fantastic for players seeking a tactical experience, being able to outfit your ships with whatever weapons you want, and using them as you see fit. Be warned though, there are some bugs/glitches that show up after playing for a long session. Namely your units failing to follow your orders, or they magically refuse to use their anti ship weaponry when commanded to do raw damage against an enemy's hull.			"

												This is another one of those gems that you don't see too often. Although the game takes a little while to load up. It's truly spectacular. The single best space game that I have ever played. It has the best engine ever made for starship combat unfortunately for whatever reason it didn't meet the sales that it needed at the time of it's inception so there's no hope for a sequel. There's plenty of mods that people love to play around with but the worst part about this game is that it ends.			"

												There isn't much to say to this except: One of the best space games, ever.I played a lot more of this when it wasn't on steam yet. Some would consider it the third best space game of all time after Freespace and Homeworld. But as with all these things, opinion is very subjective. It's still very playable today.			"

												Alas poor Nexus, I knew thee well.SummaryNexus: The Jupiter Incident is a Real-Time Strategy tactical space combat game that incorporates realistic physics and dynamics involving warfare within the vacuum of space.The story follows a man named Marcus Cromwell as he serves one of Earth's megacorporations to defend their regions of the Solar System from their corporate rivals.Along his travels, he discovers a self-aware AI known as Angel who warns of an impending apocalypse upon all organic life in the galaxy and that Marcus is the only one who can stop it.ProsThis game embodies scientific accuracy from ship movements to how space explosions work.There are nukes and superlasers in this game and they're awesome.The story is rather original and features a collection of unique characters and aliens.There are a multitude of different mission types such as stealth, escort, and base defense.You have complete control over every ship's customization from weapon loadouts to fighters.You can pause the game at any moment to plan out your strategies ahead of time.As of 2016, this game is compatible with Steam Workshop, allowing for user-made mods.ConsThe camera may cause nausea. (you can view a ship from any angle even upside-down)The story feels a bit rushed and the characters, although impressive, are not memorable.Destroying hardpoints renders ships easier to kill, but the same applies to you as well.There is permadeath in the campaign, if you lose your ships, they're gone forever.You only control a total of eight ships while the rest are all temporary, which isn't bad, but the game hints at the idea of hijacking ships, which is impossible except through mods.Because of how the AI works, you're likely to fail some of the secondary objectives.ConclusionThis game is one of those ""almost but not quite"".It has great features worthy of a few playthroughs, but it's now often overlooked.It's got its flaws, but at least it's trying its best and that deserves some respect.Bonus FactsThe funny thing is, Jupiter is only seen in the background for the first few missions and then never seen again for the rest of the game even though the trailer sets it up as a major plot device, which I feel is false advertisement.In addition, the creators planned to make a sequel, but sadly didn't get enough funds. (Twice!)			"

												I've played EVE on and off since 2007. So why do I prefer this game every day of the week? Realism. With all due respect to EVE and the understanding of technical limitations, etc: Nexus gave me what I needed. MMOs can be great, but for single-player this game is astounding. Full ship module customization: from weapons to shields to support systems to engines to fighters and more. An actual visible shield bubble around your ship that flashes when hit by enemy energy weapons. The Combat and Deflection engines make for amazing moments, enabling you to narrowly dodge hundreds of battleship-class projectiles that would otherwise shred your frigates and destroyers. The ability to target specific enemy modules, and having to have a good scanner to detect a ship's weapons and systems in the first place. Great fleet battle command controls and more. Unknown space anomalies, allies and enemies that actually make you go ""what the hell!?"" A very frenetic but fantastic automated drone/fighter system as well. I'm not a rogue type of player in the least, yet I applaud the inclusion of various stealth drives, cloaking, ECM, ECCM, and even jamming shields. Did I mention how fantastic it is to view a ship taking hull damage, let alone the sectional explosions leading up to the ship explosion? And memorable stories & characters to boot. Phenomenal. An under-appreciated space combat game. If you're the kind of gamer that prefers more realism than just pure fantasy in your spaceship-combat games, this title may be for you. If you are considering this game and want to know more, PLEASE ask me. I swear by this game but I will also answer questions objectively.			"

												They just updated the game, a game I would have recommended without the 'HD-patch' they just released.This game is pretty cool. To give you a review that brings it a bit different; Think Homeworld, but now you do not build ships, you aquire some throughout the campaign. For the rest it is very similair, expect you do not have to send out collectors to gather resources. You also have a bit more options than setting an agressive of defensive stance.The game makes you expand your fleet throughout the campaign and offers a certain freedom in the upgrades you apply to your ships. Then once you are in a mission you can give very specific orders, or let the ships do as they will. The last probably wont be too succesfull though, but that is pretty much what makes this game good. It allows you do make your ships do all sort of things, target specific equipment on enemy ships, make artillery strikes on incoming enemies, and sooo much more. Often these things can hurt you as much as they can help you, so some thought is required and you should also not forget the AI can do the same to you.			"

												As a long time Homeworld addict ( both original and remastered ) I bumped intonothing less than a little gem when browsing the Holiday Sales.Do not be fooled by the original release date. Graphics and 3D have been upgradedto todays standard. The story line is very addictive and incites to complete mission after mission.While Homeworld is all about building ships and enemy crushing tactics, Nexus TJI provides for much finer and detailled ship management up to the level of manually tuning every ship system. Missions teach in a gradual way more and more elaborate controls and tactics.Really love this game after only a few hours and for the Holiday Sales price it's a giveway.If you like Homeworld series, you will for sure appreciate Nexus TJI.

												I don't know why I haven't written a report on this game before. I've played since the year it came out before I had it on steam I remembered I had loads of fun and it was one of the best games I've ever played. Years past and I lost my CD and than decided to buy it again on steam, and once again after all those years I found myself completly immersed in its universe. The story and gameplay are amazing as well as the graphics. The only badside perhaps is that it doesn't have a skirmish mode, however there is a mod for that which allows you to have skirmish battles. If you are a sci-fi fan than this game is a must!			"

												Warning, this review is based on my several years old experience, haven't played that since, only for a few minutes. YOu can skip to bottom for TL;DR part.Brilliant! I've spent approx 100 with this game (only in campaign!) and it is incredibly tactical. Maybe Homeworld seems to you too much arcadish? Well, this one is more like hardcore tactical RTS :) You can assign orders even to last single battery on your corvette, but don't forget yourself! Too much micromanagement can kill you very quickly. Solution can be a lot of pausing, or simply giving orders in such manner, your ships will perform well even without your intervention, so you can take care of top priorities. Protect your ships, bring them from mission to mission throughout whole campaign and be sure your crew gathers experience, because experience can be more valuable than guns and armor itself.And atmosphere is still ""realistic"". As realistic as it can be in space opera RTS :)) Thanks to music, graphics (right now I mean long trails behind ships, design of Earth ships and other details, not beauty of textures, lights or shadows, more on that in next paragraph...) storrytelling and proportional grow of your forces you get first grade experience. First you start with a single ship that travel from Earth to Jupiter for eight months. That seems to be kinda fast for today's technology, isn't it? Well, wait for your first alien ship that carries you from system to system in no time, compared to Stilleto (your first ship). It takes like ages of ingame time, to get Angelo (if I remember the name correctly), but that makes it even more rewarding. Later you will get another ship to your current one, so you will be able to use two of them. When your fleet grows to number of like 5 ships, you will feel invincible.Today they released patch (first one after years of inactivity) that brings the game to full HD. I realized how much time passed since I started Nexus for last time. Graphics looks really old, but playability seems to be still very high.I really hope in more updates, possibly in remastered edition or even brand new game? (ehm, inspirated by not named studio, right?)TL;DRIf you are fan of space opera where you take care of your ships and where you can really enjoy tactical decisions and story, definitely buy this game while in discount like today's one. For current price 2,49 Euro, it's a must. Even when it's priced on it's full 10 euro, it can be a good buy.			"

												Great storyGreat gameplayGreat mission designThis game has lots going for it, being quite different from your average sci fi space game. It's been marketed as a 'capital ship combat simulator' which isn't too far from the truth. You command a large frigate in this game meaning you have shields and various weapons systems to manage while in combat. This makes for really fun and interesting gameplay. Add to that a rich and engaging story that grabs you from the start and slowly unfolds as the game progresses and you're onto a winner.Nexus is the kind of game I love, and it deserves to be in your games list!

												One of the best RTS space game I played... Had a cracked version of it when it came out then bought it as it was awesome and now I have the steam version.Pros:- Looks good even 12 years after it first came out- Game mechanics are easy to understand and still make a lot of complex actions and strategies available- Story is good, even if it is quite predictable- Characters are lovable and you can quite identify with the main protagonistsCons: - Can feel random sometimes- Very linear- No sequel planned at this timeAs you may have understood, I really loved that game back then, and I still do.

												Wow. This game brings tactical 3D space RTS to the next level. Homeworld was one of my favorite games, but the level of detail put into the balance of this game is stunning. Ships compete and dish out damage in a unique number of ways adding some rock/paper/scissor elements I love. Also no giant cruiser ship is going down in a few seconds here so there is long-term strategy involved in battles with time to adjust micromanagement of individual ships. I love that part. The big caveat though is there is no skirmish generator to keep enjoying the mechanics after single-player making this purely a single-player experience. I curse fate for not allowing the sequel to make it on kickstarter, but the creators still seem motivated on their facebook page.PS - back in the day you could never finish the second to last mission due to the massive load on your graphics cards and CPU. Now luckily you can play this game without having that fear if you got the latest hardware. You will just have to find some work-arounds for the higher screen resolution and window size customization. It is worth it though.			"

												Extremely enjoyable game, not going to lie. The story is a major driving factor, along with the space movements, management, combat, and more realistic feeling.Pros:-Enjoyable gameplay with variety in the levels, envionments, ship design, and more.-Customizable ship loadouts, allowing you to go in with the equipment you want. You can customize weapons, special weapons, engines, shields, generators, and more.-It's a very long game so if you enjoy it it's well worth the money.-You can command multiple ships, and manage each either manually or with help from the AI, which is suprisingly competent, as they will target key systems on your ship. -Pleasant voice-overs of the plot, as the transitions from act to act is voiced by an extremely pleasant voice.-The game runs unbelievably smoothly.-Enormous levels to partake in, although it is 99% empty space.-The game is extremely good at giving you terrible situations but giving you just enough weaponry to steal the day, making it a game that will give you plenty of satisfaction.Cons:-The camera is rather clunky, as it will lock to a certain axis and not move unless you make very specific camera movements.-Some levels are unfair without lots of trial and error, meaning certain levels can be utterly repetitive.-The game never directly tells you about the ship customization option, and some missions can be nigh impossible without a proper loadout.-You do not choose which ships to go into battle with. The only ship you are certain to go with is A) for the early bit, the Stiletto, or B) The Angelwing. All others are strictly variables, which can make the experience a bit depressing when you kit a certain destroyer out only to have it removed for two missions in a row.-Some voices are pretty bad, but others are acceptable, while Marcus himself has a Morgan Freeman tier voice during transitions.Neutral:-Missions can take a very long time depending on your play style, so people with strict scheduals might be daunted.-The soundtrack isn't bad, but isn't good either, as it can feel a bit repetitive when it repeats multiple times, but certain tracks are epic and enjoyable.Story:Set in the near distant future, Nexus - The Jupiter Incident places you into the role of Captain Marcus Cromwell, the son of one of the most influential men of the era, as you work your way through the ranks. You take up when Marcus arrives on an outer moon of Jupiter, and slowly begin to unravel a plot of epic proportion.Plot: (SPOILERS)After the discovery of the Angelwing - an advanced alien spacecraft - and an Artificial Intelligence known as Angel, Marcus and the crew flee through a wormhole away from a mechanoid - an extremely powerful device that is invulnerable to traditional weaponry. The plot expands outward to galactic empires warring against each other and the systematic capturing of earth by these mechanoids. It is down to Marcus and the crew of the Angelwing to rescue earth and defeat the mechanoids, and perhaps save a few space empires in the process.(SPOILERS END HERE)All in all, I give the game a solid 8/10, an extremely impressive game for something that has come out so long ago. My recommendation for a game similar to this is Homeworld Remastered Edition.			"

												Highly recommende if you are a fan of space game, military freak, and an OCDC like me.Pros- Graphics is magestic.  Space is vast and captivating. Everything is up to their sizes. From smallest fighters to grand battleships to the asteroid fields or whole planets. This game is a truely immersive experience.- Details are superb.  All the smaller detaisl of the shield deflecting gunshots, different engins giving off different effects, all those jets coming out from all the small ports trying to get the ships in to positions. Just mavelous.- Micromanage to the highest level.  All your devices, shields, guns, engines, ECM, ECCM, can be turn on/off at will to direct energy to where you need most. And you can do that on ALL ships, not just your hero ship.  Want to feel like captain Kirk yelling ""Shields up! Ready the lasers!""? Hear ya go!- Combat is fun and challenging.  You can adjust your loadout to fit your liking and it will differ you playstyle too. Cons- Camera management is hard.  Sometimes annoying.- Still some bugs. - Combat equire heavy pausing and micromanagement to get the best performance out of your every ships. The ""auto"" mode is just too stupid.- Levels are hard. I routinely restart/reload a level 10+ times in order to get the best possible results.  (But the feeling of accomplishment after you can finally perfectly excecute the plans and formation you've been working on and tried for 10+ times is very satisfying.)All in all. Just grab it. It worth much more than it's current price. "
