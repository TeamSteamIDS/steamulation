Early Access Review
TL;DR: Robocraft did not deliver on the potential it promised and instead changed the core gameplay mechanics to mimic other shooters, destroying what made the game unique.I have played this game for over 3000 hours (the standalone launcher does not add to steam hours) and supported the game with over 100GBP (150$+). I was a moderator for the game because I believed in it and wanted to support the community, but was removed from the team because I spoke out to a developer about the direction they were taking – not because I wasn't doing my job, but because I spoke my mind. The game has changed. Freejam have tried to make the game more accessible to new players, with a focus of getting as many players as possible. But instead of focussing on what made the game great and trying to get players to love it, they changed the gameplay mechanics in order to please a wider audience, which destroyed many aspects of what made the game great and unique in the first place.Instead of a currency reward system that allows players to buy the parts they want for their robots, they now have a ""random loot crate"" reward system, which is a blatant attempt at copying other games and trying to trick people into spending real money on the game. Non-premium users get tempted by the items that they could have received if they had paid for premium (every loot crate that gets opened show the premium items) with the option to purchase it now to receive the items. Furthermore, only the top scoring player on the winning team receives the highest level crate (which promises better item drop chances), while every member of the losing team receives the same low quality crate. This leads to selfish play for the highest score rather than the rewarding teamplay experience that it used to be, and also leads to the losing team to stop trying because they receive the same bad rewards either way.They also made the most interesting part about the game – the fact that building skill and design decisions directly affects battle performance – much less meaningful over the last couple of months, by removing the pilot seat component, introducing auto-healing (another aspect to mimic other shooters), and allowing each player to put several different gun types on their robots, which removes the need for playstyle specialisations. This also negatively affects teamplay, because there is no use for dedicated medics or dedicated frontline or support types – every player is now a (selfish) one-man-army trying to score the highest points.This game had a lot of potential a year ago, but the developer's decisions over the last updates have shown that they care less about making a good game and more about the money they can make by trying to get more players with lower skill levels, by copying other generic shooter-types and removing/reducing the unique aspects that used to make Robocraft great.Freejam have gone the way many F2P games go and opted for the cash-grab alternative. It is disappointing, because there was so much potential.UPDATE: After two and a half weeks, the lead game designer released a ""state of the game"" letter, which conveniently failed to address any of the points the community has brought up in their feedback. This, to me, puts the final nail in the coffin. These developers do not care for the quality of their game or their community, they are only out for new players for their statistics and wallets. "

Early Access Review
								Man, a couple years ago when I first started playing this game, it was so much fun! There was a balanced matchmaking system and every weapon was usable. Then they added things like nano-bot weapons (medics), and the Boss Battle mode, which allowed 1 Insanely powerful bot, or 4 pretty strong bots, to go up against a full team of low-level bots. Then they decided to remove the Tech-Tree, forcing you to unlock thing at a set rate, not allowing you to work to get the parts you were actually going to use. They also added a feature where after 10 seconds of not being damaged your bot would be completely healed, making nano-bots worthless and anyone who mained the medic role was basically screwed. Then they added the ability to have multiple weapon systems, which totally screwed up the balance. For example, the rail gun was insane at long ranges, and useless at short ranges, sometimes one shotting bots if you could land a shot, which was really hard to do. But with the removal of the pilot seat, just making you die when your bots health went below a certain threshold, this got rid of a bunch of the strategy in Robocraft, now you just spray and pray at bot instead of trying to figure out where their pilot seat was and targeting that section. But now if someone gets up and personal with you as a sniper, ou can just switch to a different weapon and take them down. This also allowed for people who either farmed for years, or spent a lot of money, to make insanely overpowered bots with no counter, and because they skewed up the matchmaking, these people get randomly put into low-level games. Then they decided it would be a good idea to remove the premium currency, which could be used to buy cosmetics, and if you had spent money on the game? Well looks like you will be getting some low-level crate in return. And with the expulsion of premium currency, they also got rid of the normal currency and replaced it with 'Cubits', so if you had coughed up some cash for the gold developer flag that cost something like $50, well now everyone can get it. In that same update, they also made so when you complete a battle you don't actually get any money, just a crate which can be opened to reveal some garbage items that are way below your current level. And also, if you try to sell these items yo buy what you really want, your only getting %25 of what it's worth, so you'll be farming for years before you build anything decent. They have also added some 'super-weapon' like a lock one missile launcher, aero flak, ion distorter and basically a chain gun. With the introduction of these weapons, the old ones are really lacking and gameplay isn't very balanced. They also completely got rid of the boss battle mode, which was my favorite game mode!After all this happened I can't recommend this game anymore, it was one the most popular free-to-play games for a while, ranking 4th at some point, but now it descended into a game that will honestly just waste your time. Those of us who played this game from very early on will remember how great a game this could have been, and how now it doesn't have a chance of lasting long term, even though easily could have if the devs had decided to play the long game instead of trying to make a quick buck. Well, I suppose I kind of ranted on about this, but this really could have been a great game. Fairwell Robocraft.			"

								*Robocraft dev team headquarters*BOSS: Alright guys we need a new way to attract new players! Our last idea of taking away everything that made Robocraft good seems to have made all the old players give us bad reviews and drive away all the others!SCRUB 1: I know! We can add new overpowered guns that make the already underpowered normal weapons completely useless!BOSS: GREAT IDEA!!!!!!SCRUB 2: How about we stop giving players currency for completing games and give them random items instead of letting them buy the things they actually want!BOSS: ALSO AN AMAZING IDEA!!!SCRUB 3: Oh and we could get rid of the special currency that players have to pay for and not refund them for all the money they spent!BOSS: THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA I'M PROMOTING YOU TO HEAD DEVELOPER!!!!!Sensible person: Um, how about we go back to the old game that attracted people in the first place? Bring back tiers, megabots, boss mode, different strength armour and verticality in general and improve matchmaking so new players with really weak bots don’t end up in the same games as hardcore players with thousands of hours? You know when we actually got positive reviews and the players didn't warn new people to stay away from the toxic pile of sludge Robocraft has become?EVERYONE ELSE:..........................................BOSS: John, you're fired "

Early Access Review
								tl;dr edit: basically, no matter if you like the game or not, the dev team ignores its playerbase and is going to drive the game into the ground. i do not recommend getting invested in it like i have.edit #2: if you are tired of this game and want a replacement, i recommend Galactic Junk League. it's a game similar to robocraft, but in space. it's in early access though, but they seem to be trustworthy developers from the few years they've been developing off their website. more trustworthy than the developers of this, as they haven't been in early access for 3 or so years now.steam link: website link: https://galacticjunkleague.com/and now the actual full reviewAfter 618 hours played in this game, I have learned a few things about this game and everything surrounding it.-The playerbase is mostly made up of 11 year olds who were trying to find Minecraft but found this instead-The dev-team is adding weapons to make the game more friendly to those people; such as auto aiming weapons that take absolutely no skill or learning to use, which have basically ruined a large chance of having any amount of fun-The dev-team is also trying to squeeze money out of said 11 year olds by effectively replacing the currency with a crate system that rarely gives you what you want, causing you to either spend hours in game (me sadly) or spend a large chunk of money on crates so the 11 year olds can get a pair of auto aiming rocket launchers and just annoy everyone with them+The game has its fun moments, when you arent being killed unfairly (like seriously, not just being in a bad place or overextending. Instantly dieing to enemies upon spawn, enemies killing you across the map when there should be no way to, other unavoidable things like that)-The game doesn't seem to be going in a good direction, and only seems to be getting worse. So I recommend not downloading this game and turning into me.sorry for the wall of text and any dead sea levels of salt encountered though. cheers			"

								Freejam has completely removed any kind of progression from this game and turned it into that of digital gambling. You can no longer pay real money to get exactly what you want. You now pay real money to gamble on crates. Because they removed RP in favor of Robits, the only way to make money is to recycle the random junk that you get from crates at 1/4 their value. This heavily increased the time it takes to get a single item that you may want. This game is no longer about experimenting with new builds, it's about gambling your time away on random junk. Epic Loot? More like Epic Fail.			"

								The new update to the game is terrible , well more than terrible but little children may have to read this.Losing the tech tree means that all weapons are available to any one in the game, this means that weapons like the Proto Seeker or the lock on missile launcher are really easy to get making any match boring and tedious.Any blocks that you want to add to your robots have to be ""forged"" with the new ""Robits"" which can ONLY be got by scraping previous blocks, you cant even get them by playing a match anymore.Losing the match gets you the base level of the crates giving you the base level of blocks which are worth as much as a chocolate firegaurd meaning that you are stuck with rubbish weapons on a rubbish robot. To conclude the new update to this game turns a previously enjoyable and exciting experience into the pay to win rubbish that you would typically find on a mobile,if you want to be highly frustrated or enjoy Dungeon Keeper on your phone then this is the game for you! P.S if you want either of these things then you may want to seek immediate medical attention			"

								I decided to finally review the game which I knew and loved by the name of Robocraft.Which my review can be best summarized by:._.Robocraft started out as being such a interesting concept. Build a vehicle out of cubes and pit them in combat against each other in an arcade style arena. Robocraft was initially successful, but then the FreeJam lost sight of the original game. Making update after update that made the game worse.-Flying fast? Nah, speed is boring-Pilot seats & Triforcing? Nah, let's just build bricks-Teirs? Who needs teirs, let's just make matches unbalanced-More parts! Who cares about part balance, just create more!-More game modes! So many that you take forever to find a match-LOOT BOXES! everyone loves RNG and not get the items they want. They'll surely give us money nowPros: -Build bots out of blocks-Fight other players with your custom bot-Different weapons & movement partsCons:-Devs seem to make the game worse-Building lacks depth-Poor balancing-Very grindy (P2W)			"

								1. Robocraft was such a nice game back then! I remember... we had the Tier-Classes which were really important for a fair match! (Today you get thrown into a match, flooded by ""pro's"" which one -or two shot you with the ion distorter or any legendary weapon, which practically isn't affordable if you don't want to spend 100 bucks for these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ protonium crates.)2. Adding those ""crates"" was the worst idea ever. We all know that games with these ""crates concepts"" died shortly after release. Should i tell you why? Because there will be a lack of fun! Back then I wanted a strong weapon. What I did was farming RP because I had the motivation to get this weapon! After like 10 - 20 matches I had enough to buy this weapon. It felt rewarding because you knew that you worked for it. Today you get a gold/diamond crate (..meh..), with maybe 1 or 2 rares which in my opinion belong into a dustbin. Beside this ""rare"" catch you get f*cking blocks and without premium chances are pretty good that you won't get the good♥♥♥♥♥♥for years!3. What happened to the Tech-Tree? It was abandoned. The Tech-Tree gave you freedom to unlock whatever you thought was useful for your bot. Whenever you saw something interesting you worked for it and also had fun! By removing the Tech-Tree and RP Robocraft lost its foundation.4. The ""repair-feature"" during a match made ""Nano-Bots"" worthless.5.  The weapons were nerfed way too much. Remember the rail gun? It was strong as f*ck, but it had to reload several seconds to unleash a strong shot. Also the chance to miss was pretty high and on close quarters you had to run away, because you couldn't do nothing but miss! - In my opinion this was balanced! Also the drivers seat was removed. Why? You had the urge to protect you driver, because you knew if he wasn't secured to 1 Block you would've been insta-killed. In my opinion this feature added tactics, because you had to figure out where the weak point of the enemy robot was.6. Now to a new feature: Recycling! Prices are way tooooo low. You just get 25% worth of that item and we all know you just get crap outta those crates. So to buy an other item which won't appear in a crate you got to farm.... how long? 1, 2, 3 hours like in the past? Heeell no! It takes forever just for an item!7. Now to the Forge: Prices are too high! How the f*ck are you able to forge a moderate item when the recycling just yields 25% worth of that item?8.  Back then you had to buy cosmetics, garage space, and other non-game-breaking equipment with real money. The garage space was limited, pretty fair tho?9. I like the idea of the Factory, but there are several problems. People don't got Robits because the crates just yield crap and the prices are too high. So how do they buy robots? They don't. And this is the reason why the Factory is senselessly!10. The company of course needs money, because they also have families to feed. But this (in the past) glorious game was ruined  because of greed! It wasn't a smart move to change the game concept from ""FreeAndFunToPlay"" to a ""PayToHaveFunOrFarmYourselfDead"" concept. The company will see that if they  hadn't been so greedy they would have earned more money....Rest in Peace Robocraft. We (The veterans and myself) will forever remember you!I am sorry if you find some mistakes. My first language is german.Written with mourning by XxT0xiiCxX.			"

								tl;dr Was good, then became a p2w. Avoid unless you have a massive disposable income and are fine with a company trying to swindle you.I got into this game a year or two ago. A genius idea it was back then. Near unlimited creativity, fun gameplay, a good community, low lag, yadda yadda yadda. That's all auxillary stuff. It's what makes a good game into a great game. But what about the essential stuff? It was all there, too, and in innovative fashions: a well-developed and balanced tech tree, specialization to create diverse teams, currency rewards based on how well you performed, quick and fair matchmaking, the list goes on and on. All of this was essential; you play well, you get currency, you upgrade your robot in the direction you want, and you go through the tiers, facing harder opponents as you go.Ah, what I wouldn't give to go back to the days when this game wasn't a steaming pile of pay-to-win trash.Creativity? Gone. Premade robots are the only real contenders now. Why is that?Progression? Gone. Now you get a linear tech ""tree"" that unlocks without the tech points of before.How do you get new parts, you ask? Why, with the currency of course!...Except not the same currency.Now you get a currency which is only granted to you based upon how many parts you sell. And how do you get these parts?With the completely original and foolproof crate system, how else?For just a single match, YOU can get a crate of at least five items that YOU didn't choose. Oh, not even that, though, since one is dangled in front of your face like a pet toy, essentially going, ""You COULD have this, but you have to be a PREMIUM MEMBER!""And there's the center of the problem. Membership.Jesus H. Christ on ice skates, membership costs so much that you'll need to just start paying with your dignity. $1.99 a DAY. That's about $60 a month -- money that could EASILY buy you at least three retail games on sale, or a full-price title -- and about $725-730 a year. You could buy at least 25 decent games with that kind of money.Oh, but that's not even the half of it.What do you get for your money? Well, you get:-A color wheel (Did I mention you only get a whopping FOUR colors to choose from, if you're a normal member?)-Some rare weapons in crates (that don't do nearly as much damage as they originally did)-Instant access to the stronger weapons (I omit the word ""tier"" because there IS no tier system any more; little Johhny that just joined the game and threw together a gun on a car frame with no armor will go up against someone with 2,000 hours with a fully decked out air bomber. Funny thing is, if you get lucky, you can take down the ""highest level"" players with entry-level gear.)-Some cosmetics and stuff that don't do anything...I think you get the gist. It's not worth it.So, in conclusion, it's a prime example of what happens when money goes to a dev team's head but they want to keep that ""free to play"" sticker on Steam so poor losers with nothing in their wallet can actually play something. Or, rather, suckers with too much money to spend waste it on their pay to win scheme. After all, winning feels good!Oh, and did I mention it's buggy and laggy now?It's buggy and laggy now.Freejam, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.			"

Ruined by Developer Decisions and CarelessnessThis was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.Then the January 2015 update was released.The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.(Order not completely accurate)""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.Until then, goodbye Robocraft.P.S. If you're going through old threads on the forums and spot someone with ""Dera32"" as their username, know that that's me. Please don't question my username choice; I know it's a horrible username.

								Well, here we are, my first review.  It's unfortunate that my first is a negative review.  I've been with this game since fall of 2014 I believe and that’s where most of my hours for the game went.  Now........ What have they done? How could they manage to screw up a perfect formula?  Let me explain some of the key changes that turned me away from this game.Taking away techpoints - Tech points were key to unlocking new parts such as: wheels, treads, weapons, wings/rudders, building blocks.  This was a perfect progression system that I was ok with.  Now just leveling up to get parts just isn't fun compared to the techpoint system.Removal of boss battles - I never got to the level to face off Mega bots.  Oh how cool it would have been for my bomber to fly around a gigantic robot.  Sounds cool right? That was one of the big reasons I got this game.  Now it's gone....... why devs.Rare moment in pvp where you were paired up with four high teir players *Removed* - Sometimes when you played a game, your team of twelve had a chance to get paired up with four high teir players as sort of a challenge round.  This mode was fun! The thrill of being hunted by someone much stronger than you and being able to take down someone with 3-4 of your team mates.  How could you remove such a fun mode!The ""new"" gamemode - What the hell... Is this League of Robocraft or something?! You get the gist, you and your enemy have a ""nexus"" you gotta destroy and in between are capture points to shut down the enemy shield if one team has them all.  What irks me the most though, is the devs recreation of League of Legends Leaverbuster system (Which btw, Leagues system is way more merciful).  Second time playing, the game crashes due to poor hotel internet.  Come back later to play, ""You have been temporarily banned from playing as you have left too many matches recently."" *slow clap*  Face it devs, Robocraft isn't a MOBA, it's a PVP game.Paint system - ""Hey loyal fans, want us to remove the block tier system, potentially throwing away some of the money you spent on this game to be replaced by a paint system in which you have to pay us more money to unlock basic colors?  Too bad, were doing it!""  Why.... just why.....  Adding a system in which you just scrapped tier blocks completely and replaced it with paint.  Here’s the catch though, you need to PAY FOR PREMIUM to unlock BASIC colors, but here’s the best part, free players ONLY have access to light grey, orange, light blue, and white.  REALLY!?  If your gonna add a paint system and throw away people’s money they may have spent on blocks, then MAKE FREE PLAYERS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL BASIC COLORS!  A good premium perk for a paint gun would be a color mixer, not locking off every single basic color to the free players.The 10 second heal - This just ruins the strategy and the role of a medic bot completely.  Not only that, but it ruins the part in which your robot being stranded on the field somewhere.  Waiting in anticipation for an enemy scavenger to come by and finish you off.  Now, its just crash, wait 10 seconds, and take off again, what’s the fun in that.Getting rid of pilot seats - When I first started this game, there was a cool astronaut pilot that was supposed to be the core of your robot.  Then came along android, three with unique strengths.  Then the devs just decide to get rid of the pilot seats completely..... Really!? Now you need to destroy atleast 75% of the robot to kill them, which is annoying if all that’s left of a player is a block and a thruster.  J-just why, the android pilots were perfect.Insane RP prices - Robo points (I think is what they're called) have been around from the very beginning.  I wanna create an insect themed robot.  What’s the price of the lowest tier leg, 150,000 rp? Ok then, how much do I get from a match.  ONLY 500 RP PER ROUND WITH ABOUT 2-4 KILLS!!  Then they put the rp you WOULD have gotten, if ya just payed $10 for premium or however much it costs on a monthly basis.  SERIOUSLY! The game I knew before was free player friendly, two rounds would get you five tier four blocks, about 10-20 would get ya a couple decent wings.  Now... about 25,000 RP for the LOWEST tier wings.Now, here are some of the changes I just so happened to like, but it's not enough to change the inevitable score.New single-player mode - I admit, AI being able to fight back is the perfect way to test out your new robot before entering pvp.  It gives good practice bots while seeing some cool and witty creations like: R2-D2, the enterprise, the millenium falcon, a freakin toilet, and many others.  While these added features are great for single-player, it still doesn't fix the game's true focus.Multiple garage slots - Finally, I can store more robots than just having three slots.Notice how the liked features list was way shorter than the disliked features list.  When I got this game, I thought the devs really wanted to make a fun, free game.  Now its paywalls, paywalls and micro transactions galore.  A game that once had intense strategy is now mundane.  I believe the only way these developers could screw up a perfect formula is their lust for money.  I thought you guys were gonna be different for a change, but shame on me for thinking that.  Final score is a 4/10, below average.  If this game keeps heading down the path it's headed for, I'll be ashamed to see the final product.  For what it's worth, download the game if you're morbidly curious, but it'll never be the same as it was in 2014.   How this game got a very positive rating in its current state is beyond me. "

								TLDR I do not recommend this game, not even if you paid me to. Links in info, please look.I recommended this game quite a while ago and honestly used to love it and support it. However, the game design has gone ways that are just unapealing, unchallanging and quite bothersome to me. I started playing this game because I like building robots, and at the time of me playing, it was the only game I knew about that was of this sort. However, as time went on, I saw other similar games, and I also saw good suggestions for robocraft, not get implemented in game, while bad suggestions and ideas did. Seb, one of the game devs seems to think our negative reviews are jokes, but this just shows you how seriously they take our criticism because its their game and they want to take it the way they want, the way that makes them the most money and scares off the most logical players and makes way for children who have fat wallets for GambleCraft 2.0 open your wallet addition. Well, now they are on damage control and posting fake apologies, but its a bit too little and a bit too late. Dont apologize, fix this game and revert far far back to when it was once a good game. I dont care about all the time you spent on it, you ruined it. You fix the game and you will fix the reviews by doing so. Until than, keep laughing freescam, but if you go out of buisness, dont expect me to not laugh because it was YOUR fault. I dont want you to fail, but you seem dead set on doing so. I could list all the things I hate about how the game went but seb will just say get used to it. https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726373014854615040 #Game dev, FreeScam games https://twitter.com/sebify/status/677895687548350465 https://twitter.com/TomCat__86/status/728177749706186753 oh and dont forget, they will ban you for talking about other games or having valid cricitism on bad updates. http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juvar23/recommended/301520/ What other company do you know of that is that insecure? Hell I cant think of any. Whoops, I talked about how the update is horrible. BAN, Whoops I talked about a game thats better than robocraft, BAN. http://steamcommunity.com/app/301520/discussions/2/364040166681997039/ it also appears the company freejam that puts out robocraft is owned by a mobile gambling game company and freejam owes them over 1 million dollars of debt due in september. http://robocraftgame.com/forums/topic/will-robocraft-be-adversely-affected-because-74-of-freejam-owned-by-hyperion/I love reading the recent reviews on steam about robocraft and you can easily see how pretty much all recent reviews are negative. The only reason the game still has an overal possitive rating is because the possitive reviews are years old by people who no longer play. I hope you devs have a fun time dealing with bankruptcy.There are many bugs, imbalances, and seriously large pet peeves in this Robocraft game for me. You are very limited in what you can build, but other games have much more freedom that are also free. I have recently started playing Machine Craft on steam, I have screen shots of the bots I have made and come in contact with. You can build so complex and so large in that game its like using a megabot x100. You can even build transforming transformers. However, the skill cap is much higher, the game takes much more thought, and the community is much more mature. If this is what you are looking for, try machine craft if you like building. If you like a younger audiance and a very low skill cap, play robocraft. This is a link to Machine Craft. It was recently just released on steam so the community is rather small but when you like it, tell your friends about it and it will grow. Its an amazing game. This is a link to steamcraft if you enjoy the competitive side that robocraft sort' of granted.

								This game used to be fun. Now it's a money grabbing, gambling-orientated rubbish. No fun anymore, the whole aspect has been replaced with grind. Just grind grind grind. Want to skip grind? Dish out a couple of thousand dollars to sit through hours of shxtty crate opening you can't skip to accumulate a few hundred thousand ""robits"" which is worth a couple of legendary plasma guns or SMGs. Only then may you reach the top and stay there for a couple of weeks before more dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥is added so you can grind and grind even more.Previously the game had a purpose and a set objective, which was you getting to the highest tier (TX-1) and unlocking everything step by step in the tech tree. Everything had a tier except cosmetics - weapons, cubes, thrusters, you name it. Each tier cube had a unique colour too. Black cubes was a symbol of respect, everyone followed you around and hid behind you since you could take the most damage, while purple cubes were not a symbol of respect. These days you can colour your whole bot in four ugly colours, white, grey, pale orange and pale blue. All of the nice colours are hidden away behind premium. Oh boy, premium! Just 99p a day! Who do you think I am, the prince of Nigeria?If you had a T2 bot, you were matched fairly against players from your own tier. Even if you had T6 railguns, you were still put with players of the same level. What about today? Newbies and veteran players all get grabbed in handfuls and mashed together into a ""match"". Who pays the most for rocket launchers and legendary bull♥♥♥♥♥♥is the winner in every match, even if you played the game from the alpha version, you can get owned in 1 second by some snobby spoiled little tw4t with a rich daddy's credit card. Don't even get me started on the crates in this game.Items were purchased with GC (galaxy cash) or RP (robo points iirc), but you could not buy a million GC with your rich daddy's credit card to get the highest level stuff. Instead you needed tech points to unlock items, which were only available through playing the game. You unlocked items in the tech tree, in which cubes, weapons, wheels, electroplates etc. were unlocked level by level using tier tech points. These tech points are earned after every battle, and were unique to each tier. If your bot is T10 for example, you would earn T10 tech points, with which you were able to unlock a variety of T10 equipment, but nothing higher or lower. You could also convert these tech points to uber tech points (using GC) which could unlock every item from every tier. The tech tree was BALANCED. Why break a working, operational system? Are you really that money hungry, freejam? You should rename yourself to paidjam or gamblejam. Or ""piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥inc."" Keep hiding behind ""early access"" for it's such a good excuse when people point out what a terrible game you've made. I hate you.			"

When you have a game where most of the many bots on the store that are heavily bought are ""robits guide"" and ""R0SEFALL"" bots that make no sense and have exploited the system, and a meta where tesla blades (a melee weapon) is your one way ticket to the top of the scoreboard through literally pointing your mouse at an enemy and clicking a few buttons, you know that the game in question is... questionable.Robocraft started out as an incredibley enjoyable game, with unique building, fun gamemodes, and constant updates. The game was not only fun, and had great potential, but the developers were out to make a game, not a profit. They listened to their community, and strived to improve the game. After the ""New Meta"" update, a lot of people were angry, but a minority supported this direction. This resulted in many neutral updates, and one of the most hated updates of all - Team Orders. The update removed what made Robocraft fun and enjoyable, and turned Robocraft into another Dota 2, except instead of heroes, you had bricks with guns attatched. Despite Freejam noticing, their attempt to fix the problem with ""Unleashed"" was not the Trump Card everybody wanted. They removed tiers, replacing it with ""Mk"", and added a whole lot of gimmicks. Soon, they completely removed tiers. After that, they continued to remove what made Robocraft unique. First tiers, then ranking, then level in general. Although I do like the paint system, tier flattening led to a lot of unbalanced items. They also unnessarily added new weapons - additions NOBODY wanted. And now they're still adding MORE weapons, while people are suffering from ghosting. Robocrafter YouTuber Lathrix had SEVEN games IN A ROW where somebody was ghosting (which is when a lagged out player damages and destroys other players even though they are destroyed). When the devs should've been fixing the game, they were adding to the game. Now, the average match is very simple - build a tesla plasma bot. Wait for your team to severely damage an enemy, and then go in for the kill. If you deal 80% damage to an enemy, killing the enemy will reward you with more points, which brings me to say the truth: In any Robocraft gamemode (The developers SPECIFICALLY stated that kill stealling was an option in the FFA gamemode ""The Pit""), you are forced to fight against YOUR OWN TEAM. People become utterly selfish, not healing, and stealing a kill you worked hard to get. Just go to the reviews section of the Robocraft Steam Community, then scroll down, and savour the red square boxes with thumbs down symbols. It's so clear in the reviews. 3,691 recent reviews have been submitted, and 55% of those reviews (~2,030 reviews) are negative. Freejam is also silencing moderators who oppose the company, and actively responded on Twitter to the community ""deal with it"". Yet, they are still adding more weapons, that will a) add a potential risk for unbalanced weapons and b ) makes you want to spend real world money even more.Freejam has gone from a small indie developer team that made an award winning small free to play game that people put thousands of hours into, to a money hungry profit machine.How Freejam could improve the game:• Make crates mono-tiered (or squashed), or just outright remove them. They're completely based on RNG and they just steal money from you. Premium doesn't change a lot of it. • Revamp the points system so that if you say deal 50% CPU damage, you earn 50 points while if you kill an enemy, you earn 10 points. This will counter kill stealing.• Fix ghosting. It can make a Protonium Crate earning hover bot that made someone put ten hours of their life to make the bot get to a Bronze Crate because a ghoster killed them.•Get rid of the Premium Paint system. It defeats the purpose of being ""creative"".			"

								I remember when I got this game in 2014. It was one of my first steam games. I immediately got addicted to it and spent my spare time climbing up the teirs. The game reached its height when megabots where introduced. But over time the game got worse and worse. By the time crates where introduced the game was unplayable. I can't believe that you could mess up a great game this much.I do not recommend this game. It was a good game two years ago but now it is just terrible.			"

								The game USED to be good.Back when crates didn't exist,RP, the Tech Tree and Teirs existed,The Capture the base gamemode was still a choice to play.Now you get paired up with people who have every module and fifty smgs because they have less blocks than you do so technically they're stronger than you are. Don't install this if you expect a fair game.			"

								This is a very sad day. I tried to give this new update a shot even though i kinda knew it would just **** it up even further than it already was. I do miss the old days. RIP Robocraft.Here is why:Before in the golden days of Robocraft you had a tier system which imo was awesome since it created more balanced matches in higher tiers because you worked your way up learning the game, getting better at building and knowing how to play effectively etc which would make most matches competitive since everyone else in that high tier went through the same process. Yes there were cons to this since you could make tiny bot with an overtiered weapon to troll and kill newbs in lower tiers but that could easily been dealt with by restricting the use of these weapons in the lower tiers but now the balance is all over the place... each Robocraft big update more recently claimed to bring balance instead creating more imbalance by allowing inexperience players to play with veterans so you would get a situation where you are the only vet in the match on your team and the rest seem to be clueless and you are facing a team with more experienced players and they steam roll you or vice versa i'm on the team with the experienced players and we steam roll the newb team.... i find it hard to actually get a good game these days... to me a good game is when both sides find the match fun and competitive not just an easy win. The golden days of Robocraft is when you got good games and the people you played with or against were much more mature than these days.Now i didnt mind the tesla, tracks update i liked it... i didnt even mind the crazy fit any weapon you want on your bot update i still played even though the game was just a shadow of its former glory... you could still have a lil fun and mess around... but this most recent fast and formidable update is just.... i really dont know wtf to think... i feel like there is no goal anymore.. at least before you had levels to grind so you could get the max cpu... now it kinda seems pointless... there is no progession... they took are tiers, tokens, and now levels away from us.If you are a new or fairly new player you will probably like this... well hopefully for freejams sake but all you vets out there thinking of coming back, it may just leave a bad taste in your mouth like it did me so thats why i cant recommend this game since its not the same game i fell in love with before it was even released on steamEDIT: oh and the god damn crates! THE ******* RNG KOREAN INSPIRED ******* CRATES! WHAT THE ACTUAL ****?! i do apologise i needed to get that off my chest... and whats with showing a non premium user the 2nd row of the loot crate? i'm not prem anymore but when i was it actually ****** me off to know that this is the direction freejam took it... oh looky you ""could"" of gotten these nice epic n legendary items but **** no cos you aint got prem ****! and **** robits! ok i'm done with that rant.EDIT: you know there is so much more wrong with robocraft than what was said in this review i just cant be bothered to mention them since i am just done... for good. I actually could still find some fun after the F&F update after messing around but now its just too boring. The final nail in the coffin was the recent fast n formidable balance changes... guess what? now you can stare at the protonium crystals on the towers and base long enough to feel bored from the first tower because protonotivity was reduced and some other things played a part too llike certain nerfs to energy n weapons.... matches can be painfully long and more ppl just alt+f4 it just to make the pain go away.I will be uninstalling the game right after this review.

								I've written a formal letter to FreeJam in the Robocraft Sub-Reddit, which I will link to, however, I'd like to outline some feelings I've had toward this game. I understand it's in Early Access, and I understand this is only one 'phase' of many. Who knows? Maybe in the future, I'll end up wiping this review and posting another one, but here are some finer key points of my letter, and the reasoning behind those points.TL;DR Game used to be good, now the balance sucks, and the economy is worse. Wrote a letter, here's some points and clarification.Damage and Balance*Lock On Missile LauncherOriginally posted by /u/RichterRicochet:""...Those were the days, when you could fly and not get shot down by Flak and LOML* walker bots with ease... ...because the Flak system has not been properly crafted to focus on AIR targets."" This point was my first. In real life, Flak shells are used as Anti-Aircraft weaponry, because the shells can be fired high into the air and explode, leaving shrapnel to tear planes apart. However, in Robocraft, the 'AeroFlak Cannon' (aptly named so as to make you believe that it should be used against airborne targets) instead causes significant damage with those same shrapnel explosions to anything not connecting with the ground, whether they're meters in the air, or a few centimeters off the ground. These explosions hit all blocks within the explosion radius and can potentially destroy a bot in as little as three well placed shots.Not only that, but if the shells don't explode and connect with a player directly, they do their standard explosion damage, though given in a smaller radius. Mind you, the AeroFlak Cannon is a high-powered weapon. The damage is does is very significant, and you're likely to take massive damage, even if you're hit directly. With this in mind, you'd think that the trade-off would be either a very low rate of fire, or a higher power consumption (more on that in a moment). Surpisingly, no. The Flak fires at a steady pace of roughly once a second, however, add more guns, and you're firing more often. Roughly twice a second.Now, regards towards power. Each robot has a power meter that goes from 100% to 0% and recharges over the course of ten seconds (or eight, if you have the optional Power Booster attached to your robot). Here's the problem that we face with the Flak cannon. It has only a power consumption rate of 10.8% per shot, allowing you to fire off at least 10 before needed to recharge (however, the power is recharging constantly, meaning you may face upwards of 11-13 shots before the enemy needs to recharge completely). Worse still, it does over 30,000 damage a shot, and your average armor cube has 2100 health, meaning at least 13 or 14 armor cubes are getting toasted. (The damage does fall off in the blast radius, thankfully, but not by much.)But that's not all folks! These cannons are damn near indestructible, with over 130,000 points of health themselves. And, if you do not directly hit the weapon block, it doesn't take damage. The only exception to this is Plasma weaponry, which has a small explosion radius (roughly the size of a grenade), which leads into my next point, surprisingly.Originally posted by /u/RichterRicochet:""Those were the days, when plasma damage was actually reasonable, and Plasma weapons were affordable... ...I've taken several low tier plasma weapons and placed them up against walker bots with seemingly little armor... ...even after a full hail of plasma shots... ...only a few blocks are destroyed... The damage is absolutely abysmal.""And by golly, is that true! In a recent update Plasma weapons (or grenade launchers, as they could be considered) were actually REDUCED in damage, compared to their high powered counterparts. As a trade, they instead were given a higher blast radius and lower power consumption. But, there in lies a problem. If a player cannot do enough damage to destroy a high-powered weapon at short-to-medium distance (as is Plasma's intended purpose), then what use do they have on a player's robot? Now, understandably, higher tiered weaponry does do considerably more damage, but at that power consumption and fire rate trade off, the Plasmas were more balanced than the AeroFlak Cannon. Need proof? The second highest tiered Plasma, an Epic Quality item (just like the Flak, an Epic quality), has 40,000 health (roughly), does 38,000 points of damage (roughly) with a slower fire rate than the flak cannon, and a lower blast radius. So, while they do roughly the same amount of harm, the Plasma was balanced in such a way that it could be combated and successfully defended against, unlike the Flak cannon.Engines, and how useless they can be.Originally posted by /u/RichterRicochet:""Those were the days, when engines actually had the power to push something, instead of just gently dragging it off the ground to simply float in the air. I have [a ship] which has over eight separate engines pushing it forward... The ship isn't maneuverable in any way, and it's not meant to be... ...I expect it to be able to fly, on even maybe four engines. But, if I lose my main rear engines... ...my altitude drops steadily, and immediately, with no way to get back in the air until a heal; by which time, my enemy has already caught me...""This was one of my biggest issues. The game expects players to have an understanding of physics when it comes to building flying robots, as in where to put wings and how much force required to get a vehicle off the ground. Yet, I don't believe even the developers do. The engines in this game are vastly underpowered, requiring usually no less than five to get someone off the ground. The smaller engine tiers hardly provide any lift at all and I wonder why they're still relevant. Now, I'm going to point out, the robot in reference here has 6 of the highest tier and two of the next tier down pushing it forward, and the acceleration and lift are absolutely meager. I'm surprised the damn robot flies at all.Community Backlash, pricing and other various points. Originally posted by /u/RichterRicochet:""Those were the days, when Megabots ruled, prices were moderately fair, and recycling really meant recycling and not shredding... ...[Players had] bought all the parts that they needed to sustain themselves for a while, and now [after] the Epic Loot update, those prices were cut from 50% return, which is moderately reasonable to in some cases less than 33%... ...to top that, the prices of some items went up, further blocking progression, and yet again causing more community outrage..."" God, bored of this review yet? Oh wait, points... So! The economy in the game drastically shifted with the introduction of Epic Loot, because gone were the days of battling for currency, instead now you battled for parts that dropped in a random crate after each battle. The better you did, the better the crate (from Rusted to Protonium). However, you'd be led to believe that Protonium crates would offer higher tiered items, the Epic and Legendary ones. Yet after testing players have shown a very low drop rate for these items. Players would often hope for Movement or Weapon parts, but would frequently receive cosmetics instead, these cosmetics ""recycling"" for a very low currency count. (I.E. a 10,000 robit flag resold at 750 robits.) ""At this point, this is not a game I wish to see to completion, it's really not. Because if the current 'meta' is to stand in a similar fashion... ...then there will never be any balance... New players will come in, get rekt, pack up and leave... I've never been one to complain... ...I now understand why people are so upset."" As an avid supporter of the game, I've not only poured time into it, but money as well. Originally, I thought my funds were well placed, but I suppose I was wrong.Read the letter here. Best suited to Robocraft Vets. "

 TL;DR - This game has been ruined by ""The Glorious Democratic People's Republic of Freejam"". I highly recommend that you don't play it.	 I ask in Your best interest to Not Play this game	 Enter the Shredzone The Shredzone update could have been the update to fix all of the problems the community has with this game. I would like to bring your attention to the could have part of that statement. Starting with the recycling rate. 10% of the part cost is returned to you. Only Bloody 10%! We can't even come close to buying any of our desired parts. All hope for the parts we want is now based on RNG-sus. This is all thanks to the Loot crate update which added these idiotic loot crates for us to gamble our parts. Most of the time, the parts are useless to us. 50% of the recycle price would be nice as it would finally make things affordable instead of needing to pray to RNG-sus in hopes of gaining the parts we want. At least this update has added an great tutorial for newer players, giving them false hope that they will enjoy the game. By the time they realise that the game isn't actually that much fun, they would have spent money on the game, to gain the advantage of having more blocks. However, i honestly doubt that using this method, FreeJam will be able to claw their way out of the abyss of debt that has been accumulated. They have finally taken account of some feedback from players which is a step in the right direction. The changes are mainly to the weapons and not outstanding issues which many players are trying to bring to light. Finally, the new chaingun, another weapon added to ""balance out the game"". Laughable due to the fact that this type of weapon can be achieved using multiple wasp SMGs. This game is finally unsavable. All we can do now is sit back and watch the game run itself to the ground. Battle For Earth (outdated) New update, new edit. Welcome all to the ""improved"" Robocraft, Battle for Earth. Here we shall squeeze every last penny off you, through methods which have been tried and tested by multiple one-hit-wonder android games. The grind, i assure you, will be real. But who cares about that when you can spend countless amounts of dollars to be able to buy protonium crates. These crates will give you the advantage against others as you will be able to build not five, not ten, but only one decent robot a day (provided that you keep buying 300 crates every day). Pleas for changes are fallen on deaf ears as the developers have not addressed any issues raised in the previous update.  If any existing players are reading this, i ask you in your best interest to boycott this game. Any new players can refer to the title. (I'm lazy that way, don't judge me too harshly) Epic loot update (outdated) Well Well Well... Finally, new update is out and once again, the update has broken the game to an even more unplayable state. Anyone who has played the game since the very beginning has seen the evolution of a once promising game, become a hideous monstrosity. With the new ""Epic Loot"" update, the game has now sunk deeper in to the lowest common denominator. Copying other games. Of course we all know which game this is trying to copy *cough cough* CS Go *cough cough* it is now almost impossible to progress. The game in my professional opinion has become so unplayable that even i, who have never reviewed a game before, have reviewed this game to comment on how horrendous it has become. The game is still in early access. I mean for crying out loud, this has to be an bigger scam since the Nigerian prince (still waiting for the transfer) and the metropolitan police (need to wait for the money from  the Nigerian prince to unlock PC). It is just a horrible excuse to change the game dramatically without much consideration for the existing player base The Epic Loot Update	Now this update is obviously released out of greed. Play one game and you will see what i mean. The loot crates give premium users more than double (epic and rare items) what players who play for free get. Although you may argue that premium users should get more, it demonstrates the desperation that the developers have for  Money	. This is what the update is released for. The rail cannons now use more power per shot and smgs don't fire as quickly as before. Medics are now obsolete, repairing robots slowly enough that i can make an cup of tea, write this review as well as watch an couple youtube videos before they are fully healed (excluding the 10 second self repair of course).Ask any person who journeyed with robocraft throughout the years and they will tell you that "" Robocraft has been ruined	"" What to expect	By playing for free, you only get four colours, less Robits (previously known as RP), stress from grinding as well as high blood pressure from realising that most, if not all, shotgunners that killed you were or are premium.  The battle arena is a blatant attempt to copy  League of legends and DOTA	 and incorporate MOBA into the game. Team death match is just destroying robots (No respawns). The main point of the game is building robots and fighting, which this game does quite well. However, needing to destroy at least 75% of the enemy's robot, now without the pilot seat, is an absolute deep pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Especially if all that is left is a thruster and a single block. The reduction in speed of the SMGs have definitely bent each one of us over and screwed us, since it only takes 10 seconds to start auto repair, the singe thruster bot would have full repaired by the time we tracked it down. Explanation	""It isn't all that bad"" you may say, innocently or while the developers are elbow deep in your rear and skillfully puppeteering what you type and say. Most of my hours came from the very start, but there are quite a few things which turned me away from wanting to play this game: Removal of tech points The removal of megabots The addition of extremely OP weapons The removal of the tech tree The lack of consideration to long time players Removal of the pilot seat That is barely scraping the surface of the problems. I am not demanding in-game items to be given to me. What I am asking for is  for 25% of their stock with a certificate to be served to me on an silver platter and 10 percent of their profits	 change. For example, adding in again the pilot seat will bring the fun back into building to defend the seat (the description still says ""Jump into the pilot seat of your robot and drive it into battle...), adding in the challenge mode to encourage team work(with megabots of course). Final thoughts There are a number of things I quite like in robocraft right now, but listing one or two them would require more effort than the developers have put into the new ideas. Each update is well presented, but taking a massive dump on the game and putting a bow on it Does Not conceal the fact that the game has been defiled (well that ship sailed a long time ago). Any new idea implemented causes dramatic change to the game from the developers basing the whole game around the update. Download and play it if you want, but keep in mind that it will never be as gripping as it once was. I rate this new update 1/10 but 10/10 for the game's concept. (How this game still has an overall very positive review is baffling)			"

								Here's an ""interview"" with the developer team which nicely sums up the current robocraft situation:


YouTube™ Video: SHOCKING Interview With A Robocraft Developer 

			Views: 6,998		

			This is just a parody... Don't take any of this too serious !!!		

This used to be a fun game where you got rewarded with ingame currency and access to new robot parts every few hours of playing. Cycle of purchasing set of new parts, building a robot and fighting against others in a team deathmatch or MOBA-style game type was quite fun.Then Epic Loot update broke the game completely:- it removed the progression- it removed the currency- it added crafting instead of currency, which isn't really a thing since recycling items gives too small fraction and thus no value- it removed the matchmaking barrier between players, so now Veteran players armed to the teeth with items worth hundreds of thousands of robits now play against robots worth just a few thousand robits. It's called ""Seal clubbing"".- it added loot box system - after every game you get a few random items. I now have one spider leg, 1 medium size laser, 14 wings (but no good air weapon), 3 wheels of different type, 1 ski and a robot leg.I built a new robot every 2-3 days before the patch, now I have done one in two weeks because parts drop one by one instead of in sets, like I used to buy them in the old currency.Developers say that everything is ok ;)			"

								edit: Added developer comment at the bottom.Robocraft has gone through many changes. Some for the good, mostly for the bad.My previous reviews have always been positive, albeit quite criticising. After the recent removal of the megabots from the game, i installed it again. In ignorance? With hope?Or perhaps it was because FreeJam has given me that tiny bit of hope, that they would make robocraft great again.Unfortunately, with the recent edition of the shotgun, they just completely messed up and lost all of my trust.Increase of TTK (Time to Kill)? That was a ""maybe"". Well, TTK is getting lower and lower with each passing day.Skill should be an important factor! Well, with the addition of 3 guns that really don't require much skill, really doesn't strengthen that comment. FLAK: Introduced to sooth the pain of the players that lacked the skill to deal with drones. (What is shooting me? I don't see it? I'm looking everywhere, except of course above me, because i'm a ground vehicle)LOML: Yes, this gun is as awesome as it sounds. Lock on and fire, no need to aim as the rockets will find their way to your target,Proto-seeker (or as i call it, the turdgun): On first introduction, it was litteraly a gun that fired crap. It hardly did any damage and was just plain annoying. And you could fire it without your enemy even seeing you, due to the ridiculous range. Just aim in the general direction of your enemy and you would simply hit aim. No skill required.In the next update, the range was nerfed, but the damage was buffed. ""Great"" job FreeJam.Let's talk about the ""making robocraft a competitive game"" comment that was made. It was most definitely a priority.https://twitter.com/MarkDJammer/status/613285367886667780- The leveling is now a lot easier. What used to take weeks/months to do, can now be done in 1 week or 1 month. Depending on how much and how often you play.- There is no more steadily unlocking of items. Meaning, combined with the leveling, new players who reach the end game in no time.- There are no tutorials in the game, so what you learn you learn by doing, without having any clue what or where to start. - The removal of the pilot seat: The importance of building a good (and competive bot) is no longer as important anymore. To ""balance"" this out, FreeJam decided to let your bot die, when it's at 25% health. It could still be functional and combat ready, but that no longer matters.- Regen: Another ""awesome"" addition to the game. Because removing a part of this ""competitive"" game wasn't enough. And likely to make up for that *facepalm* die at 25%, you will heal up if you're not being shot at for 10 seconds.- Tactical gameplay: Also note the irony in this part. In order to help the megabots (weren't they removed? Yep) move about more easily, about 50%+ of cover on all maps has been removed.- Ranked: Just because you call a square a ball, doesn't make it a ball. And ""ranked"" in Robocraft is as much ranked as a pig is a carrot. It doesn't matter what ""rank"" you have or what ""rank"" your enemies have, the end result is still the same.All that matters is win and loss and if you lose, score. Be in the top half of the scoreboard when you lose and you will not lose ""rank"". There are 5 ""ranks"". Bronze (1-5), Silver(1-5), Gold(1-5), Diamond(1-5) and Protonium(1-5), with Protonium being the highest.This is one of the biggest fails FreeJam has made, as far as competitiveness goes. As a bronze player, you can be fighting with and against even Protonium players. The matchmaker doesn't really care (if at all).Then there's the ""ranking up"". Just win and you'll rank up. Currently 6 wins in a row, will get you to the next ""ranking league"". Combine this with the ""awesome"" matchmaker and perhaps you will guess that being a high-ranking players doesn't mean anything, there's also no point. Whether you are on the bottom or the top, you'll be playing with the same kind of players. Even new players, who don't even know what to do (yet?)One little note: The one reason to rank up is to get the league badges. They do look really nice.Now let's be honest... it can't be all negative, right? No, you are right. They did remove the tiering system and all armor is now the same. This means that artbots are actually viable. They also decreased the cost of the cubes you need to build your bot. AND... they added the paint tool. (4 colors standard, 16 (or was it 12?) with premium).Secondly, they added the CRF (Community Robot Shop) in which players can upload their own designs and allow other players to buy them. However, the rating system has a big flaw. You can only rate a bot after the first real battle. As such, the ratings mean little to none, just like its ranking system.Conclusion: Robocraft is turning more and more into a game that you'll play for a while when you are bored. All the promises are basically ideas that can be withdrawn/changed or be completely the opposite.Would i recommend it? No. Not anymore. Robocraft Developers are basically like a 5 year old kid that has an attention span of a goldfish.Note: I have over 1000 hours in the game. As such, i do know what i'm talking about. I could boast about my ranking, but whether it's Bronze 0 or Protonium 5, it just doesn't mean a thing.Developer commentBy Sergii Design JammerSurely we have no plans to revert everything we was working on for a year. Surely we avoid removing content from the game if we don’t absolutely have to: after all, this will surely make many players unhappy.But we are spending years of our lives working on the game. Surely we don’t want to make the game worse.It’s well known fact that without content updates online games die quickly: players get bored and leave. So even if it was true that before Aeroflak the game was perfect, this perfect game won’t last long without things like Aeroflak (i.e. without content updates making big impact). So to survive, the game needs to evolve constantly, even though many mistakes happen along the way for sure.So the choice for us is to let the game die, or to evolve it. We understand the disappointment of players who liked the old ways more, but honestly leaving the game as is wasn’t an option at every stage in the past and won’t be in the future. Changes are painful, but there’s no evolution without change. "

""A machine to turn your time into an enormous amount of frustration, anger and salt, for an absolute zero amount of fun.""That sums up very well what RoboCraft is now. I'm not going to be rude or to be nostalgic, I'm only going to state actual facts that justify this negative review.As of today, what do we have now? A game that vaguely ressembles something in which we assemble parts to create a robot that we bring in battle to fight with team mates and against opponents. Vaguely ressembles because the reality is a game that terribly lacks anything properly thought like gameplay, balance, progression, sense of achievement, fairness, social network (and communication means), and so on and so forth. The result is a ""game"" in which parts are more and more numerous, yet the diversity during battles is poorer and poorer. The remaining players are more and more selfish, aggressive, unfriendly, unfair, rude and behave in an hateworthy way. The robots are more and more ugly, unbalanced, while a majority of theorical designs and combinations are absolutely useless.The result for you, as a potential future player? You trying to build something nice, struggling to do it (because hours and hours and HOURS of grinding), yet you end up being obliterated in combat by atrocities that took 5 minutes to build, because hey they just have the best parts and you have garbage that cannot possibly do anything good. That is, if you haven't spent an enormous amount of ingame currency in an item that is labbeled as extremely rare, yet it is terrible. And of course you keep being steam rolled by players who already have much better equipment than you, yet this equipment is ""combat rated"" the same level than yours.What? You won a battle and you've certainly been the best player of your team? Congratulations, you haven't earned anything more than the other players of your team. You've been carrying over several players who could even have obtained better stuff than you. That is, IF you have a better score than them, because now the score doesn't reflect how useful to your team you have been and rewards only those who have kept stealing kills or who kept shooting crystals while leaving all the dirty job to you. Whatever, you cannot possibly be rewarded for being good and doing what needs to be done for the sake of victory, actually you'll always be punished for that.The only thing that rewards is being lame, having a nooby behavior, being selfish, working against your team mates and abusing the features/parts that are perfectly legit, yet extremely unbalanced (or by comparison that do work while the rest is utter buggy garbage). No wonder why the remaining players are so hateworthy.So now, do you have any feedback to give, or any proposals? Forget it: as much as the devs claim that they listen to the players, they don't. The only thing they will do, is being gadly praised by naïve players who barely have any experience in the game at all, or by kissasses whose goal is to be noticed by ""dev senpai"" (maybe expecting a moderator position in the process, not for the good reasons, obviously).The development team seems to be completely oblivious to concepts like product/project management and design. They do and undo things. They plan and unplan. They throw up ideas and hype the playerbase about them, yet they do nothing about them, or at best they half-do them. If something ever gets done, nothing ensures that it will remain anyway: it can very well be removed, for bad reasons. They don't finish anything correctly and neatly, they don't test thoroughly. They don't know what their priorities should be. When looking for an increase of the player retention, they jump to solutions and tools which they don't master at all (or even understand anything about), instead of doing the obvious thing: listening to their players and understand what goes wrong. To have an objective analysis of their game, they favor the opinion of random kids who barely touched the game 10 minutes, instead of asking their experienced players (some of which who also have experience in game/product design or marketting) who are looking for the best for everyone and setting aside their personal needs.To make it short: they do nothing the right way, favor those who praise them for bad reasons (or who find all the excuses possible in the world for everything that goes wrong) and are extremely disrespectful/neglecting toward those who are truly trying to help them and who will praise them with sincerity if something was done well. If not outright rude and insulting toward the last ones. If anything, the way they work is exactly similar to that of teenagers: no objectives, no methods, no backup/documenting, no tracing, no measurement (to check if the objectives have been met), no feedback analysis, no measurement of. They just do things randomly, basing themselves on their whims, and expect that somehow this will do.I won't expand on this or that feature, people have already done so before me. I will however point out something crucial that the CEO himself is completely oblivious about: you cannot state that the ""player retention"" is maintained when you implement a feature that explicitely forces your players to login everyday to get a random reward.So that's it. All the experienced, fair, creative, sincere/honest and nice people who used to play this game are now gone and have abandoned every hope of seeing the game back up. Now, all you have left to play with are a bunch of horrible kids whose only goal is to thrash you as much as they can with the most disgusting and unfair robot/methods ever possible, an who will kissass the devs. No friendship, no humour, no joy, no laughs, no creativity, NO FUN. Even the features themselves are more and more anti-fun and promote selfishness and unfairness instead of teamwork, skill and friendship.Please FreeJam, don't take this review personally, but you've screwed up and keep doing so. Your ego will lead to your doom.			"

								Stay away from this game. Simply put, the development team (FreeJam) is utterly incompetent. There have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). Instead, FreeJam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. This accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. Sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, FreeJam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.Other major issues with the game:1) Building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. Nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. Any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. In fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, FreeJam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. Either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. Regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did ""because FreeJam said so.""2) Significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. Simply put, FreeJam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. In the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. There are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). 3) FreeJam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. They won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. Instead, FreeJam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. Basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. Things like clans have been ""on FreeJam's radar"" since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? Still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. The sad part is, by the time FreeJam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. 4) Minimal skill required. If you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. FreeJam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. This might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.FreeJam: One step forward, two steps back. Always.			"

								So, the last update has made me update and expand my review. It seems it is so bad that only handful of players left, since I am seeing exatly the same names and afker's since yesterday and almost no new players.What changed and introduced?Forge?Reforge values are atrocious. If the prices won’t be fixed, then it is way too grindy to do anything, reforge values are incredible (75%+?). For example, from items that cost 20000 to forge you can only recover 25.For newbies, I assume, it simply won’t do. As well as for players, who don't already have everything.They also divided RP/63 to get to Robits balance. However, if you were smart enough to buy thousands of weapons to reforge them, literally millions of money could be saved. I wasn't.Crates?Even with premium I get 3-6 simple blocks from gold/diamond/protonium crates. And some customization trash. And I can’t even recycle it from the crate’ screen. Oh, since you can recover only a few robits from the crate, even protonium ones, good luck playing thousands of battles to get some weaponry. And only BA/LA battles, TDM gives 1/4 reward of BA/LA or 1/3 of The Pit.Want to donate to buy 300 crates and get some good items for you bot?You will only get thousands of simple blocks and very few movement parts and weapons. But, duh, you will can tons of customization dirt.Newbie-friendly?Ah yes, simple robot blocks. They are now 10x times more expensive, some newbies cannot even build a normal robot since they do not have enough money even for blocks.I do not even know how newbies can get into high-tier now, seeing everything is way too expensive even for old players.So much of a newbie-friendly game. Also, the matchmaking with FJ' fixes.Matchmaking?Did I mention that even 500 CPU (sized) bots are still thrown into 1500-1750 CPU battles?Ah, now I did. Also many afk's, since being afk and wait till the battle's end is much more profitable than trying to do anything.Robot-building?Forget about it, simply place some cubes, just make sure it is not too hollow, some weapons, at least 6 of them, and you are ready to go.Building does not really matter for a long time.Of course, there is a meta-builds, but why build it when you can buy it from roboshop?Obviously, FJ undestands it and now you can buy it for free.Game-modes?The Pit is incarnation of killstealing along with ion distorters little bots. Not very interesting.Team Deathmatch is a good mode still, however, FJ hates this mode and to promote Battle Arena they made severe nerfs to rewarads from TDM, so if you like to play TDM you will never get much money (now you really won't get anything, since you get only one item from the TDM and you can recycle for around 50 robits, while new weapons and modules cost thousands and hundreds of thousands).Battle Arena/League Arena - gamemodes with highest rewards right now. FJ likes to think they are making game similar to MOBA and promote this gamemodes as hard as they can, reducing rewards from other gamemodes and increasing rewards in BA/LA.How bad BA/LA?Small maps, countless campers, in the lattest update you are guaranteed to lose if you have Robocraft's target auditory (10-12 year old kids, from FJ's comment on the official forums) and one or more disconnected people or leavers.So, if you want to play BA, do not forget that disconnect and wait for two minutes is much faster than try and lose in the battle witch lasts for 15-20 minutes in average. Weapon rebalance?High-tier battles became way too boring and low-tier battles are full of shotgunners.Seriously, a few shots from SMG and you have no energy. And SMG's don't really damage anymore.Protoseekers, which I disliked, first were changed into close-combat ones, which was much less fun than longranged annoying weaponry, but now they were nefted into dirt and completely pointless to use.Plasma?Unless you manage to land the hit into dead center of the robot it is weak and after each strike you can go to make a tea to wait for energy to reload.Rails?Oh, somewhat useful, one of two weapons that can damage enemies now. But you have only two shots before you have to wait ~10 seconds to energy to restore.Ion distorters?Only weapon of close combat capable of 1-3 shotting any bot. And there are many of glass-cannons on low-cpu battles literally humiliating newbies, who can do nothing against them.FJ also told that low-tiered weapons will be useful.They are not, however still being a little better than high-tiered ones. Still bad. And forcing to turn beatuful bot into cactus of small plasmas/smgs is a disgrace.Modules?Blink is fun, this much I can tell. One of the best ideas FJ made ever.Invisility is strictly limited to shotgunners, has some uses for planes and copters, but not much.Megamodule turned into powerboost is a must in high-tiers, without it there is simply too big delay in weapon' fire.Disc Shield Module is not really of use now, but I sometimes see someone to use it only to enemy rush through it and kill the DSM' user with ion distorter (shotgun).Bugs?One of my friends can’t play, since he is getting white screen/falling underground/crash issues.He is, obiously, not the only one.And I got another fps drop, but I am used to it.Exploits?FJ removing bonus to players' score when the latter spot the enemy to fix exploits.I really think it is not a way to fix exploits. And desync is still not fixed, FJ cannot into fixes, duh.EAC?Points 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are still relevant. They are seriously doing almost nothing.As for point 2 - I do not see crashes and issues with the game in the last update, but in previous update I could start the game only a few times out of ten, because EAC would simply not start and then the game would crash since EAC is not running.As for point 3 - now it is hard to understand if it's FJ's fault for optimization or the EAC's, so I can't say anything about it. To be honest, optimization is not very bad, however, there are lag-spikes and sluttering with micro-freezes from time to time. I am not saying I am quitting, I already have more than 20+ detail each and some robits, so I will stay to see when FJ hits the rock bottom. Seeing this update it shouldn’t be too far away.However, this update is much worse than I expected and I expected something bad.I am disappointed in FJ and especially Mark, the latter one could read the forums and not hide in his twitter ignoring any messages that matter and making silly updates which make the game worse.I really do miss the classic robocraft without regeneration and with pilot sits.(Updated 29.04.2016)OLD:New anticheat EAC does not prevent hackers to use hacks, yet it:1. prevents the usage unsigned drivers2. gives absolutely horrible matchmaking, almost always kicks from game and if be lucky enough to get into the game you may get into the middle of the match (and get kicked again), too many false positives and crashes3. cause of low framerate4. messes with other software outside robocraft5. dissallows software like fraps and macroser even when they used on other programs6. recognized as malware by some antiviruses7. EAC devs suggest you to run the game in virtualbox if you encounter problems like unsigned drivers8. There is no guarantees gathered data (screenshots, keylogging, logins, passwords, usernames, chat messages, etc) from you will be kept private.I do not think it is the full list of the issues.By the way, I mostly run the game without turning on steam, so I do not have much hours on the record.Also my friend's brother died from this.He had serious depression and robocraft was his only relief. But then FJ started ""patching"" the game and as game progressivly got worse he couldn't bear with it, stole the gun from his dad and killed himself when there was nobody home.			"

								This was a really good game, however it just got ruined with all the updates. Won't go in full detail cause there's allot of stuff that just make this game absolutely atrocious, but I just gonna go over some. Before the crates came in the game was still fun, even with all the unbalanced guns and match making. But now, you could be playing for hours and get nothing. The items you get from crates at the end of a game are just complete useless, so useless that selling them for money is not even worth it. They are more useful as a ""dust collector"" then anything else. There is no more skill involved anymore as the devs also took that away. Brining in lock on missle launchers, and making that if you shoot your self you dont lose energy, which takes away from the entire point of being strategic with your shots and conserving energy. The distinction in classes which were; medic, sniper, support (plasma, laser) are just gone. Anyone can be eveything, which just takes away the fun of using strategy and working together to defeat the enemy.The 10 second heal which is that if your not shot with-in 10 seconds your robot heals. This just makes everyone go rambo cause they pretty much charge in, shoot, then heal, needing no medic or team-mates to help them defeat the enemy. And lastly, the pay-to-win aspect of the game (buying crates to get items, being able to buy legendary guns, buying items to boost heal regen, etc...) are just so damn gamebreaking that even with hundred of hours of grinding (which I have done in this game) someone spending money on the game could match you and destroy you with no problem. Overall, I woudn't recommend this game as there's too many things that just take away from the gameplay being fun.			"

								It used to be a lot of fun even with some balancing issues, now it's a complete mess. They added more stuff instead of balancing what was already over powered.You can build any nice looking or carefully tought bot, you will still get destroyed by the same op drones that have been the ""meta"" for years. Now if you even manage to hit them while dodging they can actually flee and auto regenerate...Their forums are filling up with the same complaints for years about air drones and heal beams, to no effect. A real shame.			"

Robocraft had good promise and a shiny outlook on how it could have gone but freejam eventually slid it into a sort of extremely basic and P2W game, the matchmaking is absolute trash, the new armor/health system is annoying and stuff, tech tree was removed and replaced with a progression system where the level progression is horrible as is anyways. used to binge this game so much but it was also getting annoying from these updates.

								Now, I only have around 80 hours in this game. But I have played what it was back in its ""hayday"" and I have played what it is now. There was a point in my time of playing robocraft in which I couldn't stop playing. It was a drug, and an outlet to let my creatvity go head-to-head against other people's equally absurd ideas. What it is now, I can't really understand what went wrong. Call me melodramatic, but how does one screw up a wonderful game so  BADLY ? I don't know.All in all, this game has become what it worked so hard to go against. A game that requires very little creativity and a lot of mommy's money. Don't let me change your view of this game, give it a try. But know that you are playing a shell of a once mighty game. "

								(Quick note: I have played much more than 170 hours, using the RC launcher rather than Steam.)So FreeJam are now going around reporting some reviews because they are ""abusive"". Here's a screenshot: https://gyazo.com/66d544d7b6f793ce65ac537bc0ac1f53FreeJam, if you can't take some simple constructive criticism then there is no hope for you or your game. I hope you drown in your money pool.------------------------------------------------------------------------New update, new paragraph. I admit, I didn't know what to expect. But I can't say I like it. Well, the matchmaking issue is fixed, you're more free to build whatever, and for that I thank FreeJam. But what most people don't realise, is that you don't earn Robits from battle. Progression in the game is now completely reliant on the drops in crates, down to complete luck. No skill, just luck. It doesn't matter that you have 20 Protonium Crates, someone out there will unlock something better from a Rusted one. FreeJam, I think I know where the problem is. When you think of a shiny new mechanic, you base the WHOLE GAME off of it. Couldn't we agree that the new crate mechanic would be better added to the meta, and not rewriting it? Because right now, I've advanced more in Singleplayer than in actual battles. **ORIGINAL POST**Developers.Do you not understand what this game is meant to be? I downloaded this game assuming I could build what I wanted and watch it explode in the midst of battle. Things like CPU caps and level progression just stop something that everyone wanted. And now you're getting rid of megabots, meaning the bots we can make are limited. You're getting further and further away from your original plan, and we suggest you turn around. Let us build what we want again!This doesn't even take into account the god-awful matchmaking, in which a small plane will be matched against giant SMG tanks for no reason, and the terrible weapon balancing, where owning one weapon means you win the game. There needs to be more ways to build an effective bot than just ""stick some missiles on it"".Game mechanics have come and gone. I admit, the new battle arena with respawning and protonium towers was a good idea, and I still enjoy it. But I also enjoyed Megaboss mode, a mode where a full team of smaller bots take on a Megabot. I've had instances where I have both won and lost as both sides, but of course FreeJam removed it.Even further back, we had the tech tree. A sense of progression gave the game purpose, and it was hard yet rewarding work to earn the tech points needed to unlock a new weapon. I was super happy to have unlocked an end game item, but of course the tree wasn't finished. Then they updated the game, granting me access to every item, and completely eliminating this sense of progression from my game.FreeJam, that is what the game should be. Please, for once in your careers, listen to us.tl;dr it's bad but used to be goodfreejam are money-grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"

What is robocraft?Robocraft is a driving shoot-em-up where you build cars, tanks, robots, planes, helicopters or whatever weird creation you can think of and drive them out to fight each other.You are granted a light walker, a hovercraft and a tank to get you started which you can use or dismantle for the components.There are a few different game mode:Tutorial The tutorial tells you how to place blocks in edit mode, how to move a walker and tells you to kill a stationary bot. You then recieve a reward crate.Basic Mode 2 teams fight to a specified number of kills. After death you respawn and are shielded for a few secondsBrawl A variation on basic or previously removed pit or elimination with additional rules such as weapon limitations. Changes every few weeks.Normal Mode 2 teams fight to fill their base with crystals. There are 3 capture points on the map, if you hold all 3 you can shoot into the enemy base to steal their crystals. If you hold at least one tower your base is protected by a shield which blocks enemy fire and bots while regenerating allies. Every 5 minutes a crystal appears which the losing team can destroy to equalise the scores.Play Vs AI The same as basic but it's just you and AI bots. A good place to test new buildsTest Map A wireframe VR style map for testing robots.Battles give crate drop rewards containing up to 4 random items for non-premium or 8 if you have premium, a better performance grants you a better quality crate. Items you don't want can be recycled for a small amount of robits which you can use to buy parts or even complete bots in the Community Robot Factory(CRF)Is it pay to win?No, the game is not pay to win however paying for premium does double your reward from battle and triple what you get for recycling components. You can also buy premium crates which means you are paying for random items all of which can be obtained as free drops anyway.You may notice several reviews say the game is pay to win but I can only assume they don't actually know what pay to win means. You pay to reduce the grind and get a few more colours to paint your bot not for any kind of advantage.Matchmaking An ELO system has now been added which increases or decreases your rank based on whether your team wins or loses, this is an improvement on when there was no form of balancing but it doesn't take player performance into account so it only works if you play in a platoon.So why don't I recommend the game?Balancing Rather than filtering bots by relative strength Freejam opted instead to make smaller bots have a larger energy pool to fire longer before recharging weapons, at the same time big guns naturally have a high energy drain. This encourages people to make smaller bots with over sized guns or larger bots with smaller guns. As a new player if you try out your starting walker expect to be matched against all manner of weapon and module combinations likely including a dual chain shredder walker and a teleporting shotgun hover. To put simply 2 of your starter bots are completely impractical and obsolete under the current balancing system.The CRF This in theory doesn't sound a bad idea especially since it now only uses the free ingame currency.Put your bot designs up in the CRF and if anybody buys your bot you get 25% of the robits they spent.In practice this has lead to a serious lack of creativity, expect to see duplicates of the same bot in some battles and a few core designs that have been widely bought in the CRF making up a frustratingly high percentage of bots.Crate Drops When you finish a battle instead of getting robits towards buying the parts you want you get a crate containing a few random parts. For me I already have plenty of components to play with so this isn't an issue.Its the new players who suffer under this system, most weapons require at least 5-8 of the same weapon equipped to be effective, likewise most movement parts require you to have multiple of the same item. You will likely find that after a few battles you have a selection of new guns and movement part, you will also likely find you only have 1 of each. Do you want to sell items that you likely want to try later anyway at a greatly reduced value until you can afford enough of the part you want to try out or do you want to slowly grind until you eventually have enough of something different you can equip.Lack of progression At one time the game was completely different, you had a tech tree. To buy new parts you first had to research them with research points gained from battle. Your bot size was limited by your level and the size of your bot determined what battle tier you fought in. Researching parts gave you something to work towards, getting that extra CPU from a level so you could add to your bot likewise gave you something to aim for.Now you can buy anything from the start and anything can drop in random chest, levels are simply free crates. The only form of progression is in the MMR teirs of normal mode but unless you play in a platoon you will just yoyo with no progress.Normal Mode This is the primary battle mode replacing Battle arena and therefore needs to be able to hold its own. Unfortunately you spend more time waiting for timers than fighting. Once you are ahead the only thing left to do is spawn camp.The maps are so small that if your team goes for the equaliser you can't be stopped, on 1 map you can even shoot it from within your base, good luck getting ahead on capture points though, you're likely just prolonging the battle.Previously different bots could approach a fight in different ways to all offer a different advantage, for example you could have your tanky and dps bots take a straight kill the enemy on advance approach, while fast bots flank or split push. Now mobility is far less useful to a team since you need to destroy defending vehicles to capture a point and a single tanky vehicle can block a capture point for a good amount of time.Connectivity Progress was made in this area with all players now having to load in before the battle starts. Unfortunately if 1 player fails to load in everybody gets kicked back to the main menu. This isn't much of an issue with the 5v5 setup for normal and basic but Brawl can be rather difficult to get into a game under elimination rules.Collision Physics Crash a hovercraft into a heavy tank and chances are the tank will be flipped into the air while you glide straight though feeling barely a bump.Test Map Test map to me highlights the design decisions frequently made by Freejam. This is supposed to be a map to test your bots and has a shortcut from the edit screen to test your current creation during the build process. Sounds like a useful feature but as usual there is an issue.The physics in test map don't match the physics in battle, this is most noticeable with hovers and flyers. A hovercraft which is perfectly balanced in test map and glides like a hawk could have a 45 degree lean in battle or spin wildly out of control due to a bad centre of thrust.A plane which flies perfectly in test map could prove to be too heavy to leave the ground or completely uncontrollable due to poorly placed thrusters.Mode names and interface Mode names may seem a petty thing to have an issue with but its more the combination of the two. Changing Deathmatch and Battle arena to Basic and Normal just makes it sound more childish or overly casual. Combined with the big blocky mode selection screen gives almost the feeling of a mobile port.TLDR:While I enjoyed the core build, drive, fight concept of the game it lacks the pace, diversity and strategy it once had.In my last version of the review I mentioned that I was getting close to recommending the game again however the beta update has been a massive step back.

								I may not be a super old or veteran player, but I feel entitled, as a paying costumer, to give my opinion about this game. Bad design choices, bad design choices everywhere. I won't go super detailed as some old veterans, like Juvar23, so I will just quickly comment on why I stopped recommending this game to my friends: The last update, Epic Loot, was a good idea. But they executed it in a manner that it feels like one of these mobile games with a life spam of 1-year or less, made to extract the biggest amount possible of money. It's unrewarding, it's relentless, it's not fitting for a game with the premise of BUILDING things. The issue is, the mind behind Freejam, Mark Simmons, is too dellusional over his own work to admit it's flaws, effectively leading the game to disaster.			"

								First off, my hours played is inaccurate. I played MUCH MORE before the game was even on steam.Now, down to business... I was the clan leader of 1 of the first 3 clans in the game(over a year before ""clans"" were actually introduced...), and back then the game was amazing. It was fun at the time, and showed a great deal of promise. Ultimately, we dissolved the clan when the ""moba"" patch hit. The game had already begun to tumble downhill, and showed no signs of improvement.Unfortunately, we were right. It has gotten constantly worse, and worse as time has gone on. I cannot vouch for this ""crate system"" I hear about, as I stopped playing the game long before it was introduced. But I have no doubt in my mind that it's followed the consistant downward spiral created by Freejam.tldr;Was great.Stopped beging great after a few updates.Continued the trend and is now patheticly atrocious.

								Well this game is interesting! It was amazing at first and it was one of my favourite games, but then the devs decided to push a huge update that just ruined it! They removed the leveling system for blocks and mega bots which were an important  part of the game and took a really long time to save up for and a lot of work to get, then in addition they removed the whole levelled armour system. Having different tiers and strengths of armour brought strategy into the game, making it a fun and tactical game which was amazing and actually made the game balanced, but they removed that as well and replaced it with cubes with no differences in strength. What they thought would make this better is being able to paint the bots cubes, only 3 colours unless you pay constantly for premium to access the other colours of course! I can completely understand the 'colour you bot' idea, but my god what did we gain? At least give us some sort of tier system, or something other than this rubbish. If not, don't lock colours behind a pay wall, as this game was meant to be (initially) completely free to play. That idea went out of the window, along with the good game. Then they add dlc. Not your 'new maps and weapons' dlc, but the ability to pay £25 for a couple of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics and crates. Oh and crates? They're the worst idea you've added yet! You remove a currency system which I put money into and replace it with a random loot chest, removing my £10 off of my account and not reimbursing me at all. The chests don't even give you anything good, and in order to get a somewhat okay chance of getting something more than dog♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to pay! This game has gone from an amazing award winning game to something only to steal money from us as, let's be honest, that's what all games devs want nowadays. This game really proves how you can destroy a perfectly fun game and transform it into something that even youtubers say 'shove it' to. You actually disgust me, and everyone else who wants the good, original Robocraft back.			"

								Alright.Enough is enough.I've had this game since they still had tier tech points.Yeah, remember those?See, I kinda supported this game, even after they removed those tech points and introduced the leveling system. But now?Now... I don't. I just don't find this game fun anymore. It's becoming very bland, with the same designs and the same weapons, over and over, match after terrible matchmaking match, with terrible rewards that half the time you can't even put to good use.I put a lot of time into this game, and I remember playing it whenever I possibly could, but now, I literally haven't touched the game in months, and whenever I do touch it, I literally have to force myself to click ""Play"".I'm sorry, Robocraft, my old friend... but you aren't you anymore. It's a no from me.			"

								First off, I have played well over 1000 hours so I know what I'm talking about. 6 months ago this game was in my opinion perfect, you could play whatever mode you wanted, there was armor ranking etcThen you changed the block system to one type of block and a color wheel, ok except all of the non ugly colors are premium and I wanted this to be a fun FREE game. Next every week you added a new weapon each more insanely overpowered than the last, combined with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking and you get people with those things going up against people who still hadn't payed. At this point I was kinda getting turned off the game. Then you add the modules and energy and at this point I don't really play anymore Now you have ENTIRELY Changed the basis of the game, the part which  made it unique, fun and interesting. You got rid of the old tech tree and now have these boxes. You also decided to destroy any attempt at matchmaking so new players get to go head to head with missile launchers. You have successfully turned many people away recently including newcomers and me. And I'm hoping that if you read this and don't believe me please at least be weary as you enter the game			"

								Game WAS good, developers ARE bad.After playing this game 500+ hours i have worked one thing out, the game developers punish people who play the game alot. Whenever there is a big patch, things are changed, added or taken out of the game, this can be a good thing for a new player and maybe the game in general. however if you have played for a reasonable length of time or spent any money in the game, prepare for your items to be worthless, or ingame currency to change so something you paid 50,000,000 of ingame currence on is suddenly worth less then 50,000 with no hint of a reinbursment. or reaching the ultimate tier and spending hundreds of hours building a ship only to have it removed and the money/ingame or real spent on it now worth jack all.If you choose to play this game, be prepared to grind for hundreds of hours, only to have everything u worked for taken away in a patch wrapped in christmas paper, guess the card saying i f*****d your mum is still coming in the mailplease continue to keep abusing the people who love/d the game the most and playe/d it the most.Game WAS good, developers ARE bad.

								Id like to say that the latest update ""Epic"", has gone south in the way i feel about this game. The game WAS fairly good and was pretty much even, this includes the premium etc but now the way this game is aheading is the P2W route. I feel like the game will run down or have the people who spend hundreds of real money for so many crates or so long premium. At first i agree with premium, it gave plenty of goodies and so on, it persusaded me that much that i almost brought a few days. Now i am not. Why? Because its basically useless. You get 4 more slots to get items and you get 4 slots in your platoon...thats it? Last time you got more in-game money when you finish each match, this money could be spent on getting parts which were RANKED! Speaking of Ranked, this system of being ranked? Where did it go? What is with the new players getting weapons like the photo-...? This weapon is crazy, it is the most used and most powerful weapon i have seen. Concluding this, dont get the game until the developers actually listen to the public and remove the things which they ♥♥♥♥ed up on. Simple.Your welcome for this review, i hoped it helped you to stay away from this game			"

								Okay since a few people think I should probably back up my review with actual supports, here goes.   First of all, the game started dying when they removed tiers. Without tiers, there is just no real progression. Yeah, there's still Roboranking, but it doesn't feel like progression as much as it does as just a rank for your robot. You make a bot, it will stay at X rank probably. You make another bot, and that will also stay at X rank. You don't really take a bot through the higher levels of play anymore.    Loot boxes are trash. Literally the worst part of the game. Oh you want a wheel? Good luck finding a loot box with one. Oh and did I mention some items in the loot box are premium locked? Yeah. So chances are, it'll be locked out anyway. Want to actually buy the wheel instead? Well there's no currency. You heard me right, there's no currency besides galaxy cash which you have to pay for with real money. There is robobits or whatever, but you only get them by recycling parts you have already. So good luck with that.    Weapons weapons weapons, so many broken weapons. There's literally a weapon that locks on to any target and destroys it, requiring 0 skill whatsoever. There's too many weapons too. Having an SMG, a Sniper, and a Shotgun like weapon was fine. But then they added all of these other weapons that are too expensive in Robobits or whatever for a F2P player to even buy. Games that are F2P, should reward you for putting some money into the game, but not making the game unplayable if you don't.    Honestly if this game just put tiers back, removed loot boxes, and removed all those broken weapons, maybe I'd give it a good review. But the developers have gone super greedy and desperate for this game to succeed, if not evident by the loot boxes, look at how many times they've payed Yogscast to play their game. They are desperate for money and players. TL:DR; Game used to be good, isn't anymore.			"

								I don't know in which update, but when I came back to this game after a couple months, it is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up now. They added F****** LOOT CRATES, you need to grind I don't know how many ungodly hours before you can even unlock the good gear, which you can't even try out. Once you buy something you're screwed if you don't like it, the resale value is pretty much 5%. The game became unbalanced, the unlock tree is gone and the devs are just throwing in more ways to benefit premium players.			"

								Note (1/9/2017): It's official. This game will simply never leave EA. It is very much a complete game. But why bother leaving EA when it just means you won't be able to use early access as an excuse to dismiss criticism?*TL;DR WARNING*Before you read the rest of the review, I want you to notice a trend. Look at the positive reviews. Notice how most of the positive reviews (except for the ones at the top) are from people with very few hours, rarely more than 100, and almost never over 200. Also look at how the positive reviews (for the most part) sound like they were all written by little children. Compare with negative reviews. Most negative reviews have hundreds of hours, tons of experience, and have watched this game go from something amazing to nothing more than a depressing reminder that you should avoid early access games. On top of that, you can tell that the people who write most of the negative reviews for the most part sound more mature, or at the very least can spell words correctly. Many of the recent positive reviews are worthless comments saying ""good gam"" or ""10/10"" or something equally meaningless.Okay, now I can explain this. The devs for a while now have been deliberately trying to pretty much kick out all of the veterans. They ignore our feedback, ignore our problems, and on top of that, they move out updates that kill massive amounts of the playerbase. Their strategy of getting new players is horrific, and they do it by exchanging experienced veterans for new players, and given that new players usually quit pretty soon after starting the game, you will see on Steam Charts how much this game has fallen in popularity. around 4000 online while writing this, when it was released on Steam a little after I joined, this game had on average around 14000. The game gets a small player spike every time an update is released, but then they eventually lose more players than they gain. FreeJam is attempting to rebuild there playerbase, this time instead of it consisting of friendly and mature players, their new playerbase is made 99% of illiterate 10 year olds that probably all have a below average IQ.Now, let me take you down memory lane to explain to you the updates that really screwed up this once amazing game. Unfortunately, I forgot which order the updates go in, so instead I'm just going to say which major changes screwed over this game, it's community, and it's future.TIERSTiers were what made Robocraft.... Robocraft. I still vividly remember how much I enjoyed moving up tiers. I eventually got to tier 10, and that was a huge accomplishment for me. Now, they removed tiers, and so no one else will be able to feel awesome after finally achieving tier 10. Now, the whole system is based on levels, which was screwed up also.LEVELSIs it even possible for a game to seriously screw up something as basic as a simple leveling system? It is when you work for FreeJam, to aid them on creating a trainwreck of a steam game.. Now, the game depends on leveling, and not tiers. But wait! There's a catch. Now, leveling is so easy, An experienced player could probably create a new account and reach level, 100 within 48 hours. The first time this happened, I went from level 42 instantly to level 100 (the max level at the time), and I heard that they later made it even easier to level up later on.CRFA fairly recent addition to the game was the CRF, or Community Robot Factory. Now, it's easier than ever to plagiarise the bots of other players. Not into plagiarism? Oh well, the CRF still means that much of the element that the game was known for, building, is gone. This game was supposed to be a game where you build, drive, and fight. Now it's a game where you drive and fight bots that you took from someone else. A place to share creations is good for most games, but Robocraft is not one of them.FULL SPECTRUM UPDATEThis was actually a better update that the other ones, I'll admit, but it does take this game a step closer to being pay2win, and does take something else away from the game aswell. Now, cubes are no longer tiered, and with that, they no longer have their own colors. To get better cubes, you need higher robot ranking or levels (I forget since I haven't played this game in weeks) but now all cubes are colorless, all parts are colorless. Everything is white. Non-premium users get only 4 colors, (white, orange, and 2 others that I forgot), while a premium user gets them all.TECH POINTSWhat happened to TP (tech points)? Well, the developers thought to themselves, ""This is unacceptable. Our players are actually enjoying this feature. It must be removed at once!"" and now we have no more tech points. They were originally used to gain access to new parts, although now the tech tree is no longer a tree, it's an ugly elliptical spiral where you get everything on it for free, by leveling up. They may as well just remove the 'tech tree' entirely, cause that implies that there's actually different paths of things to unlock, but nope, not anymore.THE GRINDThis entire section used to be about how grinding for RP took hours upon hours, which took a total of 112 hours for the ""perfect"" regular bot, or otherwise about 450 battles, and about twice as long for a megabot, which has since been removed. Now, however, it's based on an awful CS:GO style RNG clusterf*ck, which is even worse than before. Since the game is now RNG based, I'm unable to make any reasonable predictions about how long it would take to get what you'd consider a ""perfect"" bot. Weapon prices are completely hell now, even worse than before, and now the currency is a ""robits"" system which is beyond terrible. To put it into perspective, every block ingame now costs a certain amount of Robits. Previously unobtainable and rare holoflags (or whatever they're called now) are also now obtainable, which is also where Freejam screwed up. The old premium currency of GC was exchanged for money that you could use to buy premium or crates with. Unfortunately, we got completely ripped off and my 2300 GC was changed to about 3 dollars or something, barely enough for 3 day premium. Anyways, any ingame block has a price of robits, but you can also find any part in crates. However, when recycling something, you literally get a tenth of what its worth, making the whole recycling system an effective waste of money. Another thing worse mentioning is that when opening a crate, you can see what you would have gotten with premium, since premium users get twice as much stuff. And then if you would have gotten something incredibly rare if you were premium, you are just left to feel bad about it unless you want to actually buy premium.ConclusionThis was a longer review than I thought it was going to be, but everything said here is true, except that my statistics may somewhat inaccurate since I haven't played in a while. I'd keep writing on, but apparently there's a limit to how big reviews can be, so I'll stop here. This game is probably the biggest disappointment i've ever played.			"

								11/24/2016 Update:The forums are correct. This is ""the most playable robocraft has been in years"". It's also still very very broken. This most recent patch ""Fast and Formidible"" is a resounding ""meh"". It fixes >none< of the previous problems introduced by previous patches. ""Fast"" is still a invisible parking brake griding into your face. ""Formidable"" is actually fat, slow, and under gunned.RNG slot machine rewards are still fustrating and tedious, much like the Battle Area mode. You >will not< be getting any of the parts a free form building games critically >needs<.*Sound and VIsuals are great! They really add much needed environmental depth, and are the single positive to the game itself.All other aspects of game balance, offense vs defense, match rewards, ect are dismal. That 2014/2015 steam rating of 95%+? Free Jam, You guys earned that.The ""Epic Loot"" steam rating of 30%? You guys earned that too, and thats where the current 11/24/2016 build still stands.Previous Review:A very interesting, entertaining idea, with almost unbelievebly poor design choices.A sadly accurate forum description was: ""It's like watching a bunch cluless guys burn down my favorite pub.""These design decisions for the last year, expecially that last 4 months or so, have completely gutted the building aspect of what once was a building focused game. The devs decision to make every weapon nearly insta gib removed any sort of depth and flavor Robocraft once had. Additional poorly though out, crudely bolted on mechanics have added nothing but frustration to this now bland, generic FPS.What was once my favorite game has become a strangely fascinating game development trainwreck in super slow motion. Not recommended for any age group.5/4/2016 edit, giving the new loot system time for two ""fixes"".As pointed out in the forums and Reddit, this: 


YouTube™ Video: The Skinner Box - How Games Condition People to Play More - Extra Credits 

			Views: 649,183		

			Engaging design is extremely important in games, but too often simple reward systems are used to keep players playing longer or spending more money on in-game purchases.		

 is the entire reasoning behind the sloppy, broken slot machine crate system. Even worse, in typical FreeJam style, it has been very poorly implemented in a sudden, ham fisted manner.Just as bad is the new ""flattened"" weapon balance. Small variants are still inferior to the ""rare"" or very expensive ""epic"" and ""Legendary"" larger ones, damage is vastly to high and now even more frustrating to use. The only Time to Kill increase comes from the forced stop to the fight, since you ran out of energy to fire.Layers and layers of more ""Cons"" to add to game play. 1/10. Single pro for minor GUI improvements.			"

								I used to play robocraft when tiers existed.  There was a clear game progression and you could build a bot to play at specific levels.I recently returned to the game and I am extremely dissapointed in the path the developers have taken the game.I tried playing my old bots which used to be very good at their tier and they are now useless, not because they are badly designed, but because the game has turned into a massive P2W scheme.For example: To maximize damage on my SMG bot, I need 8 uncommon SMG weapons giving 60k dps for 80 CPU.To maximuse damage with epics, I need 4 epic SMG weapons giving 80k dps for 104 CPU.That is a 33% increase in DPS that I can do nothing about to compete with and the CPU difference is so small that I will always be paired against those superior bots.

								The game has sadly become excedingly pay to win.  Unique and well constructed robots pretty much no longer exist, almost every bot you will see will be a variation on whatever the current meta is.  The game also penalizes your standing in the leagues and thus your chances of getting better items, which are required to play in higher leagues, by rating your performance entirely on whether you win or lose, get matched with crappy players over and over and you can drop entire ranks and theres nothing you can do about it.The loot system is one of the worst systems I've ever seen outside of iphone games where your forced to watch advertisements.  Opening crates often taunts you with high powered items you cant have unless you pay for premium, and the only way to build a specific item is to sell your existing stuff for insignificant amounts of ingame currency.There is a massive lack of balance between the power and rarity of items.  If a player refuses to pay money, they are forced into an endless pvp grind where their opponents will oftentimes have higher tier equipment that will win in nearly every fight.			"

								I first played this many months ago and decided to give it a try tonight, only to find they have added ""EasyAntiCheat"" as a requirement. While I get that client side anti-cheat software can be useful and seems to have been needed based on forum posts, I have considerable privacy concerns based on what EAC is requesting it be allowed to do on my computer.The software itself has full access to screenshot, keylog and google searches have shown the results are publicly available for all to see. The only limiting factor is their word that it only operates while the game is running. While I'm sure there is other anti-cheat software running on my computer (ie steam), the data it returns to any third party servers has never been Google searchable.I recommend the developers for Robocraft force a migration of their users to Steam and use Steam's built in anti-cheat instead of using a third party app developer who obviously has zero clue on how to secure data being returned to their servers. There's no excuse for that to be Google searchable.			"

								EDIT: I want to point out, that since this game has made the changes i listed below. The games rating (especially recent) has plummited from ""overwhelmingly positive"" and is now sitting at ""mixed"". As mentioned in comments, the people who have the most hours, are the ones not reccomending it!If you asked me ANY Time last year or even earlier this year i would've said this is by far my favorite game, they removed teirs, they removed the pilot seat, they screw up the tech web so you're stuck with a tech pole, not even a tree. You used to be able to pick what things you wanted more than others, if you didn't want helium, you didn't need helium, they could care less. Now you get helium regardless of what you want.That was just a scratch of what this review is. Now i will explain why each of those things was important.-The pilot seat- This used to be what you had to protect, you had to deal with the weight of it, engineer creative ways you could protect it from being damaged, now thats removed, what is there to protect? Guns? Wheels? Blocks?-Tiers- This was the ""Leveling up"". It was implemented a way i loved, you upgrade your blocks and guns, so that would count towards your new teir, as soon as you had enough of htose blocks and guns your teir would go up, now it's a level thing, A little to confusing to under stand as well. I belive as you hit marks you get new items.Along with the removal of teirs came the removal of teired items, now it is a weird one item thing, where some guns get better as the price goes up? And are stupidly expensive.-""Tech tree""- The tech web, yes at one point is was a tech web, now you get one item after the other, so you are forced on the items you get one after another. You used to be able to pick and choose what YOU wanted, they had tech points you earned and with those you evolved your tech web, and you would get to choose what item you wanted, although eventually you would need to get the rest but you could get the stuff you wanted way before them. Now you are stuck with the spiral tech pole.  If they revert this stuff it will become my favorite game, but now, it's just not even fun to play. It's pointless, and dumbed down. It used to take skill, now you can spam blocks and actually still do decent. Out of my 50 games at the momment this dropped down from #1 to bottom 3 favorite games.			"

								Robocraft was a great game to play. The new Robocraft: Unleashed update came out and all of a sudden everything has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The credit system in the past used to be great, I would get a nice amount of credits for finishing a game in a high tier. 200-300k depending if I did gone in that match. Now, since the new update has came out, when finishing a game I get about 30-60k credits. This doesn't help when the higher tier parts cost about 100-150k each. Furthermore, they removed the Tech Tree system, which grants access to all of the part depending on your player level. I am a high level, and it feels as if there is no progression in the game anymore. I got a buzz out of working to unlock parts to build my Bot; but now its just handed to me and it just doesn't quite feel the same. To be honest, it feels awful. They have removed tiers in the game, may I add it was a great system, and replaced it with Robot Ranking. Robot what? Anyone can be matched with anyone, and there is no sense of achievement anymore. You could acknowledge that you have increased in tier, and you would feel great because of it. You could feel progression through the tiers as you earned more and more tech points and credits. Now? You feel nothing. Robot Ranking isnt quite the same, and to be honest... It is a dissapointment. I couldn't wait to download the new update as I thought it would bring loads of new features to the game to make it more fun, to be honest they just ♥♥♥♥ed it right up.Finally, they decided to change the UI to a mouse-based system. Was there any point? You could have used certain keys to open different menus. Now its all mouse based and is sluggish as ♥♥♥♥; Another unnecessary feature that has ruined the game.The new matchmaking system that they decided to add in allows you to play with anyone you want which, don't get me wrong, sounds like a great idea. But the only problem is, it doesn't work. Basing this description on the tier system, it basically matches lower and higher tiers together. Tier 5s battling Tier 10s and Megabots? Not fair at all. This completely ruined the game for me as my Bot was completely useless against some other Bot designs that had overpowered SMGS that they unlocked also because of another terrible unnessecary feature that they added; the awful new Player Level tech tree system.To finish it off, I wouldn't recommend this game to any newcomers until FreeJam get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and realise which features are necessary and which features aren't. The game isn't fun to play anymore, they killed that vibe along with the hype that everybody had leading up to this update. Long time players are sure to be quitting this game because of the trouble this update has caused; infact, there is no point in even downloading. The community is slowly dying.UPDATE 25/8/15 : They fixed the credits, the game is much better as they have fixed this. Still would not reccomend until they fix the other messed up features.UPDATE 6/3/16 : They fixed the credits but quadrupled the price of the parts? Wow.UPDATE 8/3/16 : THEY ♥♥♥♥ED THE CREDIT SYSTEM AGAIN!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? THE DECENT MODULES AND WEAPONS ARE 1MIL+ AND THEY EXPECT 50k A GAME TO CUT IT!!?!?!?!?! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

								There's a reason this game's awards are all from 2013/14, this game was great. It was amazing because it was dumb, it was amazing creative possibilites leading to theraputic mindless destruction. But then they starting adding moba like properties to it, then ranks, then they put all creative possibilities behind a paid subscription wall. haven't played it since then. They could even just revert to a previous version and it would be better than the current one. Don't waste your time on this♥♥♥♥♥♥game.			"

								Don't download at all within the next couple of months because the game is completely changing so it won't be anything like it is now or even what it used to be. This developer has no idea what they are doing and for some reason want to base their unique idea off of games that are not even the same genre e.g League of legends and heroes of the storm. That is legit from the developers mouth, they are gonna take their current meta and change it into other games metas.I love this game but if this is the direction they want to go in it won't be the game that i have played since it came out. I've been there for every change and I don't see how their newest direction is going to be a good one. It used to be unique.*UPDATE* 30/4/16So I Haven't been able to play this latest update but from what i have seen the game is almost entirely pay 2 win. If you have been playing the game as long as i have then good for you, you now have lots of cash to spend on crates that will allow you to completely do whatever you want. If you're new to Robocraft then the news is a bit more unfortunate. Welcome to the latest in gaming inovation newbies as you are now in a sense gambling your way to a new bot, let's hope you actually manage to create something you like even though you're now forced in a certain direction then having free reign to buy any block like you used to.A lot of people have used the term ""Dated Concept"" when referring to how robocraft's old tier system used to work, You level up and spend tech points to breach yourself into that sweet new tier that has an entirely new meta than the old one and etc. It's fairly simple and it worked quite well in my opinion, I always wanted to get to tier 10 and fight against people who had refined skill and bots to match.Here's the thing i don't like about the term ""Dated Concept"" while this concept is old and everyone is used to it now that doesn't mean in any way that it was detrimental to Robocraft. If ""Dated Concepts"" didn't work in gaming then games like Terraria would have failed, it's pixel style in a 2D world is a dated concept and yet most of us would agree that this style is what we enjoyed about it. Robocraft had a style, it's take on the traditional progression system was one that allowed for a great flow of creativity and freedom in build. You chose your parts and what kind of bot you wanted to be. Somewhere along the way the devs of this game got the impression that because this style was dated it needed to change. When most of us would have just liked some more gamemodes and the new parts.Lots to read i know but I truly loved this game and i kinda wish i had it back. Don't get me wrong the game still has it's moments though.Also sidenote why the hell is this still in early access i mean the game has changed so much there's no way it can still fit in this category.

								This used to be a really fun game.Very challenging, yet fair. But with the latest updates I'm getting that strange feeling that developers do everything to make it as unplayable as possible. It used to require minimum ammount of skill to build a viable robot, nowadays you just need to build a brick, slap a gun and tons of thrusters on it and you're unstoppable. This kills both fun and creative aspect of the game.The new ""random loot"" system is a joke. It literally forces you to grind for ages to hopefully get a part that you need. If you aren't lucky, then you need to grind even more, because recycle rate for useless parts is unfair to be gentle.Also that randomness has other drawbacks. For example starting the game at level 1, you may encounter enemies who were lucky to get a legendary weapon and 1-shot you with it. (super fair play)But the worst thing that hasn't been fixed since the very beginning of the game... matchmaking. You either get in a match with bots waay above or waay below your level. That wouldn't be a problem though if the teams were equal in size. 90% of matches is 8vs7, 8vs6 and I even had a few with 8vs4. So as mentioned above, at the current state the game is totally unplayable.The only positive aspect oft the game which I can think of is the creative part of it. If you somehow manage to get to max level and somehow managed to gather all the parts you wanted, you can indeed create a uniquely looking robot and then watch it get killed by a brick.For now my score for this game is 2/10 and untill Freejam reverts back to the old loot system, fixes matchmaking and balances stuff, I'm not changing my opinion. So if you like to get frustrated alot, download the game right away.			"

								This game hit the dirt right when the energy system got introduced.They decided to throw out the entire core of the game and run it trough a blender.A really unfair and stupid crate system got introduced to hinder new players and milk some delicious cash out of them.I spend hundreds of hours in this thing and was real damn good at it for a while and it was fun as all ♥♥♥♥.This was back when you could in fact make a functional art bot and lead the team in it. It was back when it took a bit of time to kill someone or be killed, teams kind of played more tactically because games took longer, now it's always over real damn fast andm ost of the time you don't even ♥♥♥♥ing know why or how. It's a visual mess with no structure.A real good example i can give of how ♥♥♥♥ed this game is right now is this. You take a tiny maybe 16 blocks long car with 6 t3 smgs, no fancy pantsy skill blocks and really average wheels and enter a game. What kind of opponents do you expect? Small bots with low powered weapons to match yours and have a cute fun low tier game where you can drift your Panda Trueno around dudes dispensing laser fire into them? NOPE here have weapons that one shot you and huge bots because what is balance.Seriously freejam what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you, why did you ruin a very very special game. You had something there you really did... Now all you have is lumps of messy blocks with a shotgun attached. GG			"

								Where to begin...Alright. I've actually played far longer than my nearly 90 hours, starting wa-ay back when Robots were real Robots and Pilots were real Pilots. Matchmaking was balanced, no one weapon was extremely Overpowered and there were fun game modes like the Boss Battle.And then it all changed. First to go were Tiers, which had balanced matchmaking oh so well. Suddenly formally Tier 9/10 Bots were facing off with Tier 3-5. Then Tech points disappeared. Literally. They vanished. Out with an actual feeling of progression. Weapons became an unbalanced mess, what was OP one week was bottom of the barrel next update. We used to have a physics engine that nearly made sense, well, that's gone. Wings? Pffff I can fly a shielded box with a couple of thrusters. And so we get to the latest update. Woo hoo, Missiles and Flak. Plasma is OP again! Hooray. Missiles can kill you from halfway across the map and lock-on! Yay. Oh but there's a counter to both! A shield module! Just $10 Million! TL;DR: We had a nice, progressive, fairly balanced game. We now have this.			"

								Hello. My name is Jeff, I am 28 and I have been playing Robocraft for over a year and a half now.In the next few paragraphs I will try to explain how and why Robocraft has gone from one of my all time favourite games, to no longer worthy of my time.I will start by telling you more about me, and my account.I have always been able to think outside of the box, and come up with great, new, original ideas. This gave me the ability to create, test, and perfect many bots that looked, and functioned like no one else's. I took great pride in spending MANY hours making these ground breaking bots. I enjoyed it so much I often offered to lend a hand to all of my fellow friends and community members. Thus - I have the account and passwords to 22 other accounts. Some of them have as much money and hours invested as mine, however none of which play any longer for the same reasons you are about to read.I have more hours logged then most players.(928)I probably have another 500+ hours logged on friends accounts.I have more garage slots then most players. (30+)Prior to the reduction of max CPU per tier I had all 30 garage slots full of max CPU builds (1511, -more details on this issue to come)I HAD a bot for each Tier 1-4 and 2 bots for each tier 5-9. I kept a healer, and a DPS in every tier to allow me to help friends level up. (I used to premote this game heavily amognst friends)I still have have some of the BEST T-10 max cpu builds possible. (16+)Read that again. 16- T10 bots. All finely tuned and perfected for battle.At one point I also had 2 max CPU Megabots - but tore them apart as the Dev team seemed to go in a different direction after releasing Megabots. In other words.... They were a huge time and money sink with no real way to play them in any game mode without waiting 10-20 min to get into a 3 min game.I have over 200,000,000 in-game credits.I had every single part unlocked and some 150,000 T-10 tech points.....  I had many thousand Tech points in every tier until they did away with tech points at the same time they did away with tiers (more details to come)None of this matters when you have changed the game to the point it is not enjoyable to play.My advice - STAY AWAY!-If you want a more details on why the devs are ruining this game - continue reading.The #1 reason for me is a 3 step process. (represented by A,B,C)-A. They put a Max CPU cap on all lower levels leading up to the old max of 1511. T-1 500 T-2 600T-3 700 etc. etc. etc. They did this, because they claimed it was unfair to have a 1511 CPU bot in tiers lower then 10. My argument is the tiers were broken up by RoboRanking - not CPU.  So If I choose to be skimp on armor, and movement parts, to get a better gun, and play my bot to its strengths and weaknesses then that choice is on me.  The same give and take could be made with any combo of parts as long as you stayed inside the RoboRanking of the tier you wished to stay in. Each part added its respected value, meaning the better the item - the more RoboRanking it had. You could make a 1511 CPU bot with the same RoboRanking as a 900 CPU bot using different combination of parts.At the same time they applied a max CPU cap per tier - they also made it impossible to add any guns HIGHER then the tier you were aiming to build in. In other words.... IF you took one white block, and added one T-7 SMG to it, your one white block is now a T-7. Same for any gun type, of any tier. Not a big deal unless you already had 13-15 max cpu bots at lower levels that ranged from T1-T9. All of these bots I spent a GREAT deal of time making, and fine tuning. So suddenly all of these bots were T10. Obviously these bots were not able to compete with proper T10 builds.-B. So I was forced to DELETE all of my T-1 through T-9 bots that I spent so much time working on. But I am not easily deterred, so I get started on rebuilding. I spend MANY MORE hours remaking lower tier bots inside the new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t requirements only to have the VERY next update (2-3 weeks later)remove tiers completely. Really?  Like REALLY, really? If your whole plan was to remove the tiers entirely then why even release the update before it forcing all this nonsense on me? Why not release the updates together so I didnt just waste 3 weeks of my life?? To make them more ""fair,"" (not sure how this process is fair to players like myself) is their official statement. ""Balancing of the tiers.""-C. Now there is a broken match making system that attempts to put you in with other bots around the same rank as you. It fails horribly. They were trying to prevent people from stacking at the top of a tier to make it easier for the people at the bottom. Instead, they take you from wherever tier you are in and places you against people 2-3 tiers higher. Cause that's fair.All they were trying to accomplish was water it down, so the young kids, and faint of heart, did not have a hissy fit when it came time to enter a new tier. -Point of interest- It is supposed to be hard..... That is what leveling up, and grinding is all about. This is also how YOU, Devjam, make your money. By offering a solution to those who do not wish to grind.  Okay - So looking past that huge game breaker of tier removal...what else is wrong?The new game mode?You really think it is a good idea to give each team a shield around their base, that they can shoot OUT of but enemies can not shoot IN TO? AND while doing that you want to buff snipers so they can 1 shot you?The middle of the map became a no man's land.... People would literally just sit inside their base dome, camping, waiting for the enemy to leave the safety of their dome.... As soon as you leave your dome you get sent back to respawn. Said snipers are not playing the objective of the map. Just straight up camping. And - can you blame them? Thats on the Devs.Robocraft is a PERFECT example of how devs kill early access games. They spend too much time trying to nerf this and nerf that so that all the little 12 year olds can get along. When are you going to build a game that time and effort is going to be a factor in your success? The amount of time I spent fine tuning 1 bot until it was perfect is probably more time then most other people have played the game in total.... Only to have that 50-100 hours spent on 1 bot to be ruined by the next update, or exploited by a glitch. or even worse - reduce the max cpu per tier forcing players to remake their lower level bots - only to completely remove the tiers entirely... What a ♥♥♥♥ing slap in the face that was. No compensation for time lost. - I can not even get a single Dev to respond to me anywhere, about anything. I have tried politely messaging them privately, publicly, on their personal pages, public pages, left forum posts, filled out reviews on the website..... ZERO response from anyone but noobs who have no idea WTF I am even talking about.And why do you keep releasing ""new content"" when you can't even get the previous updates ""new content"" to work correctly.....Talk about a joke....This game went down hill when megabots (not even worth getting into that discussion) were released, and every update since has only made it worse.I have uninstalled the game - if you are interested in purchasing my account - message me.

								sigh..... Really isn't much you can really do to get through to the devs. In fact they don't listen at all. I loved this game so much and put many hours into it. I did manage to play it for another ~20 hours after the ""Epic Loot"" update somehow but it got repetitive. That update in my opinion being the WORST adition you can possibly put into a game where you BUILD the robot the wa YOU want it. That update has made it literally the hardest thing to do due to it's mechanic. It could've been handled better like just a new reward you get along with earned currency. I got bored with this game real quickly because I couldn't really experiment that often or freely with new weapons and modules because I couldn't buy them. overall was good pre box era. Now really difficulit to get a foothold.  "

								I've stuck through the past updates, but this most recent one is perhaps the hardest to swallow.FJ took a a dump over the entire building mechanic by making every single part - Even the most basic chassis blocks - RNG loot. Want to build a plane now? Pray you get wings in crates. And then go through 50 or so crates, and still be missing half the wings you need. And get a few worthless mask pieces while doing so - And I do mean worthless. Their recycle rate is .025% compared to other parts that recycle at 20 to 40%.New players are going to get shafted the most off of this update since mid and higher level players are going to be grinding low levels for protocrates using ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t gnat-seeker bots that are all but impossiable to hit using low end weapons - And most higher end weapons, minus the seeker itself of course, as well - and are armed with a weapon that the user doesn't even have to AIM to get kills with.Of course, this is dependent upon you getting matched with bots that are near your own rankings. This game is a bit netorious for bad match making, and this update just made that even worse.FJ made progress with the ML and FSC updates, but they crapped all over that progress with the microtransaction inspired loot-crates change.

								There once was a time when this game was simple, had a simple matchmaking system, and a simple ship building concept. It was a game where you battled to get more stuff for your ship, used the stuff to battle and get more stuff, and eventually unlock cool items to put on your ship. Players were sorted into ""tiers"", which were general leagues of power for a ship. You simply could not place powerful items on your ship and expect to keep facing noob players. The tier concept allowed good players to maximize ships for specific laugues of players, and for less skilled players to know that, once they place enough items on their ship to go into a new tier, they will be at a slight dissadvantage unless they prepare right.It made the concept of unbalanced gameplay less unbalanced. Now, unfortunately, you know absolutely nothing about your opponents, or whether specific items will be overspending for your level and land you in a new group of opponents, or if your weapons aren't quite powerful enough to face off with the people at your level. You go in blind, and can't even leave the damn match with any means other than the task manager when you screw up your build. This could mean a solid ten minutes of gameplay in which you are simply wasting your time.If it's really a concern about unbalanced teams after someone leaves, then just throw in one of those pre-made ships piloted by an AI or something. Or better yet, don't make it a damn trial and error session just to make a ship for a specific group. I couldn't even make a ship with nothing but cubes and a few smg's without getting blasted apart by people outside my preparation.Seriously, I don't know what to use and what not to use. Do I grab some shielding, or does it raise my ranking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton so I don't know? What guns are people using at my level? Are cubes good armor, or do they even HAVE armor in this game?This game was once simple, and it was good. Maybe people like what they have now, but I wouldn't know since I have no F-ing clue what they'd be talking about.			"

								I joined this game and fell in love with the custom robots, the balanced tier system, and the fun mechanics of the weapons and building before the Marks update(Thar be gunchairs over them thar hills!). Should've known this malarky wouldn't've stopped after more than one flip of the table update. They never stop even after much disdain to how the updates change things, and they never backpedal, even when somebody not two sheets to the wind would. It's now all about who has the ""legendary"" weapons. Who's gotten the RNG favor today? Never gotten anything good other than pitiful cosmetics or something I already have plenty of. I get a legendary? It's a blimmin' ""special"" pair of wings. I get epic? Gee, six useless cubes that some idiot rubbed up on with charcoal(carbon),... Joy. Only time I saw anything worthwhile in this topsy turvey hole is when it was on premium, which I'm assuming is also more likely than free to get legendary items. It's flak, shotgun, or grind until you get them because everything else is six feet under as even rails won't stop a horde of blinking shotgun, crutch players. I enjoy the fond memories, but over 200 hours of my life were wasted on this sinking ship. Glad this mutated, devolved abomination is out of my library forever(and a day).Also, ever notice how most positive reviews keeping this game's recent review rating above ""Mostly Negative"" are not just grammatically inept, but simple statements with no reasoning or logic as to why it is actually still anything more than another ""social experiment"" gone wrong?This game may be ""free"", but I'd like 265 hours of my life refunded, please!Update:Just came back to check, and congratulations on making it more visible to the developers, as Steam now regards the recent reviews as ""Mostly Negative"". May it someday penetrate the narcissistic, thick craniums that choose a vile idea of what they want to make rather than the majority's desires, that someday we may actually have fun grinding gear again, as I did before epic loot or their abysmal energy malarky.Though seriously, a couple condescending numbskulls on youtube making reaction videos were smart enough to backpedal, so why the hell isn't a single person in a team of about 35 bright enough to do so?As an update, I've reviewed this on IndieDB as well, and here is the review:From the heights of potential and of much praise, to something whose developers condemn the very people advising them of their wrongdoings, proclaiming their own players at fault for not adapting, and in spite of the condemnation of such a lousy recent update, all they'll do is tweak it and add onto it, blaming us players for the prestated fault. I'm sorry, I'm not fond of adapting to a bed of nails at night, nor people who say they listen, but only if it's a one-sided conversation in their favor(""quality of life"" voting system, wink wink*flipped bird*). I had so much fun at one time, making custom robots in creative ways and duking it out with others, but that was many, many updates ago. They've done it before, and they've done it again after the main update everybody is ragging upon, with the armor update. They flip the main mechanics of the game about like a yo-yo and expect us to deal with it. What we hold dear also means nothing to them, proven with the removal of megas, and the addition of shotguns. Now you'll never have to worry about actually spending effort, creativity, time, or any intelligent ingenuity! Just money(go figures, eh?)! All your work gets annihilated in a heartbeat anyway, courtesy of shotguns. Just grab a couple high-tier legs, a couple shotguns, perhaps a blink module and some rechargers, then slap a couple armor cubes on, or maybe a flak! You'll win every time until the matchmaker forces you to lose twenty games in a row(gee, 'fair', right?!)! This game is not what it was, and not in a good way. It didn't change into something of worth or equal value, it mutated into an abomination lead by minds beyond a point of any sane return. Wanna bet the developers still will pay us no heed, and if they do, they'll be obnoxiously condescending?I highly recommend you review it on IndieDB as well. There aren't many reviews, and any surge of reviews now will be recent, so they... might maybe,... possibly actually... listen to us.			"

								Man I used to love this game...I played this back when the tech tree still existed. Good times.This game used to be friggin' AMAZING. Over time, every update just made it worse and worse.Pros:-Build a custom tank to use in battle-Party up with friends (if you had any ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))-Multiple gamemodes including elimination and Battle Arena (kinda like control point in TF2)-Updates often bring new weapons and contruction itemsCons:-Updates tend to make the game worse-Tech tree was removed (level 1's can get lucky and have missile launcher)-Armorgeddon events (Increases everyone's HP to ruidiculous levels making every fight long and annoying)-HackersSomehow there's a hack that still hasn't been dealt with that makes the hacker's tank invisible and invincible ruining the entire game. It is impossible to fight against.-Instead of saving money to buy weapons and such, it has been replaced with crates/loot boxes that are completely RNG based other than the tier you recieve. You can still buy items, but they're ridiculously overpriced and you can only get money from selling items from crates where you tipically get items that sell from 1-100 dollars or robits when the only good things you can buy with them cost 5,000-1,000,000. Yeah. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken.			"

								The developers have shown again and again a great example of how to take a really good game and drive it into the ground. I used to recommend this to many friends but after having more and more features removed I am left with no feeling of progression or achievement.Do the developers care about the game? Probably. But in reality it just feels like they are trying to swap the game out from under our feet. I used to invest my time into improving my robot and be really excited to try out a new part but now it's only good for a quick round of shooting things where most of the bots are just the same design. Creativity is gone. Originality is gone. Excitement is gone.This is not the game I supported in the past. It's still a fun game in some ways but be cautious about how attached you get to it. They might decide robots are not what they want in the game anymore and continue making it less unique by turning it into a FPS. It wouldn't suprise me if they did.Oh and if you do play it you should know this. When it says press left shift... they mean right. And while this isn't really a big deal it does describe my opinion on the direction this game is going. Backwards.Disclaimer: I am probably being a little harsh on the game but when you get crapped time after time then it kind of hurts your opinion.			"

								RNG reward is painful.  Recycle prices are way too low.  It's too hard to get the parts you want.  Balance issues.  Matchmaking accuracy nosedived. Despite an overwhelming negative response, FJ isn't going to budge.  One update tanked an otherwise positively reviewed game. "

								*Sigh*  I wish I didn't have to do this.   They have made so many improvements since I first begun, a lot of which I actually recommended precisely, (SMG's having travel was awesome).   It really is a lot of fun to play. I like most of the 'gameplay' changes they have done, I think they've been pretty great. Battle is my favorite mode.   And I have found myself putting small amounts of money into it on occasion to get premium.But there are some things which absolutely ruined the entire concept for me.. and honestly they can be fixed fairly simply.  #1)  Currency. At the moment called 'Robits' I think. You used to be able to receive a fair amount of it from completing a match. With this money you could go ahead and purchase anything you want to.  Every match felt very rewarding and you got what felt like a fair compensation for your efforts and participation.  This has been changed.  Now you receive, first of all, the worth is far less.. but you receive a completely random slew of parts.  The only way to even make this currency is to jot down or remember what parts you got in particular, and go to the store and then exchange them for robits.  Time-consuming and inconvenient.  The *only* benefit to the current system is that you have the chance to receive rare, exotic 'bling' items that you couldn't before.   But the fact that you are given paltry, sorry little rewards for a match now is extremely disappointing. The fact that you have zero choice over what parts you get initially is very disappointing.  The fact that exchanging the parts for money literally requires remembering which random pieces you got or writing it down, is thoroughly disappointing.  #2) Daily win Bonus:  WHY did they take this out?  I loved these.. these are why I played the game.. I play many games and don't always have time for Robocraft. But getting a win in with each robot, each day, and being rewarded for that, felt great!  Felt very nice to accomplish. Please bring that back. Now you only get a paltry bronze loot crate for a log-in per-day.  Blegh.  So it encourages people to log in, not to play.			"

Early Access Review
								WAS the Awesomenes Construction Simulator 2014. That is what this game WAS. Note that I'm a Tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.I have Built:M-35 Mako from Mass Effect 1M-44 Hammerhead from Mass Effect 2.UT-47A Kodiak from Mass Effect 3.Terran Diamondback from Starcraft 2.Terran Ar♥♥♥♥e Mercenary Siege Tank. (YES. THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)But none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with ""Improvments to the system"", and a plethora of other problems.Back in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- ""Clone Wars""So let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- ""Double Edged Butt-♥♥♥♥ery""Now PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a ""Repair function"" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).- ""Hero Zero"" Next up was the ""Hero System"", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ - ""Turn up for Hate""Now, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE. - ""From Intense to Indense""This game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The ""Respawned and Overclocked"" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named ""Classic"" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. ""Classic"" is now as worthwhile as dumping your♥♥♥♥♥in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED. - ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY ♥♥♥♥ING KEYBOARD!?!""The controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYER. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES!""Why all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO ♥♥♥♥ING PROGRESS. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1""The introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, ""If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game"". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - ""GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!""WHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like your♥♥♥♥♥ you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder* - ""Nerf 'em to the Grave""Now, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example. - ""From Speedy to Needy""I made a vehicle called ""The Masterkill B@stard"" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - ""Final Thoughts""Lastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. A toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, ALL IN THE NAME, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. Stay. Away. From this hideous deformed child of a game. You will be stricken with it's Gods-awful MOBA wannabe gameplay.[More on my Review in the Comments section]			"

								When Robocraft released it was fun, me and friends would spend ages playing it. Now after nearly 400 hours we un-installed it, they  ruined it. My personal opinion is it's no fun compared to when it first released. It isn't fun having weapons that you can't easily avoid if your a flyer or weapons which require no skill to use giving players and easy RP. They add something then after a little remove it. They removed Tiers which was the point of the game, they removed pilot seat. It used to be fun and gameplay used to be really fun, but now it isn't matches take on average for me after testing and recording multiple games 50 seconds where as before they could take up to 6 minutes. Building a bot used to be a skill now you build a small aero rod frame, add a few weapons types, hang back and suddenly your getting loads of kills, where's the fun in being taken out by someone who spends no time making bots and enjoying the game instead just out to get as much RP as possible; compared to the veterans who can spend hours building and playing properly. My own opinion.			"

								This used to be really good.  You removed RP.  Okay I can take that.  You add crates.  Ehhh, ok I'll deal with it.  But now... NOW YOU DO THIS?  You guys ruined the game.  I'm so sad right now... I used to love this and now it is unplayable.  First of all, the matchmaking system is still HORRIBLE.  I get matched with players probably 100 levels lower than me.  Second of all, the new game mode not only got rid of the tower based system, but is full of flaws.  Probably the most irritating one to me is that it FORCES you to get a rank.  I made a vow to never get one and you guys just ruined my whole Robocraft career by forcing me to do so.  Plus, the protonium eruption FLIPS YOU OVER.  We still don't even have a built in voice chat function to coordinate our team.  Please Freejam, at least bring back the old game modes.			"

								Short version: they go back and forth in the development adding and removing features. Sometimes awful features (like pay per team up) are kept too long alive before realizing the mistake. In the end... mah... give it a try, you may find the game in a state you can actually have some fun. I'll get back to it too probably to check what is changed in these months.EDIT: after several months the pay per full team has been removed. If only they would think 5 minutes more before releasing an update and maybe fixing things in a week instead of months this game would be a lot better...EDIT: ...and all of a sudden a mass of positive reviews of players with like 0-10 hours of playtime appeared in a bunch of days, all having more or less the same useless pattern. Now you know where the money you spend on premium goes...EDIT: they added a paywall contest too. Make food-looking bot. Sadly they already put all the colors we once had behind the usual paywall. This way you have to buy premium in order to get the chance to do anything that is not 4 monotone colors made...EDIT: now they are organizing 5vs5 tournaments claiming they finally have a competitive scene... that would be fine if everyone had the same chances to play and train, but obviously it's not like that, since the so called paywall. unbelievable...Best thing this game can teach is that spoiled kids have more chance than others. Great job...Long version:Besides the amazing sound and the perfectly fit graphic here is one of the many (and really, the most shameful one) reasons you should not play this game:After 2 years of playing, hoping for the best and supporting the game for a while, in the usual attempt to ""mimic moba"" they have introduced a 5vs5 mode, but guess what:In order to play in full team you have to pay. yes, you got it right. you have to pay for having a full team and stomp on random people, matched for you by their long term broken matchmaker.They will come to you with any possible excuse like ""we are cheaper than others"" or ""you need just 1 player to pay [for having the chance to stomp on pubs]"", but in the end that's what all is about. They will also flood the forum with promises and projects they will not stick to, defended by a horde of kids that will spawn endless ""stfu we are in alpha"" messages.It really sets a milestone in the multiplayer games. the most unfair one.Back when games development wasn't purely based on greed we called this ""pub bashing"" and that was the lamest thing a team could do. In robocraft you can pay for bashing pubs, it's perfectly allowed and even promoted by the game itself.It puts every kind of real cooperation, competition, strategy and fair multiplayer whatsoever behind a paywall.The crate system was already a huge drawback for a game that proposed itself as an innovative building one. Turning it into a loot/gamble hell and removing any real decision on the items to buy with in-game points... if you don't want to wait for a couple of months of grinding for getting some (oh, you can of course rise the chances with real money...). But hey, there are people who like these kind of games, so whatever...Now they reach the bottom. After the additional paying slot for platoons, they offer paying full team bashing.Many things have been proposed by the community, like private servers and many suggestions have been made about fair games, custom games and tournaments but they got no clue of what fair and balanced gaming is about except for every possible way to get an income from that.There are 2 ways:1 make an amazing product that everyone loves, supports and buys. This was the original project.2 put candies for kids behind a paywall. This is Freejam way.If you had any hope about this company forget about it and move on.			"

								Like most people say, the developers do not listen to feedback and continue to make the game how they feel it should be made. They seem to like making things that go boom, and threw both game balance and logic out the window months ago. The game runs very poorly; I set everything to the fastest or lowest quality possible, and yet I still get huge drops in framerate. There is somewhat frequent server maintenance, usually at night, but is has stopped me from playing a few times.I'm a fairly new player. Most of the fancy new weapons and movement pieces they add cost tens of thousands of in-game currency, which is a pain to get, especially for newer players that don't have much to build with. Of course you can just buy premium to make it twice as fast getting pieces from loot crates, and recycling profit increased to 300%. There's a feature that lets you upload your robots for the community to purchase, and you get 25% of the profit from it. They even feature robots, which lets them get seen so more people buy them. I notice, however, that they seem to only feature robots painted in premium exclusive colours, covered in cosmetics and sponsor flags, and often armed with expensive guns.I would definitely say it's pay to win, and players that pay more money are definitely favoured. This isn't a game made for the purpose of entertainment, it's made very apparent that it's entirely for profit.It's a shame that's the case, as the idea of this game is good. hopefully the developers change the way they work and turn this game around.

								I started playing this when it was still good. It was a time of simplicity and freedom, you could jump into a game and ragequit and not because the game was bad or unbalanced but because you were just bad. So you kept on playing getting those techstars and unlocking better stuff and learning the game so that you would become better at it. But then the devs tought it was a good idea to ruin the game with to many silly weapons and removing any sort of strategy from the game and just making it unbalanced and bad making you rely instead on luck. Also why not make all the weapons and stuff overpriced so that you have to grind for three years to be able to by one wing to crash around with.Edit: Now when the Epic Loot update have come out the game have improved a lot, however it is still a pain to try to get something decent because it costs half a robot to try to upgrade one piece to the next tier. I do like that they changed the economy system but relying on luck to get something good in a box and then sell it to get a low amount of money from it is way to slow for me. So I say that the game has improved but there is still a couple of unbalanced bits and pieces until it can get a thumbs up again.			"

								Okay,let's face it,this game has gone to crap. I know that freejam has done way better than they currently are. But one thing the community needs to know by now is that developers of free to play games need to have in game purchases. To ensure people buy this the developers make the ways to collect the currency extremely repetitive and tedious. People start to be worn down by the offers for things they don't have yet. No game is free from a development stand point so the premium is a way to make the money  to cover it and make profit. Money is one of the things that is the problem with these types of games and that's why it is early access,to help fund the development of the game. But do the ends meet the means? To change the way the game's main objective so often is really bad for a game. The way they changed some things just mess up everything. When adding in a new weapon,it seems they don't play test to see how it balances out with existing ones. It would also really help this game if there was a way to create a community server so people don't fear how long their money will last. If freejam stops making money,they may shut down the servers like many other multiplayer only games. So,if you don't mind losing a few bucks on a game,this is a good game.			"

								Never has so much potential been so wasted by so few. This game is now quite possibly the most bug ridden on steam. Robocraft won indie game of the year 2014! What happened? This game smacks of an enlightened individual creating a new and refreshing idea but then as he gathered the mediocres around him to develop it they eventually turned on him and pushed him out. The game originally appealed more to adults as it required a degree of intelligence and experience to understand the physics behind building the more effective bots.  In other words you had think and do your research.Unfortunately Freejam (the game developer or should that be crucifier) decided to completely ignore thier older player base and appeal to thumbsuckers. They then  dumbed the game down to the point where a lobotomized chimp could play it. But in thier clamour to provide more and more new features at every ""up""date (which kids with thier short attention span need) they ignored fixing old bugs and exploits i.e wall clipping. They didn't test the new features and instead just introduced even more bugs and exploits i.e. the notorious slope cube exploiting tesseract bot.I find the game is now a frustrating almost unplayable mess which has completely lost it's sense of direction. AVOID.			"

								After playing this game since it's alpha, I can truly say that this game has been ruined by money hungry developers. It is no longer about how well you can build/design your robot, it has lost it's optimistic community that were willing to help new players build and fight with their robots. It is with great sorrow that I will not likely play this game again after witnessing the loot crates, which have destroyed this game's balance. Now, a noob can get legendary items, and an old time veteran can be stuck with simple commons and rares. This game is dead.			"

								Mission start. My team storms for the center of the map to meet the tide of enemy machines, congregating at the foot of the bridge that makes up the fastest route between the enemy bases. On the other side, the enemies are doing the same. Before anyone makes a dash across the bridge, one of the enemy vehicles pulls out in front. It is just a simple, flat, pure white vehicle with a white Christian cross mounted on top. The base is just wide enough that it blocks the entire bridge and all of his teammates can't get past him to fight us. One of my teammates almost instantly shot that cross to pieces and then his teammates managed to wedge underneath his craft and send him flipping over the side of the bridge into the canyon far below, never to be seen again.I saw this happen.

								This game is basically everything I'd want as an eight year old who obessed over legos. It's got a really good system that transfers your designs into actual robots that work really well, even if it can be really annoying at times.Not pay to win, shockingly. Yeah you can pay to get higher tier robots, but they're not necessarily better than the robots you'll be competing with. So it kind of balances itself. Same with Premium, yeah it makes you level faster, but the competition also gets tougher as you level up.I'd recommend this game highly to anyone who enjoys a good game where they can make their real design dreams come true, I know it did for me.

""Buy Premium Now!"" 
A Screenshot of Robocraft
By: loganpea




Premium should give you duplicates of the item you unboxed, not give you random sh*t like this.Also, that was my first Legendary, Seriously.*(Edit 5/19/16)*I guess getting 2 legendaries for premuim is a little too much... soo mabye they should hide premuim slots in crates if you don't have premuim. It gets 30x more frustrating (like the picture above). Tbh ik it's a way to encourage premuim, but.. I've already paid $35 for this game lol*(Edit 6/23/16)*...wait did I say I quit?Anyway, ""Free""jam strikes again! ffs...

								TL:DR - Pay to win [BAD SWEAR WORDS] garbage.First 2 hours of the game consist of building your first robot and queuing for your first-tenth matchThose first 10 matches consist of you facing people who have shelled out money to gain a [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] unfair advantage. Not only do they have far more HP than you ever could hope of having, but they have access to weapons that hit harder, faster and more accurately than you.I'm talking, bots with HP higher than your entire [BAD SWEAR WORDS] team.BUT! I decided to stick it out and give it a chance.9 hours in and I rage quit. You've got these [BAD SWEAR WORDS] flying around in full decked out robots that you can do nothing against. Try and adapt your designs? NopeTry and counter their movement type? NopeTry and change your size for more hp/speed/etc? NopeThe [BAD SWEAR WORDS] match maker says ""Matching you fairly"" What a [BAD SWEAR WORDS] joke. First match? Some [BAD SWEAR WORDS] with missile launchers on a bot that's absurdly huge. You'd think that would make it an easy target? Nope, it [BAD SWEAR WORDS] flies. IT [BAD SWEAR WORDS] GOES INVISIBLE. He's taking damage? WELL, GOOD THING HE'S GOT A [BAD SWEAR WORDS] PAY 2 WIN [BAD SWEAR WORDS] BLINK QUARTER THE WAY ACROSS THE MAP.Yeah, no [BAD SWEAR WORDS] this and [BAD SWEAR WORDS] the company. I'll always give games a chance, even [BAD SWEAR WORDS] games but this one took the cake.Pay-2-win/10EDITED - 1/16/2017Edited the review because Freejam (The developers) seem to report reviews.Seems like the [BAD SWEAR WORDS] developers, Freejam can't [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] the [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] of the [BAD SWEAR WORDS] [BAD SWEAR WORDS] so [BAD SWEAR WORDS] them.

								Robocraft was a great game.Unfortunately, whilst some of the fun still remains, the developers of this game (FreeJam) have become greedy and forgot what their game/company was about. They have completely ignored their vocal community and have made the reward system become a game of RNG as opposed to skill.The balance has been destroyed gradually over the past year, up to the point that there are now 'legendary' weapons that will outgun any normal weapons. To make matters worse, the new weapon types are also designed to require no skill (such as massive aoe explosions and auto-aim). The overall result of this is the game no longer rewards thoughtful construction of bots and skillful aiming.If you are a new player, these problems are even more prevalant, as you will be matched up against players who will slap a hover blade onto a 'legendary' weapon and they will completely outlcass anyone within their robot's rating (which is determined by the parts you use to build your robot).Unfortunately this game seems to be moving towards 'cash grab' and is starting to feel like a premium mobile game.

								robocraft was a really nice game until the dev's patched it to the ground. the most changes are good but the lastest ones was bad as hell. we earned after every round some rp to get new items - now we get nothing... well those useless crates with a drop rate of nothing! the only way to get protonium crates after being the ""best"" player of a match is to buy them in their shop. now we could say robocraft is a pay to win game BUT no it isn't. those people which are spending money on the crates get the same crap like other players in their crates. xD it's really ridiculous... and sad... maybe the dev's listen to the community in future and i hope they do it before the whole community is gone.

								Robocraft used to be my favorite free game on Steam. Creative, fun gameplay. Now though, if you want to play Robocraft, you have to install a piece of third party software called ""EasyAntiCheat"" to play. As far as I can tell, EasyAntiCheat is a keylogger and a screencapper that periodically posts both screenshots and chat logs from the game, with an accompanying username, to a public database. EAC is flagged by most antivirus software, and for good reason - it is blatantly spyware that compromises users' privacy.I am deeply disappointed at the developers' decision to carelessly disregard their users' privacy, and will not play Robocraft or any other FreeJam game again until I am allowed to play without downloading intrusive third party software. Sadly, I cannot recommend this otherwise excellent game to anyone who cares about their privacy.			"

								Since the 'Epic' Loot update, the ecomomy has been completly broken.Freejam has changed the end-of-match reward system to a random crate drop based system.This has caused problems like: -Part drops are completly at the mercy of The Random Number God -Sellback value (to convert parts into ingame currency) is terrible. Before this 'Epic New Expansion' parts could be sold for 50% of what they cost. Now at best, you will only get 33% of the original price back.  -Top tier crates have only slightly improved drop tables compared to the worst tier crates. -Crate drop tables are the same for all players, meaning newbies and veterans get the same rewards at the end of a match.I will change my recommendation to a positive one when FreeJam fixes these issues.UPDATE 21/07/16: With the Enter The Shredzone expansion, FJ introduced a gamebreaking bug that can brick a player's account. Ironically, this bug can be triggered by entering the tutorial. You know, that thing that new players will click on first. GG Freejam... And they say they're all about ""new player retention.""I have no choice but to quit due to having my account bricked by the aforementioned bug.Stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game.Get Galactic Junk League instead.

								I know you most likely have seen that it USED to be good but its true. I used to play the game a fair bit here and there but now i have not touched it for quite a few months, every time i see a update i just give a sigh and think ""there Really digging themselves into a big hole of making the game worse and it does not look like there coming out."" It looks like they are completly ignoring the fans in the comment section giving advice or basicly telling them to get there act together and put it back to when it was good, and the only reason its got ""very positive"" reviews is because the people who used to play gave up and did not bother to change/make there review. So in the end then Robocraft WAS a very fun game with lots of potential but the dev team messed it up.			"

								Where to start... thats kind of hard. i`ve played this game alot and i think personally that this game might not be the type i like anymore. with every update comes a new set of bugs, thats normal. However the set has been growing larger and larger with every update. The new content isnt really that exciting anymore, for instance the pit. The pit was promising at first when they presented the idea of adding a moba element, a new type of game. Sadly it just turned out to be a FFA which is not very balanced for classes (if you are gonna play that part go for the smg) like plazma or nano.Updating itself is a very slow process, no wonder as they dont have that many devs working on it. Unfortunantly what they promise should come out in the next few weeks wont until months later, when no one even remembers there ever being a note.Other key elements in this game have been for the one or the other reason (in my opinion) made from really nice looking to.... kind of crap.For instance the new menu is supossed to be better, however it has only made things worse. It`s just really inpractical now. The new waiting screen is basicly just ads and not really that pretty.The terrain textures are not that good even not on the fantastic setting.The control setup is just an imposibly long list of buttons, and overall the game itself doesnt really look that pretty.Also the point in using anything else then wheels or wings has been lost a bit, everything is now basicly equally crappy, trax used to be slow but to counter that they were near invincible, but now they`re just larger wheels same speed, same armour. not to mention legs which are completly useless unless you want to build a stick with some railguns on it.To some it all up:this game used to be great, due to the crappy, boring and just generally pointless updates it has turned into an unbalanced, not that good looking shooter game.do i recommend it? No not right at the moment.will i recommend it if some of the problems are solved? YESEDITION:Well its been well over half a year now and i can say: they`ve really ****** up.All they`re doing at this point is adding new and pointless op sh*t that makes the game an incredible grind, aswell as incredibly unbalanced.Building a hover is pointless now, building a tank is pointless now, building anything else then a walker with flak or a heli of any sort (aslong as its rotors are all on the back) is just plain stupid.Conclusion: dont download this ******* game its utter♥♥♥♥♥♥EDITION: So it has again been like half a year and jezus fukn christ its just unbelieveble.I didnt think they could turn this piece garbage into something even worst than it had already become. like jezus christ on a bike, the youtube fella rosefall or something (main player only thing on his channel anyway) quit. EVEN HIM, freejam have you replaced your brain with♥♥♥♥♥♥oh and the trailer is outdated as hell too.			"

								Can not recomend this game in present state.  + ""Minecraft Like"" building robots+  Nice graphics- Optimization is horrible, FPS drops, FPS fluctoation, freezing even if you have NVIDIA 1070- Horrible servers: many players are disconected, then teams are uncomplete- If server lose connection  or game crashed then YOU will be punished!- At the fastest graphics settings you can not recognize invisible robots- From a first game you have to fight against  powerful expensive robots that are reachable only after a few days of playing- Developers do not protect their rookies and tolerate bullying- Immortal cheaters and cheaters with reinforced arms are seen daily- You can fight against Reported cheaters again- Support returns a template with answers and solves nothing- Many players use ""META"" robots from shop. METAS are mostly unkillable for new players- Match making is bad and balanced game are very rare. - Tutorial explains only WSAD !! Not a word about the principles of game modes, not a word about editor functions, not a word about the choice of weapons, not a word about the way buildings more durable, not a word about the modules and their use. - NO information about two types of steering- A lot of errors in the editor- First default robot is uncomplete and second and third are not visible in menu- New main game mode is just chase between capture points. Battles were canceled- Gaming currency was removed. Instead, you will get randomly selected parts from which you can build just crazy mutations in Picasso's style-If you want to sell unneeded parts then you receive several times less than is real price.- If ou re not very good then your income is low and you will lose again and again.- For real money you can buy only random crates without any garance it will worth it "

								! ! ! UPDATE ! ! !Will revise review when EAC stops blocking Test Mode and unsigned drivers. Would be positive otherwise.----------------------------------Take a game with a good concept and throw in every con known to mankind, and you have RoboCraft, the game you want to love but want to strangle to death at any given time. Robocraft wants to be a good game that can allow players from around the world make their own tanks/planes/mechs/flying pinwheels and pit them against everyone else's, except that it fails on every part on what a good multiplayer experience should have and soon becomes boring, repetitive, and rage inducing.In Robocraft, you can make just about anything you want to a degree (but more on that later). You have many options of movement from wheels that let you tread around the terrain to hoverblades that let you cushion some air between you and the hard ground. Advanced players can arm themselves with wings and take to the skies or mix everything together into some monstrosity that were not meant for the eyes of mere mortals. From the start, you get 3 robots to work with and 3 garages for each one. Each also demonstrates the unique weapons of the game: the sub machine gun, the plasma cannon, and the railgun.Let's talk about the weapons: the sub machine gun is you standard 'SMG'; high fire rate, decent accuracy, and good effective range. They are the only weapon (at this time) to have two varieties: front mounted and top mounted, with front mounted being able to lay on the face of a cube and top mounted being best for being on top of a cube. The plasma cannon is an arcing explosion-on-hit weapon that requires some skill to use, but once mastered, it can easily be one of the better weapons in the game. It is only trumped by the railgun, which might as well be the 'point and kill' weapon. The SMG and plasma gun do not have block penetrating damage (though the plasma has splash damage), whereas the railgun does. While it's balancing factor is that it takes 20 seconds to reload, this creates a problem because of how the game determines 'death.'In your design of a mech (robot, mech, at this point, the game doesn't really seem to define what on earth you are building), you have a pilot seat, which is where your pilot sits. For a game called 'Robocraft', this seems out of place, and in gameplay, it is. It is a 'block' that consists of 2 blocks outwards and 3 blocks in height. It must rest on two blocks underneath and those two blocks are your only lifeline. Let me repeat: TWO BLOCKS DEFINE IF YOU ARE ALIVE OR DEAD. Remember the railgun's penetration ability? It didn't get the nickname 'point and kill' sitting around drinking on a summer beach (the plasma cannon is no better). Your dream robot better have a huge underbelly because that is your only way to survive, but even then that only gives you a slightly better chance at not dying.So let's talk about gameplay. At the moment, there is only one game mode: Capture the point. A team wins by sitting on their enemy's base until the timer gods are satisfied with your demonstration of doing nothing or you can kill the enemy team in your quest for showing off your mad Plasma cannon skills. This is all assuming you survive the first 5 seconds of the match. The game's physics engine is your first real enemy: assuming there is at least one impatient person on your team (pro tip: there always will be one), you may run into the situation that just a gentle bump will send your Robotic death machine into a flying whirl that can only be achieved in a cartoon. If you land right side up, proceed to call that teammate a moron and move on. If you don't, congratulations: you are now target practice for the enemy railgunners and plasma cannon users until either they kill you (and your two blocks too), or the match ends. You can quit the game at this point with the penalty of taking 25% damage (more on that later).Assuming you survive the onslaught called 'Lack of Teamwork', the network engine will come out to play. 'Warping', or when an entity moves from place to place due to network latency, is common and the same happens with their bullets. This can make SMGs get magical penetrating powers and make enemies appear to attempt a re-run at flipping you over like the impatient teammate whose mech looked like a fried egg. This doesn't have a lot but when it does happen, you can join the therapy party for everyone else who died from the same reason, and that party is at least a third of the player base.So about damage in the game. The game's definition of 'damage' is the total health of your mech, which is mostly attributed by what blocks you used, since each one's armor value is different depending on which ones you do use. If a set of blocks becomes disconnected, that is considered to be doing a massive amount of damage and your health will plummet like most of your hopes and dreams of what could be achieved in the game. Any damage you receive at the end of a match (including if one of the two blocks providing your pilot leg room gets destroyed) must be repaired at the cost of either the in-game currency or actual money. Remember that 25% that you lose if you quit the game early? That also falls under your bill and if you get flipped over after taking damage, the 25% is only tacked on to what you have. This makes any earnings you received from the game get minimized even further. The game has a 'bonus engine', but the rules for that are to laugh at any player trying to actually achieve it: you must not die and your team must win. This means if your team wins but you were sacrificed to ensure victory, congratulations: you haven't appeased the Robocraftian gods enough for a pay raise. Will that be cash or cash?Surely there has to be a way to keep the game balanced, and the game's attempt at it is laughable at best. There are 10 tiers, with each tier under the assumption that the weapons and armor of that tier is better. Unfortunately, this isn't the real world situation. You can be shoved into a higher tier due to using more blocks for your beach ball of doom or because of the weapon's lethality. On top of that, assuming you have evenly matched lethality and good looks, the matchmaking will often pit you against tiers 1 to 2 above your own. Suddenly those pair of sunglasses you added aren't looking so hot and floorless pilot is you with the enemy team's highest tier mech mowing your fellow team's tier mechs for target practice.The icing on the cake is the map selection, and unlike the flavor selection at your Dairy Queen, you have only 4 to choose from, two being ice and the other being on Mars. If you have the misfortune to be rocking out with tires on the ice area, have fun on the ice river that each ice map offers, as it has a physical property where you will glide forever in one direction despite how much you try to turn and reverse the other way. You will grow thankful for how other games interprets ice physics after experiencing Robocraft's interpretation. Mars doesn't really have much going for it and the blandness will make you wish for another map, all of which are chosen randomly while matchmaking, which is the only option you have (no picking a match, no choosing an enemy platoon to face).In closing, Robocraft is the game that wants to be unique and enjoyable, but falls flat on its face on its own ice physics only shortly after tripping over its own flaws. I haven't even covered its 'premium membership' and other obvious ploys to earn money quickly and with as little effort as possible, but those would only add insult to injury. Give Robocraft a try for an hour, but turn away and don't come back afterwards. At least until they get their act together and actually try listening to what little of a community they have.			"

								It WAS a really good and fun game where you could make silly or cool bots and fight with them.Until the mean updates, then.First of all, they updated so the Tech Tree feature disappeared and they added levels. Some people even got boosted by 20 levels somehow.Secondly, the devs couldn't see which weapons/bot types needed nerfs and the game was dominated by the same bots every game.Third. THE CUBES! Cubes had different tiers and costs and everything was good. Then they deleted all and made all to 1 kind of cube which was free. R.I.P weeks of cube grinding.Fourth, last but worst. As they removed ''Mega bots'' people who owned the ''Mega module'', which could be bought with ''RP'', a sort of money you got by playing, got a lot of Galaxy Cash, which was a paid cash type that you bought with real money. The thing is that the next update they removed the normal money types and replaced them with this dust shet and R.I.P the old RP you had worked for and R.I.P the Galaxy Cash that you got from the mega module.   I myself never bought Galaxy Cash with real money but those who did lost maybe even hundreds of dollars spent on that. This is probably one of the greediest things a game company can do.Step 1: Buy GC with real money. Step 2: Wake up and see they're gone. Step 3: See that you now buy chests instead, and got barely any replacement of your real money-bought GCGreed at max level			"

								I had this game laying around for a bit, was bored and started it up.  I havn't been much of a minecraft type of player, but i must say the block building style seems to work.  I was able to create something I liked before even trying to drive it.   I hoped that after spending over 1hr making and re making and re making something i wanted to drive the game was as decent as the builder.      Success I loaded in fast with a similar group of newbie players.  After inspecting some units i guess not so novice.   I noticed a few vets that had aquired larger weapons and scaled thier vehicles down to be in the bracket so I tried to avoid the high flying snipers which actually helped me get better.      I spent a whole day playing and by the end was pleasantly addicted to building and destroying.   I enjoyed the battles which mostly left me 1 shotted :/   or rolling around with 1 tire , or better yet upside down un able to move.  Every battle I wanted to change my vehicle, fine tune it,  use what i was seeing otehrs kill me with and so on.    Anyways I am only on day 3 and really enjoying the game as simple as it seems the game modes are they work for now.  The BOSS mode will be exciting when I am able to level that high. The free to play seems to work.  I REALLY hope they keep it so people that do not pay do not need to grind.     I have not paid a dime and I feel like the grind is comfertable and satisfying enough.     Paying does give you an edge obviously.  You get your Armor and weapon blocks faster and so on as expected.    I hope they Keep the model letting free players have equal access to all game content levels and equipment  at the same speed since I felt rewarded when winning. Sucks a bit if you dont get a Hit on the enemy,  you dont get much points at the end of the match so you really want to be part of the battles.  Anyways my opinion is the game is a decently fun builder.  It has made me giggle a few times rolling around 80% wrecked killing off whoever got in range of my last weapon. The bads that the game might have is the overpowered weapons in certain brackets.    Being fully armored with that tiers armor and getting 1 shotted from accross the map might be fun for the shooter,  but i think can hinder the old school feel of original arcade Tank shooters were you r skill manuvering your vehicle and getting a good shot on a target was key game play.    Some weapons are so strong you get as high as you can and just 1 shot sniper whoever comes in view :/  This game needs guilds int he future,  platoonsa re ok but seems shallow.   Bottome line:    I like the game as a FREE player.   So I plan to spend some cash on this game and see how the higher levels play out.  Hopefully they nerf the overall weapon damage in lower tiers with higher tier weapons but other than that try it if you like to build. "

								I, personally, am someone who has played Robocraft quite a bit. However, due to numerous patches that have been steadily lowering the quality of the game, I decided to take a break- in the 6-9 month length. Today, I decided to dust off the old game and try it again- and let me tell you, it's only gotten worse. Robocraft was a game that started off with a great concept and limitless potential; I tell you, I see none of that game left. To put it bluntly, in my playtime today I saw no real content updates or additions since I decided to quit; I'm sure there have been bugfixes and QOL adjustments, but there is no new content- this was an automatic turnoff to me, because I wasn't satisfied with the content there was when I WAS playing- and over a minimum of half a year, they should've managed to do something, but such was not the case.     In fact, I lucked out, and chose to play the day that a brand-new patch came out, a patch that the developers claimed was the ""biggest"" patch in well over a year. Do you want to know what it actually was? The developers spitting in the face of all their veteran players, and removing some of the last vestiges of replayability that the game had. Every advantage that veteran players had, aside from parts collected, was removed- and, to null even that last part, players now get bonus items on every level, but with zero consideration for the veterans who already were at the prior maximum level of 150. This is why I flatout detest Freejam, and will not be playing this game again; aside from the fact that they are absolute screwups and ruined an incredible game, they have no consideration whatsoever for their veteran playerbase- including the ones who spent money on the game. Thankfully, I never did.			"

								Used to be good but once again Devs kill a fun game . Introducing stupid ideas and ruining the game completely. lasers dont do half the damage they used to, buying parts now requires grinding forever to get 1 part, 1100RP for a win and parts costing thousands will take forever to get anywhere. shame its time to uninstall a game that used to be fun !

								I’m not going to write a huge rant covering the innumerable flaws this game currently experiences. For those of you who play, have played since the start, understand the game's original enjoyment, and current flaws of this once glorious idea, I don’t need to refresh what you already know about how broken this game has become.Simply put, at the start, this game was incredible. As it stands today, the game is near intolerable, broken and flawed on nearly all levels. Robocraft ‘CAN’ be extremely fun, at times. Those times... are ending.Overall Fantastic idea, monumental potential… However, horrendous money hungry developers who lack the intellectual and creative potential to sustain and progress this game past its former glory.Play for fun, but don’t waste your time expecting anything balanced, professional or even at times functional. Sadly, it has been proven through experience that this is an idea which supersedes its creator's abilities. "

								Used to be a great game, but some of the updates have ruined it. Spent a fair bit of money on it, now seeing where the game is going and has gone, it seems like a complete waste.#Edit (For the sake of Phantom_Skull):I liked the way the game used to be, I still like the game but it is in my opinion worse than it was a year ago. Paying for things was optional, but they removed several of the things which I payed for.feelsbadman#BringBackOldRobocraftI used to bring a railgun and 5 blocks to t1 fights			"

								Played this when it was tanks vs machine guns in some Mars-like landscape and made it to level 25 or so, and playing it again I can say it is ruined for casual and somewhat noob/new players like me.People will build what my friends call a ""Ramp of Death"", a flat (or bleacher-shaped) robot with a bunch of sub-machine guns that would cost about 7000 robits in Factory, that will keep following and shooting you (without their energy depleting) until your pathetic demise, and which is somehow tankier than your 300,000 robits robot covered with a lot of overlapping shields.Oh, and airplanes are irrelevant now. I really enjoyed them, but now anything can destroy them. In fact, they were my only chance of fragging in a world of smg-bleachers.tl;dr carpets of destruction will keep following and shooting you through a boring Earth map until you're cucked to death.

								This is my first negative review for a game ever, and it hurts me to do so on this game but the dissapointment is too much - FREEJAM... What a shame - PLEASE fix your terrible new tiering system out, you completely killed robocraft with it. Until then, I have very little motivation to play. I have played with friends since first release, LOVED IT. Got over T10+, stopped for a while and we said to each other that ""we can't wait to play it in a while and see it grow and mature""... 1 year later, we try it again updated, excited to show additional friends too... but wait, it's not Robocraft anymore - it's truly Robocrap. The spirit of classically, easily and understandably levelling up (to all types of end-users) has died... you could even say this pretty much isn't even a proper objective-based level-up game anymore, now it's just some weird kind of open-world-free-for-all-matchmaking-CHAOS that is really frustrating and just doesn't make sense.Robocraft is now literally a sinking ship - soon on it's way to 'Mixed' reviews on Steam. This game could have been a timeless classic, and it still can be. Would love to delete this review and leave a recommended one, make it happen. I'll be watching carefully, and honestly if it's not fixed soon I'll be very sad to see this once-a-great-game be uninstalled from my library.*EDIT/UPDATE 1* - For people who say I'm hating, I'm not, I still love the game and I'm actually still playing it, if you haven't played the game since it's initial release you won't understand. Trust me, if you played the pre-updated versions you would say, “why did they ever change it?!” ... I just cannot recommend Robocraft anymore - yes it WAS a fantastic game, but anyone can make any robot now and the matchmaking will 90% of the time put you in an extremely unfair game - the tiering system is completely messed up making the whole aim of the game pointless... the achingly painful feeling of spending hours on building an awesome robot only to find it is put into games with MUCH more powerful robots is depressing, confusing and just pure torture :(*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (29/09/2015) - I was just playing Robocraft all last night, woke up this morning and wow... just WOW - FREEJAM what are you guys even doing?! A few days ago I made this review and it made it to the steam store page and I hoped maybe you guys would feel my outrage, but nope, you go and add even more ridiculous updates. In the last update you made it so that only high level robots can do TDM, a week later, without any word of warning again, without letting the community know what your doing you switch the whole thing around for a week? and your excuse is, ""so we can make more games available for everyone""... :| :| :| LOL HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! At least come up with better excuses. Seriously, let us know more about what your doing and working on, you should be serving your consumers, making votes and poll's, making us feel part of the development, instead you don't listen to suggestions and complaints and you act like Gods who use their consumers as lab rats. I'm not even playing this week because of today's update. You know, I didn't even know who you guys were until your over-tampering with the game, your presence in the game makes me feel nauseous and I had to find out who was causing it, how sad is that? I should be searching you guys up because of how awesome you guys are as developers, and yes you guys were good initally, but your test of integrity failed badly. How can you not see your ruining the game? It's like you guys sweat on your monitors so much that you can't see your screens anymore. Take a break, have a shower and clean it all up.Sorry if I seem harsh xD I'm just ranting on, BUT STILL, the truth is always harsh. :) Anyway just remember I'm willing to forgive and forget and venerate you guys as one of the best indie game developers ever for making the awesome game that is Robocraft if you just sort out all these unnecessary updates, kthnxbye :D (Y)			"

								Welcome to the ♥♥♥♥-up that is Robocraft.So basically there's no reason to play anymore. Too many things that made the game awesome have been removed,  and too many things that absolutely suck have been added. It's just not worth playing anymore. Here are some reasons to stay away:- Say goodbye to originality as you'll often see many of the same overpowered designs in battles due to the Community Robot Factory. Your original designs that aren't based on exploits won't stand a chance.- The map variety sucks. Different colours basically. No water-only maps. No air-only maps. No cave maps. Nothing interesting at all. No destructible terrain, no interactivity. Just impenetrable generic hills and walls. For every map.- Game modes are too same-y. Drive around and shoot. No race mode. No football/other sports mode. Nothing interesting. Same thing over and over. The developers have no imagination or creativity.- Player base sucks. Too many casuals who copy each other's designs. Too many Japanese cartoon bots. Too many exploiters. Chat is always filled with nonsense.- Graphics are terrible and unoptimised, not to mention boring.- Developers don't seem to test or even think new features are actually any good before adding them to the game.- Sound is very basic and unimpressive. Boring.- Barely any social options(which I don't mind, personally).Well damn I'm sure others can elaborate on what's wrong with the game but I just can't be bothered anymore. As of this review, reviews in the last 30 days are 39% positive. They speak for themselves. Stay far away and don't even bother unless the developers get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together for once. They can never seem to make up their mind. They simply don't have vision.			"

								Such a shame... The game before all this recent update crap was good. I really enjoyed the concept of it, and it felt fun to build creations and play against others. Now, it feels like someone with a superior gear level will easily out gun you, no matter what you do. The new currency is crap too, it feels so hard to get any now, to afford blocks, weapons, etc. What's the point?! Like the game used to be so free flowing and used to actually give you few limitations(excluding the restriction bar the increases with leveling). Now, it's like a constant what should I give up so I can get this piece of gear? I'm disappointed that so many games are pulling this kind of crap. Before these crate updates the game was a solid 8/10, now it's like a 5. There is no creativity to it anymore; All the creations feel like they have to be built for a compeitive purpose. I no longer see anyone trying to be silly with their creation. For example, I saw someone do a bunny and just hop around the map, and even had someone create a mini-gundam figure in game. They didn't have much firepower, but they were amusing and it was awesome to just see that people could be so innovative and creative with everything. I even remember someone making a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with legs; even though it wasn't appropriate, it was amusing to see because they were creative bots made by the people. While people still create massive, and awesome mechs, automobiles, and aircrafts, they just aren't the same.			"

								They ruinied this game countless times.Time 1: Just got to T10. Pretty pleased with myself. Then freejam, the drugged up devs of robocraft, went ahead and scrapped the entire teir system! xD Luckily i was lvl 100 so i wasnt effected from loosing things.Time 2: The pricing of TX parts. Just extortionate prices. Basically if you didnt have premium, you would have to play 300+ hours saving up to get a mega robot. BS.Time 3: In a recent update, they scrapped ALL ARMOUR BLOCKS, all weapon teir names and removed half of them. They made this dumb looking paint THING which makes blocks stupid colours. They added the portal gun which you know use to place blocks. The blocks are all the same now, but are they? I dont even know xD, because this update is so dumb that we dont even know if the higher tier (when there was a teir) weapons do the same amount of damage to the blocks depending on the robot ranking? They also removed the pilot seat, which is the main thing you protect in robocraft, which is one of the challanges of making a robot...Basically, over the past year or so, FreeJam has ruined their game. Since they got that indie game of the year award, they just went downhill... I kind of wish they hadnt gotten that award, as I feel it boosted them to go a bit crazy on their game. We didnt know if the changes would be crazy stupid, or crazy good, but i guess thats the unpredictability surrounding freejam.....So it was a good game, but that was before the updates came out....

								Robocraft is dead if you are older players like me who have play this game since almost the beggining then you know what im talking about. Now that they implemented a Crate System they have demolished all the proggessing youve use to see when there were teirs also the leveling system how you unlocked parts you could buy. Also you should earn cubits through playing games instead of only exp and crates. All the growth i was feeling playing ths game is now gone and now This game feels more dull and even more grindy. There are many older players leaving because of all of this including some amazing content creators on youtube. I rate this a thumbs up for all the new players because they dont know the old roobocraft. But i beleive this is still a fun game for new players.      Please thumbs up so that Free jam can see this!			"

								It was fun at first. You have limited resources and have to make some crazy constructions to work with it.But if you climb the ranks, everyone starts to scrap all their inventorys and buys some insane robot from the workshop. You see every round the same robots. Thats a huge mess, because the good part of the game should be about trying to make a good robot and upgrade it over time and on your own.If every one has the same few robots, its a normal shooter and in that segment the game can not compete.Just ditch the Workshop (Fabrik) and let anyone play with their own crazy combination! Then I would recommend it.			"

								Used to be a very fun game that encouraged creativity with the simple and straightforward reward system. Playing a match = gain currency and experience. Be on winning team and play well = greater reward. It was simple and effective and there was absolutely no reason to change this.I started the game up again a month after a horrendous update was released in which game mechanics were completely changed for the worse. The entire economy now relies on a crate system which slaps you with horrible RNG. I gave it a chance despite this and grinded my way to 400 kills on single player a few times for some sweet legendaries from the Protonium crates. Of course, my loot merely consisted of a few hundred basic blocks that could easily be obtained from the Rusty crates with much less effort anyway. Multiplayer wasn't any better. Even when you're the MVP of the match on a winning team, you don't get much better chance of any useful loot from the worst player on the losing team. Basically, progression in the game solely relies on RNG now.			"

								I started playing robocraft in 2014. It had simple mechanics and a great layout. Played 250 hours from 2014-2015 but then came the new updates. For new player: some of you may enjoy the current version of the game, but i can assure you that robocraft from 2014 was alot better. Back then you did not have ""crates"", instead you just earned credits and bought any shield, weapon and different leveled armoured blocks at an affordable price. You had tier system, where you could unlock new equipment as you leveled up. Each tier (tier 1-10) represented the cpu amount of your vehicle, tier 1 being low cpu count and 10 being high. This system was easy to understand and therefore also provided balance gameplay. There was also a gamemode back in 2015 or 2016 where 7-10 tier 3 vehicles could take on one tier 10 machine; it was basically like a boss battle. Also older version of robocraft only allowed the use of one type of weapon for a vehicle not multiple, which was better because each vehicle had a specific responsibility. Also back then nano-desruptor (the repair thing) didnt shot out seperately, it was more like a continues laser that could repair others but aswell deal damage to opponents. These were the aspects that made robocraft great, but the new updates took all that away and made robocraft more complicated and intergrated unsatisfying game modes. If you new players want to check what the old version of the game was like just search it up on youtube and you'll spot the major differences.			"

Early Access Review
tl;dr Interesting and engaging Minecraft-like battlebots concept turned RNG-based money grab with a painfully slow endgame.I really loved Robocraft back in the day, but as FreeJam tried to ""flatten"" the tiers, it's more feeling stagnant and pay-to-win. I hate to say it, but Epic Loot killed the Robocraft I knew and loved; it feels like an incredible challenge just to get one gun like an Ion Distorter or Chain Shredder.Robocraft is like Minecraft meets robot death battles: You build your robot, with a wide range of movement options, from wheels, to hoverblades, to mech legs; and equip your robot with various weapons, from rapid-fire lasers, to powerful but slow rail cannons, to a weapon specifically designed to give flying robots a bad time. Later-game, you could also choose from a range of modules that grant things like teleportation, (near) invisibility, and a shield to block enemy projectiles.Gameplay-wise, there's 4 gamemodes (as far as I remember, please correct me if I'm wrong): Team Deathmatch, Battle Arena, Elimination, and The Pit. Team Deathmatch is where two teams of five battle until one team reaches 20 kills, Battle Arena involves control point-like Protonium towers that can be captured by attacking the crystals attached to the towers, Elimination is a 12v12 arena mode where the last team standing (or the first team to capture the enemy base) wins, and The Pit is an every-man-for-himself battle to reach 25 kills. (Please do excuse me if I got any information wrong, it's been a long time since I last played.) Individually, your robot has an energy system; firing your weapons or using your modules drains this energy. When you have no energy, you can't attack--naturally. Your health is based off the components that make up your robot; each component has its own health and is destroyed when its health is zero. This encourages trying to see flaws in your opponents' robot designs to make it easier to destroy them, or shooting their weapons or mobility components off. Overall, gameplay is not very fast-paced, since most robots are rather slow and the maps are very large, but it's enjoyable.Or at least, it would be enjoyable if it weren't for how skewed the rewards system is. Prior to the Epic Loot update, you would earn Robot Points (RP) at the end of every match; the better you performed, the more you received--if you were also a Premium user, your earnings would be doubled. You would spend RP to buy robot parts, like building blocks, movement components, weapons, and the like. If you decided that you didn't need a weapon, you could sell it for half its original value, though most people did not, as they could just play the game more to earn the RP. There also existed a premium currency, Galaxy Cash (GC), that would be used to buy cosmetic items like robot masks and flags.Epic Loot threw out that entire system. Instead, upon completing a match, you receive a crate; the better you perform, the higher the crate's tier will be. There are six tiers: Rusted, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, and Protonium. Depending on what gamemode you play, the crate will contain a certain amount of items. You get double the items if you're a Premium member, but if you're not Premium, you also see the drops you would have gotten. Did a Legendary item drop in one of the Premium slots? Too bad, better pay up or you'll never see it again. Additionally, the only guarantees you get with any of the crates is that Protonium crates are guaranteed not to contain any Common items (a tier that only includes blocks), and drop rates for higher rarities are hardly higher, if at all. Not to mention that this exclusion of Common items from Protonium crates was only added a couple weeks later--once my boyfriend was so proud to have topped the scoreboard and to have received a Protonium crate, only to have received blocks and Uncommon weapons from it. Neither of us were impressed.So, do you have a ton of useless that clutter your inventory but you really want that Legendary Ion Distorter? Don't worry, FreeJam's got you covered! You can recycle items into Robits, which can then be used to forge what you want! One catch though: Recycling items returns you only 25% of the item's value. Not only that, but it's even lower for items like cosmetics! This single fact means that game progression is slowed to an unbearable crawl--it's okay at the beginning, since you mostly have Uncommon weapons, but when you progress further, you find that the Rare items are somewhat of a challenge to get, as they're not cheap to forge, and they are indeed rare from crates. Good luck once you're endgame and you're looking for Epic items. Looking for a Legendary item? Don't make me laugh; it'd take days of grinding to get the 150,000 that most of them cost. Of course, you could get lucky. Or you could pay up for a round of Protonium crates. Which, once again, don't guarantee anything other than no Commons.All in all, Robocraft is a game with a promising concept, but it's currently crippled by an unrewarding RNG-based reward system that slows progression to a torturous crawl. In my opinion, all that needs to be done to speed game progression up again and make it fun is to increase recycle values and add guaranteed drop odds that are actually useful. It's a shame that I have to give such a negative review to a game I once loved and still shows that promise. You could pick this game up and play it for the early-game, but you'll grow bored and frustrated as you try to progress.			"

								TL/DR - Robits currency system(recycling parts) feels very limiting, forcing me to sacrifice A LOT of building parts for better parts. Basically i can't have as much fun building anymore which was the biggest draw for me.This is an awesome game and with its constant updates it has kept me interested in always coming back. However as awesome as builing the best battle robot is, this newest Robits currency has given me the feeling of limited building. As it stands, i feel like ive lost way more blocks trying to build me a robot i like. The managing of what parts to sacrifice to get better parts is such a pain, with me always feeling like my vast collecting of parts is shrinking faster and faster. In terms of grind for building a new robot it feels longer, rarely i hit the jackpot and get parts i want fast, most times im recycling a lot of stuff to match the parts i get. At least the old point system had it so you would always have an ever increasing garage of parts to work with.Until they add another way to obtain robits for new parts i have to say no to a recommendation, because the cost to recycle for new parts is not currently worth it.

								The game has changed a lot since I began playing.  It needs some consistency, the constant changes and ""improvements"" make the game less predictable.  I wasted real money on this game only to have items discontinued or rules on use changed.  There are a lot of glitches and sometimes weapons become overpowered which some players (not all) seem to be able to expolit really well.  The game has always been difficult to level without putting down some real money and that is still true, however now the real money now doesnt help very much.  This game had potential but with the changes, glitches, and toxic community dont waste your time or money.			"

								I know it says I only played 0.2 hours, but thats because I play off my launcher. I have hundreds of hours in the game.Now for my review. I made it negative, because even though I really do like the game, I hate all of the new updates. They make the game worse with every one of them. They added Flak, LOML, and worst of all the Proto Seeker (all three of which are weapons that need no skill at all, since two of them are lock on and the flak has a huge explosion radius). They removed Megabots. And lastly, they added crates and removed RP (which makes it nearly impossible to get the parts that you need).Robocraft used to be a great game, but now it's ruined.			"

Intro:RoboCraft is a game about building your own vehicles and fighting other people's vehicles. Vehicles are voxel like while the terrain you fight in isn't. Currently the game modes: team deathmatch, last team standing wins or you can capture the other team’s base; the pit, free or all, first to 20 wins; battle arena, MOBA styled gameplay where you basically take out the other team’s base.Edit: Full Spectrum CombatIt comes with free premium until 2016 for existing players. Lot’s of major changes. They added a paint gun so you can color your blocks whatever color you want, but now tiered blocks don’t exist like T1-T10. So you can now be creative with color and not suffer a combat disadvantage. Speaking of creativity have 25 garage slots to be creative with. It’ll be infinite garage slots later on so that limitation of 3 is gone. They also added new blocks to be creative with. Combat wise there isn’t a pilot seat anymore so you die if <25% of your bot is left now. Being stuck crippled somewhere isn’t a thing now since if you don’t participate in combat for 10 seconds you auto heal. There’s alot more so I won’t dive further into the update. Aspect Pro Con Building It's easy. There's a mirror mode to make things easy.Build anything. Some kind of grind to get more stuff to build bigger vehicles.Have to be premium to use all the colors. Devs They're active with content updates and bug fixes.Technical support forums is good. Tech support seems...average.(I've never had any tech/account problems during the year I played) [They’re ‘customer support minion’ is down till Jan. 4th, but I doubt you’ll run into any problems].  Gameplay Always on blue team so less confusion. Just attack red.Mostly balanced matchmaking, both teams will have as close to the same amounts of gun types as possible.No Pay2Win. Everything (except cosmetics) can be bought with in-game currency you earn from battle.Free Premium every once in awhile to help you get that much needed currency to build your robot and progress. Bad teammates/medic.Only 2 map types, ice planet and mars. 6 maps total. Guns Simplicity. You can only be 1 out of the 4 gun types (machine gun, sniper, explosive, medic) with an optional melee weapon that you unlock later in the game.  Not much gun variety.Recommended To:People who like designing vehiclesPeople who like vehicular combat which includes tanks, airplanes, helis, etc. (You can just buy robots from the robot factory with RP you get from battling if building isn’t your strong suit)People who like shootersTrolls			"

								So you might have read a bunch of reviews already about how freejam messed up the game and have continued to downgrade this game. And you also might be turned off because a lot of those review are by people who played this game A LOT. Well they're all right. I used to play this game whenever I didn't have a enw game to play, because it was consistantly fun. Sometimes i'd get burned out but then i'd come back because the only limit to what you could build was pretty much what you thought up. New ideas, more gameplay. But now it's nothing like it used to be. I'll list quickly the reasons for my dissatisfaction.First - No more tier system, everything is linear.Second - They took away the pilot seat (the core of the robot) and just say that if you drop below 25% hp you die.Third - They killed off healers, if you can hide for 10 seconds without shooting, you auto heal almost immediatley, so healers are irrelevant.Fourth - They changed cubes without compensation (of which i should have gotten a lot) and completly ruined my favorite bot because of the change in cubesFifth - To go with the auto healing, there is now this one type of bot that takes forever to kill, but never stops moving. In other words, it attacks, flys away, gets full health and attacks again. It's just so annoying that i quit the game after seeing 5 on the other team.sixth - It's just not the game that they had origionally gotten known for, and they continue to degrade it. Conclusion - If you want to play this game and form your own opinion go for it. just know that it is a HUGE grind with littel reward now, and they might decide they don't like stuff and junk it so don't get attached.P.S. Just in case someone is reading this thinking ""o he just doesn't want to make new things and keep up with the game"" that's not true. I have loved that they updated their game, but this specific update is terrible. It made the game basic and boring, from both a builders and a shooters point of view.			"

								Update: FJ are now trying to censor negative reviews as ""abusive"" even if they are not.https://twitter.com/TomCat__86/status/746665833414332420I give up with Robocraft.TLDR; Robocraft devs don't know what they want their game to be. They've tried DM/TDM, E-Sports, Creative Building, MOBA, Player Choice Progression, Forced progression, bland progression. Each and every update drastically changing how the game plays and nullifying ANY work players have put in to creating their bots.They establish one set of rules only to change them a few months down the line under the guise of ""Balancing"" or enabling ""player creativity"" and doing the complete opposite.Not to mention the game has flaws from years ago still not fixed and now being hidden by new changes. For example MM being broken turning it into ""Who has the most medics, wins""and hiding the poor matchmaking by removing robot classification ""because not all bots were classified correctly"" (translation, 1 in maybe 100 were wrong, and ""its haaaard."")Edit to include the latest update (Max Loadout) - Again FJ don't understand normal development practices. They threw in MASSIVE changes all at once and are no sat scratching their heads wondering why it broke. Flak is bugged (DMG), Nano is bugged (LMB+RMB = superspeed heal), MSMGs are bugged (free aim firing, without LOS), matchmaking is atrocious (still), Blink and DSM are stupidly expensive (Both RP/GC and CPU). They should have done a slow implement of these changes one by one to iron each minor kink, instead of this.-------------------------------Too many wild changes, one step forward two steps back is this developers motto.Robocraft initially had a sensible mixture of Creativity and Function. There was also a sensible mix of Grind, Progression and sense of achievement. It was a little lacklustre in places. For example, the RP system allowed you to choose what you unlocked and the level system determined how ""effective"" those unlocks were. As you progressed in Level and CPU, your bots got bigger, your weapons better.This has now been swapped out for a system where equipment is unlocked in order, over time with no player input. Once you unlock an item, that is it, theres no improvement. Everything is by default ""Tier 10"".This in turn made building robots boring, no more balancing weaponry vs armor vs mobility. If you chose to go cosmetic-bot there was a challenge to making a bot functional but in ""theme"".Now sure you can build a bot ""exactly"" as you want, as long as you like Yellow, Pink, White, Grey & Brown as your color palette. The other colours are locked to premium (Note they touted this ""flattening"" of tiers as an 'improvement' to creative robot building).Then theres the slew of problems with actual Gameplay mechanics.Initially there were balancing issues as expected, they kind of balanced themselves out up until Unleashed/Legendary update and the devs got stuck in a nerf cycle on everything except SMGs.This last update saw them add the near useless flak, severely nerf the Medics Nano and turned it into SMGcraft again.They also did away with many of the useful gameplay information elements.Spotting now just says ""Enemy Spotted"" with no indication of flier, hover, walker, they claimed this is because bots were ""complicated to classify"" yet for the most they were classified correctly. This means you find it far harder to prioritise the right targets.This also affects your own team negatively as you can no longer easily see if a friendly medic is nearby or if a push block is Rail Heavy and needs more SMG or plasma.The game has also suffered Match making issues from day one. Resulting in differing metas.The latest of which is ""The Team who has the most medics, wins"". The hiding of Bot Type and spotting call outs I think was done to merely hide how bad the matchmaking is, especially as in the past when we could see the team makeups we would see matches where it was 6 rails and two plasmas vs say 6 SMGs and two medics.Put simple, the devs have taken this game in far too many directions, too rapidly and with no forethought.Initially it was a DM/TDM game, then they opened it up to the Creative Block Builders, then expanded to Boss Battles (removed, was one Megabot vs lots of little bots quite fun), then switching to try their hand at MOBA-like Tower matches, then trying to create some kind of bespoke ""Robot Market"" where players can sell their bots, but their currency system is too expensive to support.Its like they saw all these good ideas from other games and tried to cram it into their own, trying to snap up a bit of another niche in gaming and half assing it so badly that it introduces more problems than it gains in players.This is likely the reason why they ""flattened"" their game down to basic progression.

								Was one of the best games I've ever played but the development team has lost all semblance of touch with it's playerbase.While it once offered challenging and interesting gameplay and construction it now has been modified to remove any skill or tactics from the combat and construction. Where people once spent countless hours fine tuning creative vehicles now the most effective bot is a brick with several guns attached on treads. Additionally they have enstilled extreme limitations on all tiers making gameplay homogeneous and boring at all levels.At the begining of the year I couldn't have said enough good about this game but now all I can say is don't waste your time. Look up Steamcraft if you want something more to the tune of what this game used to be about (be warned though the whole game is set up in russian so there is a bit of a learning curve).Update: The limitations on tiers have been lifted by way of removing tiers. Now the old problem of extremely powerful weapons making it into low level games is worse than ever. In an attempt to fix the problem of overtiering they have made it much worse.Additionally the lead developer made a statement that he will be much more active on the forums, bringing up new ideas and getting the communities feedback before adding in unwanted changes. And he did...for 3 days. Since then (roughly two weeks ago) he has been all but completely absent on the forums. It appears that nothing will convince the devs to really use community feedback.			"

								A Robocraft Story:In the beginning Robocraft’s fanbase were building lovers, some art some engineer.The game tought them how to fight, and they became strong. It was a free to play game loved by it's players.FJ then comes along and nerfs the physical simulator too much, making engineers rage.Developers barely play the game themselves leading to a detachment from their part on in-game balance issues.FJ buffs and nerfs in increments of 20% percent or more without any consideration for matchmaking or player skill.Test environment behaves differently than production environment so they are unable to properly test and fix long existing bugs.They add new unbalanced and unfinished gimmick features or game modes.They removed Over Tiering, but it affects Art bots as well.This time the Art builder is raging too.Update: now with more loot crates!

								I first got this game on a whim when it first came to steam and it was great; fun, innovative, unique, challenging and rewarding.I stopped playing after there was an update that killed the progression system (which had nothing wrong with it before, why fix what isn't broken?). I decided to come back recently to see how the game had changed and I have to say the game is nothing like it was before and has been completely ruined; punishing reward sytem, unique building has been made redundant, no team work or strategy and still a terrible progression system and matchmaking system.A quick scan of forums a reviews made it apparent that the devs were not listening to anything the community was saying and update after update continued to ruin what was once a great game that I would've recommended to anyone.They used to have a great game with the potential to be even better, but as the game is now I just can't recommend you invest any time into it.If I could offer any advice to Freejam, I would say that they scrap the updates, revert the game back to early alpha and start again.

								This game was AWESOME when it first came out. I was spending time leveling up and having lods of fun while doing it. The first big update I remember is when they added new battle modes. I Loved the new battle modes and I spent even more time playing with every update. After 200 hours, I finally got to MEGABOT! The game was so fun after I got megabot. One day I opened up the game after an update. Basically it said, we are removing megabots and giving everyone who had megabots at that time about 2400 gc (can just buy a pile of crap). In addition to the bye bye to megabots, they decreased the amout of rp earned in a battle by like 90%. I just stopped playing then. I was angry, and the robocraft team got alot of complaints from me. Another update came along and I tried it. They took out all currency and replaced everything with crates you earn after a battle. This brought a little money balance back but the game still is not even close to as good as it once was. I just can't recommend it. It is ok right now but it was so extremely good at the beggining that it is horrible compared to what it used to be.			"

								Pros: Great concept, the ability to craft your own robot and battle other robots online is really fun. The graphics and particles are neat.Cons: In regards to their security protocol, i uninstalled RC due to their EAC ""sercurity"", its anything but that. Its completely unsafe and invasive of your privacy. The program collects your online data and personal information ie. browser history, downloads. There has been numerous cases where users couldnt sign in after the EAC update as well.  Honestly i think the developers should instead have a report system where users can report other players if they are using cheats or hacks.Conclusion: RC is fun and the more items you unlock, the more you just want to keep on playing. The only suggestion i have is the eradication of EAC.			"

								BTW, all those cool guns and explosions and fast robots you see in the trailer? Those are all built out of the best weapons and wheels and crap in the game, only accessible to the obsessively devoted or the payers. Don't expect to ever be able to do that. Expect to be on the receiving end of it.---Actual Review---           My friend introduced me to robocraft about a month before Nano disruptors and Walker legs were introduced. it was all me and my friends would talk about. I played it for hundreds of hours on the stand-alone launcher. I was never a very competitive person, and mostly played for fun. I took a little break, then, the devs released the battle arena update. I was hooked. I went from teir 7 to teir 10 in a month, because i spent every waking moment playing this game. They removed teirs. I didn't see why that was a good idea.             then, the mega weapons hit. It was about then I discovered Steam and began to use that launcher. I was fine with the mega SMG and Plasma, they were alright.  then, they added in the 10 second healing, making my favorite weapon, the nano disruptor, useless. I was beginning to get frustrated. then, to add insult to injury, They added the Robo-shop, Removing creativity and replacing it with grinding and copying. Then, the downward spiral began. Aeroflak. LOML. Proto-seeker was a ray of hope. then Ion disrupter. PSK was nerfed. Then, the last straw, The Epic Loot Update. That was a bad idea. The New gamemode and earth map was actually really good! I loved it! too bad the rest of the game was a molten mess. Now, I can't stand to play for more than 30 minutes, and I have to force myself to hit the launch button.TL;DR   I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the most competitive of gamers. The community is toxic, the Devs are ignorant, There is a clear difference between the Veterans and the new players, The Pay2Win is Rampant, and only a handful of designs are used. Luckily, I was one of the few who never pay a cent to the devs. They don't deserve it anymore. I miss the old robocraft. But, with the direction FreeJam is taking, I don't expect to be returning to this game anytime soon.			"

								Ok i played thiss game today for about 3 hrs to see whats changed. A lot of  things changed. Lets start off with the new weapons. After every game you get a crate. (stupid) In those crates is RNG. If  your jesus you get a legendary. You know what that legendary does? Instakills everything and makes people mad. You either be jesus or spend 50$ on protonium crates to get a legendary. why. Why the hell would you remove the IN GAME CURRENCY. Now theres this ""Robcubes"" or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. You cant really get the right weapons you want cause the only way you get the new currency is after matches selling all this useless crap. The stuff you get selling that useless crap is 1/4 of what it actually is Worth. Nano guns are useless. The heal 1 nano gun at a time and they dont all heal at once. They cant hit enemies. So the devs madde it some you can have more than 1 gun at a time. Wtf. Let me have HOMING FREAKING MISSLE LAUNCHERS  THAT INSTAKILL some nanoguns HOMING FREAKING MINI GUNS some plasmas that fire 1 at a time. So now i can have up to like  5 weapons on my robot andd they can all be op legendarys. Their you win this pay to win game. Oh yeah plasmas. I thought the whole point of plasmas were to do some burst damage. Not 1 plasma shot at a time?? Plasmas are basicly bombs and that takes the whole iddea out of plasma ""bomber"". Over all: Crates are stupid  there is stupid op guns, be jesus  or pay 100$ to win, plasmas usless, no more tiers techtree or rc, paytowin, stupid crates, no more having GC, you can buy the special misc stuff with robcubes which is stupid cause i think the misc stuff deservered to be bought with money, and did i mention stupid crates?Anyway im done ranting but i am still playing this because it is infact entertaining still but you dont get the motovation you need to get a certain weapon because of how much money you actualy get. I just wish there was an option when you press Play on steam it says Would you like to play the Old Robocraft or New Robocraft. Im pretty sure 90% of the people playing this gaame would do Old Robocraft. I hope somethings get fixed cause its an awesome game. 4/10Edit: I dont know if this is a glitch or not but I could have half my bot left and it would say like 5% of my bot is left and i find that with enemies enemies too. They would have like 5 guns on, well over 300 blocks left and be around 10%. Kinda annoying			"

								Like many others my biggest problem with the game is the recent ""epic loot"" update.  The combat system is enjoyable, and I like the robot creation tools.  The problem is how difficult it is to get everything now.  With the currency system battles were rewarding;  a long battle may be more of a grind, but it would be that much more worthwhile because the reward was higher.  With the epic loot system it doesn't matter if a game takes 5 minutes or an hour, you get the same stuff.       The epic loot system also just doesn't feel rewarding to me, and I get protonium crates more often than not from battles.  You can recycle items you get from loot crates that you don't want but they recycle for such low prices that the feature's nearly useless.  I understand that there is the potential for a loot crate to be more valuable than the galaxy cash, but it has yet to happen for me.  At this point the daunting aspect of grinding until I can get the parts I want has just about driven me away.  I can only imagine how disappointing it must be for people who get rusted and bronze crates more often.     I can understand the inention to appeal to new players by making it easier to start the game with higher level loot, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the players that are already invested in the game.     At his point I'm still hanging in there in the hopes that it'll turn around, and would be more than happy to recommend the game if a future update adresses the current problems.			"

								Oh boy, another review from XLCREEPER cause God knows if anyone wants to hear what I have to sayQuick Update: Removing megabots. I'm not even going to bother linking all of you to the monoliths of text I have written to try and save them. So, I'm done with this game.--Covering every mistake since the crumbling of robocraft, the invention of the ranked protonium battlesFirst off, you're a tad late posting that maximum loadout trailerRanting on OP Plasma BombersSecond, what went through your minds when you gave players a flak cannon to defend the OP plasma bombers, and then release missiles so you can make them OP again? The only way to protect yourself from missiles is to hide behind objects. Guess what! Bombers go OVER those objects. Not to mention they move 5 times faster than ground bots. Oh, and then you release the full weapons update, you give them BOTH plasmas and missles!

I do proficient battles in that ranked arena FIVE TIMES to get a rank increase, but every loss seems to be a decrease. OH AND WHAT ABOUT: How leaving a protonium battle will cause you to wait two minutes, even accidental. Listen, robocraft even gives you a CONFIRMATION NOTE that you accidentally disconnected, and you still get the short♥♥♥♥♥2 minute beating of wait, just enough time to grab a cup of coffee.Finally, ranting on the obstruction of strategy whatsoeverHmmmmmmm lets see where to start with this one. Oh yeah, the removal of tiers, blocks, and all that other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Good work, because when you remove tiers and blocks and limited weapons, you remove the even thought of needed to get a challenge in building a robot. Why? Because now all you need to do is just make a ♥♥♥♥ing twig robot, throw some weapons on it, and its good to go! What happened where if you were going to build a flying robot, you'd actually need to consider and calculate how many sheilds and what weapons? Oh wait, you can put any weapon on them now. Oh wait, your robot falls too fast behind a rock to be destroyed, giving you the chance to heal yourself all fine and dandy. As for megas, you still need that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ strategy cause God knows that mega smg's accuracy was reduced 50% so you can't actually kill the ♥♥♥♥ing things shooting from above, which you allow 80% of the bots in a battle to be flying~Oh, and how about not restricting almost every color available to premium? And all that other stuff, of which you're bottlenecking non-premium players to pay more money~Your match making is also one unfunny joke. All those flying bots. RIP in MEGA. Ranting on what should also never have left robocraftYou never should have removed boss battles. Boss battles were the best, and I still remember those great days where 4 Teir 8 or 9 bots would fight against a whole team of little Teir 3-5's or one Megabot fighting against a battle of Teir 3-7's. But wait, Teirs don't exist anymore.﻿EDIT: Lets go over to when this game went to♥♥♥♥♥♥Robocraft Unleashed Updates:-- Maximum Freedom, just build whatever you want and take it into battle-- Completely new match-making using Robot Ranking and Player Level-- Armor restrictions lifted completely-- Tier CPU caps lifted completely-- Overtier restrictions lifted completely-- Brand new Robot Ranking gauge, with pizazz!-- Platoons now match-made based on (just above) the average Robot Ranking between the smallest and the largest Robot Ranking in the platoon-- RP rewards are now based on your performance in battle and the Robot Ranking of your Robot-- Robot Ranking re-balanced on all cubes to assist ‘match-maker’ to match Robots more equally-- T1 changed to Mk1 in names of all functional and armor cubesand all that other crap.Like freejam wrote a book on ""freedom"" and replaced their hard-drive backups with it.Here's something we all miss:http://i.imgur.com/lgZFLlt.jpg "

								My how far this game has fallen.I've been into this game since pretty damn near the beginning. Back then it was a sense of adventure to rank up through the tiers and levels, both of which were very hard to increase - so the challenge was there. That sense of ""Yeah, I built that"" when you finally make that perfect bot was also brilliant.Those days are long since past.The tiering system is gone entirely, and it is SO EASY to level up, that when I started the game after it was first changed. I jumped from 55 to 100 instantly, and I heard you could jump from even further back than that. The game's menus are SO CLUNKY now and they're hard to navigate... I still don't know what many of my button mappings actually do on the menu, but they do something. The colouring system was a neat idea - though it's just a consolation prize for losing the tiering system - but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colours, which is just... marvelous. Oh, no more tech points? There goes the fun in unlocking things too.The Community Robot Factory, while well-intended, is just a plagiarism facility at worst, and at best utterly annihilates that thrill of finally completing a robot which you built yourself. Also, HOW MUCH ARE THESE WEAPONS?! TEN MILLION RP FOR A SINGLE TOP-POWER WEAPON? GET STUFFED I AIN'T PAYIN' THAT I ONLY GET LIKE 50-100K PER BATTLE!!!Medic bots have been rendered obsolete, as has any form of stategy in the game and the building, by the auto heal feature. If you do actually take damage, you can hide behind a corner, and get all your health back. What a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And the pilot seat was removed, so no need to worry about protecting the weak spot now.I really miss the old boss battle/megabot challenge. Couple of strong bots against a full team of weak ones. That was actually really fun and it was balanced too. Guess they decided it gave the veteran players too much enjoyment, and they didn't want noobs rage-quitting after one of these fights, so it's gone now.Worst of all, the game crashes a LOT more than it used to, which really pisses me off, as if you're in the middle of a battle, SEE YA NO REWARD FOR YOU WE JUST WANNA WASTE YOUR TIME BYE! I swear the amount of times I heard ""A PLAYER HAS DISCONNECTED"" in one match was frightening, just before I crashed myself.I remember the days when I used to enjoy this game, but now it's both too complex and too simple at once. Complex, in the sense that all those CUBE VARIATIONS; inner slope, edge slope, what? WHAT ARE THESE FOR?At least they refunded all those new garage payments I made so now I have thousands upon thousands of free GC. So there's that at least.UPDATE TIME:So, they changed the mechanics again, by changing prices so they are a bit cheaper. Fine, that's alright, it's a good start. What isn't so good is that they lowered the maximum reward whilst raising the minimum one, so now you earn roughly the same amount of RP whether you're complete crap or absolutely amazing. To quote, ""Our intent was to help boost the RP income of below-average skilled players so they felt they could make progress regardless, and to lower the bonus obtained for doing exceptionally well to something far more reasonable.""So now what? Now there is ZERO incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game, because you still get a decent amount of RP just for participation. This just downright insults those who have taken the time to learn and master the game by restricting the value of their skill, and patronizes the weak and makes it so that they don't have to actually master the game at all. Add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game.... If you do exceptionally well at something, you expect to be rewarded for it. If you're bad, you're deprived of that reward so you have incentive to get better so you will EARN that reward. But no, everyone gets similar amounts now. It's as if the devs wanted to be modern-day Robin Hoods, or those feminists trying to sort out the mythical ""wage-gap"" that no-one can prove exists. There's a better way to fix the progression issue; stop making everything so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ expensive. Even with these price drops, most of the top-tier weapons are seven million or so anyway - so what's the point of all this?Well, at least they tried. They killed off all of their veterans with this change, but they tried. I know some of you will call this ""nitpicking"" but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all is...UPDATE AGAIN:Ok. They reverted the reward changes. I take back all that I said before. Good to see that the devs are actually listening to the community for once. Let's see where the future takes the game now. They still have a bit to fix.			"

								TLDR: I cannot recommend the game in its current state because of the extreme amount of grind the last update introduced.This used to be such a great game - build robots from blocks and send them into battle. Sounds fun, right? But the latest loot update ruined everything by changing the ""build, drive, fight"" formula into ""p(l)ay, gamble, grind"". First, the random drop system may work in other games, but it is not well suited for Robocraft. No longer you can buy the parts you want and build what you want. You are now at the mercy of random drops, which is anti-creative.But most importantly, the amount of grind and / or money required to get the top stuff is now insane. If you are a new player, the loot system may look OK at first, but do not be fooled. Let's do some calculations. Probability of a legendary drop per 8-slot protonium crate is about 1/35. To get most of the high level items from crate drops only, you'd need about 2000 protonium crates. That means either paying 700$ for the crates or winning 4000 matches and finishing 1st in every single one of them if you don't want to spend anything. Assuming you win rate is 50% and you finish 1st 50% of the time, that'd take you about 4000 hours! These numbers are somewhat inflated because you can recycle items. But the recycle rates are abysmal, so the calculations do reflect the magnitude of grind that the update has introduced.The worst part: despite a massive outcry from the community, the developers act as if nothing happened, calling the update ""a success"".

								Once upon a time this was a good... no GREAT game, I love to build, I loved everything about this game.... until their latest update. Epic loot is complete garbage... Why? you can play hours and get nothing for your efforts, you can get the best loot chest in the game, AND STILL GET CRAP LOOT! why not buy gear with robits? HA! that feature is no longer worth while, now there are 2 ways to get robits, sell the♥♥♥♥♥♥loot you get for minimal robits, or have other players buy the robots you make, yeah if you're lucky, plus you only get 25% robits from selling a robot. You can also buy the best chest with real money, only problem is... you still have a high chance to get nothing. Premium is no longer worth it, instead of double robits and experience, you now get double the amount of crap loot and ooooooooo more colors to paint your ship, I ALREADY HAD ALL THE COLORS!!! now im stuck with 4. On top of every thing else, they had to add energy usage when using weapons, my favorite build was healing guns, now it's terrible, now I can't keep my team alive, oh and everyone can heal/repair. after 10 seconds of not taking damage, you rebuild yourself... now snipers rule the field... Why Freejam?... why?If your game isnt making money, you shouldn't call it ""free to play"" nor should you change it, if it's not making money, it's not the games fault, it's yours.			"

Early Access Review
								Dont count my hours on steam, ive got over 1000 on their standalone launcher:To start off, I really want to reccomend this game, and if the recent blasphemy of a expansion gets chanced, ill consider changing my review to a positive. In the meantime however, FreeJam has done a very good job at completely destroying the game.First off, my most hated patch: Matchmaking:  match-making takes into account Player Skill, Player Level and CPU of Robot.While it sounds ok at first, it was stated and ment to be a CPU based system, the bigger your bot you made, the higher matching tier you get into, great for everyone, while the algorithim was bad, it was more or less acceptable. They made player skill and player level a thing now. With this, a max level player now can not play with a low level friend, without their friend getting the shaft, seriously. Play a match with a buddy whos 150 like myself, and the guy is under 40, BY DEFAULT my level puts him into high ranking matches. WTF? Good job on destroying party play.Progression: NEW PLAYERS READ!Progressoin used to be fairly straightforward. WIth the introduction of Loot Crates and matchmaking changes, Your going to find yourself in a black hole of stress and anxiety that will only be saited with death and dismemberment. New players will have a starting bot and starting armaments, no extras, no money no nothing. You will be put into matches with players who now have everything, who are capable of oneshotting your little starter mech with the simplest of weapons, Im warning you now, if you DO decide to play, Understand that you will die, countless countless times as you level. I almost reccomend you buying a humble bundle code for 6 bucks, it will atleast give you starter material and 90 days of premium. The grind to get gear is RNG based, so finding that wing you need, or that wheel, could take you a long...long time.Loot Crates: The addition of Loot crates this new expansion was good in theory, the game orriginally allowed you to purchase items with the money made each match, allowing players to build how they want. Now? Now you have to open loot crates, a RNG system, that allows you to obtain items from the game on a random basis, items you dont like, you can salvage for 1/20th the value of the item, thats right, 1/20th. Before, you could play a match, and afford a weapon, or perhaps a wing, or maybe a little bit of blocks. Now players, especially new players are unable to build freely. You must break down items you dont want, to get 10-200 robits (currency used in game), then spend 20k+ robits to buy a weapon that would have taken far less time to recieve, OR get lucky and get one in a case. Combat: Combat was great for a time, then the introduction to Lock on Missle Launchers (LOML henseforth) and Protoseekers (PSK) has created a game that no longer requires accuracy or skill, instead requires a person simply to get a lockon beforeyou. A game with this content, with this gameplay , should NOT contain weapons that allow a player to simply lock on and kill. This effectively nullfies any Flying bots almost indefinatly. FreeJam Company: They have a bad habbit of being quiet, While i supported them at the start, over the years ive seen them turn their backs on their playerbase 95% of the time, when they are listening to us about imbalances, horrible matchmaking, or bugs/gliches, they put patches out that not only negatively affect the game, but introduce even more issues!Combined with the issues of Matchmaking, Lock On weaponry, and a company who doesnt listen to the cries of their victums, you have a perfect recipe for disaster that can only be mitigated with a clean house at FJ. They seriously need to hire a better PR manager and hire some more devs who are a little more knowledgable in arena gameplay, the current ones are only worried about expanding content, not fixing problems. Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥FreeJam, in 3 days, youve lost almost 8% of your positive votes on steam, for good reason, it took you 3 years to build up respect and only 3 days to destroy it, I hope this is a lesson that you take seriously because your about to lose your entire playerbase in less than a month if you dont revert or fix some of the crap youve done to the game.

								The last major update really dumbed down the game, before you would have to really put some thinking into parts purchase, get better armor cubes? or shields? or guns? one had to play  with th diferent cubes armor rating in order to protect the vital parts of the robot (besides other things). Now if you just make a bot with a bunch of blocks and strap a bunch of guns and you can survive for ages! Before one could get one shot kill with bombers or  railguns if hit the right robot spot, Now it takes forever to destroy pretty much anyone because everyone uses the same blocks. Block type is one variable removed that helped to make the game challenging.A bad remark also for the non-compensation on blocks when the update was made, some of us have spent a lot on blocks and that was a waste of time and money for some. I'm glad i didn't spent any money on this game otherwise I would lose the investment in blocks. I don't recomend to spend money on this game because you can lose your items overnight in some crazy update or your item can be rendered useless by an updateAnother one is the pilot seat removal, it helps to create diferent shapes of robots, but now you don't have to protect your sweet spot! again, making the game easier by removing the sweet spot and the limitations the pilot seat had.The worst one is the auto healing, this completly changed the game dynamics! before you had to think on how to build your robot even for the case it would get damaged, making sacrificial parts to be blown when under attack. Also you had to put some extra locomotion parts, in case you would lose wings, wheels, etc. when under attack. Now you have auto healing! no need for this! just hover your bot over a mountain, if someone shoots you down, just lay on there hidden (when possible) and wait to be up and running again! Same for tanks, just hide in a corner when your health is getting low.Before the update you would think twice before engaging, now everyone is Kamikaze! before you could damage an airplane or tank useless with a couple of shots, so people would be carefull when atacking, now everyone just charges ahead full steam! Also untill the introduction of the AA canon, the game was quite unbalanced, air units had a massive advantage because of the hit and run tatic, T10 block and the auto regen.Only good remark was the introduction of colours.Al said, I think the game was dumbed down in order to attract more people and to please fustrated users who couldn't do a good robot or use them properly.  The developers want to please everyone and attract more people  making the game  more ""arcadish""  but they are scaring some fans away and killing the thing that made the game special, I know I don't play as much asI used to!It was a very good and addictive game now I guess it's just ok, something to fill that 10 min break.PS: sorry for any misspeling, no spell check was used.

								I really used to like this game. I would, as many did, recommend this game to my friends, telling them that it was really fun and a cool little buildy game. It had a free-to-play aspect, but I was OK with that. I even gave the developers some money and bought some items. I now wish that I had saved my money. This game has, like many of my bots, been flown into the ground at a rapid rate after several of the important bits have been taken away. It used to be that you would build a robot of a certain tier, and would be matched with similar robots. Hearing complaints about how you could exploit the ranking system, they attempted to balance it, but it was a crap method of doing so: by completely removing the system. At this point, I stopped playing for a while. I came back to this game, hearing of a new update, and they had in fact removed features. You didn't need a pilot's seat, armor had been completely...""reworked,"" and they had made glass, which was SUCH A COOL-LOOKING BLOCK, into a freakin' cosmetic item! And the only way to get cosmetic items is with real money. Oh, did I mention that MOST COLORS OF PAINT YOU NEED TO PAY FOR?!*sigh* VERDICT:If Freejam pulls their act together, I would heartily recommend this game. However, in its current state, I would say hold off.			"

Refuses to aknowledge player feedback and continues to blindly praise their own update while blaming the community for the massive amount of dislikes due to their own presumptuous opinion over what people are thinking rather than to read and take in the feedback. Player: Hey getting 90% less money while everything is costing the same isn't ok.Freejam: U JUST DISLIKE OUR GAME CUZ U WANT TIERS BACKAlso bragging about how many new players installed the game after this update implying it was good is such a bad way of doing it. NEW UPDATE -> NEW & OLD PLAYERS RETURNING FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME -> THEY REALISE IT SUCKS AFTER A WHILE AND LEAVESBut hey Freejam just sees that people installed the game and played during a short amount of time that means MASSIVE SUCCESS. TL:DR: Game used to be unique and fun. Then they tried making it into a moba. And then they ruined it some more with the overhaul. Avoid the game and keep disliking untill they start listening.			"

								I've been a long time player of robocraft (like a year or two) it USED to be a great game. As with every ftp game theres a grinding element, but it was a rewarding one you'd grind for  days all while leveling u and unlocking new parts in your tier branch until finally you moved up a tier. Now you ether drop a bunch of money on crates or you grind for maybe a week to get the 1 part you want. Also you can sell almost your entire inventory and still not have enough robits to buy the one gun you want, only to have someone open a rust tier crate and get said gun. Does that sound like a rewarding grind system? No. I enjoy the new no tier aspect of the game but the recycle value of parts combined with the cost for new parts, or the very low chance of getting that part in a crate has broken the game.			"

								This is a good game that gets some unfair negative reviews and hate.  I am going to address some unfair attacks at this game.The BIG thing about these negative steam reviews is that anybody can write them thus many Loser players with idiot tank designs come here to take out their anger on the game’s store page.  This is partly thanks to the chat window in the games main lobby where countless 9 year-olds tell the whole server why they lost because SMG’s are cheap and not because they rushed in alone with their no-armor hovercraft in between 5 enemy tanks.  When other normal players lose to an SMG tank they see the chat and believe the exaggerated comments and join them, then they start venting their anger too. The other slightly more fair reviews I’ve seen are from the old-time players who say the game devs ruined the game. I’m a little newer at this than them and I’ve played almost 40 hours of gameplay in these ""dark times,"" made it to T5 and had fun all the way, and there’s no signs of the fun stopping any time soon. The people who are having fun (and there’s a lot of us) don’t bother to write reviews, just the people who want to vent their anger do.The first thing people say is that this game is pay2win but that just isn’t true. First of all, paying users and free users get all the same parts to work with and second, in this game your robot has a stat for ranking. When you add a part to your robot it raises the rank stat and if you reach a certain point it will go up in tier. There are 10 tiers of robots and you just about always get put against robots in your tier so paying 2-win is impossible. The only thing paying does for you is give you faster progression through the tiers. Some people say its pay to progress but I’m on top of T5 and I haven’t had that problem yet although I think during a certain update it was bad but they have already fixed that by now. Progression isn’t super important anyway because by T5 every TYPE of part is unlocked, just not the bigger stronger versions (which are in there own tier). Unlike World of tanks and other F2Ps you can still make cool stuff at lower tiers and there’s none of that “premium ammo” crud that I hate.Now for the second big thing to talk about, op (over powered) weapons and parts. Every type of weapon gets called “op” 90 times in the same day because of that venting 9 year-old thing I told you about before. One big thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha so balance is subject to change. I hate when people say “plasma has ruined this game forever” because even if plasma was cheap the devs would rebalance it ASAP. There are only 3 different types of weapons in the game (for now) and they all have their intended functions. I’m not saying the game has always had perfect balance (and it still doesn’t) but it’s still a lot of fun to play. The last thing about balance is that a lot of players are new to this game and don’t know what they can do. An example would be that hovercrafts can dodge plasma shells vertically but I don’t see many players do this. Those players could go on to say that plasma is cheap or that hovercrafts are underpowered but the real problem is that the players don’t try new tactics.People whine a little about other things like lag, warping and glitches but I have never had those problems, those things are just more problems that people unfairly vent out during their rants.Overall I just wanted to tell you that this is a really fun game that can make you think and adapt, and also that the devs aren’t evil (I think), they gave us free stuff as makeup for a server crash they had. If the game gets big and devs finish this right then this could be a really great and solid game. Thanks for reading, PEACE OUT! "

								Abysmal, the developer's actions are horrible. Freejam has left us with a mix of P2W and ""epic loot"" which is not epic at all. In a nutshell, this game used to be a great F2P. But now they added DLC, crates that make no sense, terrifyingly OP weapons, and P2W which made everything unbalanced. Utter garbage.			"

								Release your inner 6 year old as you build freaking robots that SHOOT LASERS pew pew pew pew!The destruction of the robots are fantastic. You can legit shoot off the guns of enemy robots to leave them defenseless, or shoot out the flying bits to ground the plane. It is freaking rad.The robot building mechanics make it truly memorable. It's like the custimization of weapons like Loadout, except much more in depth. It's basically building with LEGOs. It is amazing.This game also apparently likes handing out premium codes and crud. Also, if you get a premium thingy, you get 100% extra crud. The best bit, though, is that  for every premium player, everyone gets 5% extra.  When you get premium, you help out yourself, and everyone else! THIS GAME IS FREAKING RAD!  "

								With the recent updates for Robocraft, I think its a better game, however my only problem that I wouldn't recommend to any person looking to play this game is the economy.The game looks great in my opinion, they've been less transparent these days incorporating the loved Center of mass indicators and total health, and the wonderful struts that were recently added, but a problem still persists that changes the overall replayability on the game negativitly. The economy.Crates aren't really the problem like many other biased reviews, but the currency itself.Recycling rates are poor, and most of the money I normally get is through the Community Robot Factory, or the ""Robot Workshop""You can barely scrap enough money for the parts you need, and it would require a massive amount of other parts just to get the one part you want.That said. It is a great game, the recent changes allows you have a little more freedom to build your creations, you just need the currency to do so, the only thing that is really holding my review back. "

								I don't even know why I play this game anymore, its so pay to win. You have to buy premium if you want to get anywhere in this game. One of the biggest problems with this game is the rewards system. As a developer, I can tell you a good rewards system is EXTREMELY important. In this game, you get rewarded with crates after every match. If you don't have premium you get half as many items as you would get with premium. This means premium players have a much heigher chance at getting the legendary weapons. The only way to get 'currency' is to sell unused blocks but unless you have premium your going to get a small fraction of the original price of the block. The matchmaking system also is extremely flawed. It matches extremly skilled players (with legendary guns) with players that don't know what they are doing.			"

								It's been a while since I last played this game and enjoyed it.Where to start...I had first heard about this game when my brother and a couple of his friends had been playing it. I started off in the laser-fest that was tier one, and slowly began making my way up the challenging but very fun slope of technology. School starts, and I make two new friends (which are still great friends today) because we all had one thing in common: Robocraft. I got a lot of my other PC gamer friends to join us and we had a blast. The developers were releasing updates fairly frequently, and added my most favorite weapon, the Nanotech Disruptors. The majority of my friends an I were in tier 4-5, and I couldn't wait to get them, since I love playing support. I literally couldn't wait, so I payed $10 to get them and some extra in game money as well. The game kept getting better, and everyone was having a great time. I was in tier 7 right as they added spider legs. At this point, the game was at its peak.Not necessarily the peak as in the most enjoyable time, but as in right when it started to go downhill. The updates got more obscure as the game went on, adding in tank treads and other cool new weapons and addons, rebalances etc. However, there was one update that completely crippled this game. What seemed a cool new concept and great way to have fun in the game turned into a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ of people spamming caps in the chat because we weren't defending top lane or that someone kept getting spawnkilled. This was the update that added the new gamemode with the huge mechanical mushroom looking things with gems or whatever the ore was called at the top. I heard about it and was actually decently excited, the game needed a new gamemode. I played about 40 of these matches, and figured out that it was no where near as fun as the risk vs reward of the classic gamemode. Of course, you could sitll play classic, but with this new shiny gamemode about 4 people in each tier were actually playing classic. We (being my friends and I) decided to take a bit of a hiatus from the game, to see how it was doing later in development.Fast forward half a year or so, I meet a streamer from the Netherlands and a friend at school who have both played recently. The tech tree is essentially gone, all progress has disappeared (including my ten dollars mind you) and they add ♥♥♥♥ing round blocks, to a square based building system. The community gets more toxic, the demographic has completely changed, and was once a life changing game has transformed itself into a monstrous cardboard box of♥♥♥♥♥♥on my doorstep.In its earlier stages, I would have reccomended this game. Now? Well, lets just say I'd rather play Bad Ratz for 4 hours straight than play this deformed atrocity for an hour. I'm sad that it had to end this way, and wish it would magically revert to its old state. We miss you, old Robocraft. "

								I used to play Robocraft since the beginning. It was a simple game with hidden complex gameplay mechanics. When you started, you build a robot with a gun and played some games. That said, building is quite simple and intuitive. You don't have to be an engineer to build a working robot. But the more you played, the more you understood the little weaknesses of your robot. Also you had to improve your skill with the available weapon. Especially your aiming and prediction was very important (like in other Shooters ofc). What made this game also great is how Freejam handled the pricing of products. A monthly premium membership, which doubled your loot after a battle (currency to buy new robot parts) only cost 5$ per month, which is very fair compared to other games, who charge 10$+ for monthly membership. And even without premium you could easily get all the parts you wanted.But since the new updates, this all changed... sadly1. Monthly Premium costs now 10$ for a month. They also introduced loot boxes. If you get a loot box after a game, you get a row with 4 different items (random). And with premium you get a second row with another 4 items. Probablemtic about this is, that you also see the 4 premium items even if you dont have premium. It's a common tactic from mobile games to show the players what they COULD have gotten if they had premium. I dont like these fishing tactics and I'm sad that this is introduced in Robocraft that way...2. They removed most of the depth from the game. You can now literally built any crap and it's working. They did this to make Art bots possible (example: A robot that looks like a house)3. They introduced a MOBA-like gamemode. It's quite easy to observe they Freejam tries to implement every trend possible.  4. All new weapons require no skill. In the past, there were railgun (sniper), SMG (automatic weapon) and plasma launcher (grenade launcher). You needed aiming for all these weapon. The new weapons are flak cannon (impossible to dodge as flying unit), rocket launcher with aiming assist (rockets follow players when locked in) and a rapid firing gun with following bullets. The game becomes more and more casual combined with high prices for premium membership and fishing tactics. I can't support a game like this and it makes me sad that I have to write a negative review after all those hours of playtime...			"

								After about a year away from the game, waiting for it to get a lot of nice, fresh content, I came back.First thing I get is the first screen being messy, full of ""BUY THE NEW PREMIUM MOTHERSHIP!""ok..?I log in, recieve a crate. Yes, a damm lootchest. I open the rusty crate, get robot parts. Y'know, the ones you WILL be using and NEED to get access to easily, are in the chest. They're RNG'd out of lootboxes.So, I take a quick look at the new UI, you can sell blueprints of your bots now, which is kinda cool. You can preview and share your bots, and you can.. recycle and forge. Took a look, it seems like you now use this.. green dust to unlock the specific item you want, the greater the more expensive, while recycling lets you turn unwanted stuff into dust.This system is honestly stupid. Perhaps in FPS its cool to get these sweet skins, that dont affect gameplay, but.. in a BUILDING game where you CREATE your own weapon, having to RNG 'em out, part by part, it's simply stupid. So, I guess I could get some of that dust, ingame currency from a match, with no need to throw away my lovely unused parts. Nope, you don't. So, while playing, first thing I realize is the multiple gamemodes, which is nice.. in a way. I try out the old, vanilla gamemode which was in the middle of them, and enter the cluster♥♥♥♥. Now we have a HP bar, with a blue.. thing under it, I couldn't figure out what it did. Snipers have been turned from ""you missed you get punished"" into a weapon with short cd that uses.. this energy bar around your crosshair.After getting a couple of kills I finally die, and surprice. I respawn.Not only that, but if you get ♥♥♥♥ed up to 1 hp, and get away, your robot will magically regenerate itself up to the last piece. How nice!Perhaps it was only in that gamemode, but either way.. why? are healers a thing even?They also got rid of the old, nice tech system.Overall, the game did change, and did add some cool stuff, but at the same time, they changed the mechanics so much it doesn't even feel like the same anymore. Hell, it even felt like playing a moba at some point.On the plus side, there is in fact lots of new blocks and options to create your bot, it just.. gets ruined by all the cashgrabby mechacnics.Also, forgot to mention the game is highly pay to win as it is, as you can buy strong bots that are way better crafted than the rest from the ground with money, and can pretty much get anything you want with money, too.

								Robocraft is a game where you create your own robot with serveral difffrent variations of movement and weaponry.PROGRESSION.Well i have been playing robocraft for a while now and i have seen it go through all its changes but im not gonna review the game IT WAS im gonna review the game IT IS, what the game is right now is a somewhat free to play game. Why ""somewhat free to play"" simpily you have to spend money to progress unsless you grind all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ day and aint nobody got time for that. ""But mr random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i found on the internet how do you progress hmm?"" well you pick a bot and play a game and when that game ends depending on how you played you will get a crate from rusted crate to protonium crate and in these crates you will get a number of items from common to legendary with these items you can use them or sell them (recycle) but there is one MASSIVE problem you only get 20% of what the item is worth say you buy a laser smg for a 100 currency then you go woops i bought this item accidentally better sell it you sell it for 20 currency that is very depressing saying this is a example realisticlly  its 1000 gun and then 200 back everything sells for no where near enough UNLESS you BUY with REAL money ""PREMIUM"" this lets you sell for 60% and this makes the game feel so much nicer, fun and rewarding. GAMEPLAY.The game it self is brilliant the visuals are beutifull the UI is NOT clustered and how the game works is brilliant. firstly creating a vehicle is easy. ok let me jus ttell you this there is SO MUCH CONTENT there is LOAD'S of variation on wepons and movement types that both have advantages and dissadvantages and whats even better is the fact you can combine them.GAMEPLAY 2. During actually playing the game you can easily switch between wepons + the controls are super simple and just nice BUT One single thing that makes the gameplay so fun is being able to counter other people simply by targeting some of there components say they but all there guns clustered together you switch to plasma (AOE damage) and shoot them all at once and destroy them all then you switch to smg or rail or whatever and take out whatever they are using for movement and then you finish them off.Conclusion. I think the game is only worth playing if you are willing to spend money and time on the game.the only change they need to make is to make selling items worth something so people can be creative and want to have fun as they with feel rewarded for how well they played as a + this would keep a healthy playerbase as it would not just attracted people the game it would Keep them playing it. Thanks for taking the time to read this review i am very passionate about this game some of my and my friends favourite moments of pc gaming have come from this and we are very annoyed that the game changed this way becasue we dont feel like we should spend our time playing this game as there is no progression.

								Ha!! you came for the new update, to see if any lvling system or loot system has changed, guess again! NOPE!They added more loot for epic category, that mean you need to grind more!pros:this game has its own genreafter so many years of development they finally looked in the community and they added center of mass and many other features that should be already in the game robo editor, well done!cons: failed at creating a balanced loot system or recycling atleastfailed at the tier/leveling systemfailed at CPU capacityfailed at refunding old players cubes that went lost for nothing, with nothing.failed at refunding so much time that we lost on farming some cubes that got removed and currencyfailed at the healers roleso this game became a fail from all those tries of development and support/love players gave to it. Sure they make something they like, and we should follow them but in that case, dont expect people to give their money. Take an example in league of legends, many ppl are asking things, and riot applies it in the next patch, do you know how much money has made selling skins for ppls favorite skins? and its only cosmetic, back to robocraft, if you make the game something like this: max lvl 250 or 300 add many parts per lvl, unlock free stuff per lvl and if you wish, buy cheaper stuff from the store(ingamecurrensy), you could also put racing modes with or without thrusters with or without weapons, nerf locking rocket luncher, add moto wheels remove the chest random loot and put back store, but you can still recycle but gain more amount of points.and still make your game however you like, an idea of me is to put NEW GAMEMODES AS EVENTS WITH MORE BONUS CONTENT. Not you only will attract players but they will STAY and PLAY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SHIT it became.i still think it can become one of the best games, but not atm.EDIT#1 do something about afks in BA, get your mofking game fixing... its such a broke!

The gameplay is also broken, with the only useful weapons being lock on missiles that take no skill to use and are almost impossible to obtain without using micro transactions, which themselves don't even guarantee you a no-skill weapon that makes everybody who hasn't realised the new update sucks yet hate you.

								Nice Idea and really nice gameplay features. The user interface is friendly and easy to understand.The only problem is the everlasting lack of balancing. Since this game appeared in Steam, there has always been an overpowered build that could barely be beaten by non-exploiting users.This problem still makes this game unplayable in some point. Especially now, that you can attach a fully automatic gatling turret - called ""Proto-Seeker"" - that aims on it's own, deals pretty much the same damage as standard weapons, and has a higher shoot frequency than almost any other weapon ingame!Considering, that this weapon has been in the game for months and it is still a gamebreaking lack of balance, this game is just a ridiculous piece of sh**, that really does not deserve to be presented in the steam store.Well, fair enough, it is still in EarlyAccess, but fooling the non-exploiting gamer community like this and doing nothing against that for months, just to make money is naughty.I'm sure Freejam scares off lots of players just because everyone encounters the same overpowered Builds again and again and again and again, starting to get tired of this ridiculous game.I lost the hope that Freejam ever starts to take responsibility for their game and the correspnding community. Sadly, it's again all about the money, not even quality of their products.			"

								I played this game for a while, reached T10 and made a donation. A few weeks ago the problem of cheaters became the top priority. It was hardly a match without one. Reporting them didn't change much, there were detailed instructions on the net allowing any elementary kid to cheat.At first dev's implemented server-side protection, which caused lots of issues when players could not actually play. Insted of working on the fixes, they do what? They implement a very doubtful 'solution' called EAC, causing even more players to not able to play.For me it says ""EAC is not able to run in windows Test mode""I have Win x64 and have some modded audio drivers and some unsigned drivers for a legacy WiFi chip allowing it to run as virtaul AP. Disabling the test mode is currently not an option for me. Never ever I had a problem with this from, say, VAC or any other anti-cheat engine.So what? I go to their forum and find out that not only they are aware of the problem, they doesn't plan on fixing it at all! Their argument is: ""There are not that many people who need this, ok, we might block some legit players, but it's not a problem. They better buy themselves some new hardware. Or new version of windows. Or something. We don't care"".This somehow resembles an approach of executing innocent people along with the criminals without proper investigation - what's the problem? They won't be able to complain anyways. It's that kind of logic. Create a VM or another boot record allowing you play this game you say? I might do that one day, because I like the game itself. I might even try to spoof EAC check for test mode. But a whole situation when a legit player have to hack anticheat to actually play _without_ cheats is wrong on soooo many levels. Not only that, reading ito this EAC reveals it's invasive and pivacy violating nature.Read the ToS.The notorious ""False Positive"" alert from some of the AV vendors is not that much false as you can think. The EAC posess keylogging functionality and according to ToS you allow them to gather unspecified private data form you. Great, what's next? Charge my bank accounts directly for false cheating accusations?Unfortunatelly, early access games combined with Free-to-play game model have one major drawback. There is no way a player can influence the changes devs make or have their money back EVEN if the game becomes broken beyond repair.I really regret I have to put a negative mark for this game, but I find it the only way to let devs know I don't approve of their way of dealing with loyal player base. Sincirely hope the Dev's drop this horrible EAC stuff ASAP and forget it like a nightmare.PS: Tech support finally sent me a reply (after 5 days) saying something like ""We're working to fix this."" Hope this is something more than a canned response.PPS: Ended up with the dual boot to play. Never added any eclusions for my AV on this and would never do.			"

								2 years later, this game is still garbage. Not that it was ever that good.1. They removed the Tier System, the best aspect of the game. They also removed pilot seats so people could make ridiculously unrealistic robot designs with no strategic placing whatsover. The game now places you against superior oppenents with ridiculously overpowered robot designs.2. Matchmaking is terrible. Wait times are generally over two and a half minutes, and you will get placed with the same people that you played with before (even if there are >4000 people online)3. New mech types are absolutely unrealistic. Walkers can run as fast as a tank with 4 wheels and a thruster on the back of it. One helicopter blade can support an entire robot if it is on the back of it.4. Microtransactions everywhere. Pay for premium, cosmetics, robot designs, building materials, you name it. The game is a living advertisement of its own microtransactions. The queue window features robot designs that you can buy with premium currency. It even has a little note that states how much the ingame currency amount is equivelant to in USD, so all the little 10 year olds that buy these stupid and uneeded items can tell their mommies exactly how much money they are wasting on this game.The only positives about this game is the originality of the concept of the game. However, its 2 years old now, and I think the hype has died down. The updates they made to the game don't make it fun anymore. I wouldn't waste your time.			"

Early Access Review
								This game WAS good. Now it is terrible. The developers do not look at the community at all. They released a game in alpha (and while yes it is alpha) the game shown at first has changed dramatically for the worse and has gone in a completely different direction than what any old player does remember. It may seem the same but Robocraft no longer is. They are making a game that THEY want with no community input which is largely the reason why it is going downhill. The point of early access is like getting free help with the game but they do not take thaat help.After playing this game 240+ hours i have determined that the game developers punish people who play the game alot. Every update only takes away from the game for the long standing players and give more to new comers. Thi slast update, ""Epic Loot"" is not epic at all. What would have taken 12 30 min games to get 1 item that you want before update will now take 52-65 30 min games just to get the same item. The grind is terrible and based on my example of time, you will spend 4-5 times longer to get anywhere now.Any amount of money spent in this game is now worthless. The economy is down the drain and the time value worth of YOUR REAL LIFE (or even anohter game) is more valueable than in this game will ever be. The things that were added that made the game terrible: Loot crates, Nanos dealing no damage, the deletion of the Tech Point Tree, deletion of the Pilot Seat, the new MOBA base race gametype, the 10 sec auto heal, etc.Never play this game starting from 4/28/16. I highly suggest that you pick up ""Gear up"" or even ""Mech Warriors"" than this game now.Game WAS good, developers are terrible. Please never vote up for this game. Show the developers their mistake.Edit: Because of the new random loot system, the freedom to build what you want as long as you have money is now limited to what you receive by random chance. It is possible to get more corner blocks than normal building blocks which forces horrible ""creativity"". You will never be able to build what you want when starting out unless you go with the grind that has now been increased drastically.			"

								For the new players that are wondering whether they should join, currently the game is a mess and the new loot system is the main problem. Without going into much detail I can say that for new players robocraft will only infuriate you because players with better weapons are causing uneven matches which you have no control over. This has always been an element to the game but currently it is at its worse, simply because the update has massively incentivized higher skilled players to play in lower ranked matches. There was once a time were I loved this game and saw it as a key example of a good/real free to play game. Sadly it is now a pay to win game.To sum this up as a new player you will be stomped in most your matches which is not fun for anyone!			"

								I ve been playing this game on and off for two or three years now and heres what i feel about the gameIn the beginning there was creativity.  I would fight other bots that resembled bad♥♥♥♥♥futuristic tanks, air and ground walkers, and bots that ressembled creations out of movies like star wars or halothere was balance in chasis cubes.  And i dont mean just the cubes i also mean armor.  You would see decent builds with a little bit of armor for protection and overall have a balanced fight in a matchHowever ive started to play again for a few matches and i was upest to find some of the keythings that made this game fun...are while not gone, slowly being used less than they originally wereI see more armored turtles with guns poking out in a match then i see a decently built, creative, cool looking battle machine these days and i think that is mostly because armor has gotten far too important in building a robotNothing seems to be balanced anymore in terms of creativity and building balance of cubes and its really upsetting because this was and still can be a really fun game to play and i dont want to see it go down the tubes just because the development teams dont do anything to bring the creativity back.That stuff on the new cover for the game is never seen in a real match.  Because if it were it would be incinerated by hovering builds covered head to toe in armor.  The creativity to make robots is still very much in the game but the matchs themselves make it impossible to win with these creative bots because they get destroyed by these other robots that are covered in parts so high in defense that they shread you to pieces before you can do some damage.So if the development team(s) ever read this then please do something about balancing out these parts so that it is not impossible to win a game creativly.  And to the people reading this review i say to give robocraft a try, its not a bad game it just can be frustrating at times.  But if you find you' re always getting frustrated and always getting destroyed in matches, then i would reccomend to just  play something else and stay updated on robocraft to see if the dev's fix these problems that have been occuring.And if you dont feel like waiting then im sorry robocraft has disappointed youthese are just my opinions on the game so please dont harass or synically bash me over the head through the internet because im trying to helpful while still positive for a game i really want to pull through.

								I really loved this game, but now that the new update is out, Robocraft has just become another generic Pay-To-Win game that forces you to either grind ridiculously hard or pay more money to even afford one thing. Robocraft is no longer fun to me, and I am sad to say I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore, as it simply is no longer a joy to play and make robots when you cannot even buy the blocks without either playing lots of games to get the right ones, or recycling ridiculous amounts of hardware and blocks at a mere FRACTION of their cost. For example, one gun (the rail penetrator, specifically [which has also been nerfed to the point of near uselessness]) costs 2200 of the ""robits"" to buy (you CANNOT get robits from a battle outright, you instead have to recycle blocks you get, which gives you a measly amount of robits per battle in total, as I am about to explain), but somehow you only get 144 robits from recycling it, a mere fraction of the original price (exactly  18 / 275ths  of the original cost to buy the gun). This means you must grind a ridiculous amount to get only meagre amounts of robits, and to give an idea of the grind to get a interesting gun, the ""best"" gun (that is now practically worse than the worst gun) costs a whopping 175000 to buy 1.  (ironically, the Developers stated that this so called ""Epic-Loot"" update would reduce grinding and make it more enjoyable). Im sad to say I will probably quit; this update took the fun out of what Robocraft used to be. One of the worst parts of this is also the fact the developers do not address any of the complaints about this failure, and instead focus on how many people are getting the game now. I have a feeling those people won't have the game for very long, however, if they ever find out what robocraft once was. This game deserves the ""mixed"" review tab it is getting.			"

								Was hoping  I wouldn't have to write a negative review about this game, but here it is. The Epic Loot update that happened on 04/28/2016 has ruined the game entirely. The previous grind to get enough money to make more  bots, was easily  bearble and fun. This new crate reward system though, kills the fun in  the game.  I'd much rather be rewarded for my skill in a game on a definite  basis that I can predict.  I for one, cannot stand carrying my team, getting a protonium crate, and getting a bunch of blocks, and shields. Maybe  if FJ tweaked the robit prices of stuff, and possibly fix the loot crate isssue.  I could  consider staying on this game full time again,  and dropping some cash on it. But,  until then I think I am gonna be searching for another MMO Arena game.Before:  4/5Now: 1/5Will not recommend at all.			"

								Thank you freejam for destroying this diamond of a game completely. First the Schotgun and now this. Balance those weapons finally not make everything weaker. We need more ammo. What is the use of seven plasmaguns if i can fire only three pojectiles bevore running out of ammunition. Snipers are overpowered and so every game there are at leased four bots camping around and making it impossible to move 100 meters without beeing demolished. Smgs are shooting so slow and unprecise that it reminds me of a person with parkinsons desease tossig stones.Thanks to the new update almost all my bots are completely useless as i loved to build all kinds of planes an helicopters.  I think my 40 Euros and my 500 hours of gametime were wasted. The game was perfect as it was half a year ago. all weapons were basicly balanced and even the bots were basicly balanced in firepower and durability. All i wished for was more maps and more gamemodes like only planes.All in all my favorite indy game is now ruined.			"

								I may not be a super old or veteran player, but I feel entitled, as a paying costumer, to give my opinion about this game. Bad design choices, bad design choices everywhere. I won't go super detailed as some old veterans, like Juvar23, so I will just quickly comment on why I stopped recommending this game to my friends: The last update, Epic Loot, was a good idea. But they executed it in a manner that it feels like one of these mobile games with a life spam of 1-year or less, made to extract the biggest amount possible of money. It's unrewarding, it's relentless, it's not fitting for a game with the premise of BUILDING things. The issue is, the mind behind Freejam, Mark Simmons, is too dellusional over his own work to admit it's flaws, effectively leading the game to disaster. "

								Hello Players!I might be a bit biased in this review and no offence to the developers, but the game sucks. I could have given it a positive review a year ago, before the update. Before it was clear (Tiers). People played with people who are the same Tier as them, and the game was more or less balanced. I mean there was at least some balance. Of course there were some super donors who actually bought good stuff and played with you. Even if they killed you, that was fair enough. You cold just face it. And you could see by their blocks, colours and stuff how good they are and whether to evade them or fight them. The update messed up the game. Now, textures were removed, colours for each Tier block where removed and what? Yo can colour your Mark 10 (Tier 10) blocks white and everybody will attack you. And you just rek them. Also before GC (Galaxy Cash) had a higher value. You could buy a Megabot for like 5 dollars GC or could build a boog T7 for 10 euros. Like super mega Tier 7 or prebuilt magabot. Now, the cheapest crappest robot costs 30 euros, like a Call Of Duty or GTA V game. Tier system was messed up. Now worst players play with best players. Da hell? Your like T6 and a wild Megabot appears from somewhere and wrecks you, Lol? If you think differently comment. Sorry for biased opinion.Yours,Anton "

								Do I recommend this game: Hell yes.I have spent a good deal of the past few months on this game, and I can tell you that  by achieving 1000 hours of gameplay very recently, that this game is not the kind of indie you'd expect. The devs are always checking up on forums, responding to concerns, and helping in every way they possibly can to a several-thousand person player-base, with 15 devs running the place. They've gone to exceedingly long lengths to make this game balanced, and if any player out there gets into this game early, know this: all that fun you're having in the low tiers? Yeah, it only gets better from there :D.I honestly am extremely proud to say that my favorite game of all time has won indie of the year, and I cannot say it enough, thank you to all the people that make this game fun. ~~RC IS LOVE, RC IS LIFE~~			"

								It breaks my heart to write a bad review for this game. So much time and effort went into building and perfecting bots, talking the game up to friends and co-workers, and just playing the game. To keep it simple, Robocraft USED to be one of the best titles on steam in my opinion. It had a great player base, was different, and FUN.But the DEVs are so misguided. They're so afraid to hurt someone's feelings. Every update they release leaves us long time players lost. The new Game mode is garbage it allows players to hide behind a shield that the enemy can't shoot in. Removing the tier system completely broke match making. The new CPU cap made all my fine tuned bots unuseable. THe game is going south quick.It's almost like Robocraft has had it's left wing shot off while trying to plasma bomb someone and is now in a death spiral with no healer in sight.			"

								Back in the day, this game was amazing yet grindy. But the grindy was good as it was fun. There was no real ""meta"" as every gun had its own specific use. I remember the floaters with railguns, the sanic flyers, the gun beds with insane fire rates, and much more. The energy system started killing the game. Then more killed the game. And more. And more. And now here we are. Oh and the main thing. The ingame currancy was scrapped and they added a new one. With loot crates that HAD 1 ENTIRE ROW LOCKED FOR NON PREMIUM. I think they were rigged to have good stuff on the locked row to say **** you non premium user, you COULD have gotten those shiny guns but nope! YOU CAN HAVE THE TRASH ON TOP HAHA.Thats the game now.

								I liked this game.Then the full spectrum combat update happened.Now I'm disappointed.The tiering system gave you a sense of achievement when you managed to get to building a bot out of the next tier of parts. Different types of armor allowing you to put more importance on protecting THE SEAT by surrounding it with better armor in special patterns. But now there's no seat. No tech tree to upgrade how you want. No armor tiers to differentiate between the tough and the high-damage bots, or the higher tier, more expensive bots from those of lower tiers. NO SEAT WHICH WAS THE ENTIRE FOCUS OF HOW YOU BUILT THE BOT. Protecting your bot from damage is no longer top priority when there's no medic. The entire point of the railgun (aiming for the important part, the seat) is screwed. It's just so disappointing, and I don't know how they will be able to reverse this last update, if they ever do.RIP Robocraft "

								A nice concept, but terribly done. Maybe my opinion is tainted as i began playing long before all those new ''features'' were added, so let me compare the old robocraft to the new robocraft. But first let me say, this game is not bad, but i can't recommend it to you. It's free, so you might try it out, but there are a Lot better choices to try out if you don't have money and compared to those robocraft is just not worth the efford to download it.Building a robot is certainly as fun as always, probably even more, since new weapons and special abillities were added... playing with it not so much, especially since you barely gain any points to improve your robot any further. I am sorry, but there is no chance i will play for 10 days just to earn enough points for a single weapon. A few months back it was a whole lot easier, thus you could experiment a lot more and have a lot more fun.Instead now the game feels a lot like labour, instead of a fun game.And don't even get me started on health regen. How often have i shot someone into pieces, jsut for him to crawl behind cover and  get fully repaired within seconds. Why even focus on sniper or medic anymore? Cover is extremely expoitable, not only with the new health regeneration, but also with the new rocket launchers.(get behind cover, lock onto target THROUGH A SOLID ROCK, peekaboo and shoot, repeat)I am not the only one of my friends, others stopped playing, too, as they could not conform with these crappy changes screwing with the progression system and the balancing.

TL;DRThis game was great but it turned into a pay-to-win and most players become selfish because of the new updates.You needed some skills to build bots before but you can build complete nonsense now. The removal of tiers system is just bad.This game used to be fun when you actually needed to specialise in one class and cooperate with the whole team in order to win. You could earn money no matter what, then you could buy whatever you want for your bots and upgrade them. However, with the recent updates (the implementation of crates system and the ability to put mutiple classes of weapons onto one bot), people can just spam craps onto one bot and rush to the top of the scoreboard in order to get some slightly better♥♥♥♥♥♥ Most players become selfish and only focus on scores because only the top player on the scoreboard can get the protonium crate (better♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, you can't earn anything except crates and XP from battles (AKA no money and crate is basically everyting).The worst part is that even if you can get the protonium crate, you can still get cheap♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the items in it are distributed randomly and not performance-based. Normal players seldom get what they want from crates. You can still buy stuff, but they changed the in-game cash to robit which can only be obtained by destroying other stuff you own and it only gives very little amount of it, you can only get back 10-25% of what the original value is (you could get back 50% of the original value in the old system). Players can buy crates that cost real money and try to get what they want (even if they can't get what they want they can still destroy those buttloads of stuff from those buttloads of crates and buy whatever they want). This makes it really hard for new players who don't want to spend real money to upgrade their bots to higher level. And old players (me) usually bought everything they need from the good ol' days and good ol' system, which is extremely unfair to new players.The removal of pilot seat is also a really big mistake. The pilot seat allowed players to make something creative but reasonable because you needed to build something that could protect the pilot seat (basically you needed skills to build something). Now you can just build something completely ridiculous since there isn't a pilot seat anymore.I don't want to make this review too long so I will just say the removal of tiers system is just a really really poor decision.

								I need to retract a recent positive review of this game. This game used to be mediocre and now it is awful. It is as if the designers sat down in a meeting room and made a series of incomprehensible decisions on the premise that the game was too good and needed to be destroyed as soon as possible.1) The hexagonal tech tree is now completely linear. It is a straight line. It offers no choices anymore.2) The armor system has been flattened and offers no choices anymore. All chassis cubes are identical now. You have no options for strength or weight tradeoff anymore, other than to just layer on more armor.3) The autorepair mechanic is completely bogus and serves to further defeat careful and balanced robot design4) The plasma mortars have been horribly nerfed. Why? They were always slow and hard to aim, and now they are weak on top of that.It seems as if the latest game mechanics have been selected to dumb down the game and broaden its appeal, but what they have accomplished, instead, is to make it less fun. Then, in addition to that, as if the laser sights on railguns were not already useless enough to the point that your rail shots veer off in seemingly random directions for no discernable reason, the random hitches and pauses in the game further ensure that you will miss continuously until the point of ragequit. Terrible execution. Declining design values.			"

								Okay so Robocraft used to be a good game. That is as simple as I can make this. I used to love logging in and building robots and fighting against other people, seeing creativity and combat come together like some brilliant child fantasy of building things out of lego and smashing them together, or whatever. But seriously, what the f*** happened? After about 5 good games of robocraft I could walk away with on average around 200,000 to 500,000 in the game currency and buy loads of cool items and build loads of new robots with crazy designs. BUT. Now it's so disgusting, the entire combat sytem is somewhat still enjoyable, but now, you've got to be so good at the game to get some weird loot reward thing at the end of a match to get items that YOU DON'T EVEN WANT. I think in one game i was rewarded a 'protanium chest' or whatever (which i beleive is the best loot box you can get) and I got absolutely f*** all in it. I sold the crap from the box for abour 2,000 'Robits'. How the hell are new people playing the game supposed to get money to build a robot? I'm stuck with the three worst robots in exsistence and i can't do f*** all about it. I'm struggling to fight againts people who were lucky enough to have a good robot built before this 'apocalype' update occured. This game seriously needs to be fixed, like back to the way it used to be when you could actually get money to upgrade your bots and do well in matches so you can actually have fun. Honestly, the people behind this game are absolute idiots, they need to wake up and realise that what they are doing is putting players off completely. I do not recommend this game AT ALL. However I do recomend that you cry like a baby like me so that we players who USED to love the game can enjoy it once more. Thanks.			"

								Just being blunt about my review but i've started playing this game when it was first released on steam. It was fun and challenging since you had to protect your pilot seat from harm. The leveling up took a long time but it gave me and many others a sense of progress. Now its nothing more then a generic block construction game with guns minus the fun. The Tech tree isnt even a tree anymore. So no more getting to choose what you unlock first. The removal of tiers was ok to some extent but it made match making a bit more confusing in terms of figuring out what MK version of a gun/movement parts to use. Lastly, the removal of the pilot seat was honestly in my opinion the most stupid thing they could've done. It was a mechanic that forced people to think about block placement and encouraged ""creativity"" but now thats gone. everyone just throws a crap ton of blocks on and calls it a good robo. Oh, for vetern players who spent hours upon hours of playing the game to gather thousands of blocks to build thier megabots. All of that went to waste since FreeJam decided to remove all the blocks and give only a handful of basic blocks back and they made them dirt cheap. Way to go FreeJam, any more low blows like that and people might get the wrong idea when they try calling you over from the street corner. (( Also, I don't mind people commenting about my review but please keep this in mind. The comment section is for comments only, it is not a place for any sort of ""wars."" Any comments that are hostile or are just plain rude/uncalled for will be removed. ))			"

								Robocraft...........I can only say that it is among the single most fun mmo I have ever played. I have played alot of mmo's and they all suffer from the same thing.....Best Builds. A build or a set of builds that can beat all others in pvp and pve. Robocraft does not have this. Some builds are better then others in one thing and crappy in another. It is very much up to the player to decide how they want to play and while you can grab a tutorial or buy a bot (the pay to get bots are usually really crappy and serve mostly as a fun cosmetic thing rather than a viable build to play) there is trillions of ways to build a bot. I am almost in tier 10 myself and i have seen planes with wheels or cruisers that can hover. Tanks with legs and so much more.While there aren't many play modes each battle is different. One battle you will get utterly crushed and the next the timer click to 0 because you were too evenly matched and got a long battle. The variations in bots and tactics make it very fun. The devs are polite kind and helpful. Ususally offering a day of free premium every once in awhile. If the servers crash they work tirelessly to get them back up. They care about the players and seem pretty determined to avoid a pay 2 win model.But don't take my word for it, go in there and play fr yourself.......be warned though you will probably get addicted to it.

								My opinion after 50 hours about a year ago:The game has changed a lot.So much, that I'm not going to play it.The game used to be that you played the game, got in-game currency to buy parts, and then built whatever the hell you want. Now, it seems all the items are based on crates. ♥♥♥♥ing crates. I spent a long time grinding for guns and the like, armour, all that kind of stuff.Armour is gone. It's all encapsulated in one piece now.That armour was expensive. Definitely the most grindy thing, and it's gone. Same goes for electroplates, another ""form"" of armour. Damn expensive, and now its easy to get, seemingly.Medi-guns. Used to be REALLY EXPENSIVE, and I spent AGES grinding for three.Cheaper than a Tier 3 gun now, which they also renamed and incorporated into the crates system.Maybe I'm missing something, maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like FJ are treating their long time players in the middle of the pack ♥♥♥♥♥ily.I'm out.

								about 3 years ago, I first played Robocraft. I absolutely fell in love with it. Then, some things came up in my life, and I couldnt play for about 2 years. I saw the game how it was then, and I thought to myself, ""Man, this game took a turn for the worse,"" and seeing it now, I can honestly say that is the most accurate thing I've ever said. Would I reccoment this game today? Hell no. 3 years ago, I would be playing this game 4 hours a day, and I would love every second of it. Now, it amazes me how negatively this game has changed since my first game. I do enjoy the combat, but almost all of the core features that made the game unique were removed, changed, or just pushed away, being nullified by other mechanics added more recently. It was an absolutely astonishing game, until features like the crates were added, making the game very Pay-To-Win, instead of Play-To-Win. If Pay-To-Win features were removed, I would gladly make this review a thumbs up, but I guess you can't have a good free to play game without having something you must pay for. What a shame :(Edit: Corrected small typo			"

								Robocraft is actually extremely fun . . . sometimes.The idea of the game is great, and there are a lot of fun mechanics.  The developers release updates at faster pace than I've seen in almost any game ever, which is sort of a good thing.Except that so many of their updates seem so poorly thought out or untested.  Don't get me wrong, Robocraft is improving as a game over time, but every update is two steps forward, one step back.  Each update will release cool new features, and completely breaks something else.  The next will fix the previous issue, but break another part of the game.Currently, the biggest issue is probably the matchmaking.  Your robot can be placed in a match with robots with hugely better parts.  It completely ruins the game to spend hours carefully designing your bot, and months honing your piloting skills, only to have it get wrecked by a box on wheels because the box on wheels has guns that deal twice as much damage.I regularly get matched with robots that have over 10 times the ranking rating of mine.Matchmaking is not the only issue either, other issues include:-  Lack of voice chat, making communication and strategy with the team nearly impossible.-  Some very, very flawed map design.-  The medic tools heal faster than most guns can deal damage (unless at short range), which does not make for fun gameplay.-  The platoon system (which allows you to play with friends) is glitchy and has been for over a year, which is a long time compared to the very frequent updates this game gets.  It is starting to feel like the developers don't care that trying to play with friends can be a huge pain.-  The main game mode, battle arena, has some weird mechanics that make for a very strange and not very interesting meta-game.-  Robots take too long to kill, especially in the early game.-  Respawn times are too short (<10 seconds) early on in a match, although they do reach more reasonable times after a while.-  Players frequently abandon the game.  To be fair, sometime it's not their fault and their game crashed.  This often makes matches uneven (like a 6 v 8).  The game tries to balance this by reducing the smaller team's respawn times, but reduced respawn times don't help the smaller team, they just make it take longer for them to lose.If anyone doesn't understand or agree with something I said in this review I can try to explain in more detail.  Some of the issues are hard to explain in simple point form because it's more like a net of complex problems that exacerbate each other.Despite the long list of issues, Robocraft is very fun when the matchmaking places you in a fair match.  None of the other issues completely ruin a match like the terrible matchmaking can.  This review will remain negative until players are being put into fair fights.If the matchmaking is fixed (and another game-breaking issue isn't introduced) in the next update and I forget to update this review, message me or leave a comment and I will.

								I seriously love this game and with the new patch nobody can say, that this game is ""pay to win"" (it wasn't even before). I spend lots of time with this game and I am now in tier 7. I haven't paid any money yet but I am considering because the game brought me lots of joy. It is not only about the PvP part but also about the building part, trying to make the best out of your bot. There are 4 different classes of weapons which make it quiet interesting. In the first two tiers it can sometimes be a little frustrating, especially if you don't have a good design but that should only make you wanna build a better one ;)For everybody who like PvP this is a must-try and for everybody who wants to find the engineer inside himself, it is too :)			"

								I used to love this game. Used.The reason I hate this game now is because its too ""happy"". The game used to be hard, it used to be intense. One shot could screw you over and made you think about the design, its practicality and its firepower, so when the update came with the base-shields and respawns came I wasn't happy but I made do. It still had part of the thrill, but I made the mistake of leaving for a while... and came back to this.""only certain ranks can do this"" ""Share your robots online"" ""sorry, but we are limiting your CPU"" and the tech tree update was the final straw. There was no effort, there was no grind, there was no specilisation. You could spend hours building an indestructible machine, only to find out a 10 year old who just started bought a better one. And the waiting times are hideous.I might not have played that much compared to others, but I loved this game. It was simply something I could pop in and out whenever I wanted or got bored, but now thats changed. There is no exitement, no point on balancing the robot with armor when you could just respawn, hide, or snipe. Arotyermander out. Don't ask about the name. Oh, and also I hear tell of how they removed the bloody pilot seat, though I have no idea if this is true because i'm not going back in to that hellhole and I am sure as hell not gonna bother going through the updates as I might have to shed more tears then I want too, anyways the pilot seat was the center of the game, the whole damn reason you progressed up the armor tech tree(Pre-crap update) and the whole reason you had to be tactical about the design and spend hours perfecting it. Thats like taking away the command centre in a RTS game or level-locked gear in an MMO. It breaks the game.Oh, another update. Joy.Apparently they've added ""Loot Crates""Plz im desperate, tell me someone else is remaking Robocraft back to its original form so I can move on from this ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and have fun with this kind of game again.

								If you are the tl;dr tipe of guyNew update killed and broke the game and made it unfair and boring, when it was ok.Now if you want to know why, then read below for why it is not really good anymoreThe last update has killed the game i loved and played everyday, now everyone got op guns, money is impossible to get with the loot you receive in the new crate sistem, yeah you dont get money you have to sell these things you usually wanted but now you have to sell to get some op weapons to defend yourself from other op robots, but with the money i had i could only get 2 proto seekeers, that i really wanted to get back then, but now these are just nerf guns with autoaim.Try to kill some robots now and you will probably get shot gunned in the face and snipped in the back , i tried to see if my robot was too op or something that i only could fight againts highly ranked players just to see that even the lowest level guys could get some op weapons from the now bugged robot store.After getting killed 100 times just killing one guy who was almost destroyed that i saw alone and being snipped after killing him and then killing me 30 more times for the lulz and then destroying the core with the entire team without a single chance to defend or attack, you get a rusty, silver, diamond or a cobalt crate, (looks like the cobalt crate has the better loot) you get the same loot if you win or lose and you get some parts that you could have bought from the store very cheap before they changed the in-game money ( now you can just sell to get some money for some better weapons, i hope you had a lvl 100 robot back then when everything was fine because you wouldn't get anything more after that unless you have lot of things to sell). And the robot store is bugged now , now you can get colo/u/rs and designs from there free, if you have all the parts the robot have, now you can see bugged prices and lots of robots you can just copy and not give a single one to the guy who made that, well i dont really know what where they thinking on that one, they wanted to have less cloned robots? or they made it just to not give a single thing to these beggars who just place one block and cry for money, and also these creative guys that made some awesome robots that really deserve it.I hope they don't really throw their game in the trash now that they are making a new one and they fix it to be playable and fun like it was before.

								I have well over 2000 hours into this game, and I've spent plenty of $$ on premium, and I've dutifully put up with the hotfixes and updates Freejam has thrown our way, but with the latest update, frankly they just crapped all over this game and sucked all the fun out of it. You used to be able to work your way up the tech ladder, unlocking professively more powerful components and weapons. Premium got you some paint colors and some extra points, but there was very little dileneation between premium and non-premium.What happens now is that you now just get random loot crates, which are mostly full of crap you don't need or want. Do you actually want two plasma guns? Hope you can grind long enough to actually get two. I have no idea what this game has become other than a pay for play pile of dung. I used to love this game, love crafing my bot, love testing it against other players who loved the same things. That's all irrelevant now, so I have to recommend you play absolutely anything else. See ya Robocraft, was nice knowing you.			"

								So, Freejam has doubled down on the concept that keeps losing them lots of players. Continuing to ignore the community. Get rid of the RNG! Bring back the old shop, RP and GC. Revert to the old matchmaking stragegies, and oh hell, bring back the tier system again! Veteran players would end up playing with veterans. Newbies would be given the chance to learn and not just get constantly stomped on.The latest patch continues the lunacy. Buying DLC  or paying money in game leaves you at the mercy of the RNG! Way to stick it to your paying customers who were dumb enough to pay money. Bravo, Freejam! Hats off to you!I keep checking back every week or so, hoping (stupidly) that something changed for the better. Sadly I think I'm done with the game. Wasting time checking, hoping to see improvements is just that, a waste of time. I think I need the hard drive space for something more useful like... clip-art, or maybe audio books about minecraft. I hope the uninstaller isn't driven by the RNG. Hey, that's another way you can screw over your paying customers. Woe be to the newbie that is stupid enough to try the game out. Uninstalling...***Previous Review Below***The last update (EPIC LOOT)  just ruined the game. The previous update was almost perfect. Was one of my favorite games, now possibly not worth the time.The Good:- Possibly one of the best build and fight games out there. Lots of possibilities for robot construction.- Great players. Can be very punishing if you are new. But ultimately good to help you learn.- You are forced to bring your A-Game. Good bot construction, good strategy, and good teamwork and planning.- You have to think on your feet, or you'll be spending most of the time waiting to respawn. Cover, position, speed and stealth mean just as much as skill, bot construction and weapons loadout.The Bad:- All weapon, movement and special blocks now cost more relative to previous releases. - Money was removed in exchange for Robits and you accumulate those at a significantly decreased rate.- Loot relies heavily on RNG and the loot tables are poor at best. They could be tweaked for better gear to improve rewards, but the way they are now, they're very poor.- New players will struggle to build up an arsenal that will have them competative with endgame players. Ultimately I think this will stifle entry of new players.- Ranking system and matching system are broken. Players with very low level (low CPU and poor construction) are getting eaten alive in those matches probably resulting in a very bad experience for them. - The energy mechanic means you'll be shooting less (probably less load on the servers), but it is a lot less satisfying now than just opening up your entire loadout on an enemy and completely decimating them. - Oh yeah, and with the slow Robit accumulation, good luck forging that Power Booster you now need to run most of your builds.The Ugly:- The ""epic loot"" you get is anything but. Most of the loot you get, even when you're on a winning streak just maybe a few blocks that you don't need. Once in about maybe 30 games you get a legendary that comes up and even then you need to subscribe to VIP to get that.Ultimately, spending money on the game isn't worth it at all. You have to put up with the random number generator (RNG) to give you gear. After having bought 12 protonium crates (i had a bit of money left in my account), I got 1 useless legendary, 2 useless epics, aabout 10 rares that I already had and a bunch of blocks that are ultimately wortheless. What I'm saying is that with the current loot tables, even the best crates grant mostly useless loot. Using money is now worthless.Grinding for gear at such a slow rate will ultimately alienate new players and just frustrate long time supporters like myself. It is unfortunate that the game has reached this state, however, it is fixable.1) Tweak the loot tables so that the higher quality loot boxes really do give loot that's valueable.2) Increase the loot table floor so that even losing matches more quickly accumulate robits.3) You could lower robit prices.4) Make more decoration/customization items that are valueable or useful in order to increase more real/money purchases.5) Make visual customizations VIP only or more expensive (many won't agree with me on this, but if you really want to make your bot LOOK kick♥♥♥♥♥ hey shell out a little).6) Or you could just revert to the old mechanic of credits and GC.Overall, it's a better game when you're playing with other bots that are designed well. That means giving people a better way to get equipment that's useful. Make it so if you want a beautiful looking bot, cash is necessary.Hopefully FreeJam will get their act together and either tweak the loot tables, or revert partially to the last update. Still possibly good to play if you have already saved up enough gear to outfit all your bots. But for those of us still building up, it's frustrating. (edited for spelling, and to confirm that buying protonium crates are mostly useless)			"

								Robocraft is a constantly changing game were starmade and world of tanks feel like they had a child. Pros:+You get to build your own vehicle, making your immagination important to gameplay+Game feels unique and unlike others+Running requirments are low+Any design choice can have benifits and drawbacks+Weapons all feel different+Many ways to move your design are offered+Maps feel a bit unique+No pay to win issues+Frequent updatesCons:-Armour block heavy designs tend to die faster than what you would think (outdated)-SMG's have been nerfed to the point were they dont feel like they can do there old jobs now. (outdated as of 30/06/2016)-Some of the game modes feel rather unbalanced-Medics determine the out come of matches a little too heavily (outdated)-Game balance seams to change faster than you can adapt your design at times-Premium account needed inorder to make rapid progress-Requires comitment to feel fun, do to frequent game changesSummary:This is a good game, don't get me wrong. Its just that there seams to often be a lack of sustaned game balance. One day, something is added and seams to make designs invulnerable, and the very next day, the opposite is true. There is often no middle ground. All that said, I still like this game. The unique and original feel helps here. Overal, this game deserves a 8.5/10.EDIT: I would like to add here an additional final thought. While a lot of community back lash has occured as of late, I still have faith in the developers for the most part. Having been playing since the days when this game had repair costs (pay to win issues where much more prevelent back then), I feel I know what im talking about. I do however, believe that the loot crate system, while nice, does need a few touch ups.			"

								A fantastic game for anyone with a creative mind. Build anything you want and throw it into the battlefield with about anything you could not expect to fight. Maybe a giant darth vader with laser machine guns against a giant flying pirate ship? Yup it happened.The game does however require a huge amount of grinding to unlock new types of blocks to build your robots with, which willl take a lot of time to acquire.Pro:- Do anything with anything! Very few limits- Tons of different types of weapons & blocks to try out- Active devs with tons of big updatesCon:- Grind, grind and some more grind- Balancing, getting hit and killed by one shot from the other side of the map is not very funny- Expensive premium content (not by any means neccesary to play the game, but it is quite expensive anyway)			"

								The major 'Epic Loot' update makes the game completely unbalanced and unplayable. The community has gone up in arms about it and still Freejam refuse to do anything about it. They have completely monetised the game so now it is basically a pay2win system.Example:A bug occurred where people were getting too many 'crates (items)' after battling, which meant they could progress faster... Freejam fixed this immediately.A bug then occurred where people where getting no crates whatsoever after any battle, effectively halting the game. Freejam decided to eventually fix this after 5 days or so.I used to love this game so much, but they have ruined it and are too busy sitting around with dollar signs in their eyes to balance and make it better.

								After clocking up 135 hours and greatly enjoying it, my opinion has swayed over the past few months. Changes which break builds, tactics and so on and force you to learn, I expect but not to the extent and frequency to which updates have been released, infact, I enjoy it! The need to learn and develop new skills and builds is good, previous exploits fixed, broken builds, tactics, bugs and so on, fixed and balanced. Now however, the motivation to go back has completely dwindled now as each update for a good while has reaped the same problems over and over. No longer do I hear about good matches, interesting builds or tactics but rather cheap builds which really shouldn't work at all like rectangles covered in boosters. I understand the game is early access and aspects of it can change drastically but over the past few months updates have been changing the game over and over in such a drastic and reckless manner and too frequently. It seems if people complain enough about how ""Snipers are OP"" and how they get slaughtered when an SMG gets close then an update will mess up the statistics of those builds, raising the power of other builds too much and just recycling issues instead of finding and maintaining a balance.This game was fun, particularly when playing with a few people you knew, you could co-ordinate and compliment each others builds or make something special. Now, all that seems lost, I don't want to learn what works now since it just isn't enjoyable anymore and if I learned again, how long would it be before that knowledge is scrapped again?Perhaps new players will have fun playing the game and learning and having fun in its current state, but if they keep changing it, I fear the cycle will repeat with longtime players and groups quiting and eventually this game may die out. There's still time to save it but I feel too many players have given up that it may never recover if large, calculated steps are taken to improve the game and content an to welcome veterans once again.What I can still say for this game is its free to play model is excellent (Atleast the last time I played 25/07/15) there's no P2W, any part for your bot which costs real money is identical in stats to their regular counterpart or are purely cosmetic like a flag. There's a premium option which I believe awarded double RP and allowed for platoons of 3 or 4 players. Extra garage slots could be purchased for a reasonable price but you still had a handful if you didn't want to invest and premium bots were available which really just let you skip ahead in the tech tree and sometimes provided unique cosmetics. I never felt pushed or like I needed to spend money, I spent it because I enjoyed the game.Perhaps in the future I may try this game once again but I don't have high hopes. If you play it then be aware of the issues some of us have pointed out in our reviews and be prepared to re-learn if you play long enough but for now, this game will gather dust in my library until I decide something better could use the room it currently lingers in.

It's not as fun to play as it used to be and now in beta has less players than in early alpha. Always remember where you came from Robocraft... always...			"

								Used to be fun and innovative in the beginning but now every update is taking increasingly big steps towards a bad pay-to-win scenario.Under these conditions I can't recommend it any more.I played Robocraft since the very early alpha version in april - quite some time before it came to steam and followed the developement process ever since.Even though you can get the same stuff by buying it or unlocking it only by playing, several updates made it more and more tedious to unlock parts and grind for credits to buy them. In contrast by paying real money, you can have them instantly. Since this does give you a significant advantage and matches are not only fought within the same tiers this is one of many possible ways, pay2win can manifest.If it was just a quicker unlock I would not even mind too much - that's how it was from the very beginning but the change that ruined it for me the most is that robots now have to get repaired after every fight with ingame or bought credits. You can run bankrupt and end up having to choose between starting all over on a low tier, selling all your parts for 1/3rd of the original price, spending a lot of time designing a new robot from scratch and grinding for credits or just buying the credits for cash.

								This game used to be a nice game. NOT ANYMORE.when i first started to play this game u could do things in differnet ways. There were different kind of weapons and that allowed u to build different types of robots. With every update they made it so less and less options were viable. Meaning that u can still use different aproaches, but with the exception of a few ones, ull probably lose.Apart from that, its become a money maker. this means u can no longer get the things u want unless u pay. And even then, u'll probably not get them.Well done Freejam. I wont be playing ur game anymore!			"

								Stay away from this game, it is not newbie friendly, it is not vet friendly. As a new player you face nothing but seal clubbing, as a vet you face huge sweeping changes that invalidate your thousands of hours. Hell, if you joined this game a month ago and got just a hundred hours in, all that time got invalidated, they practically hit the reset all accounts button.To preface this: currently as of writing the devs of this game have added crates that you pay for by the bunch that randomly unlock parts, in these crates you mostly get worthless items such as building blocks, and once in a great great great while do you get anything worthwhile. After opening about 100 crates from matches (You get one per match) I got roughly 1 max tier item, about 3 rare items, and the rest were common items (blocks). You can sell things for about 10% of what you have to build them for, so if you want one gun of a different tier, you have to sell 10 guns of another type (aka 10 max tier smgs = 1 plasma gun), but to get these drops is nearly impossible without thousands of crates, WITH PREIMUM.In the previous patch all parts were insanely expensive, so you had to keep a small inventory while making a bunch of frames made out of blocks while swapping around parts which grows tedious. The devs tried to get people to get so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at farming forever for a single gun, they simply spend money on the gun. That didn’t work, and only generated animosity.This game is now going down a much darker road of taking advantage of middle aged people, and younger children with access to parental money (the two groups most likely to suffer from gambling additions). That second group has lost a lot of staying power over the years, but the first one has grown much more common and plays this game much more often while gambling constantly. The devs of this game are taking advantage of children and weak willed adults with addictions and children.They missed the most critical component to this steam game gambling addition; people gamble because they want to spend money in hopes of getting something back of more value then what they spent, Guess what, the parts in game cannot be solid on the market place (yet). It works in TF2 because real money auction, it works in CS:GO for much the same reason, it works in all valve games because of steam's market place. So people wasting tons of money get nothing but parts in return, so it is 100% money lost.The next obvious step for the devs is to add cosmetic skins, or just add straight up weapons to the steam market place so you can buy power instantly. This review is going to call it first, you heard it here first folks they WILL do this.The devs of this game routinely ignore their player base no matter how many people say the same thing and desire the same change, no matter how well you word things, no matter how well you write, or even if your suggestion is amazing. They could implement tiny changes with huge results. They ignore the high-impact low-hanging fruit constantly in favor of implementing wild huge game changing updates. Most recently gaming crates mixed with “you get the same chance reward at all levels” and match making worse than it’s ever been: Robots are purely matched by how many points they cost. Guess what that translates into, vets of the game making extremely efficient, extremely small low-cost robots to get placed into matches with new players that barely understand how the game works.EDIT: Ahahaha oh wow. So before you could buy a single day of premium right? Let's say the second, locked section of a crate you get has some good item in it you want. You can open up the shop and buy premium to get it. Well, they use to sell a day for about a bit over a dollar, but they have removed the option to buy a day, and now you can only buy three days for much more at a much higher cost. Soon they will get rid of that too making you buy 5 and 7 day packages for your item. :^)			"

								This game sucks. Reason?Rant incoming A few years ago you were able to earn money and buy items for a reasonable price. Now you have a moderate weapon for 100K dust.(?) However you can sell it for a FIFTH of it's price. 100,000 / 5 = 20,000 . A few years ago it was half the price. Buy a moderate weapon for 5-10K (what seems like) coins and sell it for 2.5 - 5K coins.I don't have great memory of what is was like a few years ago but it was way better.  Ranking. Today it is average CPU. A few years ago 0 - 500 CPU formed one tier, 500 - 1000 formed the second tier. etc. Unlocks. Today when you start the game you can buy crates and then take the best of it for yourself, sell the rest of it and get something OP, fight, level up, add more OP things and be a scumbag. A few years ago, same level system. Except the fact that you had to choose what you unlocked and then buy the things. It was changed to be level unlocks. Reach X level and unlock X item(s). MEGABOTS! They were gragefully removed in one swoop. I never got to try one out but you can go watch some old Robocraft vids to know hwat they were like.Also. WHY AND HOW THE F*CK IS THIS GAME STILL IN EARLY ACCESS. MOST GAMES ARE EARLY ACCESS FOR A YEAR AT MOST BUT NO! THIS GAME WILL BE IN EARLY ACCESS FOR THE REST OF THE MILLENIA. *ahem* sorry for the rantIf there are any grammar mistake i'm sorry but i'm only a non native english speaker.			"

								Biggest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Literally, one of the worst as of current. It was great, when it released. It was fun, fair, and was easy enough to progress through the game. And it got better, and better, more ways to move, more weapons, more balancing. Then, things went south. And hard. There was a once upon a time where you literally couldn't fight your vehicle, unless every single block and weapon was of the exact same tier. This made artistic bots, or just bots people were slowly upgrading impossible to play. Then they removed it, so, good, right? Not really. Skip a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you come to today. Where all blocks are the exact same, and after the update, if you had thousands of high-level blocks, that, from where I stopped, at tier 7, cost around 50k per block, and that's not even tier 10 or mega blocks, you get NO compensation for it. You got your blocks, but guess what? There are all the exact same and you get nothing for the amount of time and money you spent on them. Garage slots are now free, and you got your premium currency back, but it's not enough. They added a paint gun, which is cool, right? Paint all your vehicles nicely. Uh, no. You get 4 colors and need premium for 12 more colors. You get white, blue, orange, and grey. Not a lot. So to sum it up. Even for free, don't download. Get minecraft and get mods. Tons more fun.			"

								Pros: Nice gameplay - although its very unbalanced at the moment (as of 18.05.2016), eg. One weapon dominates all others and is therefore used by most players. It is heading in the right direction, I hope.Cons: Economy - Alot of grind is necessary to build one bot. Since patch 'Epic Loot' (28.4.2016) the economy got a massive nerf. Especially in the ability to sell things.Although the gameplay can be alot of fun at times and alowes much freedom to build and test and perfect your own weapon systems on wheels, it is in the moment (as of 18.05.2016) extremely punishing for people who become so called PRO players.This is because the reward system doesn't reward player action but instead gives players some sort of lottery tickets which have a chance of a reward.You have to put in a minimum of 200+ hours to be able to build everything you like.This game has alot of potential and can become great in the future.

								 So this game was alot of fun in 2014 and 2015 then 2016 came along and changed everything. First of all i would like to say that balancing in this game changed alot and not for the better.Normal mode and Basic mode are just getting worse and worse.You constantly get matched up against people who have legendary tier weapons such as the goliath.I just decided today to try the game again and give it another chance,but matchmaking on this game is terrible so now a what we used to call a tier 1 robot gets hammered by what we use to call back in the good old days a T6 or T8.They have implemented a new matchmaking system that is now like leagues,however I think this a terrible idea as this allows what i said earlier to exist.People will start beggining to fake losses to battle the newbs  who  just started 10 mins ago.There used to be a barrier between the pros and begginers and you would be matched against people the same tier as you or 1 higher or lower. The weapon balancing has ruined the plasma launchers as if they good and easy to use as before.Before you could shoot all of your plasma launchers at once which was good as they barely did damage to the enemy robot.Now you shoot one at a time and their damage is still crap. The crate system was okay but people have found out you can grind the play against AI for good loot.Another thing is normal mode was completly changed from attack the enemy base to drive on 3 big circles to charge up yor base and the first one to 100% wins.This game is also P2W as people with money can buy crates to get better loot or they can spend money to get ingame currency so they can buy the best robot in the factory.I wish the devolpers will realise their mistakes and MAKE ROBOCRAFT GREAT AGAIN			"

								A while back I would've recommended this game thoroughly. It was an excellent and creative game that allowed you to test your best designs against that of other players to see who is the victor and flecks of robot fly about the map!Sadly however the new""update"" to the game has killed off any love I had for it...The new main gamemode (classic is still and option but for severly reduced credits) has players shooting at cap points in an attempt to destroy the enemies main hub, Not so bad eh? Well here lies the problem, there is now respawning as opposed to the one and done mechanic previously. This has led to a lot of players taking the paths of least resistance as there is no fear of death, no more is there marvellous creations and ingenious designs to maximise longevity on the battlefield. Now the current 'Best plan' appears to make spazzy flyers covered in electroplates and smgs, if you die so what? you can just respawn and annoy people all over again.This respawn feature also removes any hope of a quick game of robocraft as games now last up to half an hours on average (kinda like a MOBA huh?)Also like a MOBA is the idea of 'Overclocks', these are basically levels that a players gains for killing, capping ect and this is probably the main thing that upsets me about the current game. People snowball and they snowball hard, you can quite happily just sit on a hill and snipe your way to victory, so what if people attempt to confront you? Your higher level basically negates their hard thought design and you can just happily tank their low damage attacks until your rail is recharged...So in summary, the game as is stand is a mere husk of a previously awesome game. And if the developers where to return to such a game I would be all ears, however as it stands I cannot endorse this game. It's trying to be something that nobody wants it to be :(			"

								TL:DR - Get it if you have nothing better to play. Otherwise, move on.Back when i first started playing this, about 2 years ago, this game was actually pretty neat. It was 'Robocraft'. You build your bots, go into battle, get RP, buy more parts and improve your bot. You could go into a battle and see unique bots all over. Some sucked. Some were OP. Some were simply ridiculous.Fast forward to now. With the CRF introduced, it's not so much Robocraft as it is Robo'copy-n-paste'. I see one awesome design in one match. Cool. Next match i see a similar design but with rearranged electroplates. Then i see one with different weapons. Suffice to say, people aren't as encouraged to build their own bots as they were pre-CRF. Still not that bad. I mean, they can copy the bots but i'm still building mine from scratch.The addition of Flaks, and all updates henceforth, spelt the death of this game. Current state of the game? Build a tanky ground bot, or get rekt (buy big shotgun). Build a small and fast flyer that is capable of retreating easily, or get rekt (by big flak cannon). The number of 'viable' builds in the game has been greatly limited to giant ground tank, or small/fast flyer. No more flying tanks. No minimen. It's just, for lack of a better word, pathetic. Flaks just knock you down no matter how tanky your plane is. An easy fix for this would be if FreeJam did something sensible and, a) decreased flak firerate or b) decreased the damage. But it's FreeJam, when've they ever listened to player input? Thank god for FreeJam that the LOML (Lock-on Missile Launcher) isnt too bad after recent nerfs. Not even gonna get started on the shotgun.INB4 ""Make better bots you noob""Fair point. Maybe i should make better bots. Now i just need more cu-- NOPE. In order to get cubes/weapons/parts, i'll need to head into battle. In order to get good stuff i need to place high up. To place high up, i'll need... oh no... a better bot!!11!?!?!?1? See where i'm going? With the old RP system, I could've easily gone into battle, farmed cash, then bought whatever i needed at the time. Now i play with a sh17b07, get low rank, then get more sh17 to place on sh17b07. Oh how do i get out of this loop? :c. By spending cash on the stacks of protonium boxes obviously (which i'll note, does not guarantee at least one decent item).End of Review/Rant/Rantview - FreeJam needs help. Whatever they're trying, or tried, to make of this game is far out of sight, and can never be reached because they took the wrong train to crapland.			"

								The game itself is actually real fun, there are good-looking items, an interesting game concept and pretty much endless possibilities of building and customizing your own robot. There is nothing bad about that part,but there seem to be some serious issues to me, such as the reward and balancing system:I barely get any XP or RP (currency) from successful runs (= double reward), even when healing megabots about 7000 HP, it's not even getting anywhere near 1/10 of my current level.The other problem is really overweighing the previous one though, having a rank 7000 robot, I'm being put together with others whose robots are way stronger, such as some people with Rocket Launchers, of which one alone got a ranking of 15000, having at least twice of my ranking. Thus about 90% of all my runs are having me face op enemies which can easily take me out with overleveled items, resulting in being killed and removing all fun from the game most of the time.			"

								Sadly, the recent changes to this game have created a system where teamplay, thoughtful design or even attempts at strategic gameplay are heavily penalised.The only way to win is to out-troll the trolls; the second the odds turn against you you may as well give up.To make matters worse, you no longer can simply grind your way to a given type of weapon or robot reliably -- previously you could predict how many games you would have to play at the absolute worst to get something; now it's plain impossible as you can not predict what kind of reward you will get overall.This game has turned from a free-to-play, competitive shooter that rewarded skill and planning to one that rewards a fat wallet and nothing else.

								I spent so many hours with this masterpiece, making a vary types of things including but not limited to- a bird, a flying ship from Treasure Planet, Star Wars X-Fighters, and many more. This game is like a minecraft, but with an ability to create a robots/vehicles and destroy other players' creations!I will give this 10/10 for sure.What's better yet- this a truely a free PVP games. There is no P2W of such sort- its all depends on your creations!			"

								***DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME***Devs are terrible, by ""balancing the game"" They remove the only way to get money easily, make you pay for colors, and add LOCK ON MISSILES and uzi guns, and anti air cannons. They also remove the ability to fire all of one type of gun, causeing you to spam the numberkeys to fire like a freaking moba. WHICH THEY ADDED. moba mode is a  game mode where you capture towers and destroy their base. if gives good money, but the games are 10-30 min+. All the weapons cost around 200,000RP, one 30 minute match gets you around 90,000 if you lose, most of the time causing you to grind for hours upon hours to get a good ""bot""           It wasnt always this way, the game used to be super fair, fun, and the people on it didnt steal each others work. **sorry rosefall, but i see your bots WAY too much**. The megabots update was incredible, it added a new challenge, a way to get massive amounts of money, and once you got there it was a last. After seeing how happy people were, the demons at freejam then decided to remove them as it was making TDM ""unbalanced"". Now all you see is missile carriers with lock on craps, and practicly invinsible bots that only focus on shielding and spamming the new uzi gun. If freejam really wants their fans and supporters back, they will actually makde the game balanced. REMOVE THE LOCK ON GUNS, add back a way for steady income, and make sure their updates wont upset 70% of the people playing this game.			"

								I have been playing the game for 2-3 years. I have seen the ups and downs of Robocraft. The devs have completely destroyed the game. I dont know why people still play it. I bet you money if they reverted it back to what it was 1-2 years ago the game would be FUN! The new Forge system has broken everything. What need is there to acctually rank up now? Other than CPU? I would battle for Tech Points so I could get the next amazing gun that had been introduced into the game. Those were the good days. But right now Robocraft isnt in a good state and if your a new player stay away for now.			"

								This game was once good. now it's really bad, few simple examples: 1. Such colors like RED YELLOW BLUE GREEN PURPLE ORANGE and BLACK now aren't availible for non-premium users.2. Previously you could craft whatever you want, now we have forced LOOT CRATE system, even the best crates have complete garbage in them 90% of the time, so building is really random and complicated now.3. Devs don't care about veteran players, they want new players to install this ""free"" game and donate as many as they could, this is their official main goal.If you want fun and creative game, this isn't what you seek.

								I played this game a year and a half ago, and I didn't like it as a personal preference. Recently, I started playing it again and it was awesome. I enjoyed it a lot and it was one of my favourite games. Unfortunatly, a recent update (epic loot) completly destroyed my enjoyment for the game. First of all, they reset the GC which means all of the real money you spent on it, you don't get back AND you don't get refunds. So if you spent over £100 on this game, that's completely gone. Also, they removed RP and replaced it with this dust thingy which you don't get from finishing games, but ONLY from selling cubes. EDIT:Although I have only mentioned negative points above, there is one good thing: crates. I think the idea of crates was a good idea but you should get dust from finishing each game too.			"

								Fun game to play on equal grounds BUT new people going against veterans is highly unfair. Match making is totally useless where your oppositions already have legendary or better weapons than you do. Editing your robot and doing the final testing is also a total lie. Runs perfect on the testing but in actual game play, your unit screws around either the robot is slower, hover gets unbalanced/to much lift.The 2 BIGGEST CHEAT of all is....most weapons cannot do much damage on high altitude planes or hiding in the centre building where NO ONE can touch them. Tesla weapons do damage on you BEFORE they even make contact.Overall opinion that this game and the idiot developers really messed it up and WILL NOT recommend any friends or people to play this half♥♥♥♥♥game to anyone.

								Today, I'll be reviewing Robocraft, or what is left from it after the amount of updates to make devs more money.So to start this off, Robocraft was a great game -- I played it a long time ago when there were Tiers. The system worked like this: You buy an item, the item has ""robot ranking"", if your robot ranking is high enough, you advance to next ""tier"", where only bots from the same tier are (or from higher if you had a party). The way the money worked was pretty straight forward -- you can buy with real money special points which can get you anything from tech points to the weapons you cant afford, but as much as I can say it was pretty balanced and not pay2win.The system is currently really terrible because of multiple reasons: Pretty much you can share your robot. Don't take this the wrong way -- it's a nice touch that you can try other player's, but this pretty much killed the must for building your own.So much stuff was changed -- tech tree was completelly removed so now everyone can buy anything. This means you can get against yourself 5 lock-on missile launchers that are pretty much undodgable, unless you have an obstacle between you and the robot that shoots them. The thing I loved in old robocraft was the amount of free premium codes -- there were so many premium codes for free to help you climb. I feel like it's rare to have any currently. The most terrible thing however is, that you no longer drop raw money from battles -- depending on your position in ladder you get a box that varies on rarity, obviouslly the better you play the better you get. To get most money devs made it that you get 4-8 items, but half of them are ONLY for premium users -- what has actually happened to me was getting multiple legendaries, why is that bad? They were all in the premium-only section and I didn't have premium.tl:dr - The devs ruined this game from its original version, which was playable without tons of pay2win content.			"

								Once upon a time, this was a good game.  And it could be a good game again.  But, the developers inexplicably put a limit on bots going into the best game modes.  Instead of tiers, they added a ""we'll rank your robot and you'll get into battles faster.""  It didn't really do a lot to help the queue times, but it was okay.  Then they said, ""Ahh, we can make this faster if nobody can play.""  So they require a rank in excess of 30 MILLION to get into the good game mode.  As a level 93 player (out of 100), my bot comes in at a hefty.... 3 million.  My friend I play this with most often is max level.  His bots?  3-4 million.  Just for fun, he sold all of his bots, bought the highest level stuff he could, and still doesn't make it into the 30 million range.  So, what's the solution?  I suspect the answer is that Robo wants to be a ""Free to play (1 game mode), but pay to play the good ones.""  They want to be in the free world and still get money by making you buy bots high enough to play.  This game is now dead to me.  Unless they remove the limits, I see no reason to ever go back.TL;DR:  Don't waste your time.  The game used to be good, but the devs do wildly unpredictable and nonsensical things that can completely ruin the game without warning.			"

Just isn't fun anymore.The game was solid some time ago, I enjoyed making things, taking account of the weight of blocks, carefully designing the robot, reached something along the lines of T7.Now they just stripped me off of my robots, getting stuff is painstakingly long, so to get lootboxes you need to win against people who put more time on it and that have better weapons, weapons which take time to get.Lootboxes are done wrong, I mean come on, I'm already getting things I don't want, why do you need to shove it on my face that I have to be premium to get something I might need? If lootboxes worked for say, Overwatch, it's because it's progression system isn't based on it, bring back the easier to get money; this is just disappointing.			"

								In light of all the negativity going around with regards to recent changes to this game, I've been hesitant to write my own critical review for fear of being influenced by the negativity of others. However, recently Freejam released a State of the Game article, which you can read on robocraftgame.com. This article, which I had hoped would be used as an opportunity for the devs to adress the major concerns myself and a large portion of this community have with the most recent major update to Robocraft, instead comes off as an attempt to move the community forward and distract players from the flaws with the current game. Admitidly it does adress the problems players have been having with matchmaking, but it doesn't offer many if any concrete solutions to the very specific problems which many have been pointing out in the weeks since the Epic Loot update, especially with regards to the in game economy and progression system. In light of this, I see no signs of this game deviating from it's present course heading straight for a cliff, and as such do not recommend it.			"

								Why should you read my review? The game is completely messed up. Loot crates ruined everything, money is impossible to get now.The worst thing about loot/crates system is that it was done wrong.In a normal game, what do you expect from a ""Silver Crate""?Normally, a normal gun and some cool gadget, right?Welcome to Robocraft, where the best crates will probably give you a bunch of blocks.Each one gives you  20 blocks, which can be sold for an astonishing amount of 1 cubit. (They are worth 10 in the market)So with 20 blocks you can buy 2.I am also adding this: ""Rare"" loot isn't that good either. Sometimes you would get half a mask, wich costs 2000 in the market and can be sold by 200 if you're lucky. But the worst part is that even if you kept it you probably aren't getting the other half. Sometimes it gives you one wheel, or one wing or an item that needs more than one of it to work! It makes no sense!The Developers are complete money grabbers, and this game is no better than a mobile game.			"

								Once opon a time, this game was good. However, sience then freejam has screwed it up. The new update have made anything that gets more then two feet off the ground obsolite. This destroyed at least 4 classes of bots you could build. Once people drove large bots. Well, they were destroyed as well. RIP Tanks. Once I saw bots that looked decently realistic...... now I see legs with pillars built up with Rail Cannons (Think sniper rifles) up there, so even tho they have this tall bot, they are next to impossible to silence. Once there was specific weapon classes. You had the sniper with his rails, the tank with his plamsas, the car with his SMGs. Well, now lets stick anything and everything we want on the same bot, so we have a smg-rail-plasma-protoseeker-areoflak-ion disporter-nano bots.			"

								Full disclosure: I started playing after the epic loot update. This game is fun for a while when you first begin, the fun of designing your own robot and sending it to battle is enough for a while but then once you get to around level 50 you realise that there is actually no progression apart from CPU limit. The drops are completely random so you can be level 10 and pick up a 'Rail Erazer' from a purple chest when you come in first place, which is what happened to me. I then dominated every game for another 10-15 levels because my weapon was so much stronger than what anyone had for a while.The RNG element needs to be toned down, especially since only the person in first place of the winning team will get a purple chest which offers the only semi-worthwhile loot. Its like a feedback loot, the people who keep coming first place will get the best loot and then they will keep winning and having a higher chance of getting the better loot. See where I'm going? "

								Alright, now I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.After sticking with this game for 2 damned years, the devs finally reveal to us that robocraft was destined to be a random, empty, cheap and chaotic cash-grab.It started out as a tactical, TEAM-BASED, game that made you modify your bot as you played, slowly upgrading and fine tuning your creation till it reached the performance you sought. There was a grind but getting to max teir was awsome, pushing your bot to the limit just enough to get into the next teir was an achievment. There was something to fight for.Now this mess is comparable to mobile games, every aspect of the game is random, skill means nothing, building even less so. There is nothing to achieve, nothing to strive for, nothing to make you want to log back in as everything has been flattened out. Everything is predictable, I do not recommend even watching this trash, this 'game' is a shining example of what happens when developers ignore thier following. They've gone out of thier way to completely replace thier fan base and are constantly trying to reinvent what has already been mastered. They add in major content only to rip it out months later. The devs are indecisive, aimless and without a roadplan. They claim that this game is close to beta yet it couldn't ever hope to reach completion.I've sunk over 1000 hours in this game, never have I been this dissapointed.This mess started as an ambition and it will end as one.

								Im revisiting this review for the third time now, and this will also be my final conclusion.When i starteed playing robocraft it was just great. Some veterans may remember the times with the old currency (i forgot what it was called), where you could actually buy the stuff you wanted.The bots which were roaming the fields of war were perfectly balanced and newcomers may not believe it, you could even use a plane without being blasted out of the sky every time you respawn.I think it all begun with the updates that added rocketlaunchers and aeroflaks where the Downfall of Robocraft begun. I was shot out of the sky every respawn which limited my helis and planes to be a total support class and the only kills you got were steals. Then the crates came and this brand new currency which looks like the ashes of a burnt alien corpse. Why not? Lets just f*cking let the players get a box of♥♥♥♥♥♥every round instead of letting them buy what the actually want, and what particularly pisses me off, is that every rich♥♥♥♥♥♥could get tons of kills with the new implemented weapons which were designed to be op, making normal weapons completely useless.Now people may think : ""Dude whats with the salt"" , or ""They have to earn money to survive"".Yes i know they have to make money to survive but the updates and their content crossed more borders than a illegal immigrant trying to get from canada to paraguay ( when he makes it over the great wall).And with the salt: Im very damn salty because i LOVED this game and absolutely adored the system it was based on, i mean you can f*cking build your own damn robots and actually f*ck someone over with it and it makes me extremely sad what happened to it.Another thing is, that one day Freejam thought : "" Damn what do i do? There are all the Veterans complaining, but if we change it back again well make less money. *Lightbulb pops up and emits a glowing light of total wisdom* HEUREKA, we just need to somehow remove the Veterans from the game! They did it like this: They gave (i think it was) Free premium and crates and gifts to all players playing the game but the presents had a maximal rank where you wouldnt get anything. This upset me and many Vets stopped playing. Freejam you won, i will not play this game anymore and complain about the things you did or are doing right now. But i will try to tell the community (from my perspective) what this once was. How much fun i had.Sincerely Up yours Your average F2P player Benejosh			"

								Overall, I used to love this game, started when it only had 3 types of wheels XD, and now it has grown into a game with planes, helicopters mechs, and everthing in between. I have hopped on and of with high hours each time playing te game, i have had hours me and friends discussed tactics and craft, and ways that builds could be better.So when this new update came on, I was happy at first! all these new items and cool stuff to use. But game has taken a turn for the worse unfortunatly, I will no longer be playing until it is fixed. The system now makes you grinde for every part, then gamble it away for the hopes of something that works. PLEASE EVERYONE stop playing until this whole fiasco is done, and they change this terrible system of hard grind and no payout.I know I can't do much, but I want others to know. This is why I will stop playing Robocraft "

								Wow.. I have played over 4000hrs and in the last 4 matches I had to deal with multiple cheaters - wall hackers and high flying invisible drones. This game was so awesome.. a year ago :( im literally frustrated 90% of the time i play this game.. Today I am done. I just dont understand how it was allowed to degrade like this. I love building bots, but you are forced to buy a drone if you want to compete. Oh and you want relaxed play in basic mode? Thats where I found the same issues with the same bots and the same hackers. If they limit or remove the factory, if the re allow tiers, maybe i would think about re testing this game to make another opinion but currently im going bald trying to chase drones around. Would be nice to actually level up, been ""levelling up"" for a long time @ 2000cpu.. whats the point. Pros - Building is fun and simulation style physics.Cons - No tiers so your up against expert players as a novice.. good luck with that			"

								i use to play this game so much and have so much fun, build robots, collect and buy new pieces to build fun and new designs. But now the developers have removed all that was fun exept the battles. i actualy remeber investing about 5$ on gc (wich is now removed) and buying a cool robot. all the gc and rp that had been farmed and collected was removed from the game, with that being removed for some thousands of hours down the drain for nothing. And now the game has added crates, this game was given the title ""Best indie game of 2014"" this game and some others is proof start that a great start doesent always lead to a great end.			"

								The game was good like two years ago. Now it's a pay to win, grinding-fest, simple-minded bullet hell.I played two years ago and I thought it was a pretty good F2P game. Not too p2w, but there is still someway for the devs to make money. There were only cars, hovercars, and planes. Fine.They could've kept the game good, but just add cool things, like the insect legs, or the tank treads. But these massive changes are completely stupid.I could go on for hours about how the Robot Tiers being removed, and Robot Rank being added is counterintuitive. But no, I'll rather say that the game has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥There are P2W Homing Missle Launchers, P2W Anti-Air Cannons, and short range teleporters?!!What happened?			"

								First impressions:(optional let's play footage)


YouTube™ Video: Robocraft - let's play 

			Views: 1,613		

			This is my first impressions of Robocraft by Freejam. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032161980/recommended/301520/		

I played Robocraft for just under half an hour until I started having trouble connecting to the server and was no longer able to play. I think it’s probably overloaded because of the popularity.For an alpha the presentation is pretty good. Main menu area looks good. Sounds alright and has decent menu music.You pilot pre-made or modified robot vehicles. Or build them from scratch piece by piece. You have a selection of different types of chassis blocks i.e. heavy armour or light, propulsion e.g. (hover or wheels, rear wheel drive or front wheel drive etc.), weapons and so on. You make your robot in any shape or configuration you want. You can make a heavy tank, a gunship with long range or short range weapons. Online matches appear to be a team deathmatch.The typical players robot isn't very pretty but I think this game has a lot of potential for some really cool designs. And because of the apparently huge amount of customisation a large amount of variety to gameplay.In the short time that I played I basically thought the game was awesome from the start. I've been avoiding Early Access titles but I would definitely recommend playing this game. What have you got to lose? It is free.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

								I realy want to give this game recomendation but i just cant. Dont get me wrong this is one excelent game with a fatal flaw that cant be overlooked(but could be easily fixed). Match making! My god the irony of that word in this game (its funny when you wait for game to start there is a message saying ""wait untill you are matched fairly"":D). Basicly when i was lvl 30 i was and still am constantly matched with ppl using lvl76 weapons (meaning the are at leest 2.5 times my lvl!) and that was not just one-two gamse with one-two ppl, no its more that half of ppl every game. It kills all the joy of lvling coz whats the poing of geting a new weapon when  you know its already underpowerd compered to standard weapons used. Im lvl 53 now and i almost stoped playing coz im just not having fun anymore. I dont know if there are not enough players or what but this is deal breaker for me...			"

								This was once a great game, with a nice fair progression system, now you'll reinstall it, notice most of your designs are nuked, and the ones that do exist no longer work because oh look, suddenly there's no more tech tree, or earning currency to unlock parts as you play, there's this worthless crate system (that right now isn't even working properly), and of course, you can pay for them now, so what does that mean?Yep, the more you pay, the stronger you get, as you currently cannot gain anywhere near enough points from disassembling to afford anything beyond basic weapons, which have no effect against half the enemies you face now, while any damage you manage to do is now made pointless as the enemy will just hide behind a rock for five seconds behind his team, regenerate everything, and proceed to pop back out and one shot you with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ homing missiles or something as rediculous. ""Matching you with equally powered robots"" is a complete and entire joke, don't believe the game when it tells you that.This game was amazing and unique. Now it's complete and utter grindy trash that is not worth your time at all, another pay to win. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shame.			"

								This game has had ups eiand downs, twists and turns, but all the while I have been playing. In the beginning, it had one of the best matchmaking systems I have ever seen, taking into account the power of the robot instead of a rank like many other games. Robocraft was unique in being able to do this,  due to their building mechanic. Since then, they have revamped the matchmaking into a slaughterhouse, added incredibly overpowered endgame weapons for one team and base weapons for the other, and have turned the game into a near complete pay/grind to win system. I loved this game and it's combat and building used to be unbeatable, but every match is now a roll of the dice between whether or not you are on the team with the smurfs. The latest update has been the worst by far, turning paid for items and worked for items into  a fraction of their original worth and forced the pay to win feature even father down it's users throats. I hope the developers work to return Robocraft to it's original glory. Until then this is me, leaving a negative review, on a game that I have almost 200 hours in.			"

								Pre-latest update: You could pretty much say ""Hey, I want to build a _____________ with _____ and ________ it's gonna be SUPER COOL!"" and then build it. If you were a good builder it'd also not fall apart within 3 seconds when it got shot at.Post-latest update: You have to say ""Oh, I have 4 left shields and three non-steering wheels, along with about 27 of the worst guns in the game. How do I make this into a viable bot?""360h in the game. Until the recycle values and earnings get buffed (back to where they were pre-update), until I get to use the parts I want (what a crazy idea!), and until wheels (supposedly the easiest-to-use movement parts) stop skidding like their tyres are literally made of Teflon, it's not going to hit 361h.

								       See, as of hours before writing this comment, I had not seen Robocraft's new massive overhaul. I mean, it's not like I should be surprised by them completely overhauling the game. They have done it mutliple times through the game's history. and it's not subtle either. So, as of bringing this new update, there is now no true reward for leveling up, except your increased CPU limit. You want the NORAMLLY level 100 item? Some can now just pay their way there. This is not TOALLY accurate, because of the CPU limit. But the one thing that REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS is what they have done to the medic system. ""Back in the good Ol' Robocraft"" It was a nonstop beam that did damage if used on an enemy, healed if used on an ally.  Then I experienced the update which removed the damage ability and made it a machine gun speed weapon, not a laser. At first I hated it, but I soon liked it because of it's massive healing capabilities. And now, it fires slower than mortars, heals for even more a shot, and really just kills the medic feel. The constant transfer of life makes sense, not a sudden BOOM GET HEALED. THe ammount healed with these new, slower beams seems off.      But back to the origional problem stated, this new update. You no longer have to actually buy items, you ""craft them."" How? buy using dust, which has replaced the currency system. When you win a battle, you get loot crates based upon how well you did. you do not get dust outright, NO. THAT WOULD BE TOO NICE. You now have to sell off whatever parts they hand down to you. As my medic ship (previously stated) I would make around 300,000 coins for a good loss, and 750,000+ coins for almost any kind of win.  for scale, msot high level equipments costed 500,000 to 1,000,000 coins. Not to shabby. The lock on missle laucher (Which I THANKFULLY bought before this inflation update) costed around 7,300,000. Now, it seems that you could get between 500-1,000 from selling the parts you win from matches. How much does this lock on launcher cost now? 175,000 dust. WHAT? Now, my estimated amount won fro mmatches may be off. I will soon playtest it, record them all, find a mean, and give a pretty difinitive amount. I am no bad player, commonly being one of the best on the leaderboard (meaning I should commonly be getting the best loot).			"

First off, I have to say that this used to be a good game. Before this latest update, you fight using pre-built robots to earn robopoints, use robopoints to buy parts needed to improve your robot's design. You repeat this process of building and fighting repeat until you've built a set of excellent robots. It was an excellent model that works and I loved it so much I've spent money supporting this game and have spent thousands of hours playing it.This latest update changed it all. Instead of earning robopoints from fighting in matches, players now earn crates that reward random stuff when opened. And by random, I mean completely random. A crate may contain a single wheel or a single wing, which is completely useless as wheels and wings must be paired. I can no longer get the exact parts I need to complete my robot. Instead, I have to recycle parts I don't want for a heavily discounted price before I can ""craft"" the parts I actually need. In order to build great bots, I now have to grind hundreds to possibly thousands of matches to gather all the parts that I need. This level of grinding is not fun for me and I has made me give up on this game.  "

								       See, as of hours before writing this comment, I had not seen Robocraft's new massive overhaul. I mean, it's not like I should be surprised by them completely overhauling the game. They have done it mutliple times through the game's history. and it's not subtle either. So, as of bringing this new update, there is now no true reward for leveling up, except your increased CPU limit. You want the NORAMLLY level 100 item? Some can now just pay their way there. This is not TOALLY accurate, because of the CPU limit. But the one thing that REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS is what they have done to the medic system. ""Back in the good Ol' Robocraft"" It was a nonstop beam that did damage if used on an enemy, healed if used on an ally.  Then I experienced the update which removed the damage ability and made it a machine gun speed weapon, not a laser. At first I hated it, but I soon liked it because of it's massive healing capabilities. And now, it fires slower than mortars, heals for even more a shot, and really just kills the medic feel. The constant transfer of life makes sense, not a sudden BOOM GET HEALED. THe ammount healed with these new, slower beams seems off.      But back to the origional problem stated, this new update. You no longer have to actually buy items, you ""craft them."" How? buy using dust, which has replaced the currency system. When you win a battle, you get loot crates based upon how well you did. you do not get dust outright, NO. THAT WOULD BE TOO NICE. You now have to sell off whatever parts they hand down to you. As my medic ship (previously stated) I would make around 300,000 coins for a good loss, and 750,000+ coins for almost any kind of win.  for scale, msot high level equipments costed 500,000 to 1,000,000 coins. Not to shabby. The lock on missle laucher (Which I THANKFULLY bought before this inflation update) costed around 7,300,000. Now, it seems that you could get between 500-1,000 from selling the parts you win from matches. How much does this lock on launcher cost now? 175,000 dust. WHAT? Now, my estimated amount won fro mmatches may be off. I will soon playtest it, record them all, find a mean, and give a pretty difinitive amount. I am no bad player, commonly being one of the best on the leaderboard (meaning I should commonly be getting the best loot).			"

Also they decided to go and say ""♥♥♥♥ the skill tree system we have been ♥♥♥♥ing with for years, thats♥♥♥♥♥♥ lets just make everything come from crates and you have to sell that♥♥♥♥♥♥for basically nothing, GREAT IDEA!!!"".

								Great concept, building new bots and taking them into battle is amazing - like lego with lasers and lock on missiles. The developers at FreeJam, however, have made the game's balance and economy consitently worse with each update. The new Ion Distorter shotguns are insanely powerful, while the protoseeker has been nerfed to the ground. Nano's require huge amounts of energy to operate, making combat medic bots unviable. The economy has been shifted from a linear progression system to a flattened one, which is good in theory, but Freejam ♥♥♥♥ed it up.  All items in the game (blocks, guns, shields, etc) are now dropped from chests, which restricts building options and player creativity  - I've been waiting for modules to drop for days. One time I completely ran out of normal cubes, and had to grind singleplayer for enough cubes. You can recycle dropped items for currency, which is used to buy specific, individual parts, but the prices on these parts are so high that you're better off waiting for the small chance that the legndary weapon you need drops. I'm not sure if they're trying to kill off all their old players to attract new players who never got to play this game at its peak.  "

								This was a great game to play, while it did have some minor balance issues that the devs were working on it was still great for most players and everyone could find a niche. Please note the operative word ""was"" in the above.28-April-2016 is a day that will live in infamy for Robocraft. This was the day of the ""EPIC LOOT"" update that was supposed to may everything more leveled and open the game up to new players. Unfortunantly it failed.Big time.Freejam, with the epic loot upgrade, has turned the game into a form of gambling. You get just as much benefit if you spend 5 minutes in a game as you do if you spend 30 minutes in a match. While this may sound good, it is not good if your teamates are just sitting there doing nothing because they show up to get whatever random drops they get. The higher pricing of ""cubes"" and other components necessary to build with has also limited many players in what they can build. Gone are the beautiful artbots of yesterday, today if the day of 4 block bots. Unfortunantly FJ doesnt seem to interested in hearing from the players that have kept it going for the past 2 years but instead want to attrack newer players that do not know the bounty of yesteryear. The ""Epic Loot"" update really should be called the ""Epic Fail"".			"

								All i have to say is why......I joined the game several years ago, back then, it was simple, time consuming but fun. a while ago you added things like tank tracks, heli blades, etc. i was amazed, it was really cool . i started playing again, the battle arena came out, and again it was awesome. then the tech tree was removed. I was mixed about this, but in the end i though it was for the better. recently the modules and new weapons came out. i though some of them were interesting, unique and generally really good. it had its downsides (e.g aeroflak 1 hit kill)  Now this....   The well done, fun, BALANCED, interesting game i knew was gone. now, robocraft is a low quality, pay-to-win cash cow. Im outraged. before i was playing with snipers and planes, hovers tanks and even the odd heli.it was great, balanced and fun. Now i join a game, with my plasma tank, and instantly die from a lock on missile, or an invisible teleporting ion cannon, or spiders, or photo seeker mini-bots. I lose instantly, and what does this mean? i get rusted crates, because i get rusted crates, i can't improve my bot, because i can't improve my bot , i can't do better, if i can't do better, i get Rusted crates and so on. the only way out is to pay a S*** load of moneyI used to consider paying money, but now? i would never pay money to the money greedy Corporation freejam has become!I will now change my review to negative. Please Freejam, revert while you still can.( new edit:   the new update, battle for earth, has come out. the map looks cool, and thats about it, get ready to embrace the mech legged plasmas and missile heli-bots. I spent ages winning a game, i came first. and i got a gold crate. with 10 light chassis. and 10 slope chassis.GG Freejam)- Dobzhd			"

								The crate update killed the game for me. I tried to like it, I really did, but progression for gathering materials for your robots has stalled. Every robot has a Shotgun, I'm sick of seeing Mech Legs, and the balance of fights is tilted. Before the updates, I had fun fighting, and sometimes winning, with art bots shaped like X-Wings, AT-ATs, and DeLoreans. After the update I need to put as many snipers as I possibly can onto an armomred square block, or be vastly underpowered doing anything else. Don't even ask me to put wings on something other than a spider-sniper build.The devs clearly don't listen to the vast outcries of the players, so now they have one less player to worry about.I've uninstalled. I'll be playing Factorio if you need me.			"

								Well since the last 2 updates, it's safe to say that this game has died a horrible death.It's like Freejam decided to bury the game, exhumate the body and leave it to rot in the open.I strongly recommend to avoid playing this game if you value your own wallet because of the latest updates this game seems to have been corrupted by EA in terms of microtransactions and pay2win grade stuff.AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COST!It used to be good how it was but they decided to introduce OP weapons which are obtainable without tech points (mistake1) and the last update pretty much killed the entire game, or what was left of it.

								This game is a great game.... Let me rephrase that. This game WAS a great game, wonder why, i'll tell you why.First off, being honest, i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam, the matches were fun, balanced, friendly and all out great, even though the 'robot' building was a bit tough, I liked it, as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesn't, but then, it was introduced to steam.First up, what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like ""Oh, awesome it's on steam now, now i can play with my friends.."" It was good for quite a while, but then they started updating alot more, at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things, but, then the later updates happened, they are what annoyed me.From what i saw with those later updates were, new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking, some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking the community what they wanted, as if it's FreeJam's way of saying ""We don't give a damn about what the community wants added, we just want more money"" And this kind of behavior really annoyed me, as for one thing they changed, they removed the armoured blocks, for what, ♥♥♥♥ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types, or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to 'balance' the entire battle challenge of the game. They also removed the pilot seat, like, that's what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it, as they likely would've though it being to easy to be killed, they removed it.Not only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec no-hit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds, but they changed the entire 'Tech-Tree' so many ♥♥♥♥ing times, it can't even be called a tech tree anymore it's more of a damn 'Tech-Spiral' now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like they've done now, and the fact that they've set it with each conescutive item tier, the price is drastically increased, so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir, I understand that, they need money to keep it being developed but honestly +500% in-game credit price increase for one tier higher in which, most people can't be bothered mustering enough in-game credits to buy alot of those as that's what most people do.Worst part is, with the addition of the 'Robot Factory' which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that, which makes the game's already unbalanced rank matching, even worse.To end this review rant, if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but i'm not, instead i'm saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company. And here's a message for the Devs and FreeJam, chnage what you have done to this game, listen to the community, don't just look at a few people saying that they don't like something or they would rather something, listen to the people that actually care, that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing it,instead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots..

								You get to build your own vehicle and the possibilities are endless. There is a crazy amount of items and levelling up isn't a terrible grind, which negates pay-to-win aspects. You will spend more time building than in battle. Graphically it is not crysis, but the textures are at least a decent resolution. It plays like world of tanks. I like it a lot and say its at least worth a try because it is free and only about 700mbs total.			"

								Two years ago, when I started playing it, I was hoping it would be a good game, but now after about 1k total in game time and countless patch... hope is fading. Every new game mode is less joyful than previous one and game itself becomes more casual which results very random/skill-free teams even at the very endgame. Btw, don't tell me then it is ""only alpha"", because it is at this stage long enough (2 years) to assess direction of changes and this direction is not promising :(Edit: Not worth your time, just stay away :/			"

								I personally do not like where the game is going since the ""epic"" loot update.    Before you would get acces to new gear from leveling up and overall playing the game. Now it is just by luck and paying for crates wich gives a lot of P2W (pay to win) and gambling aspect to the game since you pay for crates that you aren't 100% sure that you will get the item you want. Now some people will say that ""This is the CASE (bad puns are bad) with cs go aswell"", well in cs go skins AREN'T a necesity; on the other hand guns, wings, thrusters, etc. are the basics necesityes for players . And DON'T even get me started on seeing flak canons on low level tiers. I myself endured the suffering to play against an aeroflack on a lower tier robot. AND selling things before gave you 50% of the price now ""forging"" them gives you a lot less. Oh yeah LEGENDARY things almost only drop in the premium slots.			"

								I would like to mention that the devs did ruin the game. It may suit some people, but I've stopped playing as a result of the ""Freedom"" update. Good job Freejam, you listened to the public and took away the harsh tier system. In fact, you did take away the entirety of the tier system. I'm sure I can speak for many people in saying, we just wanted the old tier system back. All of the fun in the game was building good bots with enough wiggle room to make amazingly efficient bots in one tier, and that was in my opinion, the best part of the game. But now I can't seem to find anymore interest in this game. Not many new interesting blocks are being introduced, and the old system everyone but the whiney 12 year olds loved is gone. Kind of sad I can't use my Overwolf copter like I used to.			"

								One of the best if not the best free to play game I have ever played. After the first couple hours of playing I bought som in game GC just to support the devs for making this great game. You can craft your own robot and earn points through battling to unlock and buy new tech/weapons/shields/armor and cubes to build your ultimate battle robot. A must play game for everyone considering its FREE. Also very well balanced and in no way pay to win, you can unlock and build almost anything without putting money in the game, the only thing money can really get you is early block unlocks and cosmetics like flags. But they then still have to purchase the blocks after unlocking with earned in game curreency which you cannot buy but only get by playing rounds. GREAT GAME EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT AT LEAST ONCE!

								It's sort of hard getting better parts and often I get absolutely rekt. Play this game if your a proffesional, this multi player game is hard. All this tempts me to get better equipment and crates but, I don't have enough money. This game makes me angry and ecasionaly I might get a kill, if I'm lucky. All free games have in game purchases. I would've bought this game if it costed money and wasn't as doushy. I do not reccomend this game unnless you've got a lot of time and can hadle an overflow of failure.			"

								I Recommaned this game years ago ... but now I changed Recommanded..now > No here I can drop few reason Update as of JULY 20 2016( little better but same fordge sytem.... still totally rip off ... electroplate sheild K  for new is 32500 if u sell (recycle) you only get 13,000 you lose 19,500 .... that HUGE loss.... that why I still keeping this in Negative. that almost 70% loss value to each parts. rail gun is 2600 and u sell for 650 (recycle) you lose 950 simular to 19k for top tier sheild. that and loot  is mostly around tier 5-7 RARELY gets 8-10 parts... even in protounium crate still get lousy stuff. ) and Hackers still present... yeah sucks. )1. they changed tree to none. (my opinion: wtf )2. earning rate is HUGE loss and missing, when u win big battle and I got around 20 kills few times and earn still small and gets tier 2-3 weapons....look like they forgot to add after battle earning like credit why dont they add earning dust end of battle... ( my opinion: no more earning, gets low tier some are unable to recycle....this doesnt work out. way out of balance. takes long time to save up and buy high tier weapons etc.)3. based on my research of game rating 2 years ago was 91% ... and now around 38% they lost LOT players this explain why que takes while.... they lost 40% % because of Devloper being ""greedy with money"" yeah they want more money I rather spend my money on World of tanks. they're balance for long♥♥♥♥♥time.4. they dont listin to your suggestion and advice... they do what ever they want = Greedy.... so Greedy = Lose ppl's interest in playing this game.5. Flak kills hover vehicles  = bad and unfair. FLAK IS DESINGED FOR ANTI AIR UNITS.6. over all they lose my interest in playing this game .... look at all bad and neg review started few weeks ago because of this. 7. I used to get around 800k 1 mil creds per battle that's balanced based on your tier im lvl 122 earning is high but now wayy too small for all lvl. that's messed up. what make it better again ? 1. UNDO THE FACKING UPDATE RID OF FORGE SYSTEM OR ADD FORGE EARNING AFTER BATTLE LIKE CREDS.2. STOP GIVING LOW TIER UN-RECYCABLE PARTS. OR MAKE ALL TIER ITEMS RECYCLEABLE.*un-recycleable items from loot = earns nothing. you cant recycle.*recycleable items from loot = earns forge to get what u need for your robot.basiclly NEW parts are around average at least 15,000 some are at least 50k forge dustRecycle looted parts from crate is around average 500-1000 forge.takes while to get 1 new parts ... but the Flak, cloak device, jumper, seeker, ion desorter. are at least 120k fordge dust worth ... take while to get 1 parts.... I can do 3-5 Good winning battle with previous version with creds system I can get those expenstive parts with in just 3-5 Good winning battles.with forge system, could get u at least 100 battles to get flak etc ...that's WAYYYY out of balance. so after battle no more earning... just loot and sell ( recycle ) into forge u gets around 1000 - 4000 worth per battle.... that's♥♥♥♥♥♥up.So I turned away from this game. due lost of interest ... now my GF is very happy, so she can get my attn easier. -_-			"

								To any game developers looking for a good idea, take what Robocraft was 2 years ago, don't do any of the stuff that these devs have done, and release the game.We will buy it.I give this game a shot every 3-4 months to see where they are going with it.  Regretfully, I am giving up on this game, having no hope for it's future and an unlikely return to it's former glory.I used to love building bots and would spend whole sessions building and testing without ever even getting to the fight, but when I go back now, the only designs that seem particularly effective are hideous.  You used to be able to build pretty craft that still functioned effectively.Pay to Play was the nail in the coffin for this game.  They're still calling it 'Early Access' while they rake in plenty of cash,			"

								I've been playing Robocraft since July of 2014 shortly after it was released from beta, and I can honestly say that this game is one of the most fun games that I have ever played; I just keep coming back to it! The concept is simple: make a block out of armor cubes, stick it to a pilot seat, and slap some wheels and guns on it, too. Just like that, you have a working robot that you can use to drive around and fight other players and their robots. You start out small, but eventually you level-up further and further until you can make huge, complex crafts with shields, wings, hoverblades, ""triforced"" armor... Tons! Each robot takes real-time damage during battle, which means that parts of your robot will fall off once enough damage is dealt to them; this adds a whole new dimension to combat and thought when building a robot. Recently, the game has gotten a lot of flak because of the implementation of the new MOBA gametype ""Battle Mode,"" in which your team must fight the opposing team to capture and control 3 towers on the map to aid in destroying the enemy base. Older players grew accostumed to playing ""Classic Mode"" (now called ""Team Deathmatch"") and complained about the new addition of Battle Mode, failing to realize that CLASSIC MODE (TEAM DEATHMATCH) STILL EXISTS. Whereas in Battle Mode, players respawn after being killed and focus on taking/retaining towers for their team, Team Deathmatch is a game mode which consists of no respawns, ~10v10 combat, no towers, and -- if you are in a high enough tier -- a MEGA bot on each team. Mega bots are HUGE robots that players can build eventually. So yes, Robocraft has two awesome gametypes that you may choose to play at your whim with the high chance of additional gametypes being added in the future.One of the biggest strengths of Robocraft is how responsive the development team is. It is worth noting that the game is still in its alpha stage, and FreeJam is a pretty small team. Despite this, FreeJam is very active on Twitter, Reddit, and the Robocraft forums and open to discussion with their playerbase on how to improve Robocraft. Yes, FreeJam made some mistakes (limiting building capacity for each tier, ruining artbots, nerfing hoverblades, for instance) but they have ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED these issues and have promised to fix them. Though FreeJam can't fix every mistake immediately, they are extremely aware of what the Robocraft playerbase feels is wrong. Some examples when FreeJam did RIGHT was: when the servers got clogged with an explosion of new players (last summer) they got more servers within a week, they implemented an anticheating software program when hackers became an issue which significantly reduced the amount of cheaters in games, they implemented a CPU restriction to each tier to prevent ""overtiering"" in matches which a lot of new players were complaining about -- not an example of a GREAT solution but definitely an active, attentive solution (this update made it so a lot of artbots had to be deleted). So yes, sometimes FreeJam makes a mistake with an update, but they are always aware of the mistakes and actively trying to fix them. I want to reiterate that the game is still in alpha and that FreeJam is a small indie team. Despite this, FreeJam has already recognized the issue and has promised a solution to make artbots possible again.I think a current issue that some new players may face is the brief tutorial the game offers. I would recommend watching a youtube video to learn how to properly play/make a good robot/learn the controls in the garage bay.Overall, I think Robocraft is a spectacular game even in its alpha state with a lot of promise for the future. The developers actively listen to their playerbase's concerns and always deliver solutions to their problems. I could not recommend this game anymore to anyone!			"

								Game, is waste of time, especially if you are just going to start it, your level progression be very slow even if you buy premium,""build custom crazy vehicle and fight"" is a lie,  no matter how you build you will be punished for creativity, only way to build effective vehicle is to make just brick with guns (you will see them a lot, because its only effective build), economy is lame, you will depend on random drops from crates (which are pretty useless, even strongest crate, aka ""protonium crate"" drops useless items), game demands active grinding with little to no reward, forget about gameplay balance, you will be limited to 2-3 weapon types or you just be left without kills and thus with lamer drops, dont waste your time this game was geat once, but it gone wrong, early access days were worth it tho, but now they ruined game			"

								If you've never played Robocraft before and are wanting to give it a try, don't. Those awesome robots shown in the images? You won't be making any of those. Once upon a time, not so long ago, you could. But it is not so now. See, the game would reward you after every battle with a kind of in game currency based on your performance, allowing you to pick and choose parts to build robots with. This allowed for a great amount of creativity and encouraged you to get out there and cause mayhem, as it meant more money for the parts you wanted. Now though, as of the most recent update, instead of cash, you are given a random assortment of bits and bobs to construct robots with, curbing the creative potential by an huge amount. These can be sold for money but even then you're not making anywhere near as much as you would with the old system. Add to that the grossly inflated prices for parts and any kind of meaningful progression is nearly impossible.Don't waste your time with this game. If you're looking to get creative there must be a hundred games that give you the basic freedom to build what you want, as you want. Or just buy some lego.			"

The game is constantly evolving, as you, the player do. As you rank up both your account and your robots, it brings  a whole new element to the game, because you have more parts to play around with, and an increased block cap. With new parts released regularly, there's always something to build every time you log on. 10/10			"

								I really loved this game once upon a time. It had everything I was looking for, freedom to build, pretty casual attitude, but competitive community, pretty even spread in weapon useability...but it seems like in recent updates, starting with megabots they just keep shooting themselves in the foot.First was Megabots:Megabots was a miserable addition. You build a giant tanky SMG bed and that's it. The plasma option has never been worth building because of the sheer lack of damage of the cannons and the armor of the top tier bots. All high level games became defend your megabot and hope to god they are semi-competent.Next they decided to push toward moba... This was an interesting idea exccept that in the weeks I tried to play it after that update all matches were bombarded with one side or the other running into glitches that either made it impossible to finish the match or impossibly one sided on objective since you couldn't capture them. This persisted over the course of a couple months until I just stopped trying to play for a while.Now they have...whatever they have now. Megabots are in the same spot with either smg or....smg because you still don't use plasma if you want to win. Matches are taking several minutes to queue as opposed to about 10seconds back in the earlier releases. FFA is what you'd expect, just a moshpit of gunfire. The maps still add little-no flavor to the game besides a few that were around since the start anyway.I guess I can say the CPU load and how blocks unlock now is pretty nice for freedom to build, but that's pretty much the only thing I've seen that got better.Just a minor grievance in addition, the automatic flipper is still crap.

								Well well well its time for me to write a review for this very good game . You say very good game and you dont recommend why??? Well first of all , i am playing this game since 2014 as it is a free game . I don't have that many hours because i wans't playing in all the periods of my life... but i was there when the updates were released . I have to say that a year ago this game was one of the best free to play games out there , it wasn't P2W , you were able to create everything your brain would think of from a simple robot to a beautiful robot and to a very practical robot and it required way more skill than it requires now if it requires any to tell the truth . One year ago the only weapons you had was plasma , rails , lazers , teslas and the nanos if you would like to be a healer . You were able to have only one type of gun which made the game way more  difficult and strategical as a wrong move may cost your robots ''life'' . Furthermore , that days was what i would like to call my best days as a plasma bomber . Yeah plasma bombers were actually a very good robot that days before these flaks were introduced . I loved to play as a bomber they were hard to hit plus plasmas  had good damage if not beast damage . But now i dont even consider getting off the ground as 5-6 hits by a flak to my jet are enough to bring it down . Now i have to talk about the present ... No tiers No Ranking(i preferred tiers to ranking of course) no tree , no flyers...at least for me flying is something i dont consider to do anymore :'( . The current matchmaking system is broken asf the crates are s*** if of course you get a crate after the match and it doesn't glitch . You can't make the robot you want if you aren't lucky enough , simple robots with op weapons made by unskilled or players that can't stand this update is a very common phenomenon as lock on missiles and ion distorters , legendary sh** plasmas lazers and many more things . That's it i with the review except one thing that i would like to see. REMOVE THESE FLAKS ...YOU HAVE ALREADY DESTROYED FLYERS BY ADDING LOCK ON MISSILES LEGENDARY LAZERS ON LOW CPU , RAILS(I DESTROY FLYERS WITH ONE SHOT WITH THE ERAZER) PLASMAS AS NOW THEY BURST FIRE NOT LIKE PAST...i am done with this game i am so done i have seen many developers destroy awesome games but also this one??? WHY...			"

The developers have been throwing hour grinding new gear and weapons for the past month which contribute nothing to the game (the blink generator is cool but thats all), nothing of what this game needs. The weapons need rebalancing after they messed with them in previous updates, and the simplification of the tech tree is aweful, its just a grindfest. I dont mind grinding but i want to get something decent out of it to make it feel worth it and with the removal of the Megabots theres nothing driving me to continue playing.The developers have ruined a once great game.No Megabots, No point playing.

(Updated 2016/05/16)If you are new to Robocraft, I do not recommend playing this game for several reasons, the most important of which is that I believe Robocraft is now leaning toward Pay To Win as a result of the recent so-called ""Epic Loot"" game patch. Instead of trying to make a fun, rewarding game, FreeJam is placing an emphasis on new player retention and money through psychological manipulation.Random RewardsWith the introduction of Epic Loot, all in-game rewards given for playing have been converted to Crates. Opening a Crate will give you a random item reward, such as building blocks, a weapon, a radar jammer, etc. A better score in the game will yield a higher level Crate. Higher level Crates have a slightly better chance of yielding higher level items. If you don't like the item you get, you can ""Recycle"" (sell) the item for in-game currency: ""Robits.""On the surface this sounds fine. However, in my experience, after playing hundreds of matches in the new system, my in-game Robits balance has moved only very slightly. Why? * Rewards are random. I have yet to win a ""Legendary"" item, the most valuable tier of items. I have won perhaps 2 or 3 ""Epic"" items, and a handful of ""Rares.""The thing is, it feels like there is no correlation between my performance and my rewards. I have not noticed any trend in the better crates giving me better rewards. It feels wrong. It feels like punishment. I'm not getting rewarded for doing better. I'm getting random rewards like pulling the handle of a slot machine.* Recycle values are very low. The resale rates are effectively a small percentage of what they used to be. So, even after selling everything I win, I have very little in the way of Robits.Prior to the Epic Loot update, players were able to earn in-game currency (""RoboPoints"" or RP) by playing the game or by purchasing a separate game currency (""Galaxy Cash"" or GC.) Players were rewarded with RP based roughly on their performance in game matches. The more expensive modules would take several days of playing, perhaps a few dozen matches. Progress was a little grindy but tolerable.My progress after Epic Loot has ground to a halt. It was like hitting a brick wall.Buy Crates!The option, of course, is to buy crates for real life money. I understand developers need to make a living. However, the crates you buy are STILL full of random junk. The rates for Legendary items even in the purchased crates are still under 5%, which means you can spend US$25 and still not get a Legendary.Even if you sell all of the items you got out of crates with that $25, it might not be enough to afford one Legendary item.In contrast to this, prior to the patch, you could purchase one of those Legendary items for $5 or less.DeceitMy biggest problem with the update is that the currency names and scales were converted in an attempt to obfuscate how drastically the in-game currency earn rate was nerfed. The amount of Robits you earn from selling back items you don't want is much lower than the comparable earnings prior to the Epic Loot change. FreeJam is attempting to deceive and confuse players by changing the numbers on all of the items.Weapon Balance, Quality of Life, Clans, etc.These things are important, but they're not the most important thing. They don't speak to the integrity of FreeJam. As a developer myself, I know balance is hard. I know development can be slow. I know social features are complex.But if you try to pull the wool over my eyes and deceive me about what you're doing, if you try to put me in a Skinner box to milk me for money unfairly, I'm done. You've revealed that all you care about is sales.SummaryI have played Robocraft for years. I have been around through a lot of changes to the game. This recent change is a blatant money grab and shift towards Pay To Win. It is deceitful to the players. I would recommend staying away from Robocraft until this latest fiasco has settled down, if it ever does. Robocraft may never recover from this if the developers insist on keeping these new earnings standards,			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start off by saying this: the game isn't bad.This game is certainly a lot of fun. If you're just searching for a game in which to screw around with friends, this is a game you won't regret giving a try. I personally have had some good times with this game, especially in a rather small amount of time.However, if one is to don the identity of a critic, there's a lot of interesting points to bring up, both good and bad.As if we're in a cheesy 1970's action movie, we'll start off with the bad, and then work our way to the good.THE BAD:1.This game has some of the weirdest (and no, I don't mean wacky/enjoyable) physics I have had the ultimate displeasure to lay my precious eyes on. Seriously.In the FIRST game I joined (with, admittedly, a precariously built little WALL-E that obviously couldn't tell which of its sides was which) , I found myself flipped in the first thirty seconds. Helplessly, I tried comming in the chat for one of the other new WALL-E clones to try and flip me over. Thankfully, they obliged to give it their all, which in the end meant nothing because robot collisions are barely even a thing in this game. You can ram into a tiny little 3-block retardcycle at full speed, attempting to move him a centimeter, and he won't budge at all. However, as he does not budge, you go flying at the speed of a middle-aged mother attempting to buy the next installment of mommy porn.And of course, you flip over at the smaleST GODADCNM THIBGN FCKUK EVRFY ♥♥♥♥IN TMEIE I DRIVE ROTBOT IT FLIP VOER YWUFVU VDD WEFIDFH.Second on the list of the bad:Balance is nonexistent. If you disagree, I challenge you to go find a railgun-user who doesn't at least admit that the railgun is incredibly overpowered. Plasma cannons are pretty close after the railguns as well, completely outclassing SMGs in the first 4-5 tiers of the game, especially after a certain update that shall go unnamed until later on.Recently, the developers have made efforts to change this incredible gap in the risk-reward/skill-payoff differences between the weapons. It still hasn't been enough, it seems. I've taken a pretty big break from the game now, and I don't expect to be picking it up much sooner if the balance in SMGS/Rails/Plasmas doesn't drastically, and I mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRASTICALLY change.""oh but afx ur just urmad cuz ur gt rekt (xd) by ppl whu r butter than uuu!!!11""Un-equip the railguns/plasma cannons, give yourself the equivalent of a new player's robot, and then survive more than 2 rails in a tier one game.Third on the list:Omfg. July 31st/August 1st, 2014. The days that made me want to kill people IRL. Before this update, railguns, plasma cannons, all the tools needed to customize an early robot, EVERYTHING was available to the new player after a couple matches and a few clicks in the Tech Tree.  While weapons were certainly overpowered, EVERYBODY could be overpowered with each other. However, the developers decided to cut that circlejerk in half. They removed the ability to acquire railguns, plasma cannons, aerofoils, and thrusters (as well as other things, I believe) before Tier 4~ish. This basically just ♥♥♥♥ed new players. It ♥♥♥♥ed 'em. Straight up gave them the hard Ron Jeremy, right in the♥♥♥♥♥ Anybody who played after/on August 1st could not unlock the same things other players had unlocked before. Anyone who had had the luck to install the game and get involved in it early on became a god. It was like WALL-E vs. Mega-♥♥♥♥ing-tron for days on end, as the new players, including myself, struggled to put a dent in the mechanical messiahs that were the more experienced players.When I had seen the capability to build a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ airplane robot thingie, I was so excited. Sure, it could offer quite a challenge to make a design work as I intended it to, but I was hella ready to get on that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now, after the update, I couldn't do that. No Starscream for me. Just normal old R2D2 with a water pistol against Mecha-Hitler with sniper rifle bazookas.Fourth, and more of a nit-pick:Finding a game can be buggy. Dunno. Kinda dumb.THE GOOD:The possibilities are kind of amazing. When I played with a friend, the very first thing I saw him in was a stick-figure on a platform with wheels. After seeing a bunch of power-ranger wannabe robots, this was pretty refreshing, ridiculous, and hilarious. Even disregarding the not-so-practical possibilities a robot design can have, there's a ton of room for creativity and imagination. If the interface for building were more streamlined, I daresay building the robots could take more of my time in the game than shooting other robots. This is one of the best things the game has working for it. The amount of things one needs to take into consideration while building a robot that can take and give damage is astounding. There's no real metagame of robot, no OMG MEGAZORD ROHBOT that you're expected to build to get the highest score or whatever. Your robot is only as good as you allow it to be.Secondly, the gameplay itself:Understandably clunky at times, the gameplay is still pretty charming. Getting kills is satisfying, the combat is easy to understand, and it can be skill-based depending on how you approach each situation. You never know what you're facing, and no two matches will have the same outcome. Not too much to say about it other than that it's pretty good.Third, the potential:This game has such a huge potential for growth. The developers, while not making the best choices at all times, show that they care for the game in the multitude of changes they continue to throw at the community. If the developers don't act on the potential in games (I'm looking at you, Stomping Land), there's only so far it can go. Thankfully, this game has shown that it can adapt, in good ways and bad, with the community around it. With the other things working in its favor, this game can certainly grow far beyond its beginnings and overcome the negatives that are sure to come with a rather new game.tl:dr : bad physics, bad weapon balance, dumb dumb dumb retard updates, good gameplay, great possibilities, and fantastic potential.For new players' sake, I won't recommend it now. But after this game has been turned around and flipped upside-down, changed to be the best it can be, I sure will be recommending it.			"

								Used to be an extremely cool game, the devs totally ruined its balance with the last ""Massive new expansion"". From a well made F2P creative arena game, it turned into a Pay-to-Win mayhem, with people with endgame weapons being in the same match as level 14 people. It was a nice game, now it's a useless waste of time and space on my HDD.			"

								This game used to be amazing. While it wasn't perfectly balanced (quite the contrary, really) you could still work your way up slowly but surely, given that you have enough time and patience. Now though, the game's almost completely pay-to-win. You can no longer really work your way up because the team balancing in this game favors those with way stronger robots, leaving those with less-than-stellar robots in the dust... both literally and figuratively.

								Ask me for a review on this before Respawned and Overclocked update? (30/04/15) I would give this a positive review BUT AFTER Resspawned and Overclocked update....... That's a whole new side....Here's why-Before Respawned and Overclocked, this game inspired team work revolving heavy towards flanking, sticking as one big cluster of brute force because of the arena type mode. Once dead, you're gone. Once they introduced medics; it revolutionised the whole battle mechanic on whether a team would succeed or perish further reinforcing the team staying together. Moreover, when FJ released the team balance patch, the battles would last sooooo much longer and be even more adrenalin filled so you wouldn't be paired with 5 other rail walkers and be crushed by a whole team of smg tanks. As medic you would feel so valuable; one of my favourite memories...Megabots arrive. Some of the player base decides this was a bad move (this was where the game started to get controversial) however, in my opinion, this was even better because now the T10's would stick by the Mega's siding them in one big turf war. Those were the good days of RC.30th of April arrives. Respawned and Overclocked. The danger of dying now gone; stupid bots start appearing virtually killing the cleverly thought out designs using tri forcing ect. Team work is gone; no need to stick together. If you die, you can just respawn again. Don't even get me started on medics... Before Respawned and Overclocked, medics were the top priority on kill list. But now they're just replaced with respawn. Again, no fear of dying. Megabots are restricted to the old mode where hardly anyone played because of the shiny new Respawned and Overclocked. (The megabots were still fairly new yet all the work seemed to just be abandoned). Even though arena mode is still here, it feels as if it gets no love anymore.Robocraft Unleashed touches down. The removals of tiers and tech trees are here. This resulted in a huge backlash from the community as many veterans felt that all their progress was for nothing as it took ages to grind up to each tier and save up for new parts to find that it's no longer the case. In addition, going up a tier made us feel amazing and satisfied giving us a sense of progression. I can see FJ wanted to enable full creativity as many wanted but it just won't work.To some up-Robocraft used to be one of my favourite games and WAS a fun and enjoyable game. Simple and easy to learn. However, as the updates passed, Robocraft got more and more complicated destroying the fun and simple factors or the arena game mode into a supposed 'moba' style game...ps: if you read all of this; thanks for your time!

								editedIf you want a game that waffles back and forth between buffs and nerfs, reintroduces bugs, changes game mechanics on a whim, and does this all constantly and without adequate warning, then this is the game for you.It is pretty clear that Freejam's marketing philosophy is to periodically drive out as much of its established player base as possible.  I get the impression that they view this as similar to the way Apple operates; Apple had Jobs, and no longer does, and is starting to suffer because of their inability to convince almost everyone a pig's ear is a silk purse like Jobs could.  But even taking all that into account, Apple has more loyalty to its customer base than Freejam does.Freejam appears to think they change Robocraft the way Mojang changes Minecraft.  They don't.  Mojang gives plenty of warning, and does not change basic game mechanics wholesale.  Mojang does not even fix exploitable bugs without a lot of warning.  Mojang seems to take its responsibility to its player base very seriously indeed.  Freejam is nothing like Mojang, and they do not change their game with any concern for their player base at all.I had a what's the problem heading in the original review, and it's easy to state now: the game is not worth it.  Freejam's (failing) quest for revenue has led it very far astray.  It could have led them to incremental and tolerable change, and real quality control and bug squashing.  Oh well, not the first promising game company to come in gangbusters, build up up up, and then sloooowly fade away due to really poor treatment of its customers.It's a shame though--I stuck with it even when they decided to add Flash animation for the woefully stupid Loot Crates decision, and broke the GNU/Linux version.  It really was a lot of fun even with with the bumps in the road.  But the driver is aiming for the biggest potholes and dissing the passenger constantly so...no thanks.  I'll walk.The current verdict (Nov 18 2016)I give up on this game.  It's not worth it.			"

Excellent and unique game concept, ruined by RNG boxes and bad game design, in the name of money.This game had potential, but unfortunately the developers elected to slow progression and rework rewards in an attempt to induce compulsory play (read: addiction), and force people to buy hundreds of RNG lottery boxes and a premium subscription... which, to my knowledge, has had the opposite effect.Unfortunately, the changes didn't just affect the reward system, either - they added several huge, overpowered new weapons, many of which have auto aiming or aim-assist features that drastically reduce the required skill level to score well in matches, as ""legendary"" items that might drop from the RNG boxes maybe 0.5% of the time, presumably in an effort to keep people hooked. One of the weapons - ""AeroFlak"" - also functions as a hard counter that renders one of the most interesting types of robot to build and play - aeroplanes, such as interceptors and bombers - largely useless.They have also publicly stated that they effectively refuse to address either of these problems in any meaningful way.Even though the community had warned them about it for weeks (ever since the announcements for the changes) through every possible channel.And even though the community has been suggesting hundreds of viable solutions to the issues created by the new system.Just look at the recent State of the Game post, and compare that to recent Steam reviews, the reddit.com/r/robocraft subreddit, the official forums on www.robocraftgame.com/forums, etc., and you get an idea about how much the developers care about what the community thinks of their game and what they want out of it.I can, unfortunately, no longer recommend this game.

Broken matchmaking, money barriers (when it's a F2P game, just make it P2P if you're going to do that devs), unbalanced weapons and gear, crashing launcher and the unforgiving crates. You had one chance Freejam, and you ruined it.If you fix all these things, perhaps me, and others, could come back. If you leave it like this, or break it more, I'm sorry, but you're just gonna be forgotten as a game that ""used"" to be good.			"

Early Access Review
								-Disclaimer- This preview was written during Early Access. Robocraft is subject to change.-Despite the disclaimer above, Robocraft is already a pretty well oiled machine. Most of the features are working quite efficiently and the core mechanics are in place. There are plenty of things to love about Robocraft straight from go. The basic gist is you build a bot/death machine and battle it out against other peoples creations. Where the beauty of the game lies is in its creativity, from a floating pirate ship to a MechWarrior style walker, you never know what you are going to end up fighting. Robocraft is a multi-faceted game that has many layers of complexity, so I will do my best to break it all down but I may forget to mention something.The first time I loaded up Robocraft I was greeted with an anti-cheat 3rd party software. Not my favorite thing in the world but more than welcome for this type of game. Aim-bots have ruined other games and I appreciate the extra safeguard. That being said, the game does actually take quite a while to load up all of its assets. Also the game crashed right after the long load up. Not a great first impression. I credit this to Early Access hiccups and reloaded the game with little to no problems.Upon second load up, I was brought into the heart of the game, The lobby. I watched as my pre-made bot gently floated in circles and I waited. Nothing happened. What was I waiting for you ask? A tutorial or anything for that matter. Nothing came. So I began randomly clicking around. I felt dizzy and lost with the amount of buttons, however this isn't my first rodeo and especially not my first battle arena style game.After clicking around, my curiosity led me to the build mode. After a minor pop-up that explained a few buttons. I wouldn't call this a tutorial more a crash course but I digress. The builder is exceptional! It reminds me of Space Engineers where you build things in first person view and can quickly change the direction of parts with a roll of the mouse wheel. You are given some basic parts but most unlock through the games leveling system and huge branching parts tree.The way things work is that you unlock parts the more you level. You level by playing in matches and destroying other vehicles. After leveling you unlock that part for purchase. You don't get that part for free, just the ability to buy it. There are some ways around this but we will get to that later. The builder is quite extensive needless to say and a quick Google search of peoples creations is somewhat awe inspiring and impressive. Sadly my skills and blocks were inferior and building my own machine was not necessarily the best idea, not yet at least. The only problem I found was that I was very limited for the most part at the beginning of the game. The basic starting vehicles and parts work but they don't really make you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥or all that cool. Especially as you will more then likely see other people using the same vehicle with slight variations. Things don't really become all that unique and interesting until much farther into the tech tree and amassing a fortune of in-game currency.After this, I jumped into one of the pre-made vehicles and got into battle mode. I was not disappointed at all. There are several modes and they add different objectives and themes. You have team deathmatch, a conquest type mode, and boss battle, my personal favorite. In boss battle, you and many smaller craft face off against 4 much bigger and advanced craft. This requires a great deal of team work and coordination on both teams part otherwise you end up dead very quickly. The same can be said for conquest mode, which features capture nodes that must be protected/assaulted to attain victory. In all, my experience with the battle modes was fast, visceral, and fun. Usually whoever shoots first wins but sometimes I managed to win, even if I was left heavily wounded. The only problem I found with combat was queuing up, which could take anywhere from 1 to 4 minutes per match. Which given that some matches last about the same length, was a bit much for my taste. Graphically, everything was very nice with Robocraft as well. While the focus isn't on the environments, the terrain had some nice detail and good level design, offering multiple options for different kind of play styles. The focus is for sure on the vehicles and this shows quite nicely. From the crackle of energy as your plasma cannons fire, to glowing energy panels. The only thing I felt needed a bit of work was the way you exploded which felt more like a firecracker going off than an actual explosion.The soundtrack was there. but I found it forgettable for the most part. However, I did love the sound effects. Robocraft is one of those games where you want to load up your own tunes and go to work. The options menu was rather robust with a decent amount of graphical options and rebindable keys. So let's talk about the elephant in the room, the microtransactions. Now Robocraft is not P2W or pay to win, but more like pay to skip. If you are a premium user everything is a bit easier as you earn more RP(in-game currency) and double the experience. Aside from all that, you can also purchase GC which is a premium currency that you can use to purchase most things from parts to premium status. Mind you, level still applies to this, if you aren't the right level, you can't use something ahead of everybody else in combat. Where the lynch pin lies is in the Robo shop, which allows players to purchase premade bots for real cash. This auto levels them to that particulars bots level and tier, essentially skipping the grind and getting into the good stuff. While this is far from a P2W scheme, the problem I see is that this makes the free to play aspect kinda lame. Grinding and getting up to that point is going to take you months of work where as some dude with twenty bucks did it in five seconds. Your time isn't valued here, your wallet is more important. You may be vastly more experienced in the game but getting anything done is going to be a nightmare due to queues and the way the experience system works. You are given experience based off your contribution, meaning if you have a couple of bad matches, expect zero experience.  Now one could argue that this is fair. The developer has to make money some how and development isn't cheap, also the player should be rewarded for coughing up some dough. The problem is that the free to play experience isn't as exciting.It's like going to the Zoo and seeing only the animals feet because you didn't pay. On the other side of the pay wall they have a freaking petting zoo, and you get to ride a Cheetah. Which is a damn shame because in Robocraft you probably can make an actual Cheetah, just expect to do it in weeks-months of grinding or drop a few bucks and get that shiny Cheetah right away. Everything just feels heavily stacked towards premium accounts. This shows in every aspect of the game.If you take anything from this review remember this, Robocraft is a game that requires LARGE amounts of time investment or some cash to get to the really cool stuff. The game runs well and the combat is fun but long queues and long load ups can drag the overall experience down. You can take everything I say with a grain of salt though, because the game is free to play. You have nothing to lose but time. So feel free to check the game out and make up your own opinion. Robocraft is fun and worth it alone for the boss battles and seeing the huge bots.

Early Access Review
								I used to love this game. I started playing it when it was pretty new (around early 2014) and it was amazing then. I stopped playing after a while, and didnt play it for quite some time. Then one day I was looking through my library, and i saw this game, and I though ""Hmm that was pretty fun, I had a good tank, maybe Ill login and see whats new..."". That turned out to be a mistake. Aside from the building of the robots themselves, the game shows almost no similaritys to the fun and creative idea that it was in the beginning, and the only bots you see now are tiny, op balls of smgs that can somehow defeat a plasma tank that is 5 times its size. In addition, the loot crate system is just a front for the devs to make a cash grab with premium. Even if you somehow manage, as a new player, to do good in a match, and get a decent loot crate, you only get HALF of the loot from that crate unless you pay for premium access. Yes, ""see that legendary/epic weapon/part in your loot crate? HOORAY for you! But guess what, you dont get to have it unless you pay us money!"". And on top of this the recycling system, putting in parts to get ""robits"" to forge new parts, has an appalingly low return rate, which can only be increased by getting premium. And even then the return rate is low. The devs alos saw fit to get rid of the capture the flag game mode, and replace it with a glorified version of deathmatch called Brawl. It is essentially everybody against everybody deathmatch instead of team deathmatch. Apparently they thought we needed two deathmatch gamemodes instead of just one. It has no teamwork or strategy like the capture the flag mode used to have, its just kill everyone else and get money. If i wanted that kind iof mindless crap I would go play Gta V.To say the least I am VERY disappointed in the direction this game has taken, and the utter lack of attention the devs give to the opinions of their community.  Like a disproportionate number of other games in its genere, it has become all about the devs making money. And yes, i understand perfectly well that they need money to make and upkeep the game, but making it an unbearable grind and ignoring all advice from their players is unacceptable. 2/10, Ill be back when they start listening to us.

								Balance isnt done right. I got instant killed every time by the proto seeker. Weapons are also too expensive. Plus with this new proto seeker and missle launcher and aeroflak , theres literally no point in playing air vehicles. Matchmaking also sucks. I dont actually like the new update where u can install multiple weapons on a robot. It makes every robot almost identical. Well i havent played this game for long, so i may be wrong. But i wont recommend this at all in my opinion.Good concept, but not done right. Every free to play game ever. ( Most of them)			"

								Really great game, build your own robots and fight with them. The 11 different teirs offer both upgrades to your current weapons, armor, sheilds, and mode of transportation as well as introducing new ones as you advance through each teir. The game has really good balance and you'll be hooked from the get-go. I'd also like to add that while there are micro-transactions, they are entirely unnececary as all they have for offer is either cosmetic items or a ""Premium"" membership which doubles the money and experience you earn, both of which can be gained quite quickly without it.

								To make this Review simple and sweet, this game was a really fun game. However, recently there has been a new update that has created multiple balance issues. These issues create a model of ""Pay money to get these big unbalanced weapons now"". This makes it very difficult for new players and it encoureges a very unfriendly enviroment for new players. I would recommend that anyone reading this review to stay away from this game until this current patch's problems are resolved. Hopefully this new Pay 2 Win Model will be removed soon.			"

								in short freejam will ABANDON THIS GAME SOON due to the lack of $$$ they are making on polishing this turd.This game is advertized as Play, build, fight.  This is no longer the case. Pay, Gamble, Grind is this game's new motto.  Instead of fixing desync bugs, auto aim hacks, and disconnect issues, this game released short ranged shotguns, melee tesla weapons, auto fire seeker gun, lock on missile launcher, which reduce the time to kill from 20 seconds down to 1.  The blink module is mandatory to play every type of game.  You either have it or you die instantly.  in short, pay for crates that have a chance to have these weapons, or you die instantly with no warning due to cloaked tesla ♥♥♥♥.pick another game if you find this one.  World of tanks, Space engineers, Starmade, any of those 3 are not pay to win.Drone ♥♥♥♥ are king in this game.  build a robot to dodge, because taking a hit is giving your opponents a victory.  Doge is king, tanks suck♥♥♥♥♥in this game!in additoin to these issues, you can get kicked from any match, at any time with a blank warning message. This triggers the 2 minute MANDATORY WAITING PERIOD for ANYONE who leaves a match for ANY REASION. http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/449611096774799461/959F87145E6F0D0572314EBF90AD10137D24F194/so to sumarize this:AN ERROR CAN KICK YOU FROM THE GAME, TRIGGERING A MANDATORY 5 MINUTE WAITING PERIOD WHEN YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.in short freejam will ABANDON THIS GAME SOON			"

								Disappointing. I've casually played this game for nearly 2 or 3 years now with a few longer breaks and I've literally watched it change from a to 坑. On a sidenote: i have no idea what that symbol means. I just mean to say it changed a hella lot. Albeit you gotta say they are always eager to balance the game, they also fail hard at it.It used to be possible to overtier if you preferred a single type of gun by unlocking higher tier tech with ubertech points (cash feature), then they nearly completely prevented that by making tech dependent on your level. Now they've completely removed the tech tree and you just randomly get♥♥♥♥♥♥from the lootbox after matches.It's always been hard to purchase new parts from the shop without cashing - it involved a truckload of farming - but it certainly was possible. Nowadays it's just f***ing hard to ""purchase"" new parts like guns and utility parts: you recycle the useless pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥you get from the lootbox for virtually nothing (about 100-300 ""dust?"" What even is this?) to save up to 300,000 dust for a legendary item. Alright, legendary items are legendary after all, but 2k for a blue plasma cannon? And then you're not set with just one of those? So calculate about 4-8 plasma cannons and you need to farm 8-16k dust. On top of that premium users (cashers as I like to call them) get two items from the loot crate instead of just one. Clearly they're favorizing people here... Plus cash purchased bots usually are far superior to custom made bots unless you spend a lot of time.I hate to watch another great game go down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ path of ""Oh my gawd we can make ♥♥♥♥♥ons of money here if we make it a pay2win."" But that's exactly where this game is currently headed for.			"

								It used to be good... It used to be really good... Now? It's a piece of trash.I read all of the most recent reviews, where most the veterans hours rated it negatively, and sadly, I could not agree more. The developers really messed this game up. They ran it straight into the ground, said ""Lets make this a more complex! Also add a MOBA mode! Lets screw around with the currency! Oh no! Are planes having a hard time with SMGs? Lets add HOMING ROCKETS and FLAK CANNONS! You know what? F**K IT! ADD AN INSTA-LOCK RAPID FIRING LASER THINGY AND A SHOTGUN! LETS ALSO ADD SOME MOBA BASED ABILITY BLOCKS! WOO HOO! NOW THE GAME IS SO MUCH F**KING BETTER!""They not only ran it into the ground, but poured hydrochloric acid on it, beat it up with a bat, took a big dump on it, and then threw it into the ocean. I would not be suprised if most of the playerbase has already abandoned the game, but lets take a look back into the golden ages...Tech ""Research"" Tree:There used to be a research tree type of unlocking system, where you could use points you earned from games to unlock the blocks you wanted. There were many different tiers of armors, guns, sheilds, radars, aerofoils, etc. And unltimately, it worked very well. I though it was pretty good. Then came the Level Unlocking System. You unlocked a new block each time you leveled up. and I said ""Ok... they didn't screw it up too bad. It's playable."" After all, I was already level 98. However, a little piece of me died that day. It took that special customizable feel away. With the old system, you had to choose what you wanted to upgrade depending on which area you specialized in, you chose the path of your robots design. Now, they just feed you whatever block they have at that level, and it is just not the same. Moving onto the most modern system... oh wait, I don't even know what it is. They don't even have a tab to cheack what blocks you unlocked!Weapons:It used to only be the railgun, SMG, and plasma. That was it. And tbh, I was glad that they added the Nano-Disrupters and Tesla blades. It only made the experience more fun with different types of robots and strategies. The downhill spiral started with the introduction of the Flak Cannon. It was powerful, had an area of effect, and obliterated planes. I was the plane type of guy. I loved to fly around in my Heli-Plane hybrid (gives you the speed and mobility of a plane and the hovering capabilities of a helicopter). SMGs were already a challenge for planes as one hit from a medium-high tier SMG could cripple your vehicle. The arrival of Flak Cannons rendered planes effectively useless, esspecially the slow ones. It didn't get any better from there. Homing rockets definitly did not make the situation any better. Of course there is going to be some where to hide when you are the in the middle of the sky. And the proto seeker is just a joke. What kind of weapon even is that and why would anyone add it to a game. A never miss, auto homing/locking, rapid fire, slightly sub-SMG damage laser. It just doesn't make any sense...And that is not it. The worst part comes with the new ""energy"" system. Seriously FreeJam?!?! YOU ARE GOING TO PUT ENERGY USAGE ON GUNS AND LIMIT THEIR FIRE? Hell no! The best part of robocraft was the big battles where people just just continuouly firing at the enemy team. Now, you just can't get that same euphoria from the heat of battle. This is just an example of making things more complicated.Then they adjusted how plasma cannons work. Instead of firing them all at once with a reload time, they made the firerate like a SMG's and it only shoots one ""plasma shell"" at a time. WTF!?! It is literally a SMG that shoots plasma projectiles! THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE! Plasma cannons are supposed to be shot all at once, demonstrating that powerful blast damage. And it was not overpowered or anything. Others could easily sustain plasma attacks with sheilds...There are many more mistakes that the devs made (mega boss battles, premium paint, epic loot, maximum loadout, failure to balance weapons, lack of new and cool maps, bad matchmaking, etc) but I have already dragged on too long. Just note, it is not worth the time and effort to play this game anymore. It's just not fun anymore.			"

								Looking for a well-balanced game with a subtle RPG-like leveling system and a beautiful tech-tree weapons upgrading system?Well, keep looking.No, Robocraft appears to have taken all the worst aspects of mobile gaming, crushed them together with the most ham-handed ""luck of the draw"" chance system, and sprinkled liberally with ""premium subscription"" asshattery.On the plus side, you can build really cool looking robots.  And you might get lucky and get a really powerful weapon out of a random loot crate.  Most likely, though, you'll spend most of your time loading your robots with the crappiest weapons in the game, then getting owned by twelve-year-olds who got a lucky weapon drop.It's something, but I wouldn't call it ""fun"".

								Okay I was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥last time I wrote this,I still am but this time ill leave something that people can actually learn from.This will be the general theme of this review-dont get this game-TLDR-The reward factor in this game is EXTREMELY LOW given the crate system,you do well but lose/and or get destroyed,you will get a crappy crate that gets you nothing. You feel discouraged to play more,and the reward system is horrible. Don't count on the devs changing anything though. They live in a shadow of ingnorance,thinking that the game is doing fine while the player count is dropping fast. I tried my best to belive in the game and the devs,but I can't bring myself to do it anymore. Crates were the nail in the coffin for me,and they aren't ever going to change it. No matter how many negative reviews this game on steam gets,they won't do a THING about it. Im Begging you reader,if you are considering this game dont get it,turn away, dont get sucked into the brutal cycle of RNG and addiction. Its sad becuase the concept of this game is good,execution is absolutely horrible. ♥♥♥♥ this game,im out. Okay robocraft was once an awesome kickass game. Really fun,innovative,you got an insentive to grind and you felt progress each time you bought something or went up in level. The ONLY reason why I am talking about the old robocraft (which was amazing) is because of the overall review that is positive.  But uh oh!!!!!! The devs screwed this game in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They got corrupted by greed and wanted more money. They added in crates,which was pretty much the doom of this game. You lost insentive to grind and felt no progress,and instead you have to now rely on RNG for good items,or you have to scrap items for currency that gives you only like 1/3 of its buy value from the store. oh yeah did i forget to mention that even if you do the best on your team and try your best to win the game but you lose,you will get the second to worse crate this game offers. The devs dont reward you for effort or skill,they do it off of luck, THIS GAME IS A SHELL OF WHAT IT USED TO BE. Gameplay-Having 600 plus hours into this game,I have a pretty good idea of the gamplay.Games in robocraft are really a flip of a coin. Sometimes you get people who disconnect and ruin your chances of winning by alot,sometimes you get people with cancer drones that you cant really do much about. DID I FORGET TO MENTION THE ABSOLUTE CRAP MATCHMAKING THERE IS??? The amount of seal clubbing in this game is horrible. It is almost imposiible to start out this game as a noob,becuase people with lomls weill ♥♥♥♥ you in 2 shots. You know what this game is so cancer now that i dont wanna put anymore effort into this review,so i will mkae a tldr on top.			"

								  Alright let me get it out...gun and robots are awesome! Sorry, this game is the best and has the player in mind. There is no goals or quests its just the pursuit to be the best in a robot battle arena. From the start you'll be thrown into the battle arena from ""Tier 1 - MegaBot Class"". Honestly I'm still Tier 9 but I can assure you, the player, that you are not losing anything from this free game and you can customize you bots to what ever you choose and has endless possibilities and capabilities for the future.  Enjoy!  KillaBitGaming Out!			"

								I have played RC for a very long time. over a couple of accounts and have watched the game drop down a deep dark hole. They destroyed the game with this new patch and alot of new players want to sit there and bash the vets about ""oh it is tears to play instead of tiers to play"". If you had any intelligence at all you would see that the before game was great. The tier system was amazing. The MM was great. Now it has been turned into crap. No leveling basically, and now these loot drops? wtf?!?!?!? Seriously devs you could have been so much more. I am very glad I never became a mod for this game now because I wouldnt want to be associated with the idiocracy of the developement or management of this game at all.			"

								I used to play this game alot, but since the last few updates came out, I couldn't help myself but delete the whole damn thing.The new ""anti-cheat system"" called EasyAntiCheat or EAC is restricting many players from playing the game, and the devs have done nothing to fix this. Even worse, according to many other users, the EAC actually publishes alot of this information for the public. 0/10 because for the majority this game is unplayable thanks to the ""revolutionary"" anti-cheat system.

								So I'm a doctor in behavioral medicine, and on my questionnaires that I give to people who play this game to determine their sanity, I ask them, ""Do you like loot crates and would you recommend this game?""If people answer YES, they're maniacs and will need straitjackets on them immediately. They pose a threat to society. We will throw these people into sound-proof cells and they will have multiple armed guards and scientists watching them.But in all seriousness, as a guy that spent more than $100 on this game with loot crates, please don't. You'll never be able to get the items you want, unless you're really lucky and get them somehow.			"

								I had started playing this game from almost the get go, I loved it, built so many robots. For most of it I was one of the worst players with the highest ranks. Now, I have 22 full equipped tier 10 (For those of you who remember when we had tiers #BringBackOldRobocraft) but I hardly play. It's utterly saddening to see how much of a train wreck this game has become. It used to let you unleash your creativity, but now you can release your creativity for $24.99As a robocraft veteran, I'd really like to see some justice brought back to the game. Especially for things like tiers, robits from battles (F**k crates man!), removing leagues etc. Some people may not agree. But personally I feel like the game has worsened because of these things. "

								I have been playing this game for a LONG time to be honest im addicted yes. down side is i've sent over 3 tickets concerning some issues about a event that is now done and OVER with. they never responded so if you like buying premium for 30days only to actually play for like 20 of them days due to glitches that disconnect you from every match or even worse glitches that let you wait in que for 20+ minutes only to never enter a battle, or even the periods of time that you cant even platoon with ANYONE!!! games great but they have promised several things and then change directions of the game quicker then my sister changing tv channels. (which is VERY ANNOYING) since i spend money and run my own clan of 50+ members that ALL play this game, this means im investing time and money into this game which makes me a customer that represents 50+ more customers. (1/4 my clan members already said screw this game) I do not know how other countries or people do business, I prefer to do my business with people who do what they say they are going to do, This company is not one of them companies. Only reason i am writing my first review of this game now is to HOPEFULLY grab the attention of the developers and let them see how they are letting a ton of players down. (Really wish i can say to my clan that do not play this game no more that ""its cool they fixed this and this and this""        not ""they added this but u cant still play so whats the point lol."")

								Let's start this off by saying I really...REALLY want to rate this game thumbs-up, but seeing the changes implemented since early 2015, I simply can't.When I first started playing Robocraft (Late 2014) it was an amazing game. They had a tech tree system to level up your equipment, you were able to purchase gear from a shop, by winning games you got currency, etc. But ever since the removal of the tech tree, this game has just been on a trip of steady decline. In recent updates, they have removed the ability to freely build your vehicle. The only way I have found to get new parts and accessories is by opening ""Crates"" to get ""loot."" You can then keep the loot, or recycle it to buy other items. I feel that this puts the whole ""Construct your own robot"" idea in the trash. I mean, this completely decimates the whole point of the game: being creative and constructing your own vehicle. It makes it so that you can only get 1 part at a time from each box (2 if you pay $$ for premium). They also removed the vehicle tier system. The whole system of tiers and and the tech tree was perfectly fine, there were no issues whatsoever. However, the developers decided to remove the tier and tech tree system (who knows why) and at first replace it with a ""buy items at your tier"" system, and then downgraded it to what it is now, getting loot from boxes. Also, by removing tiers, the matchmaking is even more buggy than it was before. It will pair up people who are exploiting by mounting a high level weapon on a very tiny vehicle, which will match them into low tier games. This was a slight problem before they removed the tech tree, but now I see it every match. Overall, I'm going to give this game a numerical score of 6/10. I feel I'm being generous because of the former passion I held for this game when it was still fun and enjoyable.			"

								I used to play this game every day.  I reached level 100 when there were still block tiers, which actually doesn't seem that long ago. A year ago, I would've, and did, recommend this game to several people. Now, I can't. The balance at every level is♥♥♥♥♥♥ At high level, it's gridlocky spam garbage. I can't even play low level deathmatch because my rank is incorporated into matchmaking, so even if I make a bot that's four blocks long with the worst wheels and a single cheap gun, I could be matched up against ridiculously well built bots that were made by lower level players.I used to try new builds pretty much daily, but innovation isn't rewarded now. I used to fly, but there are now three highly effective AA platforms. Long ago, air was superior, then it was terrible, then briefly great again, now it's worthless. I hope you like to make multiblade copters or tanks because that's all there is at the highest level. There used to be a sense of progression and a whole new set of things to try and get, but now everything is tierless and your robot is judged on its size. And man, the RNG loot crates sure are wonderful. Instead of getting a currency reward that I can use in the shop to purchase parts I want, I get random trash from a pool of parts and get to throw unwanted parts into a blender and get worthless scrap 'robits'.I miss what this game was and could've been. Freejam has been so focused on crafting a garbage, ""balanced"", build-your-hero MOBA that they lost the fun, casual team-based vehicle battle game that this used to be.			"

								I pretty much whole heartedly agree with Juvars review, so I won't post an in-depth one myself, and instead point you towards his (it should be on the top of the list).As it stands, I cannot recommend this game. FJ is doing very little to earn back my respect, or consider a rather large public outcry and is doing absolutely nothing to explain the reasoning behind a system that makes absolutely zero sense in their game. Instead of addressing the playerbases concerns they're trying to divert attention away from the negativity, quite a bit of constructive feedback, and questions regarding their reasoning and motivation by dangling year+ old QoL requested features in front of the playerbase like carrots on a stick.

								After 'the epic loot' it became certain, that Robocraft devs tried hard to monetarize each aspect of the game. Instead of progressing toward a richer building/crafting/fighting experience, they removed the faculties I liked the most (those capable of introducing teamplay for instance, or those that made victory dependant on skill). Each and every update they uttered some fluffy bla on how they are going to listen to their community next time.. then iterated on how 'their vision' of the game is grand and nice and still moved at least three steps backwards, for each step forward. I played this game alot, until their 'vision' became a toxic influence of ♥♥♥♥ing over established metagame with every update. They might not wanted to be destructive, but they are. What they never get is, that they were fixing problems they introduced themselves, Now with half of the old community already gone, they feel free to squeeze the last juice out of this once good game.  Who likes to open crates with random junk, when he could have the desired item bought directly. Nobody. But I dont want to create the idea, that the only abominable thing Freejam did, was the 'epic bull' update. No..no.. They had repeatedly the audacity to null my ingame cash balance with their updates,  - or similar.It first happened when tiers were removed: the week before I purchased tier 11 blocks for several billions, only to have them removed without refunds , with an 'upgrade' to their vision. Then they removed the Megabots, the one and only goal for a lvl 100 player. This meant removing several multi billion credit items, many players bought with ingame cash/ premium cash. Without a real refund. (well you got a stupid energy carger module, for each megabot)Well after all this Ripoff and Abuse, I stopped playing for a while, because of my old gamer buds, nobody cared about this game anymore. But with the 'loadout' upgrade I convinced some of this group to rejoin the game and play with me. That happened for a glorious week or two, until they decided to implement their ♥♥♥♥ing skinnerbox ripoff abuse lootgame. While they were trying to hijack my endorphin-receptors with their 'casinovision' of theirs, they silently removed 9000 units of premium cash and offered no refund except a protonium crate with 20 blocks.So now I stopped wasting my time/money on greedy idiots with a vision.

Robocrafts fun, well use to be in 2014 before the game breaking updates came, its even worse now- singleplayer for me either ends in a sent back to mothership, or robocraft.exe not responding. also lag in both single, multiplayer causing me to die as it just stops for a few seconds.On the otherside it is kinda fun, not as good as it use to be but creating bots is ok, either being scrap junk or op gunbeds.Also-  does anyone know what tier is in-between each ranking range? its also unbalanced for example early on, 50% of people have shields when you dont even have tier 2, play if you want but its a broken, glitchy game that was less glitchy ages ago.I'd say 6/10, above average as it IS actually fun but not excellent, it's just barely managed the 6/10- back in 2014 aka the prime days i'd say it was around 7.5-8, maybe even 8.5/10- Also whats the point of multiplayer apart from rp (the currency) as singleplayer gives alot of easy experience and rp aswell.

								At first this game was amazing, there was tactics and reliance on your teammates. Every type of bot had a unique purpose and was needed on a team. They even had a tier system that prevented the game from being pay to win... But all that is gone, there is barely a remnant of what used to be. The developers have taken all skill out of building your vehicle with the removal of cockpits and tiers. Playing this game quickly became who has played the longest, or who has spent the most money.TL:DRThis game is now a load of doo-doo with a dingleberry on top and I don't see it ever going back to the way it was.

SMG one of the 4 main weapons that endorces aiming skill unlike all new weapons has taken 3 beatings everythng got more health while new weapons always did more dmg and it is no longer instant hit like rail as it was a weaker version of it with good aimnig skill and also it has been given spread fire so it always misses some :D...I loved this game and always will a part of it that i and we as community have put it to make it awsome but generic btos all oevr the community market and n00bs already having been given shortcuts to be 'pro' has just broken the game. Along with the hopes of it community as it has now become more random tryhard n00b based than original crafters and players alot more to say but in short about everything that has happned to the game thanks to the devlopers has taken the heart out and broke the game. If they would have gone with the old style and listened to the pros in the community at the time it could have been great as it once was.			"

								ok i'm fully aware about what has been said negatively about this game however this game is doing what any great game has, it's trying to bring more people in and it gives a more easier system for some areas where even i was still learning (and i've played this game for about 2 years (on and off if you count the first year making three) but this game whilst having flaws like having all those nice and sweet vehicles that you have to buy to get. these vehicles however can be taken down with being smart and using smart tactics, the new tech tree system was a bit of odd one for them to implement however it does have its uses so that it makes the whole gameplay more faster (i was grinding through matches to have enough tech points for materials!) and whilst some may say that there is less amount of credits given out, i've earned more throughout matches then i have ever before! overall this game is amazing with the amount of creativity that'll satisfy the most outlandish (new word i think :D) of ideas and thinkers, this game has had its ups and downs but it is still a great game as long as you apply some knowledge to it as to counter one of these new vehicles that someone payed over $12 for. i hope the developers can see what their community puts out as to keep this game running overall.

								I have played Robocraft since it came out and I am extremely saddened by each new update. FreeJam is a horrible developer and I think that another good company should try and buy Robocraft before it goes down the drain. The old Robocraft with the Tech Tree and Tiers made you really want to get good at the game. I am also alarmed by the fact that FreeJam is making the game with tons of in app purchases. So it won't matter how good you are, what will matter is how much money you spend.			"

								This game used to be amazing! I stopped playing for a few months. Then I came back to find pretty much everything that made the game work so well, replaced with a terrible new broken system.The bot tier system that worked so well is replaced with this horrible bot ranking thing that pits you against pretty much random levels of bots. Half the time I was going in with my old T6 tank I was getting pitted against bots with almost max everything... How the heck is that better than the bot tier system that was very transparent and easy to work with for the players.Then there is almost no feeling of progression anymore because they did away with the tech tree! I mean WHAT!? How dumb do you have to be as a game developer to pull something like that. PLAYERS LIKE PROGRESSION and it was working fine. Now you just get everything unlocked.. woop-de-do that was so rewarding... NOTTo top it all off every time I went to join a game it would say average wait time ~30 seconds. Yet it took me on average 4-6 minutes to join a match that maybe lasted 3 if you dont die right away.This used to be a wonderful game. I loved it and put money into it. Now the developers have run it into the ground. It is very sad because I was super excited to play me some good ol robocraft again and spend some more $$ on it to catch up since I left it for a few months. R.I.P. Robocraft, Your developers ruined you...			"

								The game immediately grabs you in with the alluring promise to make whatever your mind can come up with; and it delivers, sort of.Quickly after a few level ups, you will notice everyone suddenly shifts to airplanes and rail guns.  Welcome to Mechwarrior Online 2.0.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the medics (even though I played one) pretty much ruin everything as far as strategy goes.  So the game turns into a turtle match of ""let's see who runs out of energy first"".That's not fun, it's never been fun.  Why would they think this is fun? They need to look at their low level tier matches and figure out exactly why people have fun at that stage.  Because right now building a robot or mech is absolutely pointless when the design doesn't help at all.  Shields don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥against rail weapons or missiles, or getting bombarded with plasma from one player.  It does nothing except weigh down your robot.  So there goes your imagination out the window, so much for refining your design.Upgrading your weapons also doesn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥except queue you with higher ranking players that have extremely powerful weapons, so what's the point? just stay low tier and never upgrade anything, you will experience the same game but less frustrating.  Especially with no lock-on missiles that you can't avoid unless you get out of it's distance range.I spent a measly 5 bucks on this game and I regret it now, it's extremely unbalanced, it's full of cowards and the designs mean nothing against a rail gun that blows up all of your defenses in one shot.

Early Access Review
								After playing this game for over 30 hours and progressing through 4 (almost 5) tiers, I think I'm qualified to write a good, informed review. The concept of this game is to build a functioning robot (it isn't really a robot due to the fact that you have a pilot seat, but that's beside the point) out of the parts they give you, then take this robot into battles. The more you fight with your robot, the more currency you earn (represented by RP) along with Tech Points, which are used to unlock new parts, which are then bought with RP. You must also use RP to repair your bot if it is damaged in battle, and the repair costs varry depending on just how damaged your bot was. Currently, there is only one gamemode in which you must capture the opponent's base before they capture yours. So, if you're a fan of varrying gamemodes I can't really recommend this to you...yet. One major thing that I feel like I should address is that this game does include microtransactions. BUT, before you hear that word and automatically deny the existance of the game, the game is not pay to win in the way that you would be able to notice it while playing a match, and arguably not pay to win at all. The reason for this is that the game works by matching up your bot with other bots which fit in your tier (I saw one of the reviews not recommending the game complaining that they are constantly matched with players in tiers higher then themselves, but I have never had that experience in over 30 hours of gameplay). Due to this system, someone who buys the best parts in the game is going to be automatically moved into the highest tier in the game, where they will still not gain an advantage over other players. If anything, those who pay for parts would have a disadvantage due to the fact that they are not as experienced in building their robots or fighting with them. Building off of my last sentence, the way you build your robot is very important. Someone with the lowest avaliable items in a tier with a well designed bot could still defeat someone with the highest weapons in the tier with a badly-designed bot.Another major aspect of this game is progression through levels. The only time this game gives me the feeling of grinding is after I've maxed out my robot for the tier I'm in but I don't quite want to step up to the next tier yet, which is really only a limit I put on myself. There is rarely a time (in the first 4 tiers anyway, I haven't progressed to the tiers above so I can't speak for those yet) when you get back from a battle and can't afford to upgrade your robot in a at least a minor way, such as upgrading a few sheets of armor. Due to this constant ability to upgrade at least something, I never really feel like I'm grinding away at the next level, but rather slowly progressing through the level towards the next one, something I really enjoy. All in all, Robocraft is a game with a great premise, currently limited gameplay elements (in terms of gamemodes) and a few glitches, but those are to be expected in early access games. I would recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted to be able to build and use the vehicle you take into battle and don't mind the fact that there is curently only one gamemode. To those who are turned away by that fact, there are still 3 maps which provide areas for using different strategies with different robots, adding some sort of variety into the gamemodes. Even if that still doesn't seem like enough of a redeeming factor, just try it anyway, as the worst that can happen if you end up absolutely hating it is that it took up some space on your computer and some of your time.

Early Access Review
								As almost every other person has stated, the new Epic Loot update has crippled the game unless you already have more of every part than you know what to do with. Before the update, you were given an amount of in-game currency dependent on how high your score was, independent of if you were at the top of the leaderboard. Now you get ""crates"" with random drops and most of the time those drops are either white for common or green for uncommon. There are 8 different items in most crates except for the lowest tier which is only 2, but unless you pay for premium you only get half of those items and the other half of them are there for ""incentive."" The worst part of it though is you only get 1 of each item unless it is a building block, so to reach your ""nominal"" counts for maximum dps and redundancy, you have to get very lucky and get the exact same part multiple times. Sure you could trade in some of the parts you don't want for the new currency, except that you only get 1/4 or less (many even down to 1/10th) of the value making it very pointless to trade anything in unless you have 20 of them and you want 2 more of something else in the same tier.And oh how the reward system got screwed over. Now after a match, you are given a crate based on how far up you are on the leaderboard, but only for the winning team. Only the top person gets the top tier crate, and it filters down from there. If you were the top player on the loosing team, too bad, you get the second to last tier crate like the rest of your team. No matter how well you play, if your team loses, you don't get a good reward. The funny thing is, while they state that the higher the crate tier, the higher the likelyhood you will get better parts, it seems the difference is negligible. You are better off getting many lower tier crates than one top tier, because you can still get anything from uncommon and up in the top tier.Along with not being able to build anything unless you had the parts pre-update, the new weapons along with the ""flattening"" made the top tier and new weapons about all that is useable. Unless you get lucky and pull one of the top tier weapons out of a crate, you better be running a lot of rails to deal with the people who have got those items. I say rails because nothing else does enough damage fast enough and in one spot to take out top teir weapons without having to be directly on top of your opponents. You better hope that you get a lot of them as well, because for the lowest tier you need 9 of them to reach nominal count. Speaking of nominal counts and why rails are the only viable non-top tier weapon, some of the other lowest tier weapons have a nominal count of 14! That means you have to make room for 14 individual guns that have to have space to move and can't be blocked. Lets take an example of what you would have to do to get the rail though: if you want a second tier rail setup, you have to get very lucky on your drops 8 times. You won't be able to buy them, because you would have to sell 220 of the lowest tier machine guns to get the 17,600 to make 8 second tier rails.I joined before the Epic Loot update, and managed to get to level 25 before it happened. I enjoyed the game previously, but since the update I have seen no reason to keep playing, let alone pay for premium! I was lucky and had some tier 1 rails before the update but they are noticeably lacking in firepower. For new palyers I would suggest waiting until they do some serious work on the loot system or decide to change it back.An interesting side note if you made it this far, check all the recent reviews. As of 5/20/16 the recent reviews are mostly negative with only 38% being positive out of 4,354 user reviews. FreeJam (the people who made this game) have stated that the general feedback has been mostly positive since the update. A quick scroll through the most recent reviews shows that many of the negative feedback involves at least a paragraph or more, while almost every positive review is a few words or an occasional sentence. The few exceptions in the positive reviews are people complaining about many of the same thing as the negative reviews, namely that if they are going to keep the random loot feature it needs work.Not one to complain and never offer any suggestions, the best I have seen and come up with are as follows:-Increase the excange rate and preferably make it flat across the board.    Something like 50% would be nice since they have stated they aren't bringing back ""currency.""-Allow for exchanging items for the same thing of the other side, such as left and right shields.    For when you have 8 left shields and only 1 right.-Instead of having completely spearate items for premium, double up on what non-premium gets.    Still good incentive for premium, not as degrading to those who don't have the money for it.-Rebalance weapons to bring back the usefullness of the machine guns and the morter rounds.    If all you have are long range rails on spider legs, shotguns on hovercraft, and missiles on    helicopters, it defeats the purpose of being able to build what you want.			"

								I may not have played this game much since the new update. but what I can say, is this: Robocraft used to a fun, unique game with team based gamemodes, with rewards based on how well you did. which allowed you to progress in the way you wanted. You  could build what you wanted and the bot still work semi-well.now. You get crates. which give you crap. even the best of crates will give you basic loot. which they claim is ""uncommon"" which is nothing more than the most basic weapons, the old Tier 1 items from when the game had tiers.There is no real progression you just hope you get what you want.There are an assortment of hacks out there for the game which ruins the fun for everyone else, because they can't play. Roboshield does nothing.  "

								After I decided to come back to the game, I managed to arrange some words to write this review again. Robocraft was supposed to be a good game because of its potential, but it was ""ruined"" ( According to the community ) by the Devs via update. What I experienced so far, asides from really pricy pieces of armaments and Premium related topic, is its pretty much unfair matches. As each matches are filled with fully geared players, which is OK to most seasoned players, but not for new players or other players that decided to replay the game ( which is debatable. )Conclusion : The game is fun at start, but high valued price tag and finding how you kept getting massacred by the other players will surely turn your table around. For now, I really can't recommend this game.			"

								I have played for 2 years, around 550+ hours, enjoyed it the first years when it was pretty balanced, from beginning to end.Now ? Now I would tell you to just look for a better game for you to play for free.The opened doors that shouldn't be open in their updates, everyone and everything can use any gun. That means that you can use the most overpowered gun that what thought it should be used for lategame into earlygame thanks to their so RNG boxes and crafting sistem. Not to mention that you will get 1/10 of the price of the items you get from boxes with their awful recycle sistem.There are RNGboxes that you can buy with money, and what comes, comes random, and that you could grind with time by winning boxes as you play. So you can either pay 100$ at start with 300 boxes of pure randomness, which can be painful since there is no skip button, and that if you don't have premium, you gain HALF what you get, so get that in mind, cuz premium for 6 months is 40 euros for me, maybe its another 50$ so in total is 150$Their ranked sistem is broken since 1st day... You are bronze at first, fighting against diamonds, Leveling up will be tedious as ♥♥♥♥, for you will be wanting to be AFKThe punishment to leave a game is 2 mins... Same goes for Ranked, 2 mins punishment if you leave. You will be also leaving since it will be a 6 vs 8 all the time.  Because wasting 10 mins for the enemy to destroy you when you can leave and wait 2 mins to start another and get a better reward is way efficient that wasting time.You can still aim with some weapons, but their is one weapon that you will be screaming of how the hell hide from it. Lock-on luncher missle. What you would thought that only tanks could carry such big weapon, helicopters and planes can fly above any cover for you to escape and destroy you over and over again.Until they Fix their balance with weapons weight and damage, or just go back to the old days that you will have to pick just 1 weapon for a bot, they I just can recomend this game to any.It went to a nice 8/10 to a 2/10. Awful game now.			"

								I thought I loved this game, but alas I did not. Here are the simple reasons why I really don't care for this game anymore.1. The Loot system- I love loot systems but when it comes to this game, it's horrible. I get the Protonium crate (the best crate the supposedly ""gives the most rarest of all items"") and I get greens EVERY SINGLE TIME.2. Unbalanced Matchmaking- Okay I thought the matchmaking was okay before this update but now I'm losing more than normal because I face a team that has a way higher cpu than me. 3. The weapons- If I had these weapons I probably wouldn't be complaining but since I face these really no-skill-involved weapons I tend to be killed in a matter of seconds no matter what.			"

								This game is extremely unbalanced. The wrong tier players are matched with incorrect tier players. I would love to play as a ""Robot"" but loose all hope when the opposing team are all flying robo... I mean ""Drones!"" Drones are not robots hence the difference in name and operation. I'm all for a bit of variety and quirky building, but to have my tactical designed Mech, that I spent a lot of time and care on  destroyed in an instant by a flying square on acid is really rediculous!Matches need to be fairly matched, based on equal levels and equal amount of robot type. Say 3 Mechs+ 3 tanks or Wheel vehicals and no more than 2 drones /planes/ helis ect a side, that would at least even the odds and build a little tactical advantage for both parties.I love the creativity i can put into this game and do enjoy playing it. Would it be at all possible to allow co-op in the practice range against the AI bots? This would be a nice change of pace from constant deathmatches with little reward and of course players could always have a mode where they work against each other whilst fending off the AI bots and accumulating the best score?Please sort this great game out and win back all the other players that have left disgruntled, ( just read the comments) I can't believe this games review says Very positive, I think a recount is in order, dont you?P.s single player crashes all the time loosing you progress, somtimes after 20 kills, everytime after one death or beating your high score by more than 25-30 kills, please fix thisThanks			"

								Just any other Free to Play game, you should pick this up for an hour and give it an open-minded go.In this game you build a tiny vehicle (I say vehicle, because robots do not require a pilot, because it is esstentially it's own pilot, but vehiclecraft doesn't sound as good, so I'll call it a robo) and then fight using it against other players who have built their own robot.You can build whatever you want. If you have the parts, it can be made. I've seen people make literal spider walkers (are usually seen in challenge mode or late into the game, like 80% into it), an smg car shaped like a person, a heavily armored box car, a car only describable as a quad from dune 2000, even a flying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that one time.You can make jets, hovercrafts, ""drones"", actual drones, helicopters, tanks, cars, and you can get to the end of the game's current progression to make gigantic versions of these where you can either pit it against tons of smaller, weaker enemies, or fight in a battle filled with giant robos!I have only gotten 27% into the game, Tier 3, but already I can make hovercraft, cars, tanks, hybrids of either of those and stuff.There are indeed weapons, and they all have their own uses and strengths and ways of using them. Indeed, this isn't call of Duty where tons of weapons exist, but all of them in a category all work basically the same.You've got 4 weapons. SMGs, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, and Nanotech Disruptor which heal allies and deals damage to enemies in a straight beam.The game abides by physics most of the time, so if your robo is not properly made, then you can expect to find problems, luckily there IS a practice mode that has no penalty or reward, filled with enemies you can test your robo against, some of them potentially player-made (THAT NEEDS TO BE A THING IF NOT! <3)This game is fun, just... don't get discouraged if some turd with a railgun goes into Tiers 1, 2 or 3. It happens a decent amount even though Tier 5 really should be a cut-off point for tech being below the tier it was meant for (Aka railguns below Tier 4 battles, or Helicopters below Tier 5. Walkers below Tier 7 isn't much of a big deal honestly because they're cool to the point I wished there was a Tier 4 version of them).you won't be able to make the robo you want to from the get-go (I personally have an obsession for walkers, sometimes bordering on fetish-territory if you throw on some missile launchers and beam cannons onto it xD).The only real downside to the game is the inability to mix and match weapon types. I suppose it helps for balance reasons, but it'd be cool if you could have two weapons at a time. Though then you could have medic guns on railgun planes, which would be a tad unfair.Each different item has its purpose and use, th only thing that is really much of an exception are the blocks, but they are instrumental in being tough to destroy as without them... well you're not tough to destroy as the original blocks are free for a reason.Spoiler: They're garbage above Tier 1.There's also Electro plates, which are indeed shield technology, but the precursor to it.Feel free to download this game and give it a try, it's really quite fun! Personally building the robo is my favorite part, let alone actually using it, which is even better.It's really fun.I also give this game a 6/10, which says alot for it's current state. There's not alot of bugs left and the devs have taken time and actually tried in their endeavor to make a great game which has probably very little content in comparison to the finished result, and 0 bugs or glitches pretty much.PS: This game has support for us OCD buggers who have to symmetry everything in the mirror mode. Press X or map the key in the controls menu under ""Build""Happy Building, and Merry Killing!			"

								I must admit I was really suprized to see all the negitive remarks about this once great game how ever they are all right they have completly screwed this game up. Progression is completly gone. They have turned this game in to a complete pile of crap.After playing a few matchs over the last month too add: The game has 0 balance, game breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed. Pay to win heavy... And laggy as heck..... DO NOT GIVE THESE GREEDY DEVS ANYTHING TILL THEY FIX THIS PILE OF JUNKAs of July 10th Nope just nope. Let the id10ts suport this trash. There is no balance at all level 20s going up aginst level 100 bots lol, pointless. I started a new account just to test to see what kind of bots I ran into, by the time I hit level 20 I was going up aginst bots the size of my main account (each level you get more cpu, more cpu equals bigger stronger parts). Which is 100 (150 is cap). Weapons that basicly one shot you over and over and over. The only thing the match maker does is put player in a game this is no tier or level grouping, no balance at all. Then theres the weapons, lol Teslas are a noobs best friend require 0 skill and basicly instal kill anything they run into and of course don't forget the lag your dead before you even see what hits you. I am so very sad this is the current state of this game. The devs have decided that a Pay-2-Win model is better as well as not even tring to balance anything. If you want to bang your head on you desk over and over and over by all means install this game. If you like being constanly pitted aginst bots that take your entire team to kill(while your whole team is destroyed)install this game. If you want a fair, balanced game play DO NOT INSTALL THIS TRASH.			"

								I have played tons of games on robocraft.  I have played this game since it was awarded indie game of the year, and might I say props to you for accomplishing that. That said, there are a few things that need to be taken into account:Balance: The game is EXTREMELY unbalanced, the auto lock on missiles are very hard to dodge and are expensive(more on this later) and now the timer has been dropped from taking 2.5 seconds to lock on, to 2 seconds. Not only is this devastating but the main weapons of the game: plasma cannons, and plasma lasers have taken some nerfs. Lasers have reduced fire rate and plasma cannons increase power consumption. This creates a huge divide from the premium users that paid money to get the missiles easily and the basic players who can only afford one laser of a high tier.End game rewards (and money issues in general):I consider myself to not be at the end game, but close to it. My weapons have gotten quite expensive as of late. To list off a few: Top laser disintegrator: 959,549  Plasma devastator: 1,107,169 Disc Shield: 10,876,430     Blink Module: 10,507,740 Aeroflak Cannon: 11,071,688 Lock-on Missile Launcher: 10,149,047Now, this list wouldn’t be too bad, if the payoff was about 60,000~, 80,000~ with premium users in the game. Now, understandably it is frustrating that the most I can get in a game is 110,000~ with a first win of the day bonus and premium users. So, all in all you are required to play approximately 126.86~ games to acquire 1 lock-on missile launcher, let me emphasis this ONE LOCK-ON MISSILE LAUNCHER, and in order to be any use to your team, you’re going to want to pack at least 2 of them, making the amount of games you need to play skyrocket to 252~. This is unbelievable and give NO incentive whatsoever to grind out the game for the RP. I can hear it now, how can I play this game if it takes so long to get something. Easy enough, you just have to pay real life money to obtain all of these weapons, problem solved. For translation it costs you 2,300GC for 1 missile launcher, that would approximate putting $2.50(and a little more to get 50 more GC) and to get two of them you need $5.00 for it. Doesn’t seem like a lot, but this is a “FREE TO PLAY GAME” Why then would you make the game free and then choose to make the game SUCH A HUGE GRIND that you cannot even begin to reach end game content without going past a pay wall or dedicating hours upon hours to a game.Additional premium content:On a side note, I have noticed that glass now costs GC to purchase, no RP method. The three principles upon which this game is built upon is “build, drive, fight” can you drive? Yes. Can you fight? Yes, now building on the other hand. Building has been limited in the terms of glass. Glass used to be a fun cool block that you can use in your vehicle to have, which is now gone, banished behind pay wall.Things they did well at: Fun and amazing gameplay Large variety of game modes to choose from Roboshop to help you get a ship if you suck at creativity Have more than 3 bays for free Testing area Gaining RP for testing your ship against bots (although it is minuscule)I will update my review as major parts of the game are tweaked, but at the moment if given the chance to rate the game at its current state, I would give it a 4/10. This game is below average, it can perform meh compared to most free-to-play Minecraft cube copy games. However, the game still needs LARGE improvements before it can be considered a game to play.

								A fun idea, but executed in the most uninspired way possible. At first glance it looks like it could have all sorts of possibilities for crazy vehicles and constructions, but due to the very limited number of origional parts, all vehicles are basically a bunch of cubes with guns stuck on them and some wheels or jets. There are many parts you can buy, but they are all just the same parts made slightly better. The list of parts is, currently, as follows: structural blocks, (including square and angled bits,) wheels, jets, hover jets, flotation blocks, wings, armour plates, and three types of guns; basic slowish shot, lobbed shot, slow long range shot. Most of these parts, namely everything but the blocks, wheels and basic gun, is locked when you start, so to actually build anything besides a box with wheels and a bunch of guns tacked onto it you will have to either pay hard cash for them or put in many hours of play. On top of all that, the only workable design for a vehicle seems to be your command seat surrounded by as much mass as you can pile around it, and as many guns as you can fit on the top and sides, because there is no strategy to the game other than drive toward the enemy and hope you can shoot more than he can.To conclude this rambling, I would not reccomend this game in the least. If you think the developers may actually get around to making this game less of an uninspired blob of sadly unexplored concepts, by all means keep an eye on this game, but for now don't waste your time. Or your money.			"

								Downloaded the game last night, went to sleep, woke up, made my first robot, went into an online match with my basic equipment, was immediately destroyed by everyone in the game using instant one-shot weapons.I gotta say, Robocraft currently feels very new player unfriendly from my short experience with the game. Without spending real life money, you have to seriously hope the RNG of the loot boxes gives you something good enough to even remotely compete against those who have either been playing long before the loot box update or those who spent money for their gear. Would I still be playing if I got lucky and got some powerful weapons from the boxes? Honestly... Can't say I would. First impressions can often make or break a game for me, and the bad time I had with the match making, loot system, and painfully floaty controls have made me feel like this game, in its current state, is not worth my time. Should major things like the RNG and match making be balanced later though, I may come back.			"

 Freejam, do you even care what your player base thinks??http://steamcharts.com/app/301520#AllMarch 14th 2017 updated review:  As you can see I have a lot of time in this game.  Mainly because 4 years ago I purchased currency to support the devs and so I have a bit of an investment.  I would suggest NOT giving these guys your money as the game stands right now (worth noting, they promise no game overhauls now that they are in beta, so this opinion will probably stand). And although the makers (freejam) of robocraft still tout the ""best indie game of 2014"" label and award, don't believe for a second the game is what it was in 2014.   The game play is garbage, sit on a point and wait, you must cap all three points in order to steal points (energy) from the other side.  The other team can cap a protonium crystal that emerges to tie the game despite having a huge lead on the other team (such as 90% and 5%).  These guys basically tell you one thing and do something different and say they appreciate feedback, but don't listen to their masses (read: I wouldn't bother giving them feedback at this point).Hopefully there will be something that allows the creativity, progression, and game play this game once offered.  I am stuck in this game until then, but I wouldn't suggest getting caught in this mess of a game too.April 30th 2016 update:   An update (800+hours of actual game play) and you should know I was really excited.Epic loot update = disgusting. Premium rediculously increased and lowered in value. Rather than giving us new content they changed the numbers of damage/mass/armour values and called this an update.+ Since the spectrum update, they did make league mode optional and thank you FJ for this.The new 'epic loot' update, has killed a lot of the creativity. You spend 700 pflops (out of 1700 for your bot) and those guns do nearly nothing. The new meta is shotguns and rails (snipers). If you like this class then this game is for you.The new loot drop system is uninteresting and leaves a void (for me) of the refreshing newness of prior robocraft days where you could move fast and shoot fast. The controls feel clunky, and there was no warning about the change of mass for their updates.The part that is most disappointing is how much this game micromanages it's player base. Touted as a creation based system, every change is aimed at nerfing new builds that people come up with (or at least it feels that way), yet some of the most problematic abuses (tessaracts) that clearly violate the games physics (seriously corner cubes barely touch each other) are left in the game.The loot drop system would bother me as a new player simply because i have to wait for items to appear. Got an epic item? Hope you are leveled enough to use it.We were told there was going to be an ""epic update"" and many of us were seriously excited for this. What they didn't tell you is that the real ""epicness"" of this update was that they were playing with numbers and calling it an update. No new game mode, no new maps. Final notes on the loot system.  I have to say this being a game for young gamers, I really dislike the gambling aspect where users buy crates.  This encourages gambling and gaming, both pretty addictive.  I only say this as a watchdog for younger gamers especially, and because this game is geared towards younger gamers.  Lots of dislike from me on this.Perhaps I am just a dated gamer at 3+ years of robocraft game play and can't do change. I don't take back the money I've given the dev's but I won't be continuing to support them if this is the new robocraft norm. This game is clearly looking to make money (I don't blame them for this, I am just disappointed to have my crack taken away) rather than be a groundbreaking creation game. This is just my opinion of the current opening release of the 'loot update'			"

								So I've played Robocraft since it came out, only around 261 hours, but would play a little here and there so I wouldn't spoil too much after they relased from Early Access. I will be uninstalling this game now.You used to get currency from playing. You would spend said currenty to buy cubes/weapons/items to customize and build your vehicles. It was a very easy system and honestly I had very little complaints. You can't do this anymore.There is no currency now. You cannot buy cubes/weapons/items anymore. You can buy 'Loot Crates' or win crates from playing. What do you get when you open these crates? Random cubes/weapons/items. Random. Stuff.So I can't just build what I want now. I can't simply buy the cubes I need. No, now I have to play with what I 'unlock' from these random loot boxes. I am lucky enough that I have a couple of vehicles built from before this last 'Loot Box Update'. This is not the game I want to play and it IS NOT the game I started playing. I do not recommend playing this game.			"

I bought six months premium before the update, now i just wish i had money back.			"

Early Access Review
								Please note that I am currently unable to play the game due to a crash at startup upon viewing a crate that I recievecd during a battle. I am not the only one experiencing this issue, and as far as I can tell, reports go back as far as two to three weeks ago with no answer from the developers or staff in any thread other than ""Don't bump threads"". The official respons I got from a support ticket is recreated below:""Hi,Thanks for contacting Freejam Support!This is an issue we are aware of and one we are currently working to fix as soon as possible.You should make sure to check the patch notes of our next update as information on bug fixes will be displayed there.Thank you for your continued support and patience and we apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused.Thanks again,DanSupportJammer""Below is my review of the game at this point. I have tried to remain as un-biased as possible with respect to the crash problem I mentioned earlier.-------------------------------Robocraft used to be a game about building robots and fighting to the death. It used to emphasize builder skill and fighting tactics like recognizing the weak points on your opponents robot.Used to.The game now heavily focus on a MOBA style game mode without minions where teams of 8-12 players capture towers across the map. Each tower captured increases their weapons effectiveness against capturing other towers and damaging the opposing team's main reactor. If your team captures all three towers, the enemy's shield around their reactor goes down. If your shield goes down, you can no longer heal when in close proximity of the reactor, and must instead avoid enemy fire to heal automatically.I built a quick robot that can capture a tower solo in the mid to late game in 5 seconds, and I can easily solo the enemy's reactor if their shild is down in the late game in under 30 seconds. If you are on a team that knows how to capture towers quickly then the game will be over quickly, you will get a decent reward, and you can continue grinding. If however your team doesn't know what they're doing, frequently splits up, and suicides into huge balls of enemies while the other team knows how to quickly captures towers, your life will be miserable. You will get only up to the third lowest quality crate if you are top on the losing team.There are other game modes, currently a team-death-match and free for all, but rewards for players in this game mode are so small that it really isn't worth it unless you already have most of the functional parts.Notice that I said ""if you already have the parts"". You are not rewarded with currency in this game unlike most other online games. Instead, at the end of a match, you are rewarded with a crate containing one or more random items ranging from armor and cosmetics to weapons and functional parts. The better you do, the better the parts you will recieve (supposedly). Players who pay for the premium boost get twice as many items, but do not have a higher chance at getting **better** items as far as I can tell. Items can be broken down into ""Robits"" that can then be used to craft parts that the player wants.Unfortunately, this move has massively inflated the currency used by players. Under the old system, sell-back value was exactly half that of the cost to purchase a part, and players were rewarded with currency directly. Under the new system, almost all parts are recycled into a measly 1/10 that of the price to buy a part, effectively increasing the time required to grind out the robits needed to purchase the parts you want by at least 10 times (this ignores the fact that you **may** get the parts you want in a random crate drop, but in my experience, the system likes to give you 10-50 cubes instead which decompose into one robit each)Supposedly, this has been improved a lot over the past week, however as I mentioned before, I am unable to verify as I cannot play the game currently due to crashes.This game is littered with technical problems. Players getting under the map, weapons that sometimes fire and sometimes don't, special modules sometimes crashing the game for players, graphical glitches, and horrible de-sync errors which cause everyone to stop moving to your perspective. In this de-sync'd state you can still damage the enemy a little, but as far as the game is concerned you have disgraced your team and quit, thus you get no reward and are even punished for ""leaving"" early if you were playing the moba game mode, which is very frustrating. Tech support swears that this is due to a misconfigured MTU setting on your router, but numerous players can testify otherwise.Furthermore, the developers seem to have no sense of direction. Sweeping change after sweeping change, they keep steamrolling on ahead implementing new features, weapons, and game modes, and completely changing many critical core mechanics, forcing the players to adapt rapidly. This game uses the ""alpha"" and ""early access"" moniker as a massive crutch to hide behind the litany of issues and bugs the developers leave in their wake. The community technical support forum is a ghost town, players reporting critical issues have their threads relocated there to never be responded to by any developer or staff member. This is sad really.Overall, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Too much has changed, and it feels like FreeJam are only listening to new players while shoving their fingers in their ears and ignoring the rest of the community.Sadly, this remindes me of a game I used to play: Battlefield Heroes by Dice / EA. Shortly before the open beta started, the developers completely re-worked the way rewards worked, massivly inflating the currency so that any player who wanted to progress at anything better than a sloth's pace was forced to spend money. The community split in two, and many players never returned. I hope this game does not face a similar fate...			"

								Robocraft is a game about building your own robot from a huge numbers of part and battle against other robots in a third person style shooter.As you can see, I spent a long time with the game and really, really liked it. Unfortunately, the direction the developer decided to take isn't mine. In the past, you had a performance based reward system that made it easy to get the parts you need to build a robot.Now, the reward system is largely based on luck and randomness. Good luck getting all the parts you need to build the robot you want in a timely manner. It's not possible anymore.In the past, you could spend money to get part that you want. Currently, you can spend money on a lottery-like system (buying crates with random items). This system is proven to work for games like Hearthstone, but in a building game, where you need a certain amount of wheels, tracks or guns, to build the robot you like, this just isn't fair for the player.

								This is a prime example how greed and ignorance ruined a somewhat decent game. The devs refuse to listen to people who have more than 2000 hours clocked in, removing good features and making acquiring parts more and more difficult. Because they removed levelgating players, and apparently any sort of matchmaking too, the game is hell for players who dont have the expensive weapons. What we are left with is pay to win legendary turrets strapped to singe block with some hover blades stuck to it destroying everything else, since nowaday the turret alone counts as a robot and can upon losing its paltform still shoot and survive multiple top tier railgun hits. I would have said they should name this to 'Credit card wars', but since the latest extortion scheme they introduced, you have to gamble for building parts.			"

You will get only up to the third lowest quality crate if you are top on the losing team.There are other game modes, currently a team-death-match and free for all, but rewards for players in this game mode are so small that it really isn't worth it unless you already have most of the functional parts.Notice that I said ""if you already have the parts"". You are not rewarded with currency in this game unlike most other online games. Instead, at the end of a match, you are rewarded with a crate containing one or more random items ranging from armor and cosmetics to weapons and functional parts. The better you do, the better the parts you will recieve (supposedly). Players who pay for the premium boost get twice as many items, but do not have a higher chance at getting **better** items as far as I can tell. Items can be broken down into ""Robits"" that can then be used to craft parts that the player wants.Unfortunately, this move has massively inflated the currency used by players. Under the old system, sell-back value was exactly half that of the cost to purchase a part, and players were rewarded with currency directly. Under the new system, almost all parts are recycled into a measly 1/10 that of the price to buy a part, effectively increasing the time required to grind out the robits needed to purchase the parts you want by at least 10 times (this ignores the fact that you **may** get the parts you want in a random crate drop, but in my experience, the system likes to give you 10-50 cubes instead which decompose into one robit each)Supposedly, this has been improved a lot over the past week, however as I mentioned before, I am unable to verify as I cannot play the game currently due to crashes.This game is littered with technical problems. Players getting under the map, weapons that sometimes fire and sometimes don't, special modules sometimes crashing the game for players, graphical glitches, and horrible de-sync errors which cause everyone to stop moving to your perspective. In this de-sync'd state you can still damage the enemy a little, but as far as the game is concerned you have disgraced your team and quit, thus you get no reward and are even punished for ""leaving"" early if you were playing the moba game mode, which is very frustrating. Tech support swears that this is due to a misconfigured MTU setting on your router, but numerous players can testify otherwise.Furthermore, the developers seem to have no sense of direction. Sweeping change after sweeping change, they keep steamrolling on ahead implementing new features, weapons, and game modes, and completely changing many critical core mechanics, forcing the players to adapt rapidly. This game uses the ""alpha"" and ""early access"" moniker as a massive crutch to hide behind the litany of issues and bugs the developers leave in their wake. The community technical support forum is a ghost town, players reporting critical issues have their threads relocated there to never be responded to by any developer or staff member. This is sad really.Overall, I would not recommend the game in its current state. Too much has changed, and it feels like FreeJam are only listening to new players while shoving their fingers in their ears and ignoring the rest of the community.Sadly, this remindes me of a game I used to play: Battlefield Heroes by Dice / EA. Shortly before the open beta started, the developers completely re-worked the way rewards worked, massivly inflating the currency so that any player who wanted to progress at anything better than a sloth's pace was forced to spend money. The community split in two, and many players never returned. I hope this game does not face a similar fate...			"

								With the release of the Epic Loot update, I have come to the conclusion that this game is no longer worth playing. After having been cheated out of gear due to crashes and bugs, and having what little I did get held behind a paywall, I'm sad to say that this game has finally hit the point of no return. Do not download, do not play. Uninstall if you have it, and get your diskspace back. This game has died. It was fun, once. I actually kinda enjoyed it. But now, it's just another crate simulator, grind and grind to get one single item, then scrap it and grind some more. That's not what this game was about a long time ago, but that's what it has devolved to. Goodbye Freejam, I won't be using your products again anytime soon. You ruined something promising.			"

								The loot crate update killed this game.Prior to the last major update, I would've strongly recommended this game. Its core gameplay is unique and it's a ton of fun to bring vehicles you build yourself. But changing the progression from a quick, quality-driven system to a total RNG nightmare makes the quality of the building and gameplay meaningless. Thanks to harsh RNG gating off players' abilities to build vehicles, which is the core of this game, and players no longer being able to just buy parts with currency earned from gameplay performance, there isn't any reason to get into the game in its current state.

								Alright guys it says I have played 15.7 on record but if you trust me you would know I had actually played over 100 hours. I wont go into detail on why that is so. When I first picked up this game I fell in love with it and it actually was really fun, of course I made the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ship and charged it at people only to be destroyed just like my irl sex life. But alas then came in the facist regime AKA the game devs, they had made updates every month or so that absolutely everyone disagreed with, they made the tech tree no longer as the composure of a tree it used to be but instead a leveling system. They made new game modes nobody liked. Honestly I feel bad for hitler because when I call the devs of this game nazis it truly gives them a bad name. But on the real deal, this game was dank but progressively gets less and less dank over time to the point where it just isnt fun anymore. So in protest I just drive around with a swastika if I can even find that fun. Seriously, this game was precious and a treasure but the devs updates hit the game like Hiroshima10/10 would want to stop the facist regime again			"

								Ok time to edit my review after 1 more year of waiting, this time i will make it clear:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Time played: almost 300 hours, becuz i stoped playing it.Level: 132When i started: umm...i dont remeber it to good but it was in 2014------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok, my opinion about this:Overall rating 5/10 still enjoyable but only 10% of the fun you had before 2015So where to start oh yeah when they start removing the feature where you had to pay like 60% of your winning for your robot to heal it in the bay wich was a good thing and you started to make enought money for the arts you needed, then remeber that tech tree wich forced you to actually play to game insteed of grinding it well that was the most fun part of it and you had to think before unlocking something....but hey lets remove that becuz that's what noobs players and our boos said !!!Then the new level tree come wich wasnt great at all.. but wait thats not all why not remove that to and add a crate system so the people have to grind even more for a ♥♥♥♥ING PART THEY NEED cuz the part recycling its giving you only  20% of your hard work ( grind )Also lets remove some cool fun modes like Boss battle, mega bot... oh good times, good timesAlso why not lets remove GC and let people buy crates with the money we converted so they get only 50% of what they would getAnd many others features and and cool things got remove but hey people still play this game so until nobody will stop playing the devs will do their updates hoping for their game to be great again but i dont think so.                                  #Bringbackoldrobocraft			"

								This is my first review on any of the countless games i have on steam, yet it is a review that saddens me.In the begining of robocraft it felt like a fun, well planned game. Of course there were bugs and lag issues but it was a great game.Now with the last patch in place i no longer feel any attraction to play it. It has become a pure rng-game where you might get stuff if you lose and you might get stuff when you win.Theres nothing to really aim for anymore, except grinding through gamemodes which has become more limited over time in the hopes of getting something of use.Betrayed and let down are the feelings that come to mind.I honestly hope that the devs come back around, else this might very well be the begining of the end for robocraft.

								I try to be balanced and unemotional when reviewing games. When I first started playing robocraft, it was fantastic. There was good progression, each battle rewarded you in accordance with your performance, and you could be very creative with your builds.This was because you could buy whatever you needed either with in-game currency from good performance or with cash it the mood struck you. There was no pressure to buy, and premium was so inexpensive that I didn't blink an eye at paying for it each day I actually played Robocraft. Then all that changed. Now the game is a diceroll. I have received top score protonium crates dozens of times only to be handed cosmetic and useless items. The items are just as useless to sell, and so unless the dice smile upon you, your performance and rank are meaningless and you remain stuck with the equipement you have. It is a testament to the crappiness of this update that most of the equipment on my robot predates the update. I haven't been able to get anything better.Constant messages are released by the developper about how they're ensuring better quality items are dropped. They're clearly not trying very hard as the stream of sewage (green ""uncommon"" items) continues. It is becoming hard to view this as anything other than a pay-to-win cash grab.I'm trying to hang in there, but I'm nearly done with it.  If you're just discovering Robocraft now, I'm sorry to have to tell you that you missed something really great. It's gone now. I'd move on.			"

								I will sum up this game as best as possible.I'm no pro critic but this is what I think of it,(I played months ago the game may have changed by now or gotten worse)For starters you got your average building game with crafts. It's good and all but you want more parts? Level up!OR if you're a rich person who likes to throw away money and waste the game, Pay for premium!With Premium you get to instantly play the game and fund for the devs to keep making it worse!And what's more better than that!?Now for actual game it's good but it's utterly ruined by the massive ""pay to win!"" Aspect.I like it kind of but. Why am I paying to keep up and get better. Why do people get to do this.And why isn't premium forever?You have to pay monthly? No ♥♥♥♥ that! That's a huge scam in on its own!I suggest you play a bit of offline mode first before online. The devs tried to be funny. Yet their AI craft goes against guidline... With crafts that have add ons like ""girl with boobs mk1""Overall I don't know what to say the game seems pay to win but if you feel like dedicating hours and hours into offline mode to level up and get better. Well that's your choice. Edit are you f*cking serious!?They replaced the g*ddamn currency system with CRATES? WELL HOLY F*CK. F*CK PROGRESSION. LETS RUIN THE GAME AND FIND MORE WAYS TO MAKE PLAYERS HAVE A REASON TO PAY FOR PREMIUM.The devs of this game are worse than EA.Just money grubbing losers who think they can do a cash grab.Their recent update to my knowledge with the ""loot crates"" completely got rid of the player currency system so you have to rely on ""unboxing loot!?"" Does this game look like borderlands!? Nah. Cut the sh*t with unboxing.Not to mention if you're wondering what the currency system did, it let you buy parts and actually advance in the game. Loot? That's just a cash grab because you can always buy things with  Premium . That's right. Pay for the game to support the developers  cancerous  habits of ruining the game and you can say f*ck the rules as long as you feed the devs cash for being lazy sh*ts every 5 to 10 seconds.			"

								It was my achievement to get to the highest tier. Which the devs destroyed when they removed the tier progression and replaced it with a ranking system. But it did not stop me from playing.The removal of the Mega bots saddens since it was my dream to build the perfect team captain bot.... I did build it but it was a day before the removal( I have other megas but unsuccessful)When 'Maximum Loadout' was implemented, it was a quite an idea... being a one man army tank is really something. Not a bad update for me.. But what destroyed my love for Robocraft was the 'Epic Loot Update' which made it harder to build the tank/plane of my dreams.Please FJ bring back the old one... I have been playing this game eversince money was needed to repair the bots....I'm sorry but I will not recommend this...EDIT: Alright, I'm going to list down a few suggestions to the game because a random person told me this: 'kiss my♥♥♥♥♥ this game is awesome, If you don't like it then leave ♥♥♥♥tard!'So, I'll be brief. If you want the longer one's, there are others who explained it really well.Suggestions:-bring back the tiers-bring back the tech tree-bring back the armored blocks of each tier-smg, plasma, rails, and nano's are enough to get the game going, remove the other weapons that throws away balance-bring back the old currency-bring back megabots-add more maps!-remove auto-heal-add more maps!-add more gametypes to choose from, this game has a lot of opportunities rather than fighting! (Racing, perhaps?)-also, adding in the game balance.    >ground unit vs ground units, no flying movers allowed. Flying unit vs flying unit... Drone vs drones, so on and so forth. Balance may also depend on the amout of the cpu.-remove the multi weapon equipped tanks, because it ruins player based roles of individual tanks.-add more maps!-medics can damage enemies again!-fix the reload system. Don't do mana type thingy, plus the module should have a separate energy used.-don't do all machine gun like guns, it does not really suit plasma, especially nanos.-remove loot crates( or maybe add loot crates with the old currency but crates will be rare to find :P)-fix the game, freejam. It takes 30 minutes just to start a decent game without  any errors-lastly, add more maps!So, what do you think? did I miss some parts? is this pretty balanced (because, sure as hell it is never going to be balanced with trolls around). So, those are my suggestion that FJ will not even try to read. Have a pootis day!			"

								This game has definitely changed a lot over the past year.  Everything was originally just a deathmatch with no respawning.  Now it has mini-bases that you must destroy and claim as your own, which then strengthens your main base or something...  I don't know exactly how it works but the point is that if you find the new mode too complicated, you can still go back to the original deathmatch mode.  Everything you see and hear from the trailers above can give you an idea about how it works, with you building your own war machines and stuff, so I won't waste your time.  Really the only downside to this game is the long waiting times to get into a match recently now that so many people are on at once, but I'm sure that will be fixed soon enough.  Oh wait, I haven't said something funny yet.   Sarah Palin!  Now give me 10,000 likes.			"

Very powerful shotguns I've never seen before destroy me, as well as more skilled players. Matchmaking is now a mess (and why can't I see where I am in the ranks like most competitive games? like starcraft, you know?) and earning new gear is a mix between an awful grind or you can pay for crates which are the equivalent of gambling. Enough people complained about the new paid for crate system that they changed it, but no refunds or re-issuances of crates occured. The dev's response to complaints? ""It's mostly veterans complaining, because we had made the game too easy for them."" As a new player, I guess I came pre-salted.			"

								Poorly executed sandbox building FPS. Went from intricate 10 tier system to gambling for parts. Under 50 functional cubes, the rest are nonsense cosmetics used to inflate cube count. Even if you dump money into the game, you won\'t be able to get the part you need. Over-all a poster child for bad development in the vein of StarForge and The Stomping Land.			"

								I may still play the game every now and then, to see how things are doing, but honestly, the game began going downhill long ago. First, the tier-flattening from ten tiers down to five. Next, the introduction of weapons other than the original trio (SMG, plasma and rail) and the Nanotech Disruptors, starting with Flak. The introduction of using multiple weapons at once sealed the deal, and this new loot-crate system is just the devs taunting us all. The energy system was strategic, at least for a while, but with the loot crate system's rebalance to all weapons, it's now just ""there,"" as energy runs out either too quickly or too slowly.The game is now more of a contest of who can shoot first, between shotgun-mechs and shotgun-hovers, ""Tesla trolls"" who waste all their energy in one shot and are only efficient in cutting large guns like shotguns and flaks off of enemy mechs, then taking ages to kill them, and railgun-bed mechs who are literally just 9 or so mech legs held together with aero-rods (extended connectors) and coated in railguns.And yet, what do the devs do? They pretend it's the tiering that's the problem, so they get rid of tiering all at once, allowing new players with tiny starter bots to run into hulking colossi lugging around shotguns, missile launchers and flak cannons that promptly one-shot them.I would post a legitimate review, since the game used to be simple and fun, back when Nanotech Disruptors were introduced, and even before that, but I literally cannot think of any positives for the game now. The gameplay has gotten glitchy and laggy with all the new weapons introduced, and the old weapons have been made either grossly overpowered or grossly underpowered. Armor tiering was removed, along with weapon tiering, so everybody's the exact same. And while you'd think that might help make it more skill-based (the devs sure did,) believe me, it doesn't. The gameplay stayed the exact same in some cases, and got worse in other cases, while we had less and less variety to work with over time.And the ""paint"" for your bots... having to pay to use the colors that were previously free for everyone to use via different tiers of armor? Low-blow. But, I guess Freejam has gone the path of the greedy dev on this one, since now, with the introduction of the loot crate system, you have to use RNG just to earn money, and the RNG itself is horrific, it doesn't scale with level either so a new player might get parts that are too big for their bots that they'll have to scrap and sell, and scrapping/selling them returns barely any money.Meanwhile, a high-level player, at the same time, will get those same parts, which are too weak for his usage, and so he has to do three dozen matches and top-score every single one just to get enough ""Robits"" to buy one Tier 5 leg for his mech, thanks to how bad the RNG is. Meanwhile, both players frequently win Epic and Legendary parts for their bots... but those Epics and Legendaries ALWAYS show up in the ""premium row"" where you'd have to be paying to get the loot. Eeeeh... maybe it's just a coincidence... you know what? No. No it is not.With how the new update works, the monetary gain from fighting in a high-tier match is the same as fighting in a low-tier match, so seal-clubbing is now going to be the game's meta, as high-level players take all their skills and fancy bots against absolute newbies just starting the game, in order for an easy win and top score in order to get the best loot crate available. Meanwhile, the newbies are getting decimated, and most likely will end up quitting within a few days of trying the game.I could go on and on forever about how Freejam's devs really, really messed this one up, but I'll cut myself off here for now. Let it be said, the only reason for you to play Robocraft now is... well, actually, I can't think of any. Oh well.			"

								I hate to have to get on the bandwagon, but the new update is an abomination on one of the most unique and potentially briliant games I've ever played. Loot crates are a terrible system in any game, but putting them in one like this that's focused so strongly on creativity is a joke. They need to go back to a currency based system that rewards players properly instead of at random. If they really feel the need to have one of these asinine ""blind bag"" systems that focus more on exploiting gambling addiction than any sort of fun, it should be secondary to a more reliable system of currency.. like the one they threw out.I'm not sure what goes through the minds of the Robocraft devs, but I've never seen a game flail around so much in terms of its core systems. It's like the whole thing is just an experiment and they have no actual vision for what the game should be. Many of the things they've changed over the years have been improvements, but this one... if anything, it seems like a misguided marketing idea. I deeply hope they come back to what made Robocraft great some day, and stick with it.			"

No longer recomended.With the new update the devs basically removed every feature of the game that made Robocraft unique and enjoyable.Building your own vehicle from scratch, planning and designing it is no longer a thing. Progress and working for your new parts, unlocking new stuff on your tech tree has been replaced by a stupid luckbased and dull farming, just like every other generic multiplayer. They just want you to buy their overpriced premium.This game has come from awsome indi game to generic money grabbing. Just really really sad...			"

								The game was a lot better back in 2014 but the development team are amatuers at best. Failure to learn from their mistakes (and there are many) which has been proven again and again over the 2 years of updates I've suffered playing this game.Match Making is appaulling and punishes new players and skllled players. The outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design. The problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in 2015 (Battle Arena Update) which broke the game (Overclocking mechanic) and reduced the playerbase to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times. The removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system, just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together. This relates to the poor match making.Mega Bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them. Mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers lask the skill to resolve.Failure to add key features for the community like Clans (This could make the game if they bothered to implement it)They treat the players/customers with little consideration when they release major changes. Often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws.They only care about new players who spend real money. Membership exists but it offers such poor value I suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the playerbase has taken up the offer.  If you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year. Spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in Alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility.The most recent update changed the ingame economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item. The items can be converted into ingame currency for a fraction of its price. Effectively you can grind the free to play model, convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crates/items for real money at extortionate rates. They have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the vetern players. This game is now looking more like 'free to install' and 'pay to compete'			"

In phase one it would announce what they were, for example, 'rail walker spotted' or 'smg cruiser spotted' making it easier to determine whether to strike or not. Also, after 4 months of farming just to get to lvl 32-33, they hand out lvl 88 from the alienware giveaway. This meant they shaved off months or even a year of grinding.

								Me (At Launch): I like this game! It's a unique vehicular-based shooter where teamwork and communication are the keys to success! Sadly, this game is filled with 10 year olds, but even without communication its a cool time killer. You get to design your vehicle fairly easy, and its pretty cool that everyone has a different machine, adding a large amount of diversity to the game. To get cubes to build your vehicle, you earn a currency during matches that you can buy cubes with and you unlock more cube with a different currency. There is another currency that costs real money, but it buys the same thing as the F2P currency and a couple cosmetics but that's it. A very fun game.Me (Later): Ok they changed the game a little bit, in ways i don't really like, but it is still an ok game. You still have the F2P currency and the P2P currency but now you don't need to unlock the cubes. It makes it so someone can take a Super-OP gun and put it on their tiny vehicle and it gets grouped up with the weak-vehicles with 20 very-weak guns. It doesn't matter how small the OP vehicle is because it kills anything that it sees instantly. There is also now a ""community"" market, which allows people to post their creations and other people can download them, if they pay for all the cubes that it costs to build it. A cool sharing system, but now people can just download the very-well built vehicles, which means now there is no creativity or diversity in most matches when 5 people have the same OP vehicle. A pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t update if you ask me, but the game is still all right, I guess...Me (Now): ♥♥♥♥ this game, it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Now there is NO F2P currency. Nothing. Now we have ♥♥♥♥ing crates. OH WOW SO UNIQUE! ♥♥♥♥ING CRATES! You can get all the cubes you could have bought before by playing the game, but now you get VERY VERY VERY MUCH LESS. ""Oh you spent the entire match healing a guy who was defending the base and pretty much saved your team from annhilation? Oh here you can have THE WORST CHEST IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME THAT GIVES YOU 20 CORNER BLOCKS."" So now you're ♥♥♥♥ed because when you're trying to build a unique vehicle, have fun building it out of corner blocks. Meanwhile, the guy you healed the entire match got 20 kills and got the best crate in the game. So while you have corner blocks, that selfish-♥♥♥♥♥ has a heat-seeking rocket launcher. ""OOOORRRRRR, YOU CAN SPEND 20$ AND HAVE ALL THE COOL STUFF AND WIN THE GAME SO YEA DO THAT"" -Freejam. Freejam, more like PayToHaveAChanceJam. Do your self a favour and never play this game in this state. IF, they fix thier game, (They probably won't) I will change my review. Have Fun (Hopefully playing a different game)!			"

								This game has gone downhill since the removal of tiers (a long time ago). Do not even download this.. it's a small download, but the game is not even worth the 5 minutes it takes. The devs do not care about what the playerbase wants, they are shifting to p2w style, everyone is objecting, the artwork, screenshots, discussion, everything.. everyone is shouting ""STOP FREEJAM!"" But do they care? No. They keep slapping us in the face with terrible updates that destroy the game bit by bit. Most robocraft veterans that have been with the game since the start are leaving the game because of what it has become recently. Robocraft has become a disgrace to the gaming community. They started off unique and fun in every way possible, but now it's a smouldering pile of dirty diapers. Now I am debating.. after all the hours i put into this.. I have heavily considered leaving. Everytime an update comes i get my hopes up thinking maybe Freejam did something right for once. But every singe time i am dissapointed and that makes me very upset to know that this game will never improve, it will only get worse until FreeJam kills its own game because of a crazed quest for MORE money.

								Having played alot and finally just reaching T10, it has been a great deal of fun, not without its challenging moments. But learning to adapt and change your robot design is what ive found to be most enjoyable, its not about throwing some wheels and weapons on some blocks going into battle, failing and raging. Take your time to think about your designs, build a fighting machine that is attuned to your own play style and tactics.This game has suffered from becoming very popular very quickly, the devs have had to deal with rapid growth in player base, they have had to grow every aspect of their business, and with such growth there are bound to be issues. Personally i think they monetized with micro transactions to early, it has caused people who have paid to rage about balance issues, which are infact the norm for any game in development, but there is no going back now.(i understand fully they need money to grow, this could have been achieved in other ways).Overall I do recommend this game, as it stands there is vast potential for unique designs of robot, not to mention the updates they have planned that will give us lots of new parts to use. Remember this is an early access game, it is changing and will continue to do so			"

								Fun game until they make changes.  Awful management.  Simply awful.1)  You create based on what you've tested and played thus far, then they pull the rug out from under your creation by making significant game-swaying changes seemingly without having done much testing/balancing of their own.  Any fun you have putting energy/thought/creativity/TIME into your robot is suddenly turned into twice as much frustration because they change the rules of the world/game upon which you based your creation.2)  Team ""matching"" is entirely random or non-existent.  Rare is the match where the teams are even.  One game you dominate and feel like king of the world only to be slapped senseless in your next match.  How about checking some numbers before throwing together two teams?3)  Pretty sure they have no idea what to do with mega-robots.  All these cool huge scale robot late-game items that you figure out after-the-fact can't be used like the robots you played with up to that point.  Can't participate in some game modes and can't use most of the other robot-building parts with the ""mega"" items.Don't waste your money or time - I've wasted enough for both of us. "

								While I didn't play this for longer than a day, the absurd in-game currency prices make it either a play to win or a grind to play, or both. The idea is super awesome, and I know I would spend many hours making robots in their shop, if only I had the unlimited blocks to build. As far as the actual action gameplay, it looks really cool and has promise, but with matchmaking pairing me with experienced players(or just paying players) in unbalanced air vehicles while I'm still using default vehicles to try and get enough blocks to make or purchase a decent robot. After a solid 4 hours of straight playing, I was nowhere near having a halfway decent amount of blocks for my bot, and woefully far away from being able to get enough currency, for, well, anything. I certainly understand the appeal of this game: and I tried it despite the plethora of bad reviews it had, but really, I'm not gonna sink any more time into this. I have better games to play.			"

								Many people have said the new gamemode ruined the game as a whole as it encourages no teamwork. But I beg to differ: sure during the early game, everyone is trying to shoot each other with only five second respawns - which is quite understandable - but when you get to the higher OC level, respawns are longer making players think about their actions as much as if they were just in the old gamemode. And the towers serve as a pivot to where you launch attacks from and use them strategically to get in a wave of spawns and vice versa preventing the enemy from spawning in for as long as possibe.The shields definitely was a different mechanic where it endorses players to take the towers to stop the enemy from retreating and to prevent protonium bombing due to the enemy having a distinct advantage due to heals and short respawn times in the early game.Now for my opinion. This game is, as what I learned, quite an addicting game giving the player to explore the giant possibilities of creating what ever the heck they want, and eventualy find their niche on what type of vehicle they like the most; I prefer heavy bombers. And that is what makes games fun.And the balance is very methodical as the tier system dictates what type of things you could have at a given time within the rank. You could have powerful weapons, but sacrafice getting one shotted due to you having to use T1 blocks in a T3 environment. And that gives the player the freedom to go to what tiers they want to play in when reaching a higher rank. Of course you cannont immediately jump in and reach TX-1 due to level caps and grinding.When you start everything is, technically, available to you needing tech points to unlock. But there isn't a mean of ""buying"" tech points or cash as the devs have done an amazing job keeping it that way, and the only thing you can buy are pure cosmetics or pre-built bots. So everyone is on the same boat. And you can still play the old gamemode, by the way.Edit: After playing in the T1s, I can see why. Have no worry, because you get shields and towers in the later tiers.			"

								The Recent changes of the EPIC Loot Update turned the game into a grind for the new players. New players are put at the mercy of the RNG System and they will be forced to fight against Seal clubbing Micro bots that move at blinding speeds. I've been playing since 2014 but This is where the train stops. since the beginning of the year the Devs have done nothing but break the game. They say it's to make the game into a horizonal progression system like LOL, They Scrapped The Linear progression that had decent matchmaking. and opted to make the game into something that it wasn't. The Match Making is Cancer. Whatever You do, Don't fund these devs until they admit they Screwed up, and make things right.EDIT: Due to recent events, the match has been lite and the bridge is burnt. I hope for a merciful death of this game.SEB who is one of the developers tweeted ""Boring reviews on steam by who doesn't accept meta changes. Tiers won't come back, deal with it.""https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726373014854615040 "

								Well, where do i start? Last weekend Robocraft was a very balanced game. This weekend it has all changed. The problem that the creators have made is it is now a pay to win game. That was fine but the thing that made it unplayable is the the matchmaking. It is completely of the charts, Very high level players before this update had WMD's and they could go against people that had them, now new people get instantly killed by them and they quit hoping to find a better game. And get no luck. So if it is possible, reverse the game to what it was, or your player base is only going to go down to the pay to win players. And we all know if they go it will be a unfunded game. The worst thing i have to do about this review is to not recommend it. Because none of my friends will play this after what has happened to it.Thank you for reading.			"

								I don't really know how to start this. I've played this game since November/December of 2014, now I have a bit more than a couple of hours in the game. I loved the freedom and creativity this game allows for, even after all the restrictions. I joined after the removal of repair costs, but getting to T10 was still a massive grind, where I was stuck in T7/8 for quite some time before I got to T10. I remember the feeling of awe as I played my first T10 game, admiring all the ""pros"" of the game, all the well built end game bots. I was hesitant to play T10 with my crapbot (in hindsight, it wasn't very crap at all), but I eventually got better. I tried all types of movement possible, made a lot of experimental builds that hilariously failed/worked. My rule of thumb is for any battle worthy bot I make, I must get at least a kill in it.Now, I've become very experienced at the game. I've used basically all the effective build types, and most of the ineffective ones too. I'm now an end game player, building and flying vertical thrustersticks (bots that have a little less than 50 thrusters). At this point, I can honestly say that the game has gotten stale. The average player skill has decreased dramatically since I first got into T10. No longer do I fear going into battle and meeting veteran players who will hand my♥♥♥♥♥back to me in pieces on a dinner plate. I'm not even hesitant to engage multiple enemies anymore; there has been many situations where I find myself 1 v 2 or even 1 v 3 and I'd come out victorious. I only play the game for the platoons/clan events now, occasionally for engineering/building. I can honestly sum up my current experience as this motto: ""When something stops being interesting, make it interesting yourself"". We've had many events on the Cookiejar teamspeak for Atlas core, ranging from renting art bots from the CRF, solo queueing into the same game for (almost) clan wars (with ourselves). In between all the bugs and the player disconnects (in a 8 v 8 game), that's the best we can do to make the game interesting for ourselves.I've rambled on for too long. If you're a prospective player, go ahead and try out the game! I'm sure you'd enjoy the various aspects of the game, from building random pieces of crap (maybe literally) to tearing enemy bots apart bit by bit. I can't guarantee you'd still be interested after 10 hours, let alone 100. But there is still the magic that hooked me into the game, and after all, this IS a free to play game.If you're a current player reading the reviews for whatever reason, let's just say that we veterans know the pain of getting the devs to listen to us, when we've seen the game through thick and thin. We've been through the reign of SMG bricks, copter bricks, rails, plasma, and tsticks. We've been through all the nerfs and buffs, all the poor matchmaking, all the flaming on forums. In the end, this is Freejam's game, they can take it wherever they see fit. The forums is a hostile place filled with QQ threads and minimal developer response. As each update comes, I log fewer and fewer hours into this game. Noobs complain that Freejam is catering to the veterans on the forums. Veterans complain that Freejam is catering to the noobs on the forums. The sight of a tstick is enough to make new players♥♥♥♥♥♥in their pants, even though a single SMG shot can take out one thruster. Teslas are OP even though their armor is worse than paper. Client side hit detection coupled with poor game servers make shots through entire mountains possible, and there are 3/5 weapons that are hitscan (SMG, Rail, Nanos). There are bugs that have been in the game for so long, they are essentially features now. There are those who pull the ""Alpha game"" trump card for everything negative about the game, while the game is at version 0.999999. Regardless, it has been a wonderful experience playing the game before. Give this free game a shot. It isn't pay to win, and although it isn't perfectly balanced, it is still enjoyable most of the time. There will be updates every once in a while, and the next update looks promising, so who knows!p.s. Hop on the Cookiejar Teamspeak server if you want to platoon with others. Add me on steam if you want to platoon with me, or want helps/tips! I don't bite (most of the time)			"

								After playing 100 hours of Robocraft, I do not recommend playing it in its current state as of right now. As a relatively new player, I was excited about the prospect of getting random things with a random chance, as I thought it would mean I can get the formerly Mega weapons easier. I was very excited to put life into robot ideas I had and to even test them in battle against other player's ideas.I was wrong.Even after all the crates, despite being Protonium most of the time, I have only received a single Legendary, it wasn't even the one I wanted. To get the two I wanted, I have to recycle around ~80% of what I earned, still barely reaching the price tag as either the recycle rate is far too low, or the prices of modules are far too high. As a result, I was never really able to create any of the robots I had originally wanted to make, and the only way to achieve that goal now, is to mindlessly gamble my way there. The crate system is also, at this point in time, not very well implemented. It only gives crates depending on your position on the team, whether or not you lose. It's very random in the loot it gives and that alone ruins Robocraft for me. It's just too unpredictable, and very hard to get the specific modules you want, and you're forced to deal with that because it's just how the economy was changed. Oh how I wish I experienced the only economy with RP and GC.As Reddit User visorakkal said cleverly, ""Freejam should change their salaries to a loot-based system and see how that works out. You no longer get a paycheck, you now get random groceries and clothing. Ooh, you got a car door this week, neat!""I really hope this game gets back on its feet, because right now, it's like wrestling a pig in mud. You spend hours and hours trying to (get what you want through the loot) wrestle the pig in the mud, hoping to (get the parts you actually want) defeat it, only to find out (FreeJam is thriving on the fact that you're still playing) the pig likes it.

								Don\'t be fooled by my playtime - I only recently synced with Steam. In case you were wondering how much experience I've had with the game, I made it to Level 90 out of 100. On the non-steam version I have 500+ hours.It\'s sad to see such a fun, popular and engaging game die like this. I started playing when wings were only just being added. It was tough. The matchmaking was cruel and the skies were ruled by those who had either played KSP or were really, really persistent. 2014-early 2015 was the best time for this game. There was a simple, team-deathmatch gamemode where team coordination was key. Every class had a vital role as once you were out, you were out. You got some pretty darn intense games and battles were won with as much shooter skill as robot design. I had a huge array of deadly bots which gained me massive rewards even at the low tiers. I commonly got games with 20 kills+. No joke. Okay, some of my designs were pretty overpowered (namely my helicopter-hover tank). But in mid 2015 an update was pushed out. It fixed one or two bugs and didn\'t add much new. Essentially, it allowed powerful bots that were designed to fight in say Tier 6 to end up fighting in Tier 10. Yes, that really did happen, with that Hover-heli. It was ridiculous. I had to completely start from scratch essentially. That pushed me from the game for a while.There were some great updates in that time, however. Megabots had been added earlier in the year and allowed for a sort of \""mothership\"" type of gamestyle in the very top tiers, with some incredible and stunning designs coming to light. There was an awesome \'boss battle\' gamemode where a large number of mid-tier bots fought 1-4 top tier bots. A new, incredibly fun kind of \'domination\' style gamemode was released. It was a blast. These were the days when the game had a \'Very Positive\' review status on Steam. It did add respawns, but this was a much longer gamemode and it made sense.But the devs said (not literally) \""What can we do to cheese these guys guys off even more?\"" They made the original team deathmatch exclusive to the higher tiers, they cancelled the \'hub\' social gamemode that was promised months ago and started bringing in hints of P2W. The Community Robot Factory was brought in, which basically said \""If you\'re bad at the core design factor of this game, building robots, then don\'t worry! Even you CoD newbs can be good! Just buy one of these robots and get to the top tiers with literally no effort, but a little mass from your wallet!\"" And then one patch after another came out. They started adding new OP weapons and movement types to counter the OP weapons they added in the previous patch. This seemed to happend every two weeks. Welcome aboard the hype train. And bit by bit the skill was taken away from the game. They removed pilot seats, so there was nothing critical to protect on a vehicle. And then they added loot crates. They removed the non-premium currency Robopoints/Robits and made it so you can\'t actually buy the parts you need. For a game that depends on its players building and upgrading robots, to make it impossible to get these parts when you need them, it was ridiculous. You would never get sets of parts, which are vital. What good is a car where all but one of the wheels is from a shopping trolley? Oh, but you can always buy the crates with the parts you need for premium currency, as long as you pay the devs. There is no more progression. It\'s a blatant attempt at copying CS:GO. Except in CS:GO you win pretty-looking skins for guns, which actually has no effect on gameplay. Oh, did I mention, they REMOVED MATCHMAKING. YUP. REMOVED MATCHMAKING. Their excuse was that the high-tier parts aren\'t more powerful, they\'re just different. That is a lie. Also they let you put multiple weapons on a single bot. Good on paper, but now you don\'t need to build a bot for a specific purpose and teamplay is pointless as you have every function you need on your own. Oh, and there is now self-healing, so medics and support classes are obsolete.PROS-Variety in gameplay-Varying opponents every match-Build something expressiveCONS-Literally no matchmaking-Devs have no interest in what the community has to say-Mediocre graphics, not a very pretty game-Poorly optimised-Pay to win-No progression due to crate system-Too noob friendly-Devs can\'t stand criticism-No teamplay anymore-Community is no longer as supportive or kind as it used to beVERDICTDon\'t bother. You won\'t get anywhere. You won\'t have any fun, unless you buy some Youtuber\'s bot from the Robot Factory. The devs used to always listen to the community. Now they see it as a money machine. The devs no longer try to make it more fun and interesting, they simply want more players to dip their wallets. The devs constantly use the excues ""But it's early access! That's what you expect from the game!"" Even Gaijin is better than that. All this game's positive reviews are from before the latest update. I loved this game before. I still do, but I hate the developers.I feel it\'s about time a used this nickname. It\'s kinda harsh, but I don\'t care anymore... ROBOCRAP.EDIT: Turns out, that in the new crates system you can get sets of items. Like wheels in pairs. Now ima go build a combat bicyle.			"

								Its sad, really.I've played this game for basically forever, and it isn't the same.""Epic loot""""New gamemodes""But in reality, it isn't that.Its paying.Paying, paying,paying.They removed the tier system and implied a not even closely related system that puts the equivalent of t7's against t10's.That's broken, you think?There's more.They removed pilot seats.-Now, you are probably thinking, ""Hey, thats a good thing, now I can survive longer!""That basically marked the downhill slope for this game. There is no skill anymore in building. There is no point to building a even somewhat functional robot. I literally built a box made out of guns and it worked. It also removed half the game. Half the game was making a robot that worked and was protected.New gamemodes-Half of which no one plays, and most you can't even join till you get some ungodly rank which is nearly impossible(thanks  new tier system) and you can respawn now. That also kinda ruined it. You have to try to make a good robot so that you can survive a game.Paying.They implimented a premium early on in the game. Now, around 30% of the people had it, or had bought GC and bought a cosmetic.Now, you have to pay to get a different color of block, or even GLASS, for god's sake, which you could buy back in the old  days. And, on that different color of block part, all armor is the same, from the bottom ranks to the top, its all the same.Buyable robots-So back in the old days, you had to save up alot of money, try a robot design, and hope it works. Alot of people failed, but we all found the flaws, fixed it, and stayed in that tier.Now you can buy a fully built robot.With real money.That basically ruins creativity. Half of the people in T4 were flying around in the ""T4 Eagle"", a bought robot.Overall-Devs, Freejam,If you're reading this, just put it back to what it was. It was good then.Maybe then I'll write you a more positive write up.But for now, it will take alot of GC to change my mind, sir.			"

								The gameplay is unlike anything else out here, but is completely ruined by a economy that almost completely ignores player performance in focus of an RNG (random number generator) system. It's like Clash Royale on your PC, rather than a skill-based game with actual progression.I've been playing RC for about 1.5 years, and I love it. I will continue to play it. But I could NEVER recommend the game to a new player in it's current state, because it would take 2000+ hours of play for you to approach my level. That's being conservative. On top of that, I'm still limited in what I can do!Freejam, get off your high horse and listen to the community. You were WRONG to cripple the economy, to cripple choice, to destroy creativity, plain and simple. Admit that, and we can progress and make Robocraft something truly beautiful again.			"

								I have played this game before it got in the steam library. The game has changed with each update and this latest update is no exception. The currency and exchange system is unfair and seems like a real money grab. You no longer get rewarded with currency but rather a collection of subpar weapons, movement parts, cubes, and other trash. The system is flawed and needs to be redone or this will be a game that had so much potential that burned out for no reason. People if you like playing a game that is highly pay to win against people that have game time and no mercy for new people and destroy you relentlessly then go ahead and give your best. The freejam developers of this game seem to change and maybe the game will too in direction, hopefully for a better more playable previous version. The catch is if you cannot afford to buy premium and support the game then as far as I can tell the game will not be fun for you. You will be outgunned, out maneuvered, and out classed against ppl that p2w everytime. This game used to be my favorite; now it is hard to stomach one match anymore.			"

								This game was amazing.But the Epic Loot update is so bad that can be so difficult to get Legendry items.I started this game before Full Spectrum Combat and it was great expect the rail are too OverPowered.Im not saying Full Spectrum Combat made game bad but the continuing updates made game worsened update to update.To cut a long story short this game is not ready for Beta.I would suggest the remove Epic Loot from the game.Because you can not get and Robits (Current currency of the game.) from ended games.Its cool that you can get Cosmetics but they dont make your bot better.

								Sheet guys....This game was awesome in its early stages, however now it seems as if the devs are just trying jam pack it with too much. Gameplay is not as fun anymore as it feels just too messy. Before, it was good, simple fun.It's a nice free, creative buildling game mixed with robot fighting (which sounds pretty awesome) but isn't worth the hard drive space or your time anymore.			"

Early Access Review
 Used to be Amazing  ""This game is amazing! Building your own robots and fighting others to win. I hope I have enough skill to get the wings!"" That is what I said about a year ago. That was when Robocraft was amazing. It was a balanced system that ouallowed you to buy the parts you need to build a robot. Once you gain enough experience, you could make your robot bigger and with better components. You would get money and experience based on how well you played, and you would be in matchmaking with robots around the same level as you.THIS WAS A YEAR AGO.After the so called ""Big Expansion,"" the rewards AND matchmaking sytems completely changed. Getting a good robot is hardly based on skill, but rather on luck. You don't need to be a certain level to get hi-tier parts, but can buy them from the shop immedeately or getting lucky from a rewards crate. The system has changed so that you can only get new parts by selling the old parts and buying new ones, or getting lucky with a rewards crate. No longer does the game reward skill, but rewards luck. You can no longer recieve money from matches, but different rewards crates that give you different chances on getting good items. Now you can gamble your REAL MONEY on rewards crates instead of getting what you need.The matchmaking also changed. There used to be a ranking on each part of the robot as to how good it is. This accumulated for all parts of your robot and matched you with similarly outfitted robots. Instead, robots are measured by how much is put onto them. In doing so, matches have become very unbalanced because of the differences in weaponry. The devs of this game faded away from the idea of making Robocraft ""The Awesome Robot Brawling Game,"" and instead pursued, ""How can we make more money?"" and, ""How can we get the best stats on Steam?"" Because of their greed, this may be the last year that Robocraft is running. Many people (including myself) will probably stop playing this until it is restored to its former glory.I certainly hope they revert to the previous version.			"

								This was a good game once, long ago.Now they keep releasing big updates from time to time, making the game worse every time. It becames more and more grindy, people who don't pay have much harder time to get parts, the game is so unbalanced some weapons are useless next to the one or two overpowered ones. There is auto heal, so you don't really have to care about damage that won't destroy you. They removed the pilot seat, so you don't really need to care about protection of a particular part. Most of the robots now are simple platforms with rods sticking out.Just don't start to play this game, it's not worth it anymore.(My actual gametime is much more, played a lot using the game's launcher and not steam)			"

								Well, where do i start? Last weekend Robocraft was a very balanced game. This weekend it has all changed. The problem that the creators have made is it is now a pay to win game. That was fine but the thing that made it unplayable is the the matchmaking. It is completely of the charts, Very high level players before this update had WMD's and they could go against people that had them, now new people get instantly killed by them and they quit hoping to find a better game. And get no luck. So if it is possible, reverse the game to what it was, or your player base is only going to go down to the pay to win players. And we all know if they go it will be a unfunded game. The worst thing i have to do about this review is to not recommend it. Because none of my friends will play this after what has happened to it.Thank you for reading.			"

								After playing 100 hours of Robocraft, I do not recommend playing it in its current state as of right now. As a relatively new player, I was excited about the prospect of getting random things with a random chance, as I thought it would mean I can get the formerly Mega weapons easier. I was very excited to put life into robot ideas I had and to even test them in battle against other player's ideas.I was wrong.Even after all the crates, despite being Protonium most of the time, I have only received a single Legendary, it wasn't even the one I wanted. To get the two I wanted, I have to recycle around ~80% of what I earned, still barely reaching the price tag as either the recycle rate is far too low, or the prices of modules are far too high. As a result, I was never really able to create any of the robots I had originally wanted to make, and the only way to achieve that goal now, is to mindlessly gamble my way there. The crate system is also, at this point in time, not very well implemented. It only gives crates depending on your position on the team, whether or not you lose. It's very random in the loot it gives and that alone ruins Robocraft for me. It's just too unpredictable, and very hard to get the specific modules you want, and you're forced to deal with that because it's just how the economy was changed. Oh how I wish I experienced the only economy with RP and GC.As Reddit User visorakkal said cleverly, ""Freejam should change their salaries to a loot-based system and see how that works out. You no longer get a paycheck, you now get random groceries and clothing. Ooh, you got a car door this week, neat!""I really hope this game gets back on its feet, because right now, it's like wrestling a pig in mud. You spend hours and hours trying to (get what you want through the loot) wrestle the pig in the mud, hoping to (get the parts you actually want) defeat it, only to find out (FreeJam is thriving on the fact that you're still playing) the pig likes it.

								There is a lot of reviews on here from veterans of robocraft, Myself? I'm a Newcomer to the game, I feel it is valuble to get a reference from both sides. Would I reccomend, yes and no. In its current state the following are pretty bad...* loot from TDM, BA and other game modes, a random loot chest is great for an MMO, this would be considered loot and extra to your experience and skills etc, In robocraft it is terrible. * Tech tree, Ive seen youtubers such as Lathland go through the tech tree and play through series on the game but now the tech tree is gone it limits you to how you can advance by what you get in the crates and what you can get with their Robit value.battle arena is overloaded with shotgunners and missile launchers so good luck getting protonium crates (best loot crate) and if you do manage to get them and dont have premium then youll only get the lower section of loot thats shown. anything with a lock icon on the item is premium only, be it a legendary or not.overall gameplay is fine with what I've came to expect from early access games although lag spikes and desync sometimes makes it rage inducing.  all in all I'd advise that If you want to give this game a go then please do and make up your mind based on the information you find when playing. personally I'll probably be more of a casual gamer on here and see what happens when the next update is released			"

								The game is good but what ruined it for me was the time it took to level up and all of the farming.GOD WAS THE FARMING ANNOYING! It was also unmatched, I could go into a multiplayer match and find players with some of the strongest weapons in the game and I stand little to no chance in even dealing some decent damage. One of the biggst problems I face is getting robits, the only way I've found so far to get a good amount of it is to get parts from crates when playing against AI and sell the blocks I don't want or need. It is annoying as well as being boring.P.S it was good for a few hours, but the updates were a little hard to keep track of. I still had a little fun and the game is free so it's not a big waste of money. (edit) It's ok to try every now and then and the updates make more op things and starters can't catch up to the people that have played for a long time and thats annoying.			"

								It seems that the devs are trying hard to check how much can they ruin the game with updates that are more horrible than the previous ones. I used to play the arena, now completing the objective (capturing towers and destroying enemys base crystals) give a lot less points, meaning that if you actually complete the objective, you will not be the highest ranking player in team if you dont hoard kills. The towers are also stronger, so the game lasts a lot longer. It has pretty much turned in an endless death match, those who gathered kills for the sake of killing now have more reasons to do so, and those who at least tried to win the game, have now less reasons to do so. Result is, that matches that used to last 10-15 minutes now can take up to an hour, where you actually just want to kill yourself instead of finishing the game.Don't waste your time on this, the updates have proven that this game is heading off a cliff.

								Changing the game is cool and all, but when you ignore community suggestions you end up devolving instead of evolving. Honestly, if the game was set back a year for whatever reason it would be more fun that it is in its current state.EDIT: The devs recently responded to the negative feedback of the epic dogshit update by essentially saying ""everything is going great, we are gonna keep moving forward!!!!"". good luck translating the game to russian, as they are gonna be the last people playing real soon.

								Started playing this game a month ago and it was fun..ish.  Building and playing was fun, the horrible mismatching of teams was the worst of any game ever.  Then the epic loot update came and this game is absolute trash.  There is now no reason to try to do well because you will be rewarded with trash.  When once you could play and earn currency to buy WHATEVER YOU wanted, now you open crates and pray you get something useful...You never do though. It's just absolute garbage, don't play it.			"

								I've spent around 1,200 hours on this game (I have accounts that do not go through Steam). 1,200 hours is a very long time. I remember each platoon I was in. I made so many friends over the last year on this game, but after each update, some of my friends would leave out of boredom or not agreeing with the Devs. I was always sad when they left, but since I still liked the game I would stay and make new friends.Fast forward to the Maximum Loadout update. I thought the game was at its best. You could make whatever you wanted, a giant helicopter that could both damage or heal, a frontline tank that could take more damage than anyone else, or even a stealth bomber to sneak behind the other team. No matter what you were, you felt useful to the team and could fill multiples roles for your team.I was having so much fun with my platoon, expirimenting with different loadouts and trying random builds and seeing how they worked. I could spend hours building an amazing robot and then use it in battle, perfect its flaws, and do whatever I wanted. It was around that update when I reach Protonium 5, the highest league rank in the game. Admitidly, after playing for so long, I was getting bored with the game. I could at least enjoy playing the game with my high quality robots and my friends. (Probably 800 of those hours were with the same platoons, the same friends).And now, with this latest update, I find that I am the platoon member who is leaving. I am the friend that disagrees with the Devs. I can't help but feel bad about leaving my friends, but the game isnt what it used to be. I can't enjoy it. You could spend hours making something to have it beaten by 10 blocks with a hover and a flak cannon. There isn't any joy left in the game.I loved how the game used to be, like a boyhood dream of building with legos then fighting with them, but now its like my dad (Freejam), who owns the legos (my robots), just crushed all of my creations and the time I put into them.If the game was like it was before, I would overwhelmingly recomend it, but as of its current state, do yourself a favor and don't play it.R.I.P.

								Finally I will review this game.  I really couldn't be bothered.  This game is so mediocre that it is hard to describe.  I will point out a few things I liked and how they changed.Liked:  The tech point system.  It directly rewarded you on how you played.  Play good.  Get stuff.  Play bad.  Get stuff much slower.Liked:  The toned-down approach to pay to win.  It was there, sure.  But it wasn't in your face.Liked:  Gameplay.  It was fun.  Simple.  Incredibly so.  Disliked:  The lag.  The spikes.  The network issues.  That the game automatically punished you for (disco bugs that enforced a wait period to play again.  What?  Am I at work?  Uninstall.)Disliked:  Once you felt like you were getting ahead changes were made.  Big changes.  Got that awesome railgun that you been playing all week to afford?  Boom!  Nerfed on accuracy, reload and speed of bolt.  How about those 14 or so laser blasters you installed after fighting like a dog for a week to earn?  Boom!  Nerfed!  Accuracy out the window after three shots and ranged reduced by a third.  This basically goes for all weapons and mods in general.Disliked:  The feeling of never getting to breathe because of all the sudden changes that were so sweeping and so often in implementation.  The game has probably been reworked in either level system, weapons changes, physics, research model, grind model or gameplay as to make it almost feeling like being at work.  Disliked:  The latest patch.  It has gone fully out the window.  All the effort since 2014 (on and off from frustration) just gone out the window.  All my grinded parts gone.  Just gone.  Revamped.  Now they have a random loot reward system at the end of every match.  Before you would fight well and get paid well.  Now you fight well or bad and an RNG roll decides what you get.  YAY!  I just rolled 20 common cubes!  Nice!  Because I needed 3020 of them!  All those uncommon and hard to get toys you worked for you have to work to get all over again.  And guess what!  They are insidiously expensive now.  But oh!  Wait!  You can make a roll and get them by chance if you play!  Play more and get more chances.  Great!  I should also mention that you get double the loot if you have premium.  Yes!  Pay us and you get double the chances to get what you want (you already had it and they patched it away from you but none of that talk!) and all will be well.  I should note that the vast majority of rolls I did make did have all the rares and legendary items up in the premium roll area.  For me down here it was 20 cubes and lvl 1 wheels.Uninstalled.  Forgotten.  Not recommended.  P.S.  Take note I do not write reviews often.			"

								I deleted my review from 2 years. It was positive. Now I am writing a new review with the recent changes. This will be a huge stinkin' negative review. They simply turned this into a gambling game. If you want to buy your own pieces of equipment get ready for the grind of your life. You have no control over what items you get now and the loot crates mostly give commons/uncommons. When before you could get the ""epic"" and ""legendary"" items quite easily and you got a good amount of credit if you did well in a battle. Throw all that out the window. Now it's a no guarantee to get anything you want unless you are ready to play hundreds, if not thousands of games to convert your common/uncommon items into 1, 10, maybe 100 credits in order to save up to 100,000 - 200,000 for actual useful items. It is, simply put, ridiculous.Freejam must think their playerbase is stupid as rocks to think we don't see through their money grubbin' scheme. Gamble away on items you may or may not get, increase the price of premium for an extra item that is useless. The best part is FJ said the response was mostly positive.Look at the recent reviews.

								This game used to be very fun and I used to play this game a lot. However, with recent patches, the game now requires much more grinding and removed the fun element of everyone having an equal chance. Players are able to exploit the system and this results in unfair gameplay. Some with CPU barely making the mark are battling people whose CPU is just under the mark. This is extremely unfair. Furthermore, this game is P2W, with many in-game compulsory stuff  having to be paid for. This game's ""premium"" is extremely overpowered, allowing new players to skip from a low-tier to a way higher-tier in mere hours. Clearly, this game has lost what made it unique and is now also P2W, something that I am sure the Steam community would not like as after all, this IS supposed to be a ""Free-to-Play"" game.			"

								I just wanted to create this review, because the game is slowly getting destroyed and I am sick of it.One update after another and one server maintenance after another it just doesn't stop and the bad thing is that they aren't fixing important problems that exist for ages.The new crate system is a pretty bad joke, now you don't have a consistent income, but you have a random case system with full of crap. I opened over 90 protonium cases and I only got 2 legendary's out of it. (and yes, I paid money for that)The sad thing is that I could have bought this 2 legendary items before the update after a few games, but now it takes so so so so soo much longer than before.The game is very good, but right now with all this glitches etc.. i just can't recommend the game.In conclusion check back later, when they fixed the game or if they fix the game.

								Can you imagine a ball going down from the top of a hill? Right, it not only goes down but also does it faster and faster!Why I said you to imagine such a thing? Well, that's simple. This ball is Robocraft and a hill is its quality. You can easily see that I've spend quite a bit of time in it. Robocraft had nice balance, matchmaking, freedom for creativity and so on. Now... Now newbies are getting rekt by players with just one giant overpowered cannon... Other negative side - developers. People were asking to add some things that would not worthen the game but make it more variative. Developers kept listening to cries of people who simply can't play well. That's how we lost a nice balancing. Some previous update destroyed everything we loved and when players start telling them about their mistakes what developers do? Yes! They make a new update with a new gun/module/other crap to shut peoples mouthes up for a while and when players are about to start complaining they make another one of such updates!It can be said more but I don't want to burn down my chair... ;D			"

This pretty much means you will spend most of your time grinding aimlessly for poor 25% Robits(equivalent to Hearthstone dust) rate to get parts you want. Any building is also now limited to one robot as you cannot use one part in multiple builds, I scrapped all my robots from pre-update to buy half of weapons for my main one. It is Hearthstone where you can only use your legendary card in only one deck.However grind is not biggest problem of this game. It is kinda annoying when you are at rank 24 an someone playes legendary card in HS, in this game it is much worse. Legendary weapons are constant pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for you as they are pretty much just better.Pre-epic loot it matched you with people who had unlocked same stuff meaning weapons gettin powerful was not a problem. It was also not p2w but more like pay to progress faster, which is something to consider p2w but also it didn't really afect you as f2p player. Nobody cared about how many parts you owned because level was your limiter.On top of this railguns are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

In 2014-2015, I would have given this game a 11/10 for being an original, creative, and insanely addictive game.  But after these series of terrible updates, Robocraft has become a mess of poorly thought out ideas, over powered weapons, and mindless rage endusing gameplay.  I just can't understand why FreeJam thought that any of these updates would improve our gaming experience.  The developers of this game have shattered what used to be an amazing, well designed game, and poorly compiled them back together into a mess that has made me stop playing this game all together.It is extremely sad to see one of my favorite games ruined in such a manner.  Freejam has made the decision to trade in our respect and loyalty to make a few extra bucks.			"

								I liked Robocraft when I played it about two years ago.Now I can say that I sorta hate it.Everything that was good about the game has been crushed and everything that was bad has gone worse.At the beginning we had a Tier System that differed experienced players from players that need help finding their own♥♥♥♥♥♥when they need to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥This is gone.Now we only have one tier - tier crap.I kinda grinded to the top level guns and the tier 10 cubes because I wanted to play with grown up individuals that now how to play and that took some time. Then the system was changed but i still had fun, sometimes.WIth the latest patch the game absolutely got destroyed. The crate-reward-model is pointless and P2W ... but I can't hardly see anyone pay money for this game because the matchmaking system is even worse than the new P2W model.What do I want from a game?To have fun!How do I have fun in a game?To compete with other individuals that match my skill in a fair enviroment and to play together with people that also match my skill.I want the game to be challenging and I want to be rewarded for my efforts to fight my team to victory.This is gone, it's all gone.The matchmaking system is extremely stupid and destroys the game in it's basic principles.So it's impossible to have a fair match because of people dropping out of teams and not getting replaced. Or the enemies team has like a four person squad that knows how to play and stomps you into the ground. Or the enemies team is just significantly better rolled.From ten matches I lose like seven and now to the worst thing, everytime I lose a rank aswell, that means, I can't get higher than silver ... thats where I start grinding my teeth. I would say, that I built a decent bot that has proven it's concept since the early alpha. I am always one of the three top players of my team. But I kinda always lose a rank because of the poor match making mechanics that suck me in an abyss and I have no chance to overcome that. Not by skill, not by effort.This makes the game not only pointless for me, it becomes a raging hell of frustration.I can not recommend this game to anyone who isn't a jerk or likes to feel eternal frustration.But heeeey the graphics look nice, the building system is very cool, the game types have a lot of potential.But this is worth nothing until the match making system has been fixed.I quit. Bye Robocraft and burn in hell!You can check out my tank by searching for ""Love Machine"" in the Robocraft bot show off♥♥♥♥♥♥""My english maybe suck but that's ok, i'm german.			"

								I was one of the older Robocraft players, then they go on to screw them over. If you are a new player then you got a lot of grinding to do, however if you are a higher leveled player then prepare to ace the enemy team instantly or get demolished by lower levels because now they have T-6 weapons at lv 3. . . . . .

								Came back after a few month long break. My megas witch i worked so long to get, gone, all the mega modules sell at 1/3 or 1/4 the price i bought them at. All my t10 armor cubes, are just normal trash white ones, no refunds or anything for the fact that my hoard of t10 and TX cubes went down to default crappy ones. Colors for only premium users, tech point system completely scrapped, and of course another crappy money mooch crate system to replace it, yeah let me spend money so i don't get cubes in my crate, and get a wheel.Good job devs, you had a great game, all you had to do was add more game modes/weapons/content/parts/propulsion systems and instead you decided to spit all over it just so you can mooch some more money off people.Iv been playing Robocraft on and off since its first public release, and this is the worst it has ever been, and the future looks even bleaker.Just don't bother, there are better games out there.

								I have been with this game from near the beginning and though i dropped out of it for a year it was still enjoyable. Then came the downfall. I wouldn't say that the tier leveling update was part of the downfall. But after that, everything and i mean EVERYTHING, started to go to sh**. Especially the loot crate update, and robobits? Please, just stop. I miss how you could earn Robopoints from matches thus allowing you to buy more weapons and blocks. But now, robobits, only earned from a forge from DESTROYING items hard worked for. So freejam, I say this, bring back the old robocraft, at least until the tier flattening update. Please. Bring back our beloved robocraft.			"

								Don't be fooled by its lego appearance and dull looking terrain, the battles are very fun (especially boss battles) and building your bot is fantastic, a little slow at first but picks up greatly in the mid tiersAll the different combinations you can make with the free form building makes all tiers much more interesting than other games like 'World of Tanks' or 'War Thunder' where you're so limited that it can get dull trying to work your way up.Aside from a few server issues on special event days, I have yet to experience many problems with server stability and the requirements to play it properly are extremely low. I'd recommend that everyone at least give it a shot, I wouldn't have if someone hadn't told me.			"

								Now this game used to be a lot of fun! It had a solid economy and pretty much worked as advertized, you build a vehicle and then you battle it out in different match types, you would get rewarded, even more with premium, and with the rewarded currency, you could buy new parts for your vehicle... I am writing ""it used to"" because the developer decided to promote their premium stronger and thus changed the economy model to a random drop system. This at the begining might be fun but soon you notice that you can't just buy the stuff you need to build your robot. You would have to recycle your previous rewards in order to get a fraction of their wealth back as robits, with which you could buy your desired items then... This means, the game has developed away from it's initial freedom and appeal of a building game, to just farm a bit and then buy and build what ever you wish, into a total gamble. You are now totally dependent on luck with your drops and every time you get a loot crate, you are offered additional random drops as premium player. This basically goes entirely against the initial freedom the game was advertized for. There are more issues right now, unbalanced weaponsystem and even very old glitches they never really got to fixing them but the general trend regarding this game strongly points towards becoming a moneygrab.There are lots of problems, which were solved absolutely nicely before the ""epic loot"" update for example, since everyone wants the protonium crate now, people are playing also against their own team for the top spot on the leaderboard, resulting in teams not playing together anymore.Also seal clubbing has become really common, bringing high endgame weapons into lower lever matches, to become the topscorer and thus also getting rewarded with the protonium crate... That is right, there is no difference right now, wether you win a match on your level or low level, does not matter, you get the same totally random generated protonium crate, which has the highest chance to give you some legendary items in theory but these chances are still so slim, it is almost always random crap, as well as in the other boxes. So enjoy the game as long as you do but i can't recommend getting to invested in it's current state.			"

GoodBuilding is like Minecraft for vehiclesPlaying is hilarious. Parts get shot off and it realistically changes the vehicle’s handling. I’ve been left with nothing but one walker leg and used it to claw my way onto the enemy base and win for my team.Not pay to win. Real money only unlocks things faster, it doesn’t give any battle advantageLots of freedom to mix and match parts to optimize vehicles' handling, speed, damage, and durability in auto-match team gamesMovement: hovercraft, wings, wheels, treads, floating blocks, grippy walker legs, helicopter, skids, thrustersWeapons: sniper, artillery, machine gun, energy ram, healing beam (also damages enemies)Defense: armor cubes, various plates that absorb some damage without being damagedSpecials: radar, radar jammer, radar sharing, rods & beams, headlightsYour designs really matter. There are tricks- like you can build with voids and layers to protect the core by routing damage on longer pathsLots of players. Half the fun is seeing what other people buildGood feeling of progression as you make money and invest it in your library of parts. Tiers went away, but I don’t mind.Very active devs who listen to the players and update the game every couple weeksGiant megabots. It’s so much fun to be a massive death dealer who shreds all the smaller bots. I’ve also taken a tiny healer with energy rams in so close to a megabot that its giant guns couldn’t focus on me. I burned several off before I guessed where the pilot seat was and tunneled in with the rams to kill it. When that huge thing shattered around me, leaving my tiny tiny bot victorious, it became the best of hundreds of great memories of the game.BadGenerally the anti-cheat works, but sometimes a hack gets through for a few days before a patch fixes itThere are glitches and bugs, but they’re minorSome adolescent negativity and other nonsense in chatThe big one: updates renovate or erase big elements and people complain. In my view the devs take 5 steps forward for every 1 back, and the downvoters are just focussing on the 1. Look how all the negative reviews are from people with hundreds of hours in Robocraft. The truth is they love the game so much that relatively small problems upset them. Because you battle with your own design, embodying your ideas about what’s effective and displaying your style- the battles feel personal. It’s not a fake experience like so many other games where they give you carefully controlled challenges made to be beat. It’s raw and real and chaotic. That’s what I love about it.			"

								This game is super fun. You have a plethora or blocks, guns, wheels, turbines, etc to build your own robot any way you like.I just noticed there was an update (that plane looks awesome, going to install again and check it out!)The only bad part so far is the limited maps. Seems to be about 2 different kinds of levels (desert and snow) with I think 2-4 differnt maps for each - gets boring fast.Also, one bad thing is that people will abuse the higher level guns and build a minimalist vehicle with one higher power gun and just sit back and wreck everyone, so that gets a bit frustrating.Highly relies on team work.Would recommend. This game can only get better, and it's free!Edit: After making it to tier 10 after 100 hours in the game, it's pretty much lost it's fun.I am level 54 or so, so my CPU is limited to 1015. There are people with lvl 100 in tier 10, which can have much more stuff on their robot, which is a huge advantage.I am no longer interested in the game as it's only going to be repetetive from here on out. I will just get recked by higher level players and I'm not going to put myself through that.Goodbye, robo craft, it was fun while it lasted.Second edit:They added mega bots. Every T10 match has one, on each team. Everyone just sticks with them now. No fun at all.			"

								I used to love this game.... About a year a go I posted a review saying it was incredibly good... Yet the developers of this game have ruined it. They've completly savaged the original concept and destroyed the game I used to love. A few months back they released an update which added that new gamemode with the horrible Voice Actor and I stopped playing quickly after that... A few days ago I came back to it and found it butchered even more to the point where my car which when I was playing it was one of the most powerful designs I had built and was a Tier 9... Now I come back to find the speedy car a slow tank with no damage or health and its no longer T9... it's 11M?! WTF is 11m?! The game has just become terrible without the tier system and I do not want any one who played the original GOOD version of this game to go near it... It's trash. Oh and it is buggy as all hell! I constantly get errors when moving between the confusing UI to try and get to battle or build... Naming the garage option ""Drive"" is just stupid. The key binds don't even work for me and most of the newer stuff is pointless... The renting a robot system is pointless as anyone could just copy the design block by block for less money.2/10 You let me down devs. ~ DoubleIka 2015Also having the show mouse bound to RIGHT CTRL by default is a really dumb thing and just awkward to use			"

								Game is basically pay to win. You have legendary weapons that basically overpower people. It isn't fun for people that want to try out the game. The new update basically trashed the game. It's crap. Also, when you unbox a crate and recieve a legendary weapon, you have to have premium in order to actually recieve the item.Also, not having premium means that you can't have half the items you recieve in crates. This is bs because if you get a epic or legendary in the 3rd or 4th slot, you can't get them, you're stuck and forced to look at it until you click off. Another pay2win example. Robocraft/Freejam is essentially trying to force to pay money to get good stuff. :(			"

And like Lego, building is most of the fun, though killing other players in their self-built robots is fun, too.You are totally free to build whatever you like, though of course there are restrictions on usability and necessities from the armoring.

								When i first started playing this game the released there ""Epic Loot"" system which was fine and dandy. i played for a bit thought the game was fun, purchased Premium and some Proto Crates. Once i got the crates apparently they messed up the loot system so they had to refund me more crates, which was cool. Now for the last 3 days i dont even earn crates anymore this game so *ucked, fun but *ucked.If you want fun with out earning ANY parts to build a fun Bot then this is the game for you.I have about $75 REAL money invested in this game and im so so close to just walking away from the game and take a loss.I hope FreeJam is happy taking my money and aggrivating another Fan of the game.

								Share Drive Fight? More like Pay Drive Fight. But even that doesnt get you far now. I have been on this game since before the ""Update That Ruined the Game"" but i tried to stay with it until this ""Epic Loot"" update. This update, has drawn the line for me. I could not continue this game and enjoy playing it if i try a starter robot and get attacked by heli rockets. This game has no meaning to me anymore.BTW Freejam, your Railguns dont work.			"

								I really wanted to give this game a positive review, but i just cant anymore. Ive waited and waited and I cant hold it in anymore. Ive currently spent 388 hours on the game, and probably about £200 pre-crate patch.You used to be able to buy galaxy cash (ingame premium money) and purchase items for reasonable prices. The game was mostly well balanced, fun, and centered around building nice looking robots and have a big fight with friends.Now its turned into a very competitive (even against your own team) gambling simulator. Yes, you can buy crates, but you aren't guaranteed to get anything useful. Spent £20 on some crates? Here, have some glass corners and some level 1 lasers.I play this game very casually, I have done from the start. I dont own any super powerful bots, nor do i have a decent league ranking. I play because i enjoyed making new robots and trying out new ideas. The ""Epic Loot"" update completely ruined that side of the game. Aside from that, its shameful what the developers are doing to newer players. High ranking players are actually better off making a stupidly overpowered bot and ""Seal Clubbing"", which is destroying new / low ranking players with high ranking weapons.I used to look forward to the new updates, now i dread them.Shame on you Freejam.Edit: Forgot to say, its taken the devs 3 years to think about adding commas to the currency display so you can actually read it. That says it all. (And its still not implemented!)			"

Early Access Review
								When the unstable developers finally decide what game they're actually making, I will replay that game and revise this review.Until then, I have to give it a poor rating with a heavy heart.BEFORE: I used to love this game. You would build a robot and then figure out how to engineer it to fly properly and fight in it. In the more advanced stages, you had to build a robot that 'degraded gracefully', so you could still halfway fight and fly when you were just limping around. Matches were quick and straightforward, progression was easy to understand. Fight things, earn currency, use that to buy better bits. This would have been a positive review. I knew how to play it, I knew what was expected of me, I knew what to do to make my game more enjoyable. It was a good game.NOW: I have no idea what the scrap is going on anymore.- Your robots 'level up' as a match progresses (???) because this is League of Legends I guess. Except you don't gain more abilities, you just gain more levels. Which invisibly improves how your robot fights. Which is not dependant on how you DESIGNED that robot, it's just based on how well you're doing in that match. Which is, again, invisible. That poorly-made robot you see before you might have 3 levels on you and thus be 'better'. It's bizarre and I don't understand why it's there. Again: Levels don't give you more abilities, or let you 'build' some kind of tree as you fight. You just grind a meter. For reasons.- You no longer earn currency to buy new parts. Instead, you get 'random' parts you probably don't need. You can resell them, I guess? You aren't told how much they're worth when you get them, so it's impossible to know if what you've earned is even worth the time you just spent. I used to have a ton of currency, but now I have significantly less than I did when I started. They took it away. I guess they 'balanced' this or something (???) by removing a bunch of what I'd earned (??????) but it really just means I can't afford anything anymore. I can't buy the parts I need to make the robot I want, and I can't earn the currency needed to fix this. I just have to pray I get a halfway-decent part among the random smattering of blocks I earn, and then hope it's worth the time I spent earning it. You only earn 3-4 per match and I actually am not even sure where you sell them. It's unnecessarily obtuse. It's weird. It adds unnecessary steps to gaining what I actually want. It's a CHORE.- There are super-weapons. There are weapons that kill your well-designed robot in 1-2 shots. What is the counter to this? Buying those same super-weapons, which cost as much as an entire robot in currency just to buy one. Many robot have no armor or movement at all, and just one or two of this or that super-weapon. What just happened, what just killed me and where were they shooting from? Oh, it's that fat gun-thingy. How do I get it so I can be like them? Oh, I grind for weeks. Their design looks stupid, but that's OK, because they have a giant gun. ...oh.- None of my old designs work anymore. Half my garages glitched out and crashed the game a few patches back, and the only fix was to just delete what was in them. My only remaining robot no longer functioned like it used to due to physics changes. This has left me to buying robots from the 'store', all of which handle like garbage but still have a 4/5 star rating in 'combat'. There is a cluster of three cats with lasers strapped to their heads with 4/5 starts in combat. Who is rating these things? There is no way to tell crappy robots apart from good robots. I paid money for a couple robots and now regret it, because I could have used that money for one of the aformentioned super weapons.- Gameplay is only balanced if you follow the invisible-to-casual-players meta. Which at the moment, is a robot with one superweapon strapped to the top of one solo mech leg. You hop around and it plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you one-hit-kill everyone else's painstakingly-designed robot. There is no counter to this currently, except to follow suit. There are variations to this, but they don't change the meta. You can just strap your super weapon on top of tank treads. Or strap your super-weapon on top of wheels. Or hover blades. Or maybe your super weapon also has smaller weapons on the side. Do the developers even play this game the way I have to..?- The developers want you to spend money to gain in-game perks, except they (apparently!?!?) remove these at random (garage slots are now free, I guess..?) and nothing you spend money on is guarenteed to still be there when you log back in a month later. The robot you devoted time to build won't function the way it used to. The weapons you spent weeks grinding for will be outmodeled by the latest super-weapon.What the scrap is this game supposed to be?- The developers want League of Legends leveling-and-gameplay without any of the balancing associated.- The developers want Hearthstone get-random-parts-and-pray-they're-the-right-ones pack-opening gambling-addiction progression. Except you don't need 'two' of a card to be able to play it. You need fourty cubes, two legs, eight weapons that match up, left-and-right electroplates in the right sizes and types, etc. A good card drop in Hearthstone gets you 1/30th closer to your desired deck, ignoring that most decks use a lot of class cards and it's thus more like 1/20th. A good Robotcraft drop gets you 1/200th closer to your ideal robot, maybe. I guess. It's painful rather than rewarding. It's actually AGGRIVATING.- The developers want Call of Duty (I guess?) and added self-healing that completely re-builds your robot if you don't take damage for 4-5 seconds. I genuinely don't know why it was added or what value it gives the gameplay. You could cripple a robot before, but not now, because they'll just self-heal. Not that it terribly matters, because any halfway-decent super-weapon one-legged robot will destroy you in far less time than that.I have no idea what game the developers are making anymore, and I don't think they do either. I'm getting off this ride.Who the scrap is flying this crazy umbrella anyway..?			"

								I've played this game for over a year and about 600 hours (the standalone launcher isn't tracked by Steam) and spent probably $50 altogether on premium time and cosmetic items.Robocraft used to be good, but then the lead devs started coming to work with their pants on their heads. The Epic Loot update made it virtually impossible to get the robot parts you need to finish your robot, as everything is based on random drops. The game is still plagued by game-breaking bugs (like half the players on a team never connecting) that have been around for over a year.The devs are pretending that nothing's wrong, even though they are hemorrhaging players on a daily basis.Don't waste your time here. It's another grindy, pay-to-win cashgrab disguised as a freemium game.			"

The economy will always give you items, this may seem good, but its is not because you will always be given the items you don't want. What sucks to is that you can't even sell them for a good price anyway. The weapon balence is now gone, with the addition of many new weapons the balence has turned into a pile of steaming♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now you have a very repititive leveling system. No tech tree, no tech tokens, and no real progression. Freejam has made the mistake of adding more content, but not having a stable base before adding more content. The result is a failure. If you want to make a game, stick the base of the game no matter what and add the content that the cummunity wants (as long as it doesn't screw up the base).			"

Devs gone full milking mode, and they hear only noobs now. God, they killed literally everything I loved in this game, turned it into a wretched, begging for death abomination.

								This game USED to be good.To elaborate:Back when I really racked up most of my hours, back in summer of 2015, I really loved the game. It spoke to me and both my inner creative and destructive selves. The game back then was GREAT. You had this thing called a Pilot Seat, and that was the centre of the whole craft. If that was destroyed, you were dead, even if you had 90% of your craft left. However, to counter this they had - wait for it - different types of building blocks! *GASP*. Anyhow, you had armour blocks, and heavy blocks and light blocks. Glass was a building block, as well as helium and there were a few more. You could unlock higher level of those blocks through the tech tree - and get this! - it was a tree! You, say, chose armour cubes. You could continue and unlock higher level armour cubes and other parts that were related to that. You used tech points, which were won from battle to unlock things. Building flying craft was fun and complex and took engineering skills. You had to balance the weight and have the centre of thrust just right to have a great craft. To pay for your crafts, you would buy things with this ingame currency called ""RP"" which was won from battles. Premium users could earn double RP and could buy GC which they could use to buy more tech points or more blocks. When designing your craft, you could put as many blocks as you wanted as dictated by the CPU cap, which kept your brain working so you could design working crafts under the limit. In regards to weaponry, there were four weapons: SMG, Plasma, Rail, and the healing thing. You could have as many guns as you wanted as long as they were all one type of gun. One type of gun per craft. It was genius! Made you useful in the team, and you could perfect a certain skillset. On the battle field, rails were anti flying, smg were machine guns, and plasmas did splash damage and were great if you had the skill to hit a flying craft. The healing things were for healing and had damage as well. There was not ten second heal thing, ehich made it so healers were USEFUL and LOVED by their team, as if you were damaged, you stayed that way (unless you wen't under shield in Battle Arena) until someone healed you. There was also another battle mode where a mech (the biggie bots) could fight a group of smaller normal bots. This was the golden age of Robocraft.Then Autum came.Nothing was the same ever again.I mourn now for the horror robocraft and it's loyal playerbase suffered.They had sooo many downdates (or updates as they were officially reffered to). Over the course of a few months, the evil devs took all blocks other than light blocks away, got rid of the outerspace view and interior mothership design, killed the pilot seat, added heal, added useless unnecessary weapons, added colours to blocks (old blocks were different colours at different levels), made glass cosmetic and a premium only block, changed the amazing mark I, mark II, etc naming scheme to the current horrible cheesy one, took away RP, GC, added crates, made it much harder and less fun to build new crafts, get rid of the old robot tier system (ranked bots based on cubes and parts on it and was good), added rank thing, changed matchmaking, added the nazi-like leave battle policy (so if your comp or game crashes, you are punished), made the medic class useless with the heal timer, tried to imitate games nothing like Robocraft (it would be like Minecraft trying to be more like CoD).Some good things they did since August:In December, add the outerspace view and interior of Mother Ship design (fixing a previous downgrade). Right after the last update of the summer, they added unlimited craft bays. Before there were three and you had to pay to add more (Premium only feature with GC). Recently made glass non-GC I believe (fixed previous downgrade). Made matchmaking a bit faster. Thats all.My verdict: Wanna waste time? Love it when game developers completely ignore you? Want hard earned blocks to be rendered useless? Want your money you spent on Premium to be thrown away? (Many other players had that issue). Love Pay-to-do-decently-pseudo-free games? If so, Robocraft in it's current state is for you!To FreeJam, the devs who won't read this (or will ignore it): Go back to last July, but keep the unlimited bays. Remember: your reall fanbase isn't little kids who can't take other who do better than them. Your real fan base is the adult and teens who can pay premium and would reccomend the game to other hardcore games. Wake up Freejam. Please.*Apologise for typos, and if you agree with me, upvote, disagree, downvote. For both, I'd appreciate comments! Ciao			"

								If you look at the reviews, you see the overall reviews are mostly positive, while the recent ones are mostly negative. There's a reason. The matchmaking is terrible, matching noobies with old pros, the system is grindy with pay to win crates, and it just, isn't, fun anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								When the unstable developers finally decide what game they're actually making, I will replay that game and revise this review.Until then, I have to give it a poor rating with a heavy heart.BEFORE: I used to love this game. You would build a robot and then figure out how to engineer it to fly properly and fight in it. In the more advanced stages, you had to build a robot that 'degraded gracefully', so you could still halfway fight and fly when you were just limping around. Matches were quick and straightforward, progression was easy to understand. Fight things, earn currency, use that to buy better bits. This would have been a positive review. I knew how to play it, I knew what was expected of me, I knew what to do to make my game more enjoyable. It was a good game.NOW: I have no idea what the scrap is going on anymore.- Your robots 'level up' as a match progresses (???) because this is League of Legends I guess. Except you don't gain more abilities, you just gain more levels. Which invisibly improves how your robot fights. Which is not dependant on how you DESIGNED that robot, it's just based on how well you're doing in that match. Which is, again, invisible. That poorly-made robot you see before you might have 3 levels on you and thus be 'better'. It's bizarre and I don't understand why it's there. Again: Levels don't give you more abilities, or let you 'build' some kind of tree as you fight. You just grind a meter. For reasons.- You no longer earn currency to buy new parts. Instead, you get 'random' parts you probably don't need. You can resell them, I guess? You aren't told how much they're worth when you get them, so it's impossible to know if what you've earned is even worth the time you just spent. I used to have a ton of currency, but now I have significantly less than I did when I started. They took it away. I guess they 'balanced' this or something (???) by removing a bunch of what I'd earned (??????) but it really just means I can't afford anything anymore. I can't buy the parts I need to make the robot I want, and I can't earn the currency needed to fix this. I just have to pray I get a halfway-decent part among the random smattering of blocks I earn, and then hope it's worth the time I spent earning it. You only earn 3-4 per match and I actually am not even sure where you sell them. It's unnecessarily obtuse. It's weird. It adds unnecessary steps to gaining what I actually want. It's a CHORE.- There are super-weapons. There are weapons that kill your well-designed robot in 1-2 shots. What is the counter to this? Buying those same super-weapons, which cost as much as an entire robot in currency just to buy one. Many robot have no armor or movement at all, and just one or two of this or that super-weapon. What just happened, what just killed me and where were they shooting from? Oh, it's that fat gun-thingy. How do I get it so I can be like them? Oh, I grind for weeks. Their design looks stupid, but that's OK, because they have a giant gun. ...oh.- None of my old designs work anymore. Half my garages glitched out and crashed the game a few patches back, and the only fix was to just delete what was in them. My only remaining robot no longer functioned like it used to due to physics changes. This has left me to buying robots from the 'store', all of which handle like garbage but still have a 4/5 star rating in 'combat'. There is a cluster of three cats with lasers strapped to their heads with 4/5 starts in combat. Who is rating these things? There is no way to tell crappy robots apart from good robots. I paid money for a couple robots and now regret it, because I could have used that money for one of the aformentioned super weapons.- Gameplay is only balanced if you follow the invisible-to-casual-players meta. Which at the moment, is a robot with one superweapon strapped to the top of one solo mech leg. You hop around and it plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you one-hit-kill everyone else's painstakingly-designed robot. There is no counter to this currently, except to follow suit. There are variations to this, but they don't change the meta. You can just strap your super weapon on top of tank treads. Or strap your super-weapon on top of wheels. Or hover blades. Or maybe your super weapon also has smaller weapons on the side. Do the developers even play this game the way I have to..?- The developers want you to spend money to gain in-game perks, except they (apparently!?!?) remove these at random (garage slots are now free, I guess..?) and nothing you spend money on is guarenteed to still be there when you log back in a month later. The robot you devoted time to build won't function the way it used to. The weapons you spent weeks grinding for will be outmodeled by the latest super-weapon.What the scrap is this game supposed to be?- The developers want League of Legends leveling-and-gameplay without any of the balancing associated.- The developers want Hearthstone get-random-parts-and-pray-they're-the-right-ones pack-opening gambling-addiction progression. Except you don't need 'two' of a card to be able to play it. You need fourty cubes, two legs, eight weapons that match up, left-and-right electroplates in the right sizes and types, etc. A good card drop in Hearthstone gets you 1/30th closer to your desired deck, ignoring that most decks use a lot of class cards and it's thus more like 1/20th. A good Robotcraft drop gets you 1/200th closer to your ideal robot, maybe. I guess. It's painful rather than rewarding. It's actually AGGRIVATING.- The developers want Call of Duty (I guess?) and added self-healing that completely re-builds your robot if you don't take damage for 4-5 seconds. I genuinely don't know why it was added or what value it gives the gameplay. You could cripple a robot before, but not now, because they'll just self-heal. Not that it terribly matters, because any halfway-decent super-weapon one-legged robot will destroy you in far less time than that.I have no idea what game the developers are making anymore, and I don't think they do either. I'm getting off this ride.Who the scrap is flying this crazy umbrella anyway..?			"

								Robocraft was a great game and had amazing potential back when I started playing it. This was before arena mode, heck, there might not have even been boss battles. (Which I miss.) Throughout the updates and balance changes, I stood by the developers, knowing that they made the decisions they did for good reason. However, the loot update goes against the entire idea of the game. Previously, the game had one of the best free-to-play models and you saved up for different parts. With the crates, what I heard from the developers was that, ""screw actually getting to buy parts you want, We'll let RNG decide for you!"" This conflicts with my idea of how the game should be. Maybe my view is archaic, but the game is not what it used to be.			"

								Alright, as you can see I have spent almost 900 hours on this game so I am obviously not new to this but at the current state that this game is in, I would not recommend this game to anyone. I first played when the game was new (i.e. when T2, T4, T6, T8, T10 weapons were called S-Types) on a friends account. This game was perfect for me, fun and engaging gameplay and you needed proper tactics to win. Then we got aerofoils and this was a very important part to this game since before the only type of flying robots were helium drones and you copuld not place plasmas on the bottom so you had to make it so you could flip it around to make a plasma bomber. My favourite period for RC was durong the Walker and Nano update. Nanos were the most important class for a team and often decided the winning team and walkers were very interesting to play with and meant you could explore the entire map and made rails a very interesting opponent. Also, there were still tech points!The last time that RC was enjoyable for me was the ROBOCRAFT Unleashed update. This is the battle arena update which although I thoroughly enjoyed, it made it impossible to get into a TDM game and made Megas redundantAfter this, they removed tiers and tiered blocks, megabots, gc and rp. They added so many new weapons in a short period of time, changed the currency, ruined the economy and made end-game players the exact same as newbies.Also, since GC is gone, all GC only components are now available to everyone. This is bad for me as I had bought EVERY mask, 6x Carbon SMGs, 6x Carbon MSMGs, 2x USA flags, 2x UK flags, 2x Vapour trails (The big ones), 4x Vapour trails (Smaller ones), 4x Speedometers, 2x Altimeters, 10x Vampire Bat wings & rudders (10 of each) and 10x Bat wings & rudders (10 of each). I also had 6 months of premium. What a waste of money this game is. So, in conclusion, this game is a waste of time and a money grab. Thanks FJ for ruining a once amazing and popular game!			"

								I've played this game for over a year and about 600 hours (the standalone launcher isn't tracked by Steam) and spent probably $50 altogether on premium time and cosmetic items.Robocraft used to be good, but then the lead devs started coming to work with their pants on their heads. The Epic Loot update made it virtually impossible to get the robot parts you need to finish your robot, as everything is based on random drops. The game is still plagued by game-breaking bugs (like half the players on a team never connecting) that have been around for over a year.The devs are pretending that nothing's wrong, even though they are hemorrhaging players on a daily basis.Don't waste your time here. It's another grindy, pay-to-win cashgrab disguised as a freemium game.			"

								This game is dead and the devs do not seem to understand that their mistakes have caught up with them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This used to be a good game. It had a functional economy, the weapons were balenced (not including railguns), and it had a tech tree and leveling system that always made you feel like you actually acheived something.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Robocraft is now a husk of what it used to be. The economy will always give you items, this may seem good, but its is not because you will always be given the items you don't want. What sucks to is that you can't even sell them for a good price anyway. The weapon balence is now gone, with the addition of many new weapons the balence has turned into a pile of steaming♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now you have a very repititive leveling system. No tech tree, no tech tokens, and no real progression. Freejam has made the mistake of adding more content, but not having a stable base before adding more content. The result is a failure. If you want to make a game, stick the base of the game no matter what and add the content that the cummunity wants (as long as it doesn't screw up the base).			"

								Used to have this rated positive. I didn't mind the epic loot update. It's what brought me back to the game actually, after a long period of quitting. But it's time to go again.My bot was wiped for no reason at all. It was just a regular looking tank with an appropriate name. There was nothing rulebreaking about it. It was just, gone.There's still major memory leak issues. I can go 2-3 games with 130 fps. And then suddenly the games after that will run at 13 fps. It's not my computer. This exclusively happens in Robocraft. And probably only for their Linux build. Which doesn't run anti-cheat btw.And this Armorgeddon event. Why is a temporary major gameplay changing event absolutely forced? I don't want to play with +50% health and +50% shield. The only thing I found with the event is that ion distorters are harder to break off thus they get more shots off. It's even more rediculous when they have it protected by shields. Maybe it wouldn't be an issue if I had my awesome bot, but I honestly didn't feel like rebuilding it.			"

								Unfortunately Robocraft is a grinding game right now. You wont be able to progress for weeks, if you don't know how to build a good robot or if you don't have enough material from earlier versions of the game to buy shotguns, the currently most powerful weapon.I cannot recommend this game for people who want to play alone or rage easily.Inspite of the clearly bad mechanism behind the game right now, it may still be interesting for those who like to experiment with bot designs and be creative( to an extent).But except for that bit of creativity (which will only make you understand that you designs suck) and the kick of adrenalin, there is not much to get from this game.Most players are not interested in making friends anyway.

								This game was complete garbage.  All I can say. Items are now complete RNG, and also the matchmaking completely sucks. (I got paired up with LV.100s when I was at least LV.12). Crates are nothing but useless, and it's dependent on skill level and capability to topscore in matches, unless you got mad skills, you're getting regular Rusted to Silver crates (loss and win, respectively), and usually just give you items that are not only completely useless, but sell for little amounts of currency at a time. Pilot removal may or may not have been beneficial, but at the end of the day, unless you have an entire cache of super parts and good knowledge on making the perfect armored vehicle, you're pretty much a painted target screaming a wordless ""KILL ME"". FreeJam, please acknowledge these points I have made, and maybe redeem yourself in the eyes of the community, which has and will reproach you until you change your ways. Please prove to be better than Valve, who only cared for your money.			"

								God, How terrible this game has become. This game use to be fun with tiers, and now its chaos. You may look at the time ive played on it and be like ""This guy has not played that long"" But in reality, i have. It was just on my other account, which i no longer have access to. I remember i once spent a week getting money to make my bot, then by the time i finished making it, it was over the max CPU. Apparently the CPU BEFORE what it was currently was higher so the design was perfect. Now, It gets 1shot due to the way its made. Before it could withstand being fired at for a long time due to how it was designed.The devs of this game have gone mad. They think they need more profit. They dont listen to the community. I believe that this game still has the potential to be good again. That is if the developers stop trying to be all about stealing your wallet, and listen to the community. I think any player who has played for awhile can agree that this game is just TERRIBLE now, since you can be selfish and use ANY gun on your bot at one time, and the fact that they removed the pilot chair.Since players can be selfish, they can anything at ALL that they want. Its just unfair. Basically you have to design a bot ready to defend against ANYTHING. Back when the game was great, yeah you had to make your bot ready to defend against anything, although it wasnt as major. You had your team to support you. Now, everybody is just selfish. Thank you for reading this, and i hope the lazy♥♥♥♥♥developers get off their asses and make this game great again.			"

								I am absolutely sad about the newest update... okay some older updates where bad too, but nothing has changed the whole game like the last. It now feels like a smartphone game where you have to wait hours to play along or pay for some diamonds to progress better and faster. The game is now only enjoyable if you already had a huge pile of items and money before the implemented the update.  To get a full set of higher tiered weapons you have to play about 1000hrs(someone did the math) because you dont get any money after the battle, but just a cate with random items(good luck getting good or even wanted ones).If you get some higher priced items in your crate and think you can recycle them - nope you only get a tiny fraction of the value wich you would have to pay for it normally.As a new player you get some items and ready bots at the beginning already, but if you drive them into battle you will face massive powerfull bots with the best possible weapons and you will have no chance to conquer them.I played this game about 1500hrs, but now I see it incredibly fast dying.The concept and the possibilitys are still great and I really hope they introduce a steady income again... but yeah RIP "

								Absolutely disgusting new economy changes that ruined the game in my book. What used to be a ""grind for the parts you want!"" has turned into a ""grind for absolute garbage you don't need!"". Wanna build a plane? too bad, you're getting crap wheels. And not of the same size. wanna sell those useless wheels? Hahahahaha....30% of buy value...F offThe new system feels absolutely unrewarding, even when you get the highest tier of crate you still feel like you get garbo. I really tried giving this update a chance, but i've come to the conclusion i'm never playing the game again until I feel like i'm making actual progress instead of getting tier one and two stuff no one will ever use every single game.The increased time to kill is dumb, it was already too slow in my opinion... now i feel like my T10 SMGs do abolutely no damage. Talking about guns, balance is a joke. Really fun game. try it!			"

								Basically Robocraft is quite a nice game but it really has some issues. Now there are gonna be enough reviews with pros and cons and the likes so let me make this short.There are only 2 reasons this game gets a no from me currently.1. There used to be a time were Rail Helis were, niche, hard to properly create and play but they were fun, and really useful in the right hands too. Your rails were rather unprecise due to the bobbing up and down of the rotor blades, meaning in order to aim properly you had to act against the bob, adding an additional layer of skill to actually play a competitive Rail Heli. Even then you traded some of your accuracy for mobility. Now though, in a real fight you can expect lots of freak misfires that just hit the ground 20 meter away from were the red dot was.(Speaking of which, what the frick do I need a red dot for if it isn't related to the spot I'll be hitting at all? I already have a reticule.)To make this issue weirder, I can't recreate this problem in the training mode at all. 1500ft and I still get 5 out of 6 shots on a target more than half a map away, all while moving up/down AND across the map. Maybe they're caused by being damaged? I don't know, but it's annoying, and the accuracy loss during fights is WAY too big.I still can play my Rail Heli that used to kick♥♥♥♥♥halfway decently, but the constant freak misfires which are not directly my fault AND can't be prevented by anything aside from getting another bot type, are taking a lot of fun out of the game. It just won't feel right. And yeah, that as an airborne player is still a larger issue than flak cannons or the likes to me.2. ""The scores of the winning team have been doubled"" aka ""Carried Scrublord > Exceptional Player on losing team""If just they'd change those 2 things this game would get a full recommendation from me. And I'd sink a lot more time into this game too. As long as those are there... thanks, but no thanks.Edit: 21.06.2016There's a lot of nice new features, like smart weapons and stuff. It's actually quite nice. Aside maybe from whiner acommodation aka flak.And I really want to get hyped again for this game but my personal playing niche has been completely killed off, and since it's still as dead as it gets my review stays negative.

								Love this game!!.  But I will still give the ros and consPros:         1. No health for your bot, just play until your driver is killed. (cubes = health but if your driver is unprotected you are toast.)         2. Create whatever you want        3. No premade/designed classesCons:        1. No ability to start private matches        2. only 1 gamemode for the people under 3mil robot rating. (or some high rating)Other than that This game is a must get.			"

								This should be a good game, and by all rights it is. The gameplay is fun and the robot design mode usually works properly but there a few major problems worth mention.There are a number of methods to get under the map and once there its a simple matter to wipe out the enemy team. EVERY ice map has somewhere to get underneath and its extremely frustrating to get destroyed and have the kill cam show the cheater sitting under the game on a huge sheet of ice that streaches the entire map.The simple fix for this would be a kill-zone that streaches underneath, insureing that when a cheater manages to get underground it would destroy them and respawn. On a plus side I've only seen this on the ice maps.Some game modes have come and gone, and while they were kind of nifty the game has changed to be more focused in thier absence. However what was unacceptable was the removal of Megabots. The game has Microtrasactions, and to support the game I was having fun playing I purchased multiple Megabots with US Dollars. A recent patch removed the Megabots and gave NOTHING back.The replaced 'Power Booster' does nothing (Well, ok full energy recharge takes 8 seconds instead of 10 seconds but you'd never notice unless you took it to the test zone with a stop watch) so its not in any way helpful. The mega weapons take FAR too many flops to be placed on a regular bot since if you do it'll take 600/1515 PFLOPS and then you still need a method of movement and chassis.I requested a refund for the 10 mega guns and 4 wheels and 3 hovers I bought with USD. After spending $40+ worth of GC they returned... $2.50. Unacceptable. They let you return the mega parts back for the full RP (Nonpremium currency) but you can't return them for GC and all of the cool vanity items are GC only. I submitted a ticket about it, but I'm not sure if it was anwsered because I have no idea where thier anwser would GO for me to read it. I don't even want the money back I just want my GC, and I think its reasonable that if I bought them with GC I should get refunded GC.TL/DROdd glitches in Robot Builder, a number of cheaters, and be careful what you spend you money on but otherwise awsome game with active devs. Worth playing but don't spend money in here until those issues are fixed.

								Played the game once every couple of month. Mostly because progression was tediously slow and matchmaking unbalanced. So when i read the recent reviews, i thought: ""Oh, cmon, how bad can it be, lol?"" Let me tell you that - BAD. Really, really bad. TL;DR - don't play it unless you are Willy the Whale and you ran out of ideas on how to spend your money after financing the college of every stripper in close vicinity. 1. Matchmaking is utter garbage. You get thrown in with people who have the strongest weapons driving on a tiny platform. Sure, a good hit would kill them, but here's the thing - the strongest weapons also have the longest reach, highest accuracy and best dps. Basically if you are up against someone with a better weapon, you already lost unless he doesn't notice you for half a day or you have some buddies with you.2. Loot system about as rewarding as squeezing water out of rocks. You get a crate at the end of the match - it will be a random part. Like, utterly random. I got a wheel, a track and some blocks. While it might be funny to think of a combination of those items, at the end of the day you will have no fun building your robot as a free2player. Your funneh robot loving named ""McFartFace"" will face 105% optimized deathmashines with full-legendary equip.3. The only other form of aquiring parts other than the random lootboxes it destroying the parts you have for 25% of their worth and then buying different stuff. Ofc the prices are exorbitant for anything good. If you can afford it though? You can have invisibility, shields, instakill weapons - against guys with a wheel, a track and some blocks to keep those together. 4. The only people who are still playing this game are toxic max-lvs who have everything unlocked and will call you an autist if you complain about the unfairness of it. (I guess one should be happy to have the honor of being one-hit-killed by them)5. The devs show no remorse and no reasoning. They want cash. I find this theory about lizard-people controlling everything in order to destroy humanity more and more plausible. Otherwise the devs would have to be unbelievably greedy and stupid.P.S. Ofc you could say ""What does he know, he only played a couple of hours, lol"" - well, good luck enduring any more than that as a new player.			"

								Freejam has continiously shown that they have no vision for this game and don't know what they're doing.  They're blatantly ignoring the majority of player feedback and stubbornly continue to stick to updates no one enjoys or wanted in the first place.   They remove large pieces of content on a whim ( Megabots+2 gamemodes ) and the F2P model has gotten greedier and greedier as time went on.  Furthermore they've changed their payment model, but if you purchased items with real money that are now available with in game currency, you where never refunded for them, wow!  Crate rewards are far too low and we need to be rewarded more, especially in deathmatch, and the losing team is always screwed over with a crap crate even if they individually performed very well.Freejam seems to believe that it should take hundreds of hours to get to any sort of endgame, so if you're fairly casual, this game simply isn't for you.

								Ever wondered what moving to another country and then finally returning back to your former country only to find it a burning cesspit feels like? because I sure do.This game is a mere shell of it's former self, it used to be great, it was simple, it was fun. Then the devs decided to destroy the aspect of creativity, make billions of new types of weapons that nobody asked for, (and are completely overpowered) and make it a complete pay to win cash grab. Guess how that went. 99% of the positive reviews are from when the game was actually enjoyable. Also, if you're thinking ""well at least they didn't screw up the ranking system"" They did that too. They removed megabots which completely destroyed the idea of working towards the goal of creating a huge robot.""Could this get any worse?"" a veteran robocraft player would say, and unfortunatley, it does. instead of having a tech tree where you gradually earn new parts as you level up you now have a crate system where you have to spend REAL money to get a random part.If Robocraft would go back to what it was before, I would play it again. But that will never happen. If you have any self respect, don't play this game.			"

								I used to really like this game when it first came out. Just logged in for the first time in a really long time and was severly disappointed. All the features I liked about the game were removed, and all the new features just make this game a meh game. went from a 8/10 game to a 2/10 game for me. Personal opinion perhaps swayed from playing it before. I only played a few matches (getting 1st or second on the board in each one I might add) but those matches lacked any real desire for tactics in them and were kind of just rush to the enemy base and destroy it (I could only get in one of the types of  matches even, really wanted to play the deathmatch, but it was just not to be. Waited forever and it wouldn't find a match.)Currently I would say this at best is just a quick time waster, if even that. I'm afraid I probably won't play it again. It was just rather boring.Not sure if this will help anyone decide to play it or not. Honestly its free so it doesnt really matter all that much and I'm not really mad about the game. Just disappointed.			"

								This game is a horrible pay-to-win piece of garbage. Im putting a negative review from all 4 of my accounts and told all my friends, some of which dont even play it, to put a negative review. And its staying negative until the game becomes playable. This garbage made by a group of inbred degenerates could be so much better. It could compete with other big fanbase games like LoL, CSGO, Warframe, DOTA 2, etc if they changed it just a little bit. The amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t theh spew with ""we updated the game and made it better"" is just sad. Please fix it.Also, add some d@mn achievements and trading cards. So players get an extra reward besides some random ♥♥♥♥ ingame. A lot of players love badges and cards. And maybe some tradable items that players can trade with each other through Steam like skins or weapons.I would also like to mention the fact that about 6 months ago i played and had bought some weapons and had also spent money on this trash to get some stuff. I recently turned on the game to see that the game has been changed and all my stuff was gone and instead of them i had 3 starter robots that i dont want.			"

								This game was great, it was a really good game that everyone can enjoy. They can be anything they want using imagination and good designing. But ever since the Flak update, things went downhill. Making planes were fun, but flying with one in it's current situation is just shooting yourself in the head. I'm just upset that flying is now obselete in the game excluding heli's which are practically hovercrafts that can fly higher, doesn't have that same feel as flying on the sky shooting at people.tl;dr: Bad game for now, rip flying.

								Let me preface this with the fact that I have played this game for years now. I started this game when the only modes you could play were training and battle, there were no respawns and no objective other than to kill the other team and have the best robot.I loved this game, allow me to walk you through my experiance. 1. Spend 50 hours grinding to level 100 with friends2. Spend 50 hours (and some money to support the devs) grinding and coming up with an amazing megabot idea3. Spend 70 hours (and some money to keep the subscription up) building your megabot and grinding for money for parts4. New update: oh, loot drops? uh, ok. Oh, my megabot is entirely red, why? OH NO CPU, THEY REMOVED MEGABOTS.Thanks for ruining a game devs, If you want this♥♥♥♥♥♥to come back as a playable game you need to remove all these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates bring it back to what the game used to be about: Creation and Imagination. As for right now, do not give these people money, or time. This game has gone from an amazing free team based sandbox vehicle battleground, to another fine example of terrible devs.			"

								I expected this game to get better over the years but all the devs are doing is trying to make it more profitable with microtransactions. Now I just feel that I wasted all that time by expecting it to get better. This game is now far past its prime and it will keep going downhill; the developers are trying to force people to spend money when all they need to do is make a good game.			"

								REVIEW UPDATED, SEE BOTTOM-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I used to love this game, I really did. It was my favorite for a long time. Now I am forced to stop playing because the developers are flushing it down a toilet, and I'm not a piece of sh*t so I refuse to follow it on it's downward spiral to the cesspools. If they have some convoluted plan that saves their a$$es in the end, then I may pick it up again and change my review.I've logged 350 hours in this game and now I think it's time for a review.No amount of half-arsed compensation can make up for the loss of the Mega.Sure, we can sell back all our mega-guns, but what the funk are we going to buy with all that cash? It's not like I can go and use it to build a Mega. Speaking of mega-guns, their presence is entirely useless now that we can't have enough CPU to use them.They say the Megas were too big for the maps? I never had an issue ever. If you're going to own a large vehicle, you better be skilled enough to drive it.And what's up with this new Fusion core? Another useless pile of scrap. Now that Mega bots are gone, we don't even need to worry about power consumption. And with the extreme CPU cost it has, there's no worry of having enough guns to eat all your power.One possible reason the Mega bots were removed is because whiny children were complaining due to the fact that they DON'T have a mega. It's a case of the Have-Nots attacking the Do-Haves. Also, the Store page's video is now a complete lie of false advertisement due to the removal of the Mega.The angry few are louder than the happy masses.To the Devs: Please stop smoking crack on the job. It's impairing your judgement and causing you to make horrible decisions.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW UPDATED!The new ""Epic Loot"" update has been released! And all i can say is EPIC FAIL, FREEJAMITUPURASS. Money has been entirely done away with and replaced with an insult to your intelligence. They stole my 15 million RP and gave me 100k of this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥called ""Robits"". You don't even get paid for your missions anymore. Instead of getting 300k RP per mission like I was, I am now getting 200 RP worth of CUBES. FreeJam, there are easier ways to commit suicide other than making a hundred thousand people want you dead.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANOTHER UPDATEWHAT THE FFFFFF IS WRONG WITH YOU MENTALLY INCAPABLE DEVS!Every update is another nail in the coffin! They keep screwing the game harder and harder! This is a SLOW PAINFUL TORTURE! I would rather be waterboarded by the chinese than have to put up with this! WHYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyy.......			"

								I was getting back to this game a couple of times and at each time it was different. Not worse, because I could still build my robots in peace. Now it's gone.Last and final attempt was when Maximum Loadout update came in. I don't say it was bad, to be honest it gave a player a possibility to efficiently fight against all kind of robots.But thing that finally made me think bad about this game is RP nerf. FJ agreed it was too rough and ""fixed it"".Hah, don't make me laugh. ""you’re looking at ~140 hours for 2x MegaLegs and 6x MegaLasers"" - RP Price Reductions and Time-To-BuySo I would need to play 2,5x more hours that I played to get it.It's about 43 200 000 RP = about 52 k RP for battle. As an average player before ""fix"" I took for good TDM 150 k - 200 k RP, which wasn't much. Now for same battle I take ~15 k? For great one with most kills and damage ~25 k. At lvl 98 with 25k robot!!This is a mockery. After nerf and ""fix"" most of players still get 10% of RP what they get ealier.FJ ruined the greatest thing about this game. An abillity to build everything what you can imagine without worring about money. You are making a tank, but miss 1 SMG to finish? Here, play 2-3 hours to get it.If devs wanna keep that ""fix"", they better should do something with matchmaking. The most expensive parts are only thing that will keep u alive in battle and deal real damage. Without them you will be crushed at first encounter with enemy.TL:DRGrind all evening to get one good part. "

								Initially, this game was very fun.  But the Epic Loot Update has effectively killed any interest that I may have had in it.  This game has devolved into people finding weird ways to mitigate damage through exploiting how some of the shapes work and  destroyed any sense of creativity, making ""art builds"" completely pointless and uneffective.  Having to disenchant items and use that dust to create new parts was a dumb direction to take this game.  It's an awful lot like how Hearthstone lets you destroy/craft new cards.			"

								Came back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that I no longer endorse this game. They had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on. (TL;DR alert) I've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why I don't play anymore. I used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. The removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.Originally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. All of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). Exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. Shooting said weak spots and watching 75% of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. It was the highlight of the game. The second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.How did this change? The removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. This absolutely DESTROYED the enjoyment of the game for me. I regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below 15% health, and this was due to having 3 working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. Not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. The poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy 75% of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying. Completely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. It used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. I got destroyed all the time when I first started playing, but I did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about 6 kills per game (no respawns when I played)I honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but I HATE when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche. RIP Robocraft.			"

The game's first release was in April 2013 and that buildhad no multiplayer and no combat. From that point to today, the game has grown exponentially to its full MMO state and whilst we still call it a 'Live Alpha' you will find it a very polished and fully featured experience.”Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“Freejam are now plotting a path to full release with an aim to be out of Early Access at some point in 2017.”Deticated comunity? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?“While users accounts will never be reset - so what you earn in game now you will always keep - the full release of Robocraft will contain a number of additional key core features, many more social features, Clans, more game modes, many more functional components and weapons, a tutorial and PVE mode and full game localisation into many different languages.”What is the current state of the Early Access version?“We call it 'Early Alpha' but we expect you to find it as polished and fully featured as most 'Beta' releases.”Its actualy a full game and your usng early acess to NOT be as good as this beautiful gem:Weegies birthday supriseWill the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?“No, Robocraft will always be free-to-play and our prices won't change as a result of shifting from Early Access to a full release in future.”No.How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“Freejam (the developer of Robocraft) has community in its blood. The word Freejam is a combination of 'free' and 'jam', where 'free' shows our dedication to keeping Robocraft always free, and 'jam' stands for jamming with our community to determine how our game continues to evolve. We like to think of Robocraft as a game that has been built from the ground up in collaboration with the community.”http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/340/267/7c8.jpgThe free part is how they make nearly everything the opposite of free, jam is how they look like idiotsColaberation with the comunity?

								I really enjoyed this game. I spent entirely too many hours playing this game over the past few years and I truly loved it.One of the things that makes such an amazing multiplayer game like this is a healthy relationship between the developers, and their community.Freejam recognizes this, clearly, because in the introduction to their product, they make the claim, “Robocraft has been built with a dedicated community of Robocrafters from the very beginning.""Unfortunately, it seems like they recently replaced someone within their company that has absolutely no respect for their community, or has no desire to retain their existing players.I was already extraordinarily upset when they removed megabots. That was a big deal to me because I had 4 custom megabots which I spent countless hours building. They were the game to me... when Freejam removed them (read: DELETED) overnight, I was shocked.After a week or so, I got over it and rebuilt some bots and resumed playing, albeit a bit more reserved.This latest update took my disdain for change to another degree and completely removed my currency entirely, both of them. I had over 200 million RP, and now it's gone. I had $20 worth of their premium currency saved, gone.My compensation for this loss was a crate which had some white blocks in it.No apology, no words of solace or anything which might remotely comfort me and worst of all, no explanation in game.The fact is, these people have no regard for their community whatsover. They further have no regard for their time, or efforts. They simply don't care. Plain and simple. They care about one thing.Money. More specifically, yours. The individual reading this review debating about whether or not they should install it and give it a shot.Go for it. Install it, love it, build your dream robots and have a great time. It's a really fun game.Unfortunately, for me (and thousands of others by the look of it) I'm done. I've spent far to many hours only to have my efforts tossed aside with zero regard.No consideration for their existing players.I quit.			"

WHaaaaw, so i opened it and got a few rares and an epic then i realised that TO ACTUALLY GET ITEMS WORTH MORE THAN A CARROT you had to purchase premium. Well Played Robocraft... Well played.I would have recomended this game a few updates ago, but i dont like the way Robocraft is heading.			"

								I used to like this game until the last update. It started to go downhill on the previous update with the unbalanced weapons (read: ion distorter). Now all that made Robocraft great and a good progression (getting better and better items) has now been undone and we're left with a gamble at the end of each match. It used to be really something to get a bonus of RP (the item currency before Robits) when winning. Now it's a random grind.I actually put real money into this and was somewhat annoyed when the higher level stuff I bought got turned into RP or made obsolete by the previous update.I can no longer recommend the game to others like I've done in the past. Pity that FreeJam decided to ruin things.			"

								Pros. 1. A unique game with a fair amount of weapons. 2. The weapons are balanced ok at the moment. 5/20/2016 (see con 4)Cons.1. Spawning is inconvinent at best, you can spawn right infront of an enemy and vice versa. 2. Premium is too expensive. 3. You can get the most kills and do the most damage while dying the least and you will somehow lose, a very unintuitive scoring system. This occurs even when your account is premium. 4. Constant updates alienate veteran players.Verdict: It's free-to-play, keep it that way for yourself.			"

								just quoting another review i totaly agree with. ""Stay away from this game. Simply put, the development team (FreeJam) is utterly incompetent. There have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). Instead, FreeJam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. This accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. Sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, FreeJam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.Other major issues with the game:1) Building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. Nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. Any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. In fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, FreeJam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. Either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. Regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did ""because FreeJam said so.""2) Significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. Simply put, FreeJam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. In the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. There are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). 3) FreeJam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. They won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. Instead, FreeJam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. Basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. Things like clans have been ""on FreeJam's radar"" since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? Still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. The sad part is, by the time FreeJam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. 4) Minimal skill required. If you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. FreeJam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. This might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.FreeJam: One step forward, two steps back. Always.""			"

								At one time i would have recommended Robocraft; however, with the recent ""loot crate"" patch, i can no longer do that. They destroyed some of the best aspects of their game. For one, players can only get new cubes/items through loot crates, whose contents are randomized. And, for whatever reason, players can attach multiple weapon types to their craft. It no longer feels like the Robocraft everyone loved, mainly because it no longer is.			"

								I use to like this game, but not anymore. They redid all the weapons based off of one weapon, and in my opinion, ruined all that was good about them. Skill doesn't seem to matter anymore as anyone can kill you with a few hits. Since any bot can have ALL the weapons on it at a time, it has become who fire the first shot instead of trying to outsmart your enemy with distance and weapon type. Teamwork doesn't seem to matter anymore either. Thats probably the main thing I dislike. My friends and I all agree that lack of team work has made it less fun. Use to, you would have to work with ur teammates to win a match. Now any bot can kill all enemies. It just who fires the first shot.			"

								After coming back to the game after a few months, it has changed very much from what I and what seems everyone else who first played it when it was released into early access remember. The progression system was removed and replaced with a ""free"" chest system to unlock pieces but if you aren't one for waiting you can purchase them and unlock even better things (higher chance for things that are actually good). I can't recommend this to anyone since the game isn't what I remember it to be that kept me playing it.			"

								I do not currently recommend this game. A year ago, i would have said the complete opposite, but since the recent update, this game is horrible. The seeking rocket launchers are over powered. Whichever team has a seeking rocket launcher on their team pretty much auto wins. The rocket launcher screws up match maiking since if you make a craft with a low level base but then a rocket luncher, match making thinks it is still a semi low level ship. Please get rid of the rocket launchers. Bring back the old robocraft i know and love. I have 106 hours... on the old version. Now i cant even play more tha one match without getting annoyed by the updates. Get this game if you want unfair match making or if you are willing to buy weapons with real money. Otherwise, this game is not worth your time or your hard drive space. I hope this review has been helpful.			"

								The new 'reward' system has ruined the game in it's entirety. Getting crates on victory or defeat is a nice concept, but there are multiple issues with this. - It removes all sense of progression as progression is based solely on luck.- It encourages hindering teammates as players with higher scores get better crates; I.E getting points from capping towers that are almost capped, is far greater than doing it yourself.- The item sell values make it near impossible to actually aquire items from the shop without massive ammounts of grinding.- Premium users can no longer pay real money to get the items they want, and can only gamble on crates to hope they get the items they want.- The premium users getting double the items from crates is a decent concept, but showing the players what they missed out on because they didn't put money into your game, even if they have in past (And got burned on it because of the recent changes) is just cruel.I played this game for a while before the recent overhaul, had quite a few high-tier blocks and high-tier weapons, the former of which cost quite a lot of ingame currency, only to get recycled into normal cubes with no refund to the player, meaning the amount of time I spend prior to the change was completely pointless, save for aquiring levels translating to more CPU. In summary; the recent overhaul screwed over a number players, myself included, the only progression available is that of pot luck, and has never been more pay-to-win, with premium users getting double the chances at items meaning they can get epics and legendaires more readily available (in addition to being able to sell said items for their higher values to get the items they want, far sooner than normal players.)

								This game is alright, but not good.I have multiple problems with the game that might just be there forever, and some they've just added make the problems even worse. A big problem is not being able to connect to single player, and how the new expansion works. I just hate how this game turned into a pay to win factory and people still play it! Before you could buy the items you wanted, but now you have to buy ""crates,"" which are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They obviously just want more money.. and more!I don't mind the gameplay. It's got some cool mechanics that they improved, but the almost recent update getting rid of tiers of armour, blocks, and weapons just made the game bad. The energy systems are alright in my opinon, and the new guns too, but if you really want them you would have to spent so much money on these pay to win crates or ""Plotonium"" crates.All in all this game is OK but it has alot of faults that REALLY need to be fixed.

								I came into this game when shilds where introduced and the comunity was a sceptic about this feature lowering the skill ceiling.But I hat fun and klimbed up the bot size/ranks.Midel level I mostly used railbots agains air units and mega bots (sniping mega guns of :] ). And later one with the introduction of mech legs I often played armor blob mech and where standing next to the mega bot, taking the damage for our team.For me the biggest ""design"" decision that broke the game was auto healing.Basicly every air unit I shoot down with rails was auto healing behind some hills where nobody could reach them.My armor blob also was now way more useless. Previously it made sense to take damage over a longer time. Not this is complitly discurraged because the auto healing only favors players that always hide and play ""whack a mole"" tactics.All the folowing ""updates"" just put the nail in the koffin. Its such a terrible cash grab by triend to make the game casual and ""pay to play like you want"" that I don't even want to think about it.			"

This game was one of my go-to games, now I don't even know what to say about it.--UPDATE--This game had some serious potential before. Tiers made games fun as you would play with people with around the same weapons so you wouldn't get 1 shot. Currency wasn't impossible to come by. And everybody could get to the same weapons. Now it's down to if you get a good enough drop which you can sell to get a decent weapon. The devs pretty much saying, ""You want a lot of currency? Either sell your soul to this game or pay us for the currency."" FreeJam went straight money hungry with no regard to what the community is saying.			"

The way you build determines how well your bot performs in battle and how well you take damage. You can watch your bot fall apart as you get shot and build to redirect damage in clever ways. It's great.After several updates, this important and intriguing quality of robocraft has been diminished severely and gameplay has dived as a result.			"

								I used to like this game until the last update. It started to go downhill on the previous update with the unbalanced weapons (read: ion distorter). Now all that made Robocraft great and a good progression (getting better and better items) has now been undone and we're left with a gamble at the end of each match. It used to be really something to get a bonus of RP (the item currency before Robits) when winning. Now it's a random grind.I actually put real money into this and was somewhat annoyed when the higher level stuff I bought got turned into RP or made obsolete by the previous update.I can no longer recommend the game to others like I've done in the past. Pity that FreeJam decided to ruin things.			"

								After about 750 hours in it began to lose it's thrill which is pretty good however I still returned to play however after the updates adding new guns and gamemodes were added, I lost all interest in the game and it ruined the game for me. I would not suggest playing this game as I think that many people will lose interest very quickly after the first ~20 hours			"

								Haven't played in almost six months. Was really missing it and decided to come back and craft awesome robots and have a good time. I came back to garbage. Nothing is even close to the same it was six months ago. Balance is non existant. Weapons are ♥♥♥♥ed. Crafting and skill is out the window. The new energy and cooldowns have absolutely killed it for me. I won't even start on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ currency and tech tree removal. So glad I never spent any money on this game, because it turned into something truly horrendous. 1/10 gg my little robots.			"

								Look at the pictures on this page. FULL OF LIES.Artbots, continuous stream of nano beams, MEGABOTS. Why are Freejam doing this? For money? Who would pay them if everyone hates them?Also, if you like tanky, get a mech. If you like going fast, well, get a mech and put some rotors on it. If you like to be as agile as a bunny, get a mech. It's even more agile than a bunny. See the first promotional images? Mech, mech, more mechs and mechs.But what if you want to fly instead?If you like tanky, get a drone, because it can flee with only 5% of the healthbar remaining. If you like going fast, get a drone. If you like to be agile, you know the answer. ;)The funny thing is, even though the devs love drones, there's not a single one to be found on the promotional images. Maybe they know that it's cancerous but they don't want it to go?			"

								There is so much I want to say, but others have done it better than I ever could already. Basically, Freejam is taking this game in a direction that's destroying what made the idea of it fun and unique. They refuse to listen to the community and insist because ""new user retention rates are high"", their decisions are good decisions. The retention rate is higher because new users are logging in daily for their free crate. Freejam is cherrypicking their data to insist what they're doing instead of listening to user suggestions and criticism is what's best. I won't stop playing until it's unbearable to do so, but my hope for this game's future is rapidly running out.			"

								Back in the day of Robo-Craft's beta, it adopted the gameplay of the popular World of Tanks game; two 15-tank teams, no respawns, a capture point at each team's spawn, 10 tiers for tanks, and a xp based leveling system.  For a long while, things got better. They added an origanal new gamemode, mega-bots, wings, and other smaller things. Soon though, it all went downhill. They removed everything that the game was. They alienated their long time players. What they have done to the game will ultimatly become it's downfall.I got the beta years ago and had several hundered hours on the standalone launcher and later 160 more hours through Steam. I'll never play a single minute of this dissapointment of a game again. "

								This game was really fun. Until the update came around. Now you get things from drops. You get the currency by selling the things from the drops. This game was one of my go-to games, now I don't even know what to say about it.--UPDATE--This game had some serious potential before. Tiers made games fun as you would play with people with around the same weapons so you wouldn't get 1 shot. Currency wasn't impossible to come by. And everybody could get to the same weapons. Now it's down to if you get a good enough drop which you can sell to get a decent weapon. The devs pretty much saying, ""You want a lot of currency? Either sell your soul to this game or pay us for the currency."" FreeJam went straight money hungry with no regard to what the community is saying.			"

Problem is too many players that have higher class level will build vechicals with SUPER POWERFULL weopans that can snipe everyone from out of the sky where no lower level player can even have a chance to fight back.If you play you are going to have to just wait untill your team can win and carry you up to a high enough level to even play for more than a second.

								Robocraft is a really cool idea, build a vehicle from bits and battle it out.  Feels like playing with lego and pretending to have battles.. but for real.  Pretty great.But much of the fun is having pieces to play with, and being able to stick a whole bunch of em together. I do hope the devs read this, I know its one amongst the storm though.They have consistantly tried to monetize in some way, but I think have fallen short.  Unfortunately the easiest way is to put pieces behind some sort of pay wall, experience, credits, tech tree, whatever.  As well as have some sort slow progression like we see with the CPU here.I understand the need for money, the game doesnt exist without it, but the way its currently set up is less fun than it used to be, to the point where I dont play anymore.If it were up to me, all ""default"" parts for free and charge for absolutely everything cosmetic, if that means premium to access  cosmetic parts/paint or pay for singles, however.  No levels, no tech tree, no crates, just big tubs of lego and a battleground, you want paint, or a fancy head or a flag or whatever, money.  I understand many people enjoy the whole progression thing though so... not likely I guess.  Maybe CPU tied to level?  Fixes underCPUing with big parts against low stocked people but still provides a progression of some kind.  Then let me pay to max my level?  I'd pay for that, wouldnt be pay to win because I wouldnt actually have any advantages over those people who didnt pay. (cpu matched against cpu, everyone has all parts) I'd pay for paint colors.. more paint options (seperate cubes into 4 for painting maybe) I'd pay to look ""cool"", however that might work out.   And I have paid to get through some of the progression, but again would appreciate a cut the leveling option and let me max out my level for 30 bucks, or 25 cents a level or something.  I want to play the game-game, not mess around with everything that gets tacked onto the game as if its supposed to somehow enrich my experience.. tech tree/xp/levels, earning and shopping, crates.The problem is this.. right now I have a hard time recommending it to anyone, I dont anymore unless I think the game would really fit that person.  When I have in the past, to everyone I could, they last awhile, but got tired playing with the same small pool of parts and small vehicles...  For me again, building a big cool vehicle is at least half the fun, and blowing off large bits of enemy robots while bits of me fly off is up there too.. doesnt happen much at low cpu.  I imagine retention of new players is on the lower side.  Maybe 20 or so gamer acquaintances have tried it, I thought most would like it... but only 3-4 ever played more than a few days, and only 1 other I think really got into it enough to spend a few bucks. Maybe the devs feel like the game needs value, like if the parts arent ""worth"" anything, if players dont need to grind to build big bots, then the game isnt tangible enough or something?  Did they get a consultant or come up with the idea that ""If you dont value your own work no one will"" Or something like that?  I really really REALLY liked this game, I probably spent as long playing it with the independant client as I have on steam.  I would have spent more money on it.The recentish gameplay changes... Im mixed on, variety is nice with the weapons, but there are valid issues with them I guess, never felt like they really ""ruined"" the game though... Just changed things.  Not a fan of the single block choice now though at all.  Like more CPU but dont like leveling.  Auto self heal feels really wrong.I do feel like some of these changes were made for primary financial rather than gameplay reasons, whether thats attracting peoplem, I mean game needs people right, could argue thats gameplay but.. cmon...  Or encouraging current players to spend more.  The crates drop thing feels like a total gimmick aimed at attracting people that play other crate focused games.  Its the crate thing that really motivated me to give a thumbs down and not play anymore.  The armour thing.. I dont know.. ok?  Feels like a gimmick again with the rewards. I dunno, I dont have a real thought out solution, all I know right now is I want to play robocraft, but not this robocraft.  Hearing the same thing from the couple I know that liked it enough to play occasionally.  So Im not going to be giving them any money, or talking it up a ton... which I imagine isnt going to help the bottom line, and thats the whole problem here isnt it?I dont want to give this game a thumbs down, it deserves a thumbs up, it really does.

								I tried to like Robocraft. I really did, but too much of this game is money-oriented. The game mechanics were very unique and quite interesting, but you get new items randomly out of crates. I, as a long-time TF2 player, do not have a problem with this, but again, as a long-time TF2 player, I don't like how getting more powerful weapons faster means spending money. Premium? Money! You want another crate without playing? Money! You want to buy your weapons? MONEY!Being a new player, what really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was how unbalanced the items vs levels system was. Sure, to put more items on your robot meant needing a higher level (somewhat indirectly), but that's about where that ends. You could buy, say, a target-locking missile launcher, and one or two rotor blades, and there you go! BEST ON THE SERVER.I find that fact a little depressing, especially since all this means I could've enjoyed the game a bit more if I had some money to spend on it, but I don't.I don't know what I was expecting. Another good F2P game? Of course not. What I get is this mess of a game. Robocraft isn't worth your time. At least until they fix all the flaws in the game provided by things like the Epic Loot update. Seriously, just look at some of the other bad reviews.			"

								I've always played pretty casually. I enjoyed making fun robots, trying to make jets that fly well. Maybe I haven't played 3000 hours, but this last update is terrible. I am lvl 82 and because I wanted to try a different style of robot, ended up selling a bunch of pieces because they nerfed the way you earn money. Not only is there a terrible exchange rate for pieces you get, the pieces you buy are astronomically expensive with in game currency. The only way to get them is to either grind or pay. And I did pay for premium a few times because I enjoyed the better rewards. But that was a while back before it was pay 2 win.I liked the old Robocraft better.			"

								The new epic loot system is a cashgrab. You're forced to have premium AND buy crates to make any reasonable progression . It's pay to win now, with no real ""in"" for free2play folks. As their current already well stocked players dwindle, I doubt they'll be replaced in sufficient numbers. Premium mode I didn't mind. Crates are BS, and do NOT feel good, even for someone with a lot of money like me, as it's a complete gamble. BAD, BAD update. Needs reverted. Don't bother with the game till they do. Because getting specific blocks is pretty much not going to happen, even unique builds are done for. Basic boxes with guns on top are the way forward...			"

								Took a concept that was going into a great direction, ruined it by taking out all of the things that made that concept unique and transformed the game's economy into a cliche rng loot system. If someone who played the game six months ago comes back to check out new updates and is so saddened that they uninstall, there's a problem.			"

								Loved this game once, now they ruined it. Had tons of weapons in storage because I liked to swap and build different bots, now they are useless because I have to re-craft things I already paid for before?Not to mention the total dumbing down of game mechanics has made this such a boring game to play.No thanks, I am done with this game unless they fix it.

								I just launched this game again to play it find they've removed the tier system. As another reviewer has pointed out it's an absolute joke. I would strongly NOT recommend this game. This game no longer deserves the outdated 'very positive' reviews it once had when it was an great, fun and enjoyable game. Just look at this utter crudhttp://i.imgur.com/3N4d275.jpg""Holy crap you need 30M+ to play a non-deathmatch game. By the time you get there you will be so board of playing this grinder. What happened to the tier system?! What idiot came up with this new system thinking it was better?""""I used to enjoy this game... until they made you need a 35 million or more robot ranking to play Battle Arena. It's an absolute nightmare to level up or gain RP without being able to play that gamemode.Bring it back and this review turns 'Yes', Robocraft Devs.""			"

								Alright. Old, pointless, positive 2015 review deleted, new one started. I have about 600+ hours on the actual launcher, which is why I only have 70+ hours on steam. I got this game a month after it released, and I'm sad to say that they’re ruining their own game, update after update. Around mid-2015 was when the game and it’s updates started going downhill starting with “Robocraft: Unleashed” which was the update that removed the tech points. The tech points were original, creative, and fun to unlock. Robocraft's peak point was definitely the update of ""Dawn of the Megabots.""The most recent update that was entitled “Epic Loot” was what really halted things, now that RP, GC, and the tech tree are gone, and everything has been replaced with robits. Robits are the new currency. The only way to receive robits is to recycle other, most likely needed robot parts. Really? That’s the only way? I feel like this system is based on a landfill that we scavenge for parts to recycle. The economy is now pretty much broken, since now there are crates that give you random things, crappy or good. You get a crate at the end of a match. The crate you get depends on how well you did. There's a total of 6 crates. The rusty is the worst, and the protonium is the best. I don’t see any difference between the type of crate. They all have crappy items that’s only useful for selling.One thing that keeps pestering me is that skill is unneeded. Completely. Since there is no RP that’s given in the amounts of skill, and since you get crates with random possibilities, the reward system is entirely luck based. You can fire once at an enemy, do the smallest amount of damage, and then hide at the corner of a map for the rest of the match and still receive the same if not possibly better “rewards” than someone else who carried half of the team.Speaking of rewards, they’re mostly building cubes and ugly cosmetics that are worth little to nothing. I swear, I barely get any of the essential parts for my robots, and when I get a rare or an epic, it’s a rather pointless cosmetic thats only worth 100 robits(FreeJam released a patch that added a fair value of the cosmetics).The matchmaking in this game is like pairing up 2 animals; one mammal, one reptile, and classifying them both as an insect. One example of the bad matchmaking is a seal-club. It’s basically where you’re a high-leveled player and you go into a low-cpu match as a tiny drone with powerful and effective weapons to terrorize the enemy team. When you’re in your first match, you’ll most likely be greeted to a barrage of bullets to the face by an Ion Distorter robot. I have some weak drones in my bays that I use every so often. When I brought this 196-cpu drone into a match of Battle Arena, I came face to face with a drone with 3 Ion Distorters and a Plasma Goliathon that had to be well over 800 cpu. It’s now a painful grind when you’re building a robot that you’re trying to build. It doesn’t matter what level you are or what your CPU is. Since you get such a little dose of what you previously got before the epic loot update, it may take a boring hour-long grind just to get a part that you need since things are so damn expensive in the shop. Most of the time after opening a crate, I earn a mere 200-300 robits in parts, or up to 800 robits if I’m lucky enough. Some of the good parts can cost thousands of robits. Getting 1 high-leveled gun for a 6-gun pack robot can take minutes, hours, or days depending on your luck.	It seems like now these days, no one has a sense of teamwork. Usually everyone splits and you’ll always see those lone, blue dots that are probably disappearing one by one. The removal of mega-bots was probably the cause. Back then, everyone actually had some sort of objective to do. You and your team would be huddled with your one megabot you guys had. You’d see chat messages what were constructive in feedback and strategy. Now what is it? The only chat messages you’ll see are the salty comments, usually in complaint of someone hacking. Individual robots(usually drones) will rush the enemy reactor on Battle Arena, in search for points. Everyone does their own thing.	Now for the points system. Yes, there's several issues with the points system as well. The points system is the system that gives you the qualities of crates depending on how well/lucky you were. Remember those robot drones that rush the enemy reactor in Battle Arena? They know that chipping away the reactor for 3 minutes and doing nothing else can give you as much points as someone who has 10 or more kills. If you do nothing but shoot the reactor, you’re guaranteed first place. I remember one time in a game of Battle Arena, I got 19 kills, 2 deaths, and 7 assists. Someone who spent the entire match shooting at the reactor got twice as more points than me, and he only had 2 kills, 7 deaths, and 1 assist. That’s dumb. The reactor gives you way too much points for destroying it.Building an advanced robot is a game of “Guess n’ check.” If you buy an item that is too weak or too powerful for your robot? Too bad. Go get your robits back by selling things that you might or might not need. I mean, if you don’t plan your build ahead, you’ll be left in the dirt from buying things that you didn’t intend to buy. At least give us some kind of singleplayer sandbox gamemode where all of the parts are free.Oh wait, before doing that, why don’t you slap some kind of premium content onto there, since everything that doesn’t need to be premium for has to be related to premium in some way. I know it’s premium, and there are an infinite number of games that have premium, but the features shouldn’t be on things like paint and random rewards. Actually, those are probably the only non-game-breaking premium feature options available, since they’ve focused the most on player progression, which rewrites the economy. It’s been through so many changes, each one making it worse and worse.The “Build, Drive and Fight” motto has nearly faded. For the “Build”, it was building an original, creative robot and using your imagination to your limits. “Drive” was, well, drive. “Fight” was using your own skills and abilities to your advantage, which leads to teamwork and victory. Now, the “Build” is more of “Share” because they added the ability to share robots. There are very few original robots that are good out there. Players who do make their own robots usually slap some kind of easy-killing weapon on a flat sheet of blocks supported by wheels or legs. The “Fight” motto is pretty much gone as well. “Fight” in this game means ‘use auto-target/lock-on weapons’ that are for those who’ve lost the concept in aiming, or they’re just simply horrible at the game.This is basically how most F2P games slowly evolve in a negative way, and die out quickly because they pushed their greediness too far. The developers ditch the community, thinking that their ideas are pointless, and the devs decide to listen to themselves and opt in for the cash grab. The crates are a prime example of this. Gamble to get something you want or need. If you didn’t get what you needed, flush some more money down the toilet. F2P Game Development is like an on-going drug that worsens over time. Desperation and greed for money takes over, and you’ve now turned a game that could’ve had so much potential into a trap that pressures people into giving their money to something that doesn’t deserve any.I want to enjoy and recommend this game, just like I did back in 2014, but I can’t.Until you devs can get your heads out of your asses and start listening to the community, I’m staying unrecommended.You can download this game if you want. It’s your choice. Be warned, though, as you will experience lots of hatred, frustration, and disappointment throughout gameplay.			"

								The epic loot update has rendered this game functionally unplayable for most styles of machine, weapon types, and previously popular designs.The free-to-play progression has become erratic and reduced to a snails pace by RNG based reward recycling instead of fixed score-based income.Matchmaking is essentially nonfunctional due to changes ushering in a new age of high level single guns on low level mobility parts oneshotting themselves and everything else for the same rewards as full-CPU designs... when poor underweight machines aren't being dragged into 1500+ games for no reason to begin with.Wait for fixes, hope for the best, but as for now, expect nothing.

								Greatly dissapointedEDIT: 27 feb 2017After a week with a new elo-based ranking system, the win-lose ratio is nearly perfectly 50%. This might be considered a good thing, except it's litterally every other game is a win or a lose. And not by after a long, even battle either. Complete walkover every single game. Only thing that changes is if you're the one roflestomping the other team, or the one being roflstumped. Losing a game after a long, hard, even fight is fun. Losing a game after the enemy team has decided 15min is enough time to grind up kills for XP is not. Still greatly dissapointed.			"

								Do NOT get this game. WOW!It has only gotten worse and worse. Back in 2014 Everything was fantastic! We had a cool tech tree that inspired all players to keep playing, building, battling, and creating. There use to be a bunch of good game mechanics and the play was addicting and would keep you satisfied foralmost every battle. Since then, A lot has changed. Everyone was excited when we heard we would get new weapons and better parts, but there were some changes to how much RP (Robo Points) you could get from winning. The changes kept coming, with each update going one step forward and three steps back. Back in the good days, there were various tiers of blocks, with the higher tier blocks having more health than the previous tier. Those had good things and bad things, but for the most part they were good. (Each tier of block would be a different color, essentially meaning the ""paint"" that we have now was all free and you didn't have to buy premium to get cool colors.) The update back in the winter of 2015 changed a LOT. With the various block tiers gone, the MILLIONS of RP that I had spent on Strong&Healthy™ blocks had all gone to wast, WITH NO REFUND! I could also get into the ranking system. It used to be great, allowing for higher tier items to go into lower tiers, wich allowed for more fun. Even though it may sound ""unfair"" it would not be an effective strategy for actuall combat. This system worked well and rank was built around each weapon having a different Robo score. But as with all good things in Robocraft, that was removed. And instead, it was replaced by a system that still had tiers, but wasn't as fun. Adding restrictions to a Creative game is just something that doesn't ever work out too well. Eventually the tier system was abolished and replaced with a system that puts you in a match with robots that have a similar overall robot level. That was nothing compared to what it has turned into now. Now, The tech tree idea has been trashed and instead replaced by a rarety system with crates. This new update completely killed robocraft. (as if the other updates hadn't done enough damage already) The game is no longer based around skill or experience, it is PURE LUCK. You used to be able to get new items by buying them off the shop with the RP you had earned by battling, (the better you did the more you earned) but now, the only way you will be able to get your hands on that nice Plasma Cannon is by opening a crate and praying that you get it. And as others Have said, The current game, as it stands, is purely luck based.Well FreeJam ill give it to you, You sure do know how to ruine a great game!TL;DRThe game now suckspoint system has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥br>No longer an insentive to playALL LUCK, NO SKILLDon't waste your time on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameused to be fantastic game but♥♥♥♥♥♥♥devs killed it this just shows how much the devs don't care. https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726373014854615040FUN FACT!All the cool building they are doing in the trailer/video are with the old version, when it didn't suck as bad!

A year ago it was a simplistic game with lots of potential it had the microtransactions you would expect from any f2p game but it wasnt pay to win, it would simply speed up leveling up so you could get to the point where buying 10 cubes of the next tier up didnt take 5 games. Now its just pay to win and has lost the core consept of the game where you would place the best tier cubes you could get under your piolet seat and guns and use half cubes to channel where damage would go keeping it away from your pilot seat but now it is just how many guns can you put on that you bought with real moneya good game wasted.

								I'm going to sum up Robocraft for you.Play a match. get a loot crate.Open the loot crate, get a bunch of building blocks, and maybe a thruster. Look at the loot you could've gotten if you had premium: a few top tier weapons, of course.Try to sell the parts you recieved for money.make $100.go to the shop to buy a weapon with your $100.The weapon you want is over $200k.Die a little on the inside. Cry a little on the outside.Complain about the game in global chat.And rather than uninstalling, you jump into another match and waste another 15 minutes of your life.Rather than calling themselves FREEjam, they should call themselves PAY2WINjam.

If you do enjoy any part of the game just remember the devs will kill it with the next patch. Anytime spend perfecting your crafts will 90% chance or more of been 100% useless in future patches.Then you have all the bugs and random disconnects, at times games with hackers (not recently). New loot system not giving crates when Im top on a winning team 2 games in a row... gg epic ripoff systemI have left game with 45+days of premium left which just shows how bad it is.... I did try the new update but already knew they broke the game just on randomised loot.			"

People who also used to play Robocraft understand me.Why not recommending?Because you've repelled me the game!So please, make something like Backup to the old version...It was one of the most interesting games i've played!

								Having played this game for a good amount of time, I can safely say I enjoy the core gameplay and building mechanic. So... Why am I giving a negative review? Well, dear friends, let me tell you.It comes down to two things: Crates and balance.Talking about balance, rails and minibots have once again become the new meta. Great job, FJ.And crates... Ugh. It would take MONTHS to grind for a single legendary items, and from what I've heard even the ones you can buy have terrible chances. Robocraft has gone from a fun, if slightly unbalanced arena fighter to a toxic grindfest, in the blink of an eye- And even in the midst of literally everyone pitching in, FreeJam still refuses to accept their mistake and fix it. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!			"

								AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS, READ BELOW.This used to be a fantastic game, one of very few games where I would come back time & time again because although F2P it didn't overly push you to spend real-world money.  Well that didn't last.There was a change last year that completely unravelled all the years of hard work that FreeJam had clearly put into this great concept.  There was an epic paradigm shift that has simultaneously both screwed over long-term players who had reached a high level in this game, accruing many parts and made it near impossible for new players to have any sort of progression or great hights to aim for.  This is further compounded by the massive tilt of the game economics towards forcing people to spend money via a headlong dive into the Pay2Win model.I feel the need to remind everyone that THIS GAME IS ONLY IN BETA!  FreeJam expect people to drop serious cash on a game that is neither finished nor actually released in the traditional sense - You can spend $60 on console and receive a polished, finished AAA title with no need to spend any further cash if you don't want to.  The FreeJam business plan seems akin to Honda charging you $100,000 for a new car that isn't out yet, keeps asking for more money, it may or may not have wheels/seats/roof and degrades faster than milk.

								This game was really interesting at the start, but all the new things ruin it. U could only use 1 weapon type and hat to aim at the beginning, nowadays u can have different weapon types, which means u can have a invincible robot cause u have anti ground and anti air cannons. Also alot of the weapons are lock on now, which also renders aircrafts rather useless especially the more fragile ones. This Game had alot of potential sadly its just a casual shooter nowadays. I can't recommend u getting it.			"

								It's free, but the amount of money you would have to pay to get what's in the trailer is astronomical.  Battle mode isn't fun enough to justify the amount of playtime required to attain flashier blocks just to play more battle mode.EDIT:I never said it was pay to win, but it's absolutely and positively ""pay to have fun"".  It takes a long time to get in game currency which is predominantly used for building blocks, paying to get more is an option.  Unless you want to spend many hours on this game in a boring and poorly made battle mode to get in-game currency just to buy more blocks, then your option is to pay a substantial amount of money.  It would be a completely different story if the gameplay was interesting, tactical, or fun.The game is not fun for me.Battle mode seems like a barrier for me to get currency to get blocks rather than an experience which rewards me with currency to enhance an already great game.  This game is not fun.  This game is not good.  This game is a terrible, awful, tank shooter with a gimmick tacked on so that i'll buy some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.If you genuinely enjoy the game, more power to you, it's free, Try it out, But don't get baited into buying something if the core game mechanic is inherently tedious and insultingly dull.

								Why when i first played this game it was so fun you had to earn your equipment the it went to if you were that level you got the stuff which was the begening of the end. Then they removed the stronger blocks and made it just one type which was to try to make it more accessible to beggeners, but took away late game challenges. Then the next sign this game was dead was when they added the flak cannon one of the now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t guns that ruin the game. But oh no they couldnt handle the fact that the bank full of misguided peoples money wasnt full enough so then they added crates and removed currency and added ""robits"" the illusion of money not to mention crates. Well where to start with crates lets start with the fact even the higest rarity crate has almost no chance of having somthing you might acctualy want and they fact that when you do want robits you have to recycle the items you had or got from crates leading to an illusion of currency whne its just a shadow of the items you had and not to mention the fact that they only sell for 1/10000000 of what its acctualy worth. This game used to be so fun then payday 2 showed up and said you know what this is a f2p so you cant sell dlc so just do crates without keys at first so they want to try to get crates then make they have to be opend with keys. I swear later they will have skins and you have to open them with keys. In summary save space on your computer for cat pictures that make you feel happy while this game makes you want to kill the devs of this game who need to have so much money they can swim in it otherwise its north korea you can barely do anything but when you can its the best ever keeping you hooked so you will never leave and you always have in the back of your mind "" if i pay for this i can be so much better but is it really worth it"" no no it isnt.

								i used to play the robocraft often but after the new ""epic loot"" update i personaly think that instead of being able to choose what you want to have and create your own unique play style, it has become if you pay you can get the materials needed to do and create what you want.with the loot crates you are given as a reward for playing you get ""100% random items"" and yet i have never got anything i wanted that wasent in the premium slot, which of course you have to buy premium to unlock.another thing that i disaprove of in the update is the ""robits"" feature, which are what you use to ""forge"" parts but the only way to get them is to recycle what you already have for about 1-25% of its value depending on its rarity.

Avoid until fixedPlayed first in 2014, kept playing and got the 2015 robo. It is a fun game with great potential... However the netcode and connection issues make this game the most infuriating game to play. Once you DisConnect from the game, you're stuck in limbo for the rest of your match with no one moving, none of your hits displaying damage, and being unable to quit the match because the developers simply refuse to put that functionality in the esc menu. However dispite not appearing to do anything, your shots and positioning of your vehicle after a DC still Affects the Game through ""Ghosts"". Damage you deal in DC limbo keeps damaging still connected players, and if you park on the capture point You Will be counted as capturing and your oppenents will lose the game to an invisible capper.The build aspect is fun but handicaped in the epic loot update, restricting your build options to random drops from loot crates. You can forge parts you want however the currency required comes from recycling random drops which gives next to nothing.All in all it's a game with great potential but is handicapped in so many ways that it is at best Infuriating to play, and at worst completly unplayable.

								Please robocraft developers, PLEASE LISTEN to these things which made ROBOCRAFT a good game and how you ruined it,you removed:1.Tech tree - now everyone can get everything on level 12.Different block types - before you had block tiers, with different colours and etc.3.Megabots - they were awesome, I am not sure how much cpu you could have but it was way more than 2000.4.Earning money instead of crates at the end of the match5.Team deathmatch6.The pit (not this brawl bs)7.Feel of progression - now you just login, open a crate, hope it is something, most times it isnt and then you just go into battle, you are able to buy everything (if you have enough money)I play robocraft since 2014/2015 and things were a lot better back then... robocraft is like no man's sky but the other way around (robocraft is getting worse) If you bring back these things ^, I guarantee you that you will get at least 10x more playersmore players = more premium memberships = more moneyit is as simple as that :)			"

								Hello, here is my review of my favourite game that became♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Im not english so im sorry for any mistakes i make in spelling in thsi review.I used to love this game back at the day, I played it every day.What was there back in the good old days? - tier system. If your bot was tier 2, you would face people in tier 2. If you could build a tier 3 bot, but builded a tier 2 bot, you can play against tier 2 bots again. Higher tier = more RP (currency in the game)  If you had premium (WHAT WAS OPTIONAL) you got double the income from everygame and gave other poeple +5% income. Not more- colours. Every tier had his own cube color (tier 9 purple, tier 10 black/red) Of you had tier 10 cubes you was the♥♥♥♥♥♥ because those cubes had the most lives. - Tier x. Back in the day there was a tier x (MAX tier) you could build a gigantic robot (about 3 times a tier 10 size) and battle against another tier x with tier 10 in your team. That was fun- healing. I loved to play healer in the game, everyone liked you because you helped them and it helped the tier x to stay alive.- tech tree. The tech tree was amazing, in tier one you could unlock tier one cubes, tier one guns etc. after every battle in tier one you got tier one unlock points that only unlocked tier one stuff. in tier 2 you got tier 2 unlock tokens etc. that was balanced.where did it go wrong? It started (i think) a year ago when they changed the tier system to idk what that was called. It was possible to make  a 0 to about 32k points bot and battle against the same amount of points robots. (nobody new why they did this) It was ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, the tier system was cool. I was tier 10 then. (The highest what you could be in battles without tierx) and after the update i was ""32K"".Some months later they changed the tech tree system. They removed unlock tokens, and made a spiral like tech tree that  unlocked automatic parts for what level you were. (no problem, you get the unlock tokens back in RP! What was like nothing) Still, the gameplay was fine and i was still playing it. What is wrong now a days?Problem number 1: They removed tier X (a lot of players quited the game) problem number 2: They made a new feature, auto healing! if you didnt shoot, or got shot, you healed back to full health. My favourite class was totaly useless. Why would you heal somebody if they healed themslefs....Problem number 3: first they removed every cube, everybody has the same cubes in the same colours that you can paint (antoher thing if you dont have premium, you only have 4 colours, if you pay, you have 9 more) This was stupid, tier 10 that was the cool black colour wasnt cool anymore because everyone that had premium could paint there bor black.Problem number 4: they removed the ♥♥♥♥ing shop! you cant buy cubes, guns, shields etc. anymore. NO, the only way to get new parts is by opening crates. Sounds fun! (thats what i tohught, because as a hearthstone player i like opening pack to get random stuff. But i was wrong. At this point the pay to win flew trough the ♥♥♥♥ing ceiling! In every box you got from team deathmatch you got 1 part. BUT if you had premium you got the other part to :) NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So every match lasted about 5 - 10 minutes and you get one part, a part that you couldnt choose. The parts are ranked in rarity. The strong guns that you had in tier 10 became epics (very rare) and the old tierX are legendariesch now (IMPOSSIBLE to get if you dont pay. Do you want to buy a legendary? it is possible ig you sell al your other parts and maybe, just maybe you can buy a TO expensive gun. So if you have A LOT of money and are LUCKY you can get what? tier 10? no that doesnt excist anymore, max level? yes you could try to get max level but nobody can see it in a match. This game was so much fun and i hate it that it is so much♥♥♥♥♥♥at the moment. If i could change one thins to the game, it would be deleting EVERYTHING back to the tier systemDid i forgot to say that the game is unblanced at the moment? legendary guns are so powerfull. if you get one early on, you can destry a very strong bot that has played over 200 hours. even if your looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥and the one you shot looks amazing.♥♥♥♥ this game			"

								TL;DR: Terrible macthmaking ruins a fantastic game.Could be an awesome game. But sadly it's now yet.I really enjoyed it first and so will you if you download it and give it a try.The core fo the game is great, building and continously making your robots better, redesigning it after every lose-streak or mayor update.It's polished, sort of. There is really only one big flaw with the game and it's so big that it makes a 10/10 game a 6/10 at best.It's matchmaking. It's terrible, Just plain terrible.Long story short your robot has a RobotRating(very clever). Based on this you get matched with people. Now guess what, older player who have unlocked better weapons that just shred through your robot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly easily can and will get matched with you. These players know how to build simplistic robots with epic weapons compared to what you could have and just faceroll you over and over again.I really tried to get over this. Leveled a bit, hoping that this issue will smooth out as I unluck more stuff. It doesn't.Since the terrible matchmaking, every second match is decided by who has those players with just plain better equipment. And I'm not extragrating. You RARELY, INCREDIBLY RARELY will find a match that is fun for everybody, competetive and players have equal footing when they enter the match.No matter how good you play, what tactic you use with your friends you WILL GET ABSULETLY DESTROYED almost every match by 1-2 players who have better stuff.It's just terrible. If you want to grind for weeks to get lvl 100 to be able to be THAT player go for it.If you want to play a game and enjoy it entirely, move along.If you want to have fun for 10-20 hours until you get too fed up with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking, download it & give it a try, because the game is awesome.

								EDIT:FREEJAM HAS STARTED BUYING GOOD REVIEW BOTS!YOU CAN SEE THE BOT ACCOUNTS IN THE GOOD REVIEW SECION, PLEASE INCLUDE THIS IN YOUR REVIEW, MAKE IT KNOWN!!!A case of false advertising should be brought up. The pictures for the game do not accurately portrait what you are looking at. Realisticly, you will probably never be able to  have any of that, unless you sell your children to a slave camp.The funny thing about those pictues, is you cannnot outfit a mech with the Biggest Legs, 2 Chain Shredders, 200+ blocks, AND a module, with sheilds, AND 2 lomls. Thats just plain not possible. Not even close!So why should Freejam be able to have this garbage on Steam if they're just lieing in the ""SCREENSHOTS""?The game itself is questionably the worst case of money hungry developers. Freejam as a company went off the deep end entirely. Their 'FANBASE', or whats left of it, is comprised of 10 year old children who don't know better than to give a positive review.Most of the reviews for Robocraft ARE negitive, and this ""Mostly Positive"" was from people who left their review YEARS ago, and in a better state of the game. I garrentee if that person saw today's Robocraft, it would be an instant NOT RECCOMENDED.DO NOT GET THIS GARBAGE GAME!The Devs are decieving LIERS and will not listen to ANYTHING you have to say, weather its good or bad advice. And their 'Community manager'? The F*** he there for? He just licks Drognin's Left nut all day for some sweet protonium revenue.If you read this review and still get the game, I literally hope you jump off a bridge. I mean that.Do not give this game ANY SUPPORT, its been 100% RUINED by greedy. ignorant, SLOBS.			"

								So, i have very much to tell about  this, wonderful, fantastic, funny game :D. So, about the game. This a free-to-play game, its an MMO state and its still in ALPHA like wtf :D, i can't believe that they are still adding things to this game. This game has wonderful graphics, (almost any computer can run the game out). The awesome thing is, U CAN BUILD WHATEVER u want, yes, even♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :D.U can build: Tanks, bikes, planes, hovercrafts, plasma tanks, rail tanks, hovertanks, anything, u , can imagine, I have made like 30 tanks, cuz the possibilities (sorry for my english, im from Estonia c:). Ok, now, the things Robocraft needs, MORE MAPS FFS, only 2 types of maps? robocraft are you kidding me? it needs more beatiful and awesome worlds, like an moon map, where is lower gravity or smth, grassland, with water ETC, More maps please! <3My older computer, it has wierd pink textures on the blocks, ONLY the blocks. The guns, pilot seat, radars, thrusters, wheelst etc don't have pink textures, only the blocks, can Robocraft fix it please? :) <3 <3 <3As the game says, BUILD - DRIVE - FIGHT (BDF) i like to call it. you freaking create a laser shooting tank with friking hover blades and giant thrusters and friking T10 electroplates and friking giant wheels just full speed rushing at you, u can even build better xD, I really love this game because of the fun, tanks, jets,planes,HEALERS, yes, they can heal you and destroy enemies at the same time, i have played it for 20-30 hours already and im almost T5 :D... okay, i think some people have told you this, but, Please <3 increase the CPU limit :( its too small... and please also increase the RP u can gain completing levels, :c i get max 500 RP, its so f'ing low :PP Btw, about the maps, i might even help you Robocraft, but i cant like in person come to your Office, :D i live really far from you :PPPP but thats it i can say about robocraft :)-Mr.ImVeryFat out- "

								I loved this game. I played for hours and finally justified investing a little bit of money in it to get some better stuff and a month of premium. Everything was great...until the last patch. This most recent patch made the game absolutely horrible by restricting the number of online playable gamemodes to ONE unless you are a certain rank. I paid for premium and only have the option to play the most time consuming, unfun gamemode. I have 17 days left of premium and they are most likely going to go unused because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

								I don't see why people are butthurt over the recent update. This game is absolutely amazing. Overtiering? Never seen that before. Unbalanced matches? Never seen that too. able to rerout damage? So what? You have the ability to do that too. Sure, the only gamemode new players can play is team pvp but, that's also fun. Grinding in this game is pretty much playing the game. This game isn't some rpg where you have to do the exact same missions, each 'mission' in this game is unique. The only bad thing I could think off are some idiots who either:1. They don't heal you, ever2. they go off alone and die instantly3. People who has a mind so simple the only thing they could think of is ""Let's completely ignore tactics and go rambo style and cause my team to lose.Yeah. Overall I suggest this game.			"

								Imagine playing with Legos. Imagine having little battles with other people who play with similar things.Now imagine someone coming in with some massively overbuilt thing that just wrecks all of you without trying.Well, you could just build neat things that make you happy. Creative creations.Or you could, if you weren't limited to four colors unless you buy premium.You could grind battles losing over and over to overtiered nonsense, but that takes forever.Without premium, anyway.And, if you really need that block, well, you could just buy it, right?Every problem with this game is solved with money, and that's its core issue. It got enough attention that the developers attempted everything they could to money-grab, and in the end, it got less functional than it already was.This has been an Early Access Review™, and will continue to be one for all eternity. You think anyone would leave Early Access? They can play the ""It's still in development"" card forever if they keep it this way. (Betas and Early Access are not supposed to have payshops...)			"

								My first review about this game was positive because I was mainly playing the Single Player mode. After a few hours, that was not enough anymore then I started to play Team Deathmatch and Battle Arena. At TD there's no reason to play serious. Even if you get top score, if you die you'll receive the same Bronze box you would receive if you died at the start of match (after do some damage to an enemy, only). There's no teamwork because only the top score ALIVE at the end of the match will receive the Protonium box, so is just a race for kills and points. If by any chance you finish the match alive, but you did no damage to an enemy, you'll not receive any box: 0 score = 0 box, even on the winning team.BA has (usually) better players and teamwork because you need to capture points and defend base, but you still will find rushers that just run to the enemy base to destroy it fast,  My main complain about this game is:There's no reason to work a long time in garage to design and build a robot only to be made in pieces by a micro robot using shotgun with hovers and 5 cubes as base, just because the matchmaker allow this kind of stupid design.

								Long story short, DONT invest your money in the game! (Game in a Nutshell---->)You will quit after maybe 2 days or so, grinding for hours just for some goddam blocks you wanted. Ever since the update, the game turned into a cesspool of ""GIVE US YOUR MULAH"". CratesCrates, dear god... They were the main focus of the recent ""epic"" update. FreeJam removed the past currency (Rp & Gc)  and replaced it with ""Robits"" which seem like Green Powder. The only way to get Robits is to recycle parts you get from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crates. A way to get a decent amount of Robits is, to buy about 50 Protonuim Crates and open em, recycling every item except items above uncommon. (Uncommon is represented by a green puke effect thingy) (Common = Blocks, dont sell em, it's not worth it)The ForgeBasically its a shop, which allows you to buy ANYTHING at a high cost of Robits.GameplayYou will find plenty of opponents who have better weapons that you and tons of Tiny Hover-Flies that will shiphon the life of whatever you built. Snipers in every game, ZERO teamplay due to the Big Score = Better Cratezzz.BuildingsJust build a massive brick, just do it, it's all you got. (Or just build a flippin medic)Overall DONT INVEST COUNTLESS HOURS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON THIS GAME!   #MakeRoboCraftGreatAgain "

								I have been with robocraft for quite a while, and honestly, I do not like the direction they are going. It used to be a great build and bash that was pretty balanced, but it seems like over the updates, the balance has gone away. Pay to win is the name of this game with the recent update, no more money from winning matches, just random ""loot"" crates, that you only get half of if you are not a premium user.While they do drop free premium every once in a while, it's not keeping me attached to this game anymore. I don't think it's worth too much more of my time unless some changes are made.			"

								This game used to be about engineering and it was very fun.The engineering depth was removed to the point of Robocraft becoming a generic fps with sluggish controls.The developers seem to be trying to mix features from multiple games into their game, and it's not working. The random crate drop system is bad, the chief game mode (battle arena) is boring, and the skill depth of both building and fighting has been reduced to the competence of a 8 year old. The awful thing is that this game used to be a lot more fun before many changes were made.In short, stay away from Robocraft. The game developers don't have any intuition about how to design a fun game.-I will change this review if the game ever progresses instead of regresses. "

								Once was a good game, acutally fun and took some effort to get other things; branches of paths to choose which way you want to go. At a point it peaked, where it became extremely popular for what it WAS. Now it is but a multiplayer sandbox, Freejam ignoring many of the community suggestions and creating a compremise for what little money they make. No tech tree, Nothing of that. Only compremises that make up for the TRUCKLOAD OF BUGS that exist in Robocraft to keep players' attention. The earlier stages of the game were better, what the community liked. We started suggesting things we liked and it all went to♥♥♥♥♥♥because of Freejam ignoring many things in the future/now.

								the game was a little unbalanced when i started, some wepons were a little over powered such as the proto seeker, rail guns,tesla,... and some wepons (including building blockes) were under powered such as the plasma canons,sheilds,lasers, basic cubes...but the consept was great. you had robot levels and every time you leveled (i cant spell) up you got 10 CPU (which allowes you to add extra matereals to your robot) and you unlocked an item or a set of items. the consept of RP (robopoints) was confusing, but the way you earned them and how much you earned was well thought out. every time you leveled up you usualy had enough RP to buy the new items. selling unwanted items was well thoughout and fairly priced. and the dynamics movment of the techs you built was well created and handled by the game. when the big update on april 28 came out RP was replaced with robo bits and all wepons and building blocks were rebalanced perfectly. HOWEVER (THIS IS A BIG HOWEVER), loot crates are a problem as they make robocraft look like other games like war thunder or pixle gun with a reward after fighting and a dayly reward, but the main sad thing is that when you level up, you dont unlock anything new (besides CPU), you can purchase everything right off the bat which removes the fealing of accomplishment. if it becomes anything more like other games i will UNINSTALL ROBOCRAFT... at that point its a waste of hard disk space to me.   i am so sorry but im worried about the future of this game			"

								Welcome to the game that only gets worse!!!This is a brilliant game if you love developers that only make the game system become more pay to win with each progressive update. Once upon a time this game was actually good, tiers existed, the game was balanced, no shields the didnt fit or stupid crates to open. I wish such a time could exist again.Good Job developers, you're idiots.			"

								used to have progression and you would need to grind, but you earned items. now its system is black ops 3, and is more confusing and stupid, instead of weapons and things having levels, they have names, and you need to check each individual item if its the better or worse version, and i spent hours upon hours grinding to get heavily armoured cubes and somewhat good weapons. well the game threw me the finger, and i don't think theyre switching it back, and even if they do, i don't think my armoured cubes will come back, as far as i can tell, this game is now trash, and until further updates, this game is trash			"

								Honestly This game Is a great concept and visually it works. There is alot to be said that is good about such a game, the voxel based construction and all its great its wonderful, but that is where it stops.The developers have repeatedly and continuously turn the game on its head since I started playing (before it was on steam) yes some changes arguably are and were merited but in general they have made many poor decisions and continue to keep making poor decisions. The game has been out well over a year and they claim they are still ""One step Closer to Beta"" as they launch their latest patch of poor decisions. These recent patches like most of the others have affected balance, destroyed the matchmaking system, and uterly decimated the economy. Expect to play 200-400 matches to build a fully functional robot with matching parts. Free-Jam does not admit to their mistakes, fix problems ,or even really listen to the community that despite disagreeing still want to see the game to succeed and come to fruitionIf you have been playing this game for awhile yeah you can still occasionally have fun as you already have the parts and the game-play and building still retains most of its appeal. But if you are new to the game I suggest looking elsewhere, you  are in for lots of seal clubbing by more experienced/better armed players, and rewards from battle that will keep you the unfortunate prey for many many many games to come.Maybe some day the Devs will mature and the game will stabilize, but until then I cannot recommend this game.

								Oooh boy, where do I start.First of all, this was an extremely fun game to play when I first started. The main focus was on building, and people got really creative and unique with their bots and strategies. Then, the developers started updating things, for better or (usually) for worse. There were some additions that were cool and fun like Arena Battles, the Maximum Loadout update(for the most part), the community robot factory, and so on.. However, they slowly removed some of our favorite features like low tier vs high tier battles,  Megabot battles and megabots in general,  and other things that aren't coming to mind(there were quite a few.) The main problem often is that every time the game updates, the mechanics completely change and often screw over people who played often.Spent forever getting tech tokens for new parts for your bots? Tech tree unlocks shifted to solely leveling up.Tiered armor cubes you spent hours to get? Replaced by a single tier cube and color options.Finally got better weapons and learned how to use them well? Overpowered weapon added that takes little skill.And for a while, it still somehow managed to be fun and enjoyable to some extent.Then, the epic loot update happened.This update essentially ruined any form of ranking or progress.All money was converted to ""robits"", which you could no longer get from battle, but by recycling other un-needed parts.  Dont worry, you could still get parts from crates dropped after battles and such. Except the contents are completely random. As a result, the tech tree was removed and everything was unlocked to even the newest of players. The different tier crates barely have a difference in drop rate, which means progress is based on luck rather than skill. Then, they removed robot ranking, our main measurement of progress and our way of telling what we'll be matched up with. Now, you can barely tell what kind of bots you'll be matched up against. And dont even get me started on the unbalanced weapons *cough Ion cannon cough*Basically, A new player could catch up to and surpass someone who's been playing for months in the span of a day or two by getting one overpowered weapon(as many people I know have.) In the words of someone else, ""Variety is the Spice of life… so do the right thing and breathe life back into the game.""Overall, I suggest you wait for the possibility the developers trying make the game as enjoyable as it used to be. Until then, I'm sure theres some other great games out there with equally great developers.Oh, and if you need any other proof, just keep scrolling down the review list. "

								It's been a long time I'm playing this games, and the crates update just kill the game. Let me explain, before when you win or lose a battle you had RP (money of the game) by how efficient you were in the battle, with the RP you were able to buy stuff for your bot, now it's just full random, you win ? well let me give you♥♥♥♥♥♥for you reward. You lose? well the random thing can give you a better stuff than the win reward. The game has lost in dynamic too, they nerf the rate of fire of every weapons to increase the time to kill but the game feel weird now. Instead of nerfing the rate of fire they just had to nerf the damage but I guess the dev just want to be original (hipster). I loved to play this game, now I feel sad because I unistall it.			"

								Terrible update for new players. You won't get anything done: single tires? I guess playing 100 matches to get a match of 4 tires is an awesome way to keep players playing. That's japanese MMORPG masochistic level of grinding. I bet it's more fun to hold a pebble in the rain and waiting for it to turn into a grain of sand. Matchmaking is also broken for smaller bots, you'll have to fight bots with weapons that have more health than your whole bot. Before the update: 8/10, afterwards 1/10.If you already have good bot, it's still fun to abuse the system and  pwn smaller players in the ground. Exept it isn't			"

The game was still fun, didnt feel like a grind and premium simply gave faster levels for more CPU and more robo and tech points - it was essentially pay to grind less.Now:I'd like to start off with a good point, then name the bad points in the middle and finish with some good points to represent what this game is now: A Turd Sandwich.+ Beautiful game that inspires creativity- Hackers are now present- If you dont have Premium, you will die of old age before you can afford one of the shamefully OP legendary weapons- Lost all sense of Progression- People spamming the chat begging people to buy their robots from factory+ Air Doge is funny░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░ ░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░ ░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░ ░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░ ░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░ ░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░ ░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░ ░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░ ░░░▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-- Freejam --░░░░░░░░░			"

								With the new loot update the game has gone down hill a lot. As a non-prem player you will be lucky to see a epic class items but will never see legendary class items as they will be on the prem side of the box and most of the time the good stuff is on the prem side of the box. It was a good game but now i feel like you can't go up if you don't have prem and I HATE IT WHEN GAMES FORCE THINGS ON YOU.....it gives the game a very bad feel to it.....like you are getting rip off just because you don't have prem.So if you have prem you will have fun but as a non-prem player i don't recommend this game. Sure you can try it out but i would play a different game. As i will be playing this game much less now or i might just stop playing it all together.			"

								The lock on weapons ruined the game. For me, I perfer to play as a plane and im sure a lot of other players do to but with the anti air cannons and lock on weapons, its pretty much impossible to get into the air for more than 10 seconds and not get hit. My question is why is there no anti ground wep? Do the devs hate aircrafts? this used to be my favourite game...			"

								This game crashes. A LOT.Why, I have to admit, this new ""Epic Loot"" update is great... For the first hour or two if it's your first time playing and the blocks you have are the crumby ones you get the very first time you play the game. Though once you get over how ""amazing"" that singular rare gun you got from that one lucky crate is, you'll succumb to the fact that basically everything you find in a crate is rubbish, especially since you have to buy premium to get half of what's in the crates anyways. This crate system can be seen one of two ways; either pay-to-win, or getting on your knees and praying to the RNG gods that, once, just once, you'd get an epic item from your protonium crate. Also here's a little anecdote that shows how terribly far both of these things have gone; I found a stinkin' legendary item in a bronze crate, but I needed premium to have collected it (The same thing happened to my friend, but with a different item). Speaking of big guns, they are litterally all you need to excel at this game. I build a 750 pflop tank, and it loses to some tiny bot, 90% of which is a single gun. Seriously? I could have sworn that spending time building a bot and succeeding with said bot had some relationship. I guess not. But who am I trash talk micro-bots. I built one myself, and I can get 6 kills in a single deathmatch with it (most of the time building goes into where I should put more hoverblades). Finally, this game crashes. A lot. Though most of the time, it seems to happen when I finally find a team of decent allies in an arena battle and things are going well. What a coincedence.....2016-12-16 Edit: It's been a while and there have been many big changes to Robocraft so I feel that my review could use an update too. First off; my thoughts on the ""Fast and Formidable"" update. As a player with moderate experience and a fair few decent parts, I enjoyed having the ability to build a 2000 pflop (maximum value) robot. Although quite a few Robocraft veterans would disagree, I think this update was a small step in the right direction. I could build as I please, but still feel confident with a slightly smaller bot. But this brawl update. This brawl update is no fun. Freejam has decided to (instead of listening to the community) remove multiple game modes, and throw them into a cycle with a few new modes and call it the ""Brawl"" mode. This would have been fine if they did it like Overwatch and just added a brawl as a new game mode, but no. Though at this point, I'd be a fool to be surprised when Freejam disappoints the community.			"

								If we were back in time around 2014-2015, I would recommend this game. Now, it deserves to be un-recommended. As you might have noticed from other reviews, in the few months after Robocraft was released they had overwhelmingly positive reviews and had lots of potential to be a very popular and unique game. I only started playing around mid-2014 and personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the game back then because of its convenience, fun, and the developer's effort into making a great game. I got the majority of my 116 hours of playtime in the first year since I got it. Now, the game has just gone downhill. Freejam's big updates to add powerful weapons like missile launchers, the removal of stronger armoured blocks, the auto-heal feature, the ability to add different types of weapons on your bot, and most recently the Random Loot Crate prize system, just completely destroyed the idea of teamwork. Before, you couldn't win a Battle Arena game without the whole team working together with their own specialisations (healers, snipers, frontliners, etc) in order to work together in battle. Now, there can be one or two enormous Mega bots with countless tech, and the rest of the team can consist of noobs who just stay back and do nothing, and that team will still win the game. Their recent update with the Random Loot Crate prizes in which you win some free weapons/blocks, replaced what they had before, which were simple currency rewards and allowed players to spend their well-earned currency on what they specifically want for their bot. Also, what they call the ""best"" player on the team (probably meaning whoever has the best K:D ratio, or highest amount of damage) receives a better crate with better prizes whereas the other teammates get the same bad crate. This increases the need for selfishness and instead of players working together to acheive the same reward, now it's just full of people fighting to be the best player on the team and not caring about their other teammates.  From the dev's perspective, if anybody wants a better experience than this (meaning better prizes from the loot crates), they're so highly encouraged to the point that they're almost forced to buy a Premium account for the game. In conclusion: Robocraft was awesome. Because Freejam seemed like they had a passion for making a great game for people to enjoy playing, without feeling left out because they're not the best player or they're not Premium. Now, Robocraft is horrible.  Because they took the fun and the teamwork out of the game and slowly made it into the opposite of what it was before, which is now just a scheme to squeeze money out of players for the developer's own wallet. This game had enormous potential, and they wasted it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: After months on end of ignoring the game, I forced myself to boot it up one more time just so I can see what's new and how the community has changed. Now I would like to declare that Robocraft has officially died. It's just not what it was before. Everything is different, in a bad way. This is, and forever will be, a perfect example of a once great game being ruined by the developer's thick-skinned greediness for money.  RIP Robocraft!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

								Terrible update for new players. You won't get anything done: single tires? I guess playing 100 matches to get a match of 4 tires is an awesome way to keep players playing. That's japanese MMORPG masochistic level of grinding. I bet it's more fun to hold a pebble in the rain and waiting for it to turn into a grain of sand. Matchmaking is also broken for smaller bots, you'll have to fight bots with weapons that have more health than your whole bot. Before the update: 8/10, afterwards 1/10.If you already have good bot, it's still fun to abuse the system and  pwn smaller players in the ground. Exept it isn't			"

								The latest updates of the game has turned this from okay to terrible. Before, you had different tiers in which you were out into matches with, and very rarely there would be someone from a lower tier. Now, everyone uses the same base cubes. The addition of using multiple weapons on the same bot makes this less of a tactical game, but more of a lets see how many different guns I can fit on a bot. All Freejam seem to care about is how much money they are getting from the game. The only update that I found useful were some balancing changes, when they removed the cost to repair after a game, and the CRF. It's ironic that Freejam 'Jam' with the community as they never seem to listen to the community.			"

								Honestly This game Is a great concept and visually it works. There is alot to be said that is good about such a game, the voxel based construction and all its great its wonderful, but that is where it stops.The developers have repeatedly and continuously turn the game on its head since I started playing (before it was on steam) yes some changes arguably are and were merited but in general they have made many poor decisions and continue to keep making poor decisions. The game has been out well over a year and they claim they are still ""One step Closer to Beta"" as they launch their latest patch of poor decisions. These recent patches like most of the others have affected balance, destroyed the matchmaking system, and uterly decimated the economy. Expect to play 200-400 matches to build a fully functional robot with matching parts. Free-Jam does not admit to their mistakes, fix problems ,or even really listen to the community that despite disagreeing still want to see the game to succeed and come to fruitionIf you have been playing this game for awhile yeah you can still occasionally have fun as you already have the parts and the game-play and building still retains most of its appeal. But if you are new to the game I suggest looking elsewhere, you  are in for lots of seal clubbing by more experienced/better armed players, and rewards from battle that will keep you the unfortunate prey for many many many games to come.Maybe some day the Devs will mature and the game will stabilize, but until then I cannot recommend this game.

If you try to talk, they ban you.""you have been suspendeed from playing robocraft""But... why i had been suspendeed you will ask ?It's simple : My game crashed.So, a moderator with wich i already had argues in private life made a false denonciation.So, in robocraft, a corrupted moderator can report you for a game leave, and you get ban. YOU GET BAN CAUSE YOUR GAME ENDED !!!!WTF ?And, strangly, at the EXACT SAME TIME i just get the lead of my clan, wich is rival of the mod's clan.In same times, i reported many times clans like Atlas Core and HEX wich abuse bugs and farms...What happenned ?

								It used to be good a year or so ago, but the devs have since made some pretty poor design and ""balance"" additions. This game is worth picking up for an hour or so, but then you realize how terrible of an item system that they have designed is. Don't waste your time. If you wanted to play it, you should have picked it up a year ago. Those were the good days.			"

								This used to be one of my favorite games and it honestly takes a lot for me to consider a game a favorite..... The developers however constantly gave in to complaints from players that were simply bad at the game.Somehow they made weapons that used to feel satisfying to use feel boring as if they have no impact.They changed the currency earning system to a really really obnoxious get random boxes of parts and salvage them system.They finally added a few new maps but they're nothing special... they just feel bland and don't actually add new interesting environmental elements to the game. Big wide open areas with scattered cover and maybe one tunnel. Nothing new and interesting like perhaps a urban city or somewhere cluttered.They added a megabot mode where people could finally build the gigantic crazy bots they always wanted to... then they for some insane reason took it away. They never even made a worthwhile megabot mode... instead they just had one on each team which put a lot of pressure on the megabot user because if they died then their entire team was screwed.They'd get movement items to good point where they felt right then a month later entirely screw them up and make them horrible. Making bots you probably got attached to worthless...Many parts there are no good reason to use because they're simply not worth it compared to others. Wheels that don't move you that much faster and get blown off... sleds that cost too much cpu and have crap armor...CPU cost on many things make no damn sense and it's not worth it to spent 250+ on some dash when that could be several more guns and much more armor.They changed how many of the weapons fire with an energy system which is honestly very obnoxious.Somehow they made a basic weapon like SMGs feel like absolute crap.I highly doubt this game is going to rebound back from the horrible choices the devs have made.I feel bad for the people I know who developed websites dedicated to the game when it seemed like it was going to be fantastic.I wish I could give suggestions and have them actually get listened to but I have tried in the past and they never did. Horayyyy... a new update... now we have useless icons....HOW ABOUT A ******* chat bar scroll? Is that so hard to add you insane devs? I've watched your mods rage at people who don't even see it because the chat scrolled to fast.... don't even get me started on half the community member mods they chose which annoy the hell out of their players even more...Oh yeah... and this is still not remotely an MMO. I actually had an admin publically make fun of me for mentioning in chat that I thought it would benefit the game for them put the proper tags of what the game actually is.  Ya know cause it has a freaking MOBA mode, TDM, elimination... not a open world or anything more than 10v10 mode... none of it is a MMO. But they couldn't get off their high horse and do something that would benefit the game. Total idiocy.			"

								As of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. Ill be talking about some major points.1: Weapons2: Types of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bots3: Rewards after each match4: The matching system5: Removed tech tree6: Pilot Seat Removed1: WeaponsThere are 3 major weapons I want to talk about. A: The worst one of them all, the Rocket Launcher B: Anti-air C: Shotguns.A: Rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. To use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. One rocket does 40700 damage, and you fire roughly 12 per volley. It can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. Basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.B: Anti-Air guns, Flak cannons. THey are absolute cancer when it comes to ANYTHING that flies or hovers. They detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for Mechs who jump or Crawlers who jump too. They cost the LEAST and have the same explosive radius as the strongest Plasma Cannons, which is horse crap. They do 31710 damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. Some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.C: Shotguns. THese things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about 50 yards. They can only be shot 4 times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. THey do the most damage with a shocking 225000 per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. They are strong too, with 110618 health, they can take quite a beating.2: Bots. There are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. A: Mechs B: Box Fliers C: Helis with rockets A: Mechs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. THey have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. The most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. These bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. You can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. You can have LITTERALLY everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ♥♥♥♥ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. If you put Pilots Seats back, it would make Mechs a lot harder to build and use.B: Box fliers. These things are the absolute worst. They dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. They do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.C: Helis with Rockets. These things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by Plasma Cannons or sometimes SMGs, these things are horrible to deal with.3: Rewards. Ok so, the rewards are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its chance. You could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. But if you get it, yaaay. You dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. I prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.4: Matching system. They have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with 1000 Pflops, you get put in a game with people that have 1000 Pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.5: Tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. A new player could buy the second strongest Plasma Cannon with ease, same with the SMG. Then refere to the Matching System above6: Pilot Seat Removed: Naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot AND give it the best fire power possible AND it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one shot.Some people are complaining about the fact that you can have 5 different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. If a Plasma Cannon user came up against an SMG user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the SMGs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. I think maybe reduce it to 3 and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thoseSummary: Anything that flies is NEXT TO ♥♥♥♥ING USELESS! Rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, Flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size, shotguns, meh, their fine, Box fliers need to be stopped somehow as they are over powered. Mechs need a nerf too. If you use a cancer/god gun you should be put into matchs with other people who have the same god guns. The Matching system needs to be fixed and the reward system needs to be fixed aswell.			"

								This game is such a disappointment. Not because it is horrible (which it isn't...yet), but becuase of the potential they've squandered. Sure, these guys may have a really good foundation combining solid mechanics, but they way they've implemented it is abyssmal. As a game designer myself, I can say with confidence that Freejam are either fools or greedy fools to implement the changes they've made and be so blind as to call them ""improvements"". To name a few; the different economies they've tried are all idiotic for one reason or another. Any time they add new weapons or equipment, they do it based off of whether it would be cool instead of whether it would improve the game and the game balance.I don't want to complain about these guys. They've claerly put a lot of work into this. They just didn't put enough thought into it.(And for the love of God don't use the ""it's still in early access"" excuse. The game is available to the public and they are trying to make money from it; as far as anyone is concerned, it's released.)			"

								Used to play this game a lot because it was fun. It was fun grinding games to get myself a set of the best armor and watch as all of my bots slowly turn black, the color of the highest tier armor back then. They removed the tiers and all my grinding went to waste; I am okay with that because the armor was cheap and I could buy literally millions of them after every match because I was using a megabot; they then removed megabots, I was sad but the game was still fun to play. There were things to build and things to look forward to. My efforts in game was reflected in my rewards after every match. Now the rewards are no longer really based on skill, its all RNG now, you could do the best in the entire match and get worse rewards than the player on the bottom of the scoreboard. You don't get money anymore so you have to rely on RNG to get the item you want instead of just saving up. TL;DR:Rewards in game are based on RNG instead of an earn-money-buy-item, The rates are worse than a japanese waifu phone game. Your efforts in game no longer match your reward.			"

								Alright, I will start off by admitting.I am addicted to this game.And it very much is a good game! The battles are fast and intense and the ability to make your vehicle however you please in order to play the game however you want is a lovely concept. But that's about it for the cream this game provides. Now bear with me while I write down a huge list of the bugs and all aorund terrible features.-Firstly, wether the game works or not is borderline random, sometimes it will work just fine, other times it flat out doesn't want to start.-The steam login is broken, sometimes the option is there, other times it is not.-The game is grindy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will require you to pay up in order to get anywhere beyond the first few tiers.-The gameplay, although fun, feels unrewarding and stale, for two reasons. Firstly, everyone does their own thing, and due to the size of the teams, no matter how well you do it never feels like a great achievment on your part makes a difference in the outcome, and even if it says you got 20 000 of the ingame currency (I am not calling it ""Robits"", ♥♥♥♥ off) you really only get around 10 000. Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I have a clue.-Sometimes players will get stuck under the map, and you cannot shoot at them, but they can shoot at you.-There is hardly any way to combat the new lockon weapons, especially if you are a flyer.-Freejam, alot of the time, buff things needing a nerf, and nerf things needing a buff.-They would also much rather add random cosmetics to your vehicles, instead of adding things people care about, like new and interesting maps or new blocks that do anything.-There are really only two maps with different layouts. ""Generic desert"" (mars) and ""generic snowy mountain"" (♥♥♥♥ telling you the name).-Good and creative builds are not rewarded, and instead the game opts to promote people making the same platform of guns.-The servers are slow and unresponsive.And for some of my minor nitpicks.-Sometimes, if a railgun kills you, the last shot will not display, causing you to randomly explode.-The layout is confusing.-The builder feels clumsy and awkward, it's difficult to explain why without you having tried actually good builders in games and then comparing it to this.And here are some recommendations for what I think could be done in order to fix the game! Yay!-Fix the multitude of bugs.-Add a couple of maps, how about a jungle planet? Or an ocean? Maybe even a gas giant? And even if you don't want to add new regions, atleast make the old ones interesting, such as protonium extraction sites, or cities?-Add flares. So some may have seen military aircraft shoot out little glowing, smoking fireballs, these are flares, and they confuse heat seeking missiles into targetting them instead of the aircraft. This could help balance out the unfair lockon weapons.-Buff the mediguns. As it stands right now, the mediguns are next to useless in games.-Clean up the GUI and fine tune the builder.-Reward people making creative builds, maybe monthly or weekly building contests?-Stop adding cosmetics... Stop it... There are enough of them right now.-Give us the money you promise after a game.But those are just my thoughts, you are completely free to form your own opinions.			"

If you're a flyer, you're stuck in low tier games, because Aeroflak takes you apart in seconds.Even in low tier games, you're fked over by people with high-tier guns on tiny little bots. Four basic hovers and a massive plasma gun? Seems legitimate.			"

The Matching system needs to be fixed and the reward system needs to be fixed aswell.			"

								This game is such a disappointment. Not because it is horrible (which it isn't...yet), but becuase of the potential they've squandered. Sure, these guys may have a really good foundation combining solid mechanics, but they way they've implemented it is abyssmal. As a game designer myself, I can say with confidence that Freejam are either fools or greedy fools to implement the changes they've made and be so blind as to call them ""improvements"". To name a few; the different economies they've tried are all idiotic for one reason or another. Any time they add new weapons or equipment, they do it based off of whether it would be cool instead of whether it would improve the game and the game balance.I don't want to complain about these guys. They've claerly put a lot of work into this. They just didn't put enough thought into it.(And for the love of God don't use the ""it's still in early access"" excuse. The game is available to the public and they are trying to make money from it; as far as anyone is concerned, it's released.)			"

Early Access Review
								This is probably one of the most infuriating games I've played. It's clearly got potential to be amazing, but recent decisions by FreeJam have basically been extended efforts to seemingly shoot themselves in the foot. It's clear that a lot of the decisions made by the developers are attempts to jump on 'bandwagons' to try to appeal to lower common denominators - when instead the formula that the game's previously succeeded upon is surprisingly deep tactics surrounding bot construction and the aiming priority that results from that.Starting with the easy to think of:Bad StuffTime-To-Kill too high & Blatant weapon imbalance. At the time of writing this review, the most favored weapons in the game are the Railgun (sniper rifle) and Ion Distorter (shotgun). Even after both weapons got 10% of their damage reduced, they still are the only weapons consistently capable of ripping bots apart in a few shots. Meanwhile, the traditional and most easy to use weapons, such as the SMG and Plasma, suffer from basically only doing enough damage to scrape weapons off of enemy bots, or, in the case of the Plasma, doing wildly inconsistent amounts of damage from shot to shot. The Lock-On Missile Launcher is probably the least problematic of the new weapons, but the introduction of the other two new weapons, the Aeroflak Cannon and the Protoseeker, both have proved to seriously impact the experience of the game, with the Aeroflak being supremely imbalanced depending on whether there's aircraft or not, and the Protoseeker literally being made because Freejam wanted their game to appeal more to the 8-13 year old demographic. I'm not making that up.Bad Matchmaking/Game modes. In the past, back when each bot only could use one weapon type, Matchmaking was fairly balanced - both teams would get about the equal number of SMG users or Snipers and so forth. Nowadays however most of that logic has been thrown out the window, so you usually get weird matchups where your team has nothing but shotgunners while 50% of the enemies are using airplanes, or you're the only medic and the entire enemy team's shotgun mechs that just kill everything before you can heal your allies. There just isn't a feeling of balance that results from the matchmaker at all, and specific 'sealclubbing' builds seek to take advantage of this by essentially ganking bots before they can fight back. This is a huge problem in the Battle Arena mode, which will usually require you to stay the entire game or else suffer a queueing-time penalty and no reward (and it only gets worse because usually the rest of your team has ragequit/is AFK/is stupid). ""The Pit"", a bot free-for-all, is also counterintuitive to the game's design due to how certain bot builds hard-counter other builds. In general, it makes the game experience less fun and more irksome above all.Building Technique can be Esoteric and/or Time Consuming. New players will have no clue what stuff like 'triforcing' or 'resistivity' are, and these aspects are basically essential to making the tankiest and most survivable of bot builds. Not only this, but once you are aware of these sorts of mechanics, you then have to contend with the awkwardness of trying to place blocks correctly to execute the technique. Needless to say, a lot of it is the result of unintended mechanics of how damage is calculated through bots, and Freejam once again has not done much to really capitalize on the situation, or even integrate it into how the game should be played.Very Little Incentive to Spend Money. Now this might be an odd thing to list as a Con for the game, but it really does make sense once you think about the economy FJ's trying to go for here. In the past, buying Premium Time would generate twice the amount of Robo Points (RP - old currency to buy stuff with) than you'd normally get, while also granting all other players a bit of extra RP, and allowing you to paint your bot pretty colors. Nowadays, though, all Premium gets you is twice the number of items in the (highly-controversial) loot boxes you get from completing games, while offering no other benefit. And because of the already dubious results of your loot boxes, there just really isn't much of an incentive to get twice as much trash as you already get. This all in mind, I got no way of knowing certain, but the result of this change to loot boxes has basically stymied FJ's own ability to generate revenue. Which means less ability to make cool changes in the future.Recent items are a pain to build with. New items such as the special modules and huge weapons like the IND or Aeroflak are not only gigantic and difficult to build around, but they cost a lot of CPU, meaning your bots equipped with these items are going to be smaller and generally less unique in shape. It's equal parts disappointing to see such similar builds utilize the shiny new items, and annoying to be lucky enough to afford/unbox a Legendary item, only to have it near-impossible to place on one of your existing builds without taking off huge chunks of your chassis.Bugs. The game crashes for the weirdest reasons and regenerating wheels/treads don't move for a few seconds for some dumb reason, and that problem hasn't been fixed for like 6 months now. There's a bunch of other stupid bugs that I can't fit in here because then this review would be even more verbose and unreadable than it is right now.Good StuffVery unique aiming/fighting techniques. The best part of this game's mechanics is mastering the art of firing at your foes. In place of 'headshots', you'll usually be aiming for things such as the enemy's guns to deny them of firepower, or a last ligament of chassis holding two halves of the bot together. Noticing and acting upon your enemy bot's status and shape is what it's all about, and being able to defeat your enemies using this is the most gratifying and signature part of Robocraft's gameplay. Obviously explains why my favorite weapons are the SMG and Railgun after all.Building's fun and flexible. The one good thing about premium is that it allows you to paint your creations fun colors. That, alongside the general flexibility of the block types you can construct with, and you can make pretty cool/cute bots as art. Nine times out of ten, the shape you build doesn't even matter that much so long as your chassis is fairly solid.Freejam does listen sometimes. If there's anything I can give the developers credit for, it's that they do make an attempt to gather user feedback. The problem's merely how they act on that. For example, the intensely situational Aeroflak cannon, as well as the doofy Protoseeker, both were results of exploitative/ugly Tesseract builds that used lightweight corner pieces to make fast aerial builds that were difficult to break apart with rails. Only problem was that the former quickly made all normal-looking airplanes disappear from the game, and the latter created a scourge of extremely tiny 'protosquito' builds that just flew around with about 4 blocks and would pelt people with shots, meanwhile being impossible to hit with anything but another PSK. Probably the most famous example of when FJ took feedback was when they planned to simplify damage routing by making it impossible destroy components and establishing a procedural 'skeleton' in all bots. This essentially would've undermined the entire unique strategy of this game. When the entirety of the game community backlashed, they thankfully repealed the decision. So FreeJam is dumb, but they aren't completely ignorant.So in essence this game is a diamond-in-the-rough, except even Freejam themselves don't seem to realize this, and/or really know how to expand on the game to reach a fun game experience. And that's the real tragedy here.			"

								The main emphasis on this game is that you get to create and build robots with different methods of locomotion and weapons types. It's a game aimed towards the creative mind. You're given different types of cubes and connection rods to act as armor, and when they're gone, you're either done with the match or respawn at extending intervals, depending on which game type you picked.However, lately Freejam decided to make a random reward system. This system really handicaps the idea of creating things and rather than allowing freedom for the player to make what they want, the developers seem more focused on monetary gains with membership ""premium"" status and an optional crate buying system, reminiscent of  mobile games. Although not ""Pay - to - Win"" technically, it's a literal gamble on what parts you'll get. And this is what stiffles the game. It's a game that wants people to build something, but detrimentally handicaps them by giving them a crapshoot of mostly unuseable pieces. (You might get an idea to build a cool bot, but are given a ski and a China flag. And you might have even paid for it)Also, there doesn't seem to be any foreseeable endgame planned and content releases are slow/ slight variations of previous ideas. (One new map added as of this writing)Matchmaking has been addressed, but it's still lopsided at times. I'd love to see this game progress and become something great, it has potential, but the latest updates aren't mind-blowing and it seems it's headed towards the forever Early Access graveyard.

								i dont like the new currency system. before the update i had a decent amount of money but then the update happens and its like im super poor now. i preferred the old system of buying blocks with money you earned. i dont like that they got rid of the tech tree because now any rich enough player just has access to anything they want. overall i think they changed the games currency and leveling system too much and it takes all the sense of progression  out of the game and for a game like this that is pretty important.

								I probably got Robocraft around early-2015. It was really fun. You build a car, tank, whatever, go out in battle, shoot some people, get shot by people, die horribly, and redesign. That's how it works. I loved it. You get tech points and RP from battles, and unlock stuff with your tech points on the tech tree - There's decisions to be made. Unlock the next tier of wheels or the radar jammer? New armor or new wings? Tank or plane? There's paths.Well, that's how it was. Now you just unlock random crap every time you level up from a battle.I haven't even played this awful game in a while, and I'm probably glad I haven't.From reading other reviews it looks like this game has continued going downhill. Fast.They had an amazing idea down for a game. It was popular. I voted for it as best indie game 2015. And then after that every update I'm like ""Why? Why did you go and do that? It was fine before!""You know, back in 2015, what was really fun was having one design I always used. My SMG tank with like 3 different armor levels. As I got RP I would buy more cubes to replace lower tier armor. And that tank was awesome, in my mind. It was probably pretty crap, but I didn't care. As long as I got a couple kills I was happy. But nope, they changed everything, and reset everyone's progress for like the third time.. I couldn't even get back into it at that point.Honestly, I just don't know what to say any more. This fun and amazing game that I would spend 5 hours straight playing every day has turned into something I don't ever want to even look at. I hate it.Hell, I even made a positive review for this game months back - because it was a good game. I then of course deleted that review after realizing how bad it's gotten.Sorry for this wall-of-text of a review, but I'm just sharing my thoughts.Freejam, get your s*** together. Please. You have an amazing game but you're ruining it. "

								This game has been in early access for over 2 years now, and somehow, all they have managed to do is make it worse.1)Matchmaking died. I see people using tier 4-6 weapons, chainguns, missiles, in games with people using tier 1-3 weapons.2) Instead of being able to build what I want, like the old days, when you got in-game money(robits) for completing matches, I'm restricted to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ blocks I get from crates, or I could crap them for maybe 400ish robits.3) Forget any thought of balance, lock on missiles! chain guns! people like those, they'll pay us lots of money to get 150000 robits to pay for them!Robocraft turned from a cool battle-bot building game to an almost pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.4/10I was reading through the early access memo, and came to this:How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“Freejam (the developer of Robocraft) has community in its blood. The word Freejam is a combination of 'free' and 'jam', where 'free' shows our dedication to keeping Robocraft always free, and 'jam' stands for jamming with our community to determine how our game continues to evolve. We like to think of Robocraft as a game that has been built from the ground up in collaboration with the community.”I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, if they really cared they'd see the uproar from the community about the not so recent changes and switch back.

Build your own tanks however you can imagine, then put them into the battlefield with other tanks to fight to the death! Physics are amazing in this game, as your tank actually falls apart as you loose health! The graphics are simply gorgeous, and the mechanics work very nicely.

								Robocraft used to be a very good game.Used to be.Now it is a slow running pile of garbage, with extremely unbalanced guns, repeatedly changing game modes, a major Pay2Win aspect, and it crashes constantly.During playing, I've repeatedly experienced crashing whilst building (removing all of my progress) and a failed connection which was not my fault, yet still gives me a ban.CPU Costs are majorly underrated, the rocket launcher and ion based weapons are extremely powerful, whilst you're lucky to get 4000 damage in a match with the second best laser cannons, and Plasma got even worse.Bugs are constant, Modules are overpowered, and the game only gets fun, and you only get a good ship, if you invest money, thousands of hours, OR are lucky enough to have gotten the alienware promotion (like me).I started this game with the pilot and tech tree, and it's going to end here, with protonium crates giving 1000 robits, 1 per match if topscoring, so you have to win 150 matches to get a module.It is incredibly hard to advance whatsoever in normal mode, starting players get a huge boost of which is unbalanced to old players, and this game is quite frankly trash.

								I played this game a lot before the steam client was released and i think i even got more than 1000hours ingameIt was super awsome building tinkering but then they removed pilot seat and cut the game down to slap some♥♥♥♥♥♥together and it works.then they implemented a feature which allowed you to mix any weapons which compleately broke balance and the balance is almost impossible to restore so currently you are forced to use total stupid oversized auto aim canons instead of something skillfull cause the weapons which required skill are nerfed to death.After ♥♥♥♥ing up balance compleately they had a competition how to ♥♥♥♥ up the game the most and the winner was:Lets remove skill based rewards and give players Random items after each battle which they can sell to buy what they actually want.That's just so horrible i couldn't even think about it.also the loot is semi random so if you are better you might get a higher crate but semi means that even the highest crates (for being n1 on scoreboard with a 100% stupid bot (archiefment get again)) can contain items which just suck pretty hard.In short word the whole economy was compleately ♥♥♥♥ed up and randomized.

Even with premium ( you get double number of parts per crate) it is nearly impossible to aim for what you want to build in this game. The loot is completely random so if you want 2 rotors to make a helicopter, you will depend on getting 2 of the same rotors from completely random crates.			"

								Well, I'm sorry to say that the developers have managed to wreck what was one of my favorite games. 1. The new battle mode is lame. I am not interested in blasting cubes off of towers. I want to engage enemy bots. Yes, I know that is still ""part"" of the game, but is should be the only part. I think it would work much better to simply have zone control based on sole occupation of areas (similar to world of tanks). Also having too many modes has caused crazy long que times. What used to take 5 - 20 seconds to join a match, now can take 15 minutes.2. The developers have decided that components that are higher tier should not be placed on lower tier bots. This has essentially ruined all my bot designs and makes the game (bot design and game play) very cookie cutter. It doesn't balance game play as much as it creates identical builds due to fewer options.I will NOT be back to ROBOCRAFT. Way to turn victory into FAIL. "

								Firstly, I will say that this game was a very, very fun game for me. I poured many hours into designing and building bots. It used to be fun, but with the current changes, it is not anymore. FreeJam just flips how everything works every 4 months or so, making it impossible to get 'used' to anything. In-game progression has been all but halted. Making it anywhere in the game is basically pay to win as you have to go through a crate opening system to get anything, and even then you only get HALF of what is in a crate unless you pay for premium. Overall, the game used to be great, just not anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								Robocraft used to be an awesome game.  It was casual and fun, but at the same time you could be tactical and competitive.  The game was just brimming with potential!  I was eagerly looking forward to seeing how the game developed.Sadly, the game didn't go in a good way...*** WARNING - If you're a new player:  DO NOT TRY THIS GAME OUT CURRENTLY.  The game currently mostly revolves around veteran players abusing the games matchmaking mechanics to slaughter new, and underequipped, players.  Not because they are all bad people, but largely because the games new chance crate system makes that the most successful and rewarding way to progress quickly now.  As a new player you'll struggle to get new parts, of which you'll need ~4 to 12 of per part, and you only have a chance to earn things randomly unless you take a massive reduced exchange rate by scrapping parts.  New players essentially have no chance to progress at this point. *** Essentially every update to the game involved changing large amounts of core features of the game.  Adding and removing entire game modes, bot categories, gear types, playstyles, etc.  They constantly are making broad sweeping changes that drastically alter the game. It gives the impression that Freejam doesn't actually have any overall plan for the games direction.  They'll be all about something one moment, they'll hype it up, paint a clear picture of how they see it becoming a big thing in the game, and then by the next two updates its completely phased out or largely unrecognizable.They haven't added new maps for ages despite that being one of the most requested things.  Worse, the maps that do exist largely cater to specific bot designs and playstyles which leads to balancing issues since people will naturally flock to those bot designs.  They need more variety of maps and especially need some more closed in and close quarters maps to contrast with their current maps which are largely open craters with extremely long distance sight lines. A cramped entirely underground cave map would have been a treat to see, but I doubt that will ever happen.Balance is another key issue with the game.  Often some parts or weapons will drastically be outclassed by another or heavily limited to their usage together or some things will be easily exploitable.  Freejam lets these things go for long periods of time and then as the problem grows out of hand they tend to hamfist a solution by adding in overpowered new things you can buy to counter the problem bots instead of fixing the actual imbalance.A good example would be plasma bombing planes.  Plasma was one of the only actual useful weapons for planes so naturally people gravitated to it and there ended up being swarms of them.  Instead of adding maps with more air cover or making other weapons that are viable for air instead of primarily just plasma... they solved it by having a whole series of updates aimed solely at adding in weapons that could completely annihilate fliers.  Worst of all is that winged flyers, which were already weak compared to drones and helicopters, are now left at an even more drastic disadvantage. Balancing a game by releasing new items just to crush an entire playstyle instead of fixing the core issues is just a horrible solution.... good money for Freejam though with all the people buying the new toys.To further add to the balance issues Freejam added in a shop where players can put their bot designs up for sale.  In theory this sounds like a good idea, but in practice it just means that as soon as an exploitative or ""current updates best"" bot design is found the store is flooded with them.  The game then quickly gets filled up with players using copies of them and every match becomes the same boring slog with no signs of creativity.  Even when there isn't a current game ruining exploit build thats popular there are still several designs which people consider ""the best"" you'll still end up playing essentially nothing but matches filled with copies.  If you're lucky... the people will have at least painted their store bought clone differently so it will almost give you the illusion of seeing new and interesting designs.Bugs are another big complaint.  Bugs don't really seem to get fixed.  They are just ignored until that entire portion of the game gets replaced with their next massive core feature altering update.  It doesn't matter if the bugs are small and simple ones, such as the ""your platoon is waiting for you to join the queue"" beeping sound going off constantly when you're in a platoon, or large and game wrecking ones, such as players being able to get underneath the map and kill everyone or place parts in ways that shouldn't be possible, they rarely ever get addressed.The final straw though... the ""Epic Loot"" update.  In the past you could make what you wanted because you earned points to buy things with every round.  Now its almost entirely gambling.  They went the chance crate route that most free-to-play games go for.  Its great for Freejam since they can rake in the cash, but the player gets shafted.  Sure... sometimes you might get a very nice part, but the majority of the time you're wasting hours of your life for regular basic blocks and one-off low to mid tier parts that you can't even use since you need ~4 to 12 of any part to actually use it.The game isn't even pay-to-win.  Paying will only give you a chance to get things as you can't buy parts and things outright... just chance crates.  You'd be more productive throwing your money out the window of your car as you drive around town.  There have been people who bought hundreds of chance crates, at ~$100, and in return they got heaps of randomly chosen junk and not even enough junk to make a fully functional junk bot.The game is especially crippling to new players now as they have no actual way to progress in a way that will allow them to be competitive.  Since they are entirely at the mercy of random chance they can't really even persue the parts they want for their bot ideas or even the kinds of parts they'll need to be competitive.  The only people who are still ""okay"" in the current state of the game are veteran players who have massive stockpiles of parts built up.  Which further makes it impossible for new players since they'll primarily be pitted against highly optimized end-game competitive bots.  As the playerbase dwindles the already poor matchmaker will just make things even more skewed against new players.Its really sad to see it turn out this way, but I doubt Freejam will change their minds on the chance crates as they are too profitable by playing on peoples addictive qualities and hooking kids on gambling in a way that appears innocent.The game had so much potentially, but they turned it into a casino slot machine and the only ones hitting the jackpot are Freejam.

								I started playing this a few days ago. As a new player, I have observed that a lot of matches are one-sided stompfests. If you don't spend real life money to load up on epic or legendary items, then prepare to get your robot stomped into the ground over and over again every match. A waste of time unless you're willing to drop cash to roll for epic/legendary items before ever setting foot in a match.Edit: After putting more hours into the game, I find the gameplay to be flawed. Every map is filled with close quarters and objects to hide behind, so long range weaponry is useless on most maps. This compounds the problem with the game I mentioned earlier; not only do you need legendary or epic items to succeed, but you need specifically short-ranged ones. It is poor game design to have over half of the most expensive weapons in the game be rendered useless by the design of the maps.			"

								I love building robots and testing them out, always tring to find the right build to beat the opponents. This game is Crazy fun, but with many glitches and bad match making its gets frustrating. The first three rankings are bronze, silver and gold. When you make to silver you still play with bronze players that are really bad. I'm not sure how the match making even works if this is the case. I get disconnected about every tenth game, but the game doesnt have a good reconnect system so you just get booted and go down in ranking for leaving. There are many other glitches I've found but if just these two things where fixed it would make the game much better. If a GM or Tech guy reads this, please fix these problems.			"

								I used to recommend this game, not anymore.  It used to be a fun unique game where you built your own bot, and that building mattered, and then fight it out in FPS fashion.  In order to appeal to more ""casual"" players the developers have steered it toward multiple high damage auto-aim guns.  They've intentionally gone out of their way to make building your bot matter very little in how well it does.  You can spend 5 hours carefully constructing  a tank with various layers of ablative armor.  Or you can spend 5 minutes building a rectangle with some auto-aim guns and do just as well.For many months now, the developers have been ignoring quality feedback from various veterans that have demonstrated a deep understanding of what the game is/was.  Various major Quality of Life fixes that have been sorely needed for months, to literal years go untouched, while they spend time introducing more logic defying, game breaking elements.And now they've destroyed the in-game econmy.  The old system used to be simple, but effective.  You could earn RP in order to buy the parts you wanted from your battles.  The better you did, the more you were rewarded.  It was a good steady pace where it didn't take an excessive amount of play time to earn what you needed to build your next bot, or buy your next set of parts.  You could speed up this process by buying premium (doubling your RP earnings) or just buying parts with straight money.That's all gone now.  Prices are roughly equal, but income from playing matches has been slashed an incredible amount.  I can say with no exaggeration that earnings have been slashed by as much as 99.5%.  There is no income anymore.  They wasted who knows how much effort in creating a loot system where no direct cash (RP was turned into robits) is ever given.  ""You can recycle the parts you get in crates"" they said.  Except recycling rates are now atrocious.  Previously you could sell back items for 50% their full value.  That is now slashed down to 25% to 0.5%.  New players will initially be fooled into thinking this is a good system because rewards are almost completely flat - new or old player, you get roughly the same drops.  And the drops are all random chance.  All the parts for building the biggest bots are now super rare.  Based on screenshots of what other players opening 300 of the highest level crates has shown,  at best you get a 0.4% drop rate for the tier items.This is a building game.  If you want to build a big laser cannon tank, you need 10-14 of them.  Now you have 0.4% chance to get one per drop spot in a crate (ONLY if you score 1st in the match and your team wins.)  You get 1 slot for a deathmatch game, and 4 for a Battle Arena (doubled with premium.)  If your team loses, even if you outscored everyone else in the match, you only get the lowest level crate.  You're still looking at 50-100 wins to get a single top level item.  But wait, there are many top level items, further reducing the chances you'll even get what you wanted.  This doesn't cover the movement parts for a top level bot either, which are also all just as rare to drop.  These figures are not exaggerations or made up; they come directly from multiple, large result sets provided by players that picked up the 300 crate bundles.   Old veterans with stockpiled resources can build what they want, as RP was just converted directly to robits.  with nearly zero income compared to the previous game economy, this will only last so long.New players will get gratification early on with the plethora of low to mid level parts to build low to mid level bots.  in a few weeks, they'll start to realize that building a maximum sized bot fully decked out with the parts you want is a pipe dream.  Only the most hardcore players that will literally have to grind for hundreds of hours will be able to build a single high level bot.  The level of grinding required rivals the most difficult to acquire items from an MMO; except usually in an MMO you're going after a single extremely rare item.  Here you need dozens.The latest statement from the developers is that they are happy with the current economy, putting the final nail in the coffin of what once was pretty balanced and fair.I don't recommend this.

								Starting with the good stuff, the game gives you a lot of options, from what shape your vehicle to tactics and platooning, its got a large variety of building blocks that you of course use to build your robots, a decent amount of maps and a big tech tree. There is also not soo much stuff to buy so its not a pay-to-win game, GOOD STUFF! There are a couple things that bother me tho, the chat channel mechanic is very rough, the people you get to chat with when you are not in a battle are random, PLEASE FIX IT GUYS! id apreciate :D. There is also not much of a drag, friction and gravity mechanic tho so all the surfaces are glass-like...kinda annoying if you ask me cuz you slide down slopes like its nobodys bussiness. Unfortunately tho in this game there are two design type that are really OP (due to the fact that the game doesnt really have good phisics) and the comunity is divided, some say that it has turned into a really messy MOBA because of the new gamemode, others are not happy about block nerfing and more. And yes, personally, i did quit the game because it got repetitive! And the thing is that when you get in (or any tier) tier 10 just BARELY, your next like 20 battles are going to be bad, ur just gunna die and die and die...just because you dont have the equipment that the other guys have. I definantely think that instead of 10 tiers, there should be like 20 . Now you are happy when you are finishing a tier and when you get into the next one its like ,,omg wtf can i do to not constantly diie for f sakes?!?!,, (and thats the point where i quit the game in tier 10..) BUT i have still spent 100+ hours playing! And it was fun! Even with the weapon nerfs and these things! So do try it out, i still think it has potential!			"

								Hello 4RN0 Here,I'm in love with Robocraft (Look at my playtime)Now i'm TX1 in-game and have some few good bot :DBefore the so called META, we got a Capture-The-Flag type battle. There's alot of fun i get from these battle and the feels when you get when you are the Last-Man-Standing. The bot you use must be tough for each tier because there's no respawn or heals (For T1-T4). My very first bot is Apache i really LIKED IT ALOT. Using that bot i'm able to reach T4 (Without buying it). Now after the META, The old Capture-The-Flag battle has been changed to Classic Match. Like seriously ? Classic ? And the new META got named Battle Mode... But the Meta is pretty nice because it makes the battle a LITTLE (A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LITTLE) bit interesting. My money making bot named Jaigermeister,Vertex,and Sentinel (All T10) all have a good performance in battle, and on the new META the teams are very good there's almost no T9-All-Cubed or T10 MarkBot. And the good news you can earn upto 830K RP on the new META (my best).Now the disaster strikes. The new patches which added a Maps Ping, CPU Caps, and No-OT (OverTiering). Rember the feeling when you are almost reaching T10 using your SUPER-OP-T9-TANKS ? well now Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself because YOU CAN ENTER T10 USING ONE YES ONE T10 WEAPONS, Yes all of them. And all of you Veteran or so called TX1 Master Race had a bad time making a Fun-But-Tough bot for each Tier. Just look at Lathland, he have a good bot for each tier using 1000+ Cpu. Now ? oh well he need to either improve his bot to make it available or sell it and make a new one. I'm happy because Leveling up is easier (Up to 30% easier). But the sad thing is the don't think how easy it is to get to T10. You can just use the First-Bot and upgrade half of the Chasis ( Not half maybe 1/4) and upgrade the guns. You can reach T10 in just like 1 days. Meanwhile me ? it took me 400 Hours to reach T9 and another 100 Hours to reach TX1 and make a Good-Megabot.Anyway we still don't know when FJ Gonna remove the CPU-caps that HELPING EVERY ONE WHO IS NOT GOOD AT MAKING A BOT TO BECOME T10 AND BECOME ARROGANT AND SAYS ""Nah i reach T10 like yesterday"" PLEASE REMOVE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CPU-CAPS AND EASY TIERING UP.CHECK THE FORUM FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATCH			"

YouTube™ Video: Robocraft - Epic Loot Opinion and Demonstration 

			Views: 2,733		

			So, everyone knows I basically quit playing Robocraft. However, I wanted to see what these loot crates are about. With my GC being converted to Xsolla currency, I did not actually have to pay any...		

Someone actually loved me so much they based their entire review off me and completely forgot about the game. :P+They seem to be making quite alot of changes+New weapon changes make low tier smgs useful+Single player mode finally became decentCons:-whatever you make could become crap or be buffed to be the next best thing randomly-some weapons are totally locked off until long into the end game-no 1v1 modes for private duels between friends-skilless weapon called the loml was introduced, its a homing launcher that requires no skill to use in a game about aiming, strategy, and skill-being able to color my bot and make even the ugliest of body shapes look nice is great, sadly you cant do that unless your constantly renewing your premiumMore specific examples:[LC] Waffles & (& Winnie) Bacon: ""guess you can add a small pro that says ""is 1/10000 good if you're drunk or tired""""(he changed it so here the original http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=617747212)- http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118374435/recommended/301520?tscn=1454714227Even the fanboys and girls can't actually give any good reason why the game is good, and they should really be the ones telling you.-no form of center of mass/lift indicator -never knew about mirror mode, had to look it up (its m, also it isnt mentioned anywhere on the edit bot screen))-four ugly and arbritary colors were added. want any more color? you guessed it: pay up (i know this is going to be changed, so if this con is still there then so is the limit)-there is no exit button from the launcher and you cant alt tab away from it-we were outright told we would get roughly the same amount of rp per time spent on battle arena as tdm but no thats not true so far (from my experience, this con may be deleted if my experience changes)-Spawning directly in front of people in the pit-cant choose what levels to test my bot on (would be pretty nice)-premium doesnt unlock colors permanetly-your character animation when flying around is running (you cant see the character but you can see the bobbing)-debug menu popped up but it isnt listed anywhere WHAT toggles it (turns out its shift+backspace)-average time: 22 seconds, actual time spent waiting: 1:50-when capping a base everyone on there except one isnt making any difference in speed, if ANY OF YOU GET HIT YOU ALL LOSE PROGRESS towards your next bar (and people tend to pile up on base so lots of targets to hit)no reduction in the cons section by the homing missile launcher update-cant shoot down missiles-http://steamcommunity.com/app/301520/discussions/2/412446890558589323/-headlights aren't functional anymore-surrender system requires a unanimous vote meaning despite all but 1 of the team voting for surrender that last 1 person must be more important than everyone else-you cant see your bot while scopedmaximum loadout came and....solved nothing here-theres a bug where it doesnt show a part from one bot (in your hand and in your inventory) if you remove it and go to another bot without checking your inv (tell me if this confuses you, im having a hard time wording this one for some reason)-theres no option to cycle back and forth through weapon slots and the mouse keybindings settings for loadout slots dont work at allElite loot update out-crates have absolute crap drops so far even for diamond tier and makes grinding ridiculous and RNG based (removing your ability to choose what you want to get)-Cheap tactic of constantly dangling premium in front of us, obvious mobile game tactics-Nothing seriously wrong with this update besides the cratessome aspects of this review ARE already confirmed to be changed later, this review only discusses the current features not those that are coming and I will discuss features that are confirmed to be leaving "

								I can't recommend this game.  The ONLY positive aspect is how they designed the bot-building, but even that has some major flaws.Building:  Great at first.  Just snap some Primitive Shapes together like Legos.  Except..... why are the shapes so limited?  It's like they had a good idea, then stopped halfway through.  It doesn't make sense.Weapons:  Okay, just no.  The weapons really just fall into three catagories: melee crescents (ram the enemy and hope), normal weapons, and pay-to-win weapons.  Melee is pretty much just what I said - a crescent you attach to the front of your bot, ram people, and hope they don't shoot the cresents off before you get to them.  Or kill you while you wait for it to do damage.  Pretty much useless after the initial thrill.  Normal weapons come in sniper, SMG, and grenade-launcher varieties.  Only it doesn't matter, because NONE ofthem have any ♥♥♥♥ing accuracy.  What good is a sniper rifle if you're sitting still, zoom in, take a shot, and the ♥♥♥♥ing shot veers up towards the top-lefthand corner of your screen for no reason?  SMGs are more like shotguns, considering their spread.  Put nine on a single bot and you MIGHT be able to take someone else out.  At close range.  Maybe.  Grenade launchers - calculate arcs and hope the target is going to sit still for you.  About the only thing these are useful for is on flying bots, since shooing DOWN pretty much negates arcs.And then there's the pay-to-win weapons.  I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥what the game says about fair or even matches - once you get above level 30, prepare to never win again unless you want to throw money at the devs.  Pay weapons are overpowered and have homing capabilities.  After all, who wants to do things like aim, when you can pay five bucks and have homing missles or SMGs that never miss?  I understand the devs needed to make money somehow, but this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to do it.  I would have happily paid $20 for this game, just for the bot-building mechanics alone, if the devs had instead made a variety of types of weapons and ♥♥♥♥ING BALANCED THEM.  Instead you have the most blatant pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever.  ""Free user?  Not even your sniper is going to be accurate.  Pay user?  Here, you don't even have to aim, just fire randomly in the general direction of a player and automatically win.""Speaking of winning and losing, the matchmaking is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.  You wait for three, four minutes while it supposedly matches you to a lobby of people on your level, all while flashing some arbitrary ""average wait time"" number below thirty seconds - just so you feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about having to wait so long and start questioning your internet coneection, while other people are supposedly getting into games and lobbies faster than you.  Then it throws you into some ♥♥♥♥ed-up match where all your team seems to be using bots made of maybe twenty blocks total, while half of the other team has three-hundred-block builds, pay-to-win homing missles, and advanced weapons and shields you won't even have access  to for another twenty or thirty levels.So all in all?  Don't even bother unless you like paying to win.			"

What's the point of a game that touts the ideals of building creatively when you have to grind or literally gamble to build in the first place? The Epic Loot update has made this game lose any chance of myself spending any more money, let alone any more time on this crap. I feel there's nothing left to say. My hundreds of hours of playtime, along with many other with as much if not more leaving similar reviews tells the story enough.			"

Did all those things and you were good. Now I'm in the game. I don't remember were there a tutorial how to play but it was easy to play. I used lot of my time to play this game and it was super fun. I played lot of this game with my friends and they liked this too. At the time there were tiers one to ten ten were the best. You did get tier stars and with those you bought upgrades to your vehicle. And with level you got more cpu. There were three weapons laser rifle plasma launcher and sniper rifle. Now this game has gone from that to this peace of sh*t. If you ask me the developers have gave this game to some person who doesn't care about this game... To me and my friends this games is fuc*ed and we won't play this sh*t anymore			"

								It seems like everytime I go to play this game, there's some new update that makes me not want to play it anymore.Seriously. I've had this game for quite a while now, and every single update the game has ever recieved while I was playing it has been a bad one. If it were up to me, they would just go back to how it was when I first got it, when cubes had actual levels instead of unrelated animal names, and the game was actually fun for people who were free to play. And I'm not just being sentimental either - I think literally every update has had something in it that made it less fun and less fair for people who don't have an arm and a leg to spent on a game that is supposed to be free.

								What started as a great creative game with a few cash options has been twisted into an unadulturated cash grab on the level of mobile games. I started playing this game essentially as soon as it was released. Its had its teething problems no doubt. And balance issues  are understandable, I stuck with the game through those issues because hey, its hard to balance a createive game.But the most recent change where all of your income is basically a roll of the dice, no skill required, has done it for me. It's clearly set up so that you can buy ""boxes"" or cash to buy parts outright, but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level. Therefore. the advantage easily passes to people who are willing to buy their way to the best parts.TL;DR  Was once about building, is now about buying.			"

It is gambling addiction profiteering at its most blatant and it is disgusting.The servers can't even handle the few people who play this game anymore... the developers won't listen to what their customers want... the balancing of weapons is garbage, the whole thing is a real ♥♥♥♥♥how. Don't waste your money, but more importantly, dont waste your time!			"

								When I first saw this game it was not even on Mac so I waited...  And so went like one month and then the game were on Mac. I we're really excited when I started to download this one. It downloaded like in half an hour and I started to play. At first I was like What you need to sign up for this game. Okay the game were only beta at the time so signing up were hard. Did all those things and you were good. Now I'm in the game. I don't remember were there a tutorial how to play but it was easy to play. I used lot of my time to play this game and it was super fun. I played lot of this game with my friends and they liked this too. At the time there were tiers one to ten ten were the best. You did get tier stars and with those you bought upgrades to your vehicle. And with level you got more cpu. There were three weapons laser rifle plasma launcher and sniper rifle. Now this game has gone from that to this peace of sh*t. If you ask me the developers have gave this game to some person who doesn't care about this game... To me and my friends this games is fuc*ed and we won't play this sh*t anymore			"

								It seems like everytime I go to play this game, there's some new update that makes me not want to play it anymore.Seriously. I've had this game for quite a while now, and every single update the game has ever recieved while I was playing it has been a bad one. If it were up to me, they would just go back to how it was when I first got it, when cubes had actual levels instead of unrelated animal names, and the game was actually fun for people who were free to play. And I'm not just being sentimental either - I think literally every update has had something in it that made it less fun and less fair for people who don't have an arm and a leg to spent on a game that is supposed to be free.

								What started as a great creative game with a few cash options has been twisted into an unadulturated cash grab on the level of mobile games. I started playing this game essentially as soon as it was released. Its had its teething problems no doubt. And balance issues  are understandable, I stuck with the game through those issues because hey, its hard to balance a createive game.But the most recent change where all of your income is basically a roll of the dice, no skill required, has done it for me. It's clearly set up so that you can buy ""boxes"" or cash to buy parts outright, but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level. Therefore. the advantage easily passes to people who are willing to buy their way to the best parts.TL;DR  Was once about building, is now about buying.			"

								This game has gone from fun to terrible in such a short space of time. Initially the game was about building a robot which required you to have some skill and design ideas around it. You also had to actually aim your guns. There was a purchase system where you could purchase extra credits and premium to further on your designs or get that weapon you wanted.The most recent update to this game has brought fourth weapons you don't need to aim, robots you need no skill to fly and random chance on the blocks you to actually build your robot. But hey you can purchase crates from the pay store to hopefully complete the robot you have planned. I would suggest anyone very strongly to think again before spending any real life cash on this game as it will most likely be wasted by the developers on awful updates.If you want to check out the kind of feedback they have, go to their game forums.

								The gameplay isn't very good to begin with, the matchmaking is completely unbalanced, crafting your robot is even ruined with the terrible RNG crate system, which was either put in place in an attempt to make the game worse or an attempt to squeeze more money out of its player base with what is essentially gambling. On top of that is the premium membership, which ties in with the crate system and the crafting system to squeeze out even more money from its player base. Premium membership isn't a one time buy, it requires a subscription like an MMO. The subscription options range from a few days to six months. After every match you get a crate with some items. Better types of crates have a higher chance for rarer items, you get better crates from being higher on the scoreboard and on the winning team in a match. You get more items per crate depending on the type of match you play. Match types that generally take longer give more items. The items you get are completely random. And if you're not a premium member you only get half of the items per crate, so if you happen to get a good item in a locked off row and you're not premium, it's gone. This is of course meant to encourage people to pay for premium, but it's more likely to just drive players away from the game.Even with premium (which I had for 3 days) you mostly get garbage, even after hours and hours of grinding the same poorly balanced match types over and over again. There is a way to get more crates without grinding for hours though, of course you can buy them with real life money. So if you want to get a lot of items, some of which would hopefully be good, you can pay for a few days of membership, then pay for several of the highest tier crates, then hope you get something you actually want. On top of that most of the paint colors are restricted to premium members only. So if you want to paint your robot anything other than white, dark gray, light blue, and orange, then you've got to pay for premium.Of course you don't have to pay for anything, you could go on just playing the game. But that leads to the worst part yet. The game play. The movement feels clunky and the combat is bad. By that I mean weapons, at least the ones you start with, have terrible accuracy, especially at long range. This can still be sort of enjoyable when you're up against robots with similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons, but like I said there's no balance in the matchmaking. Any weapon/part goes for any game mode. They only match based on the robot's CPU score. Each item has a CPU cost, stronger/rarer weapons have a slightly higher CPU cost than weaker basic weapons. However if you build your robot with just the basics, like a helicopter rotor attached to a powerful missile launcher (the missiles lock on by the way) or a rail gun to a few blocks flat on some wheel's/treads/whatever, you can easily get matched with new players using robots with much weaker weapons which most likely can't even hit you reliably from the range you're hitting them. Another common annoyance is people using small, fast robots which hover or fly around you firing some sort of homing weapons, which mean their robot can constantly be moving quickly and erratically while always hitting you because they don't have to worry about aiming. And even if you do land a lucky hit, they'll just heal fully if they don't get hit again within ten seconds. While you probably won't be able to heal because they never miss with their homing weapons constantly chipping away at you. The only real way to counter this would be to build a similar robot assuming you have the parts. Even if you did though, does that seem like fun? A bunch of people just mindlessly flying around holding down the left mouse button until one team wins. Not exactly great gameplay.Even if all of that sounds good to you, the only way to get better weapons and parts is to keep playing these poorly balanced matches over and over again for hours till you hopefully get the parts you want/need. Or until you get enough garbage to “recycle” for anything from less than 1% to about 30% or 40% of what each of your items is worth (destroying your items in the process of course) then finally getting enough in game currency from all that crap you spent all that time grinding for to finally afford some of the ridiculously expensive items from the in game shop. You can do all of that to see if maybe the game gets a bit more enjoyable. Or you can just play a different game.			"

								The game itself has alot of potentials, but recent changes (Epic Loot update) indicate the developer lacks foresight in looking after the player base. Significant changes (e.g. 99% drop in income) were pushed out just like that without being tested (e.g. in a test server). When asked for justification, the developer simply stated the changes were fair and balanced, whereas some players would go into detail on how they are not. The improper management of the game development drives this game backward.			"

One legendary item per 100 crates. One legendary item for $33.33. I've decided that I won't spend even single cent for Robocraft with such scamming drop rates. If Freejam wants me to rethink, at very last they should change drop rates to something like this: from 300 Protonium Crates player should get 30 Legendary Items, 200 Epic Items, 70 Rare Items, no Uncommon Items, no Common Items.And I though that Kixeye is company that deserves medal for being most shameless company that screws with players. Now I believe that this medal can be passed on to the Freejam from the Kixeye. Well done Freejam. Little more and you even be able to beat the EA and take their first place too.			"

								DO NOT PLAY THIS GAMERobocraft is no longer worth playing and here's why. Before the Epic Loot update players used to earn in-game currency(RP) after battle. Do well, earn more RP. Use RP to buy parts with which to build bigger and better robots. After the Epic Loot update players now earn crates after battle instead of currency. These crates are filled with a handful of random parts. So do you want a missile launcher for example? CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND HOPE THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR GIVES YOU ONE. No more simply buying a missile launcher. The crates will be filled with complete garbage you don't need and can't use 99.99% of the time. You can ""recycle"" unwanted parts(most will be unwanted) into ""robits"" that can be used to directly buy parts, but recycling yields insanely low sums of robits. It's like the pocket change you get from trading a game in to Gamestop... But even worse. Thanks to crates it's basically impossible for newer players to progress. If you want to build a better bot then you're totally at the mercy of the random number generator giving you random parts, and the USEFUL parts are rare. Imagine you want to build a flying bot and every crate you win contains everything EXCEPT wings. A crate is really just a gamble; there's a tiny chance you'll get a part you need and a very big chance that you won't. You can open up your wallet and cough up real world money to buy crates(this is how the developers, Freejam, monetize Robocraft now), but it doesn't even help. Somebody on the official Robocraft forum purchased 300 crates and he didn't even get enough parts from them to build a functional bot. Let that sink in. Crates could deny you the parts you need for months, possibly years. I don't know what Freejam was smoking. Nobody except Freejam knows that. The whole Epic Loot update should, by all rights, go down as one of the worst blunders in gaming history. Right up there with the Sega 32X. I'm not joking. The whole player base is up in arms over it and people are quitting left and right. Do not play Robocraft until Freej brings back RP. As long as the crate system exists newbies will have a terrible time, veterans will have a terrible time, everyone will have a terrible time. Robocraft is currently dead. Will Freejam realize they royally screwed up and make it rise from the ashes? Let's hope so.			"

								With almost 250 hours of playtime under my belt I'll start off by saying that I come from the better days of Robocraft. The introduction of this ""epic loot"" bs completely destroyed the game. I saw it mentinoed as well in another review; the removal of matchmaking barriers. When you have someone with three-four laser hornets going toe to toe with someone who, a single gun on their craft, is larger than the aformentinoed laser hornet user...you've got a problem. They took something that was a fantastic and unique game...and promptly destroyed it in one update. Though, I will take a moment to step back and say I do enjoy the new weapons and ability to choose the colors of blocks. Some tips for freejam? Get rid of the crate system while you can, bring back teirs. Keep the color system, no premium colors. Though instead of premium colors offer premium textures for the blocks. I understand you guys need to make money...but this... destroying your game...is not the way to do it.If they reverse this horrid crate system and bring back the old means of aquring items then yes I would absolutely tell you to play this game. But as it stands...in its current state, I would not reccomend it at all.			"

								The way I see it, this game has had three ""dark ages."" One was insane repair costs that even drove some players bankrupt (in terms of in-game currency), and the next was a somewhat severe limit on what you could build and how you could build it. That limit came in the form of Robot CPU caps and over-tier restrictions. However, this was quickly abolished with the game's ""Unleashed"" update.Since then, tiers have been removed, along with the varying-health/strength cubes, and as a replacement we received more painting/customization options, more parts, and ""better, balanced"" matchmaking based on Player Skill and Robot CPU (although let's face it; matchmaking will never be balanced).Then in comes the Third Dark Age: Epic Loot. With this update, the game's Robopoints currency, which was a core game mechanic since the very beginning, was removed in favor of a random-drop style economy based on Salvage(Loot) Crates and Robits.Now, players must work 10x harder to find the parts they want instead of simply buying the part using their hard-earned RP. This wouldn't be much of a problem, except for the fact that the mountains of other useless crap they get from the crates sells for barely anything. Not to mention, this update is considered by many to be not much more than a money-grabbing scheme. Now, instead of buying Premium time for a bonus to your income per battle, all it is is a better CHANCE at better gear. You're not even guarenteed to find anything good in these crates, Premium or not.While there is still some fun to be had, it's incredibly rare, and despite Freejam's repeated attempts at making their community happy, the community (literally) isn't buying it.Until something happens to rectify this situation, I can't say I reccommend this game.--EDIT--Robocraft is now in Beta, and so far the game economy seems to be more of a daily annoyance than an major problem. Only things most people complain about nowadays is the poor matchmaking and minor ""so unbalanced and op plz nerf"" occurances in weapon and movement part combinations.I still have yet to play the reworked/new gamemodes, which for once actually seem decent. However, I still feel the game is sort of past its prime, and therefore I'm not changing my recommendation.			"

								After playing well over a hundred hours of the game, playing through most of the major updates and generally enjoying them, I am disapointed about what has been done the the game. The feeling of saving up for an expensive module or weapon was the most satisfying thing in the world. But now it is really just an extremelly weighted form of gambling. Watching some of the unboxings online, the chances of getting these rare items is insanely small and the fact that you get plain cubes in the most expensive crates is just annoying. Freejam really has just decided they want to make this Free-to-Play anything but that. I have about ten hours of in battle time since the update and I have gotten nothing good from the crates. The fact that I'm slowly losing interest in one of my favourite games really says something. Honestly FreeJam needs to revert the changes or do some major balancing of the crates.			"

								This was a great game until the loot system was introduced...Why? For one, they took away the level lock system which made everything fair, now some level one can get an incredibly over powered weapon but still be matched with bots around his CPU.Secondly, there is no more economy to this game, the idea was completely scraped. The economy made it fun because I could buy whatever part I needed to make my dream bot come to life, now it's hoping I will get a decent part that I can actually use on my bot.Thirdly, the premium system doesn't work well with this update, there's not much there to pull you into buying it, I either miss 4 extra parts from BA or one extra part from Deathmatch.These are just my opinions, but they truly did ruin a great game and a lot of my friends have stopped playing.Update:I know alot of popular games like LoL and such are adding crates or similar mechanics to the game but if you've actually noticed, they haven't thrown their whole economy done the drain, the crate mechanic is a seperate feature that player can do if they desire to.Also it wouldn't be that hard to bring back that good old leveling scheme and still having a crate mechanic, all you would have to do is literally just limit what the lower levels can get, it really isn't that hard to do. I'm really just sick and tired of seeing low levels being able to two-shot eachother, it takes away all the fun.			"

								So I had to change my original review, right now I am not recommending a game that was once great, The problem? EPIC LOOT. Really like, if I want to have more pieces to keep building I either have to pla a match to get las 20 random pieces, which where no the ones I needed, or I can sell the ones I already have like... wait, wasn't I going to use those pieces to BUILD? If you get to be in the first position at the end of the match great for you, hey you get a rare loot, but what about tge people who do not care for the first places and just wanted to have some fun? So this was just my opinion, I will say good bye to robocraft for a while, have fun guys. Just got rid of it, back to war thunder			"

								Ok, lets start with how this game was before. You buy parts, build vehicles, battle online, and best of all, get paid. The better you played, the more money and experience you get. When you level up you get more space on your vehicle, and unlock better parts in the store. I actually had fun. Me and my friends went out with some cool vehicles, I had a tank that was the bomb, my friend had a realy cool armored tank that had a lot of HP, and my other friend had a big, powerful mech. We dominated. Some of the things we saw and did were amazing. One time we were coming aroung the mountain to take the enemy base when a mech that looked like a guy wielding a chain gun, jumped down right in front of us from the one of the mountains, and the ground shook when he landed. Yea, we blew his chest off, he was just two legs. We got swarmed so he got away, we were taking the base and he tried it again. This time we blew his legs off. Another time there was this giant flying sofa. It was just him and my friend. The battle waged for minuets, taking shots at each other, dodging into cover and healing, he put up quite a fight, but my friend hit him perfectly and he crashed. I liked him, he was fun, when Sofa Man flys by, I salute. Sounds good, right? All fine and dandy. Ok, now lets talk about how it is now. First off, I had around 20,000 money saved up from back how the game was before, when they redid the money system, you want to guess how much money I had left? 1,272. 20,000 to 1,272. Am I missing something? Nope. Doesn't look like it. Next, leveling up only gives you more space. Now you get daily loot chests that the more days you log in, the better loot chests you get, from level one, to level six. So if you never miss a day, you get a level six every day after the first five days, and you get four pieces of loot per chest, and eight if you pay for the premium. Cool right? Uh, sure. But, after 20+ level six loot chests, you want to guess what the best piece of loot was? It was an Epic Tank Track, from the level two chest I got after forgetting to log in two days before, and my friend, who can't always log in every day, so he gets level one to three, has gotten three or more Epics, and lots of the Rare stuff, wich is the next level below Epic. Also, I'm pretty sure you can't even get the Legendarys without buying the premium, Legendary is the next level above Epic, and it's the best level stuff. So, cool if you are premium, or super lucky, unlike me. So you mean you have a higher chance of getting awesome loot from lower level chests than higher level ones? Cool! No, not realy. That means that the loot system is broken. Next, you can also get loot chests from playing the game, but they only give you one piece of loot, two if you have premium, and you don't get paid any more. WHAT!?! NO MORE PAY!?! Nope. No more pay. Now you have to sell the loot you get from the chests, which only sell for pennies. Am I missing something, again? Nope. Still doesn't look like it. Next, planes. They are some of the best vehicles, yet I can't figure out how to build one that works correctly, and there is no, ""fire all"" button, as far as I am aware, so you have a blade, cannons, and machine guns, that you have to manualy swich between to fire. Ok, so maybe this is all different for the premium members, or maybe I am just missing something, either way, like most free to play games like this, non premium members get screwed. So, did I like this game before? Yeah. Do I like this game now? ...Lets put a pin in that. Do I recommend this game? (Glass shaters in the background)			"

								DO NOT PLAY THIS GAMERobocraft is no longer worth playing and here's why. Before the Epic Loot update players used to earn in-game currency(RP) after battle. Do well, earn more RP. Use RP to buy parts with which to build bigger and better robots. After the Epic Loot update players now earn crates after battle instead of currency. These crates are filled with a handful of random parts. So do you want a missile launcher for example? CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND HOPE THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR GIVES YOU ONE. No more simply buying a missile launcher. The crates will be filled with complete garbage you don't need and can't use 99.99% of the time. You can ""recycle"" unwanted parts(most will be unwanted) into ""robits"" that can be used to directly buy parts, but recycling yields insanely low sums of robits. It's like the pocket change you get from trading a game in to Gamestop... But even worse. Thanks to crates it's basically impossible for newer players to progress. If you want to build a better bot then you're totally at the mercy of the random number generator giving you random parts, and the USEFUL parts are rare. Imagine you want to build a flying bot and every crate you win contains everything EXCEPT wings. A crate is really just a gamble; there's a tiny chance you'll get a part you need and a very big chance that you won't. You can open up your wallet and cough up real world money to buy crates(this is how the developers, Freejam, monetize Robocraft now), but it doesn't even help. Somebody on the official Robocraft forum purchased 300 crates and he didn't even get enough parts from them to build a functional bot. Let that sink in. Crates could deny you the parts you need for months, possibly years. I don't know what Freejam was smoking. Nobody except Freejam knows that. The whole Epic Loot update should, by all rights, go down as one of the worst blunders in gaming history. Right up there with the Sega 32X. I'm not joking. The whole player base is up in arms over it and people are quitting left and right. Do not play Robocraft until Freej brings back RP. As long as the crate system exists newbies will have a terrible time, veterans will have a terrible time, everyone will have a terrible time. Robocraft is currently dead. Will Freejam realize they royally screwed up and make it rise from the ashes? Let's hope so.			"

Constanly ignoring their community, the devs release updates that dramatically change the game. Usually their changes are not for the betterment of the game, but instead, to deepen their wallets. Over the 2 years I have played this game, I've seen everything that used to make this game great, get ruined by the devs implementing pay to win systems, loot boxes, and getting rid of some of the most satisfying aspects of the game.I recommend Galactic Junk League as a, free, fun to play alternative.

								Other than the building mechanic, the game is not worth playing. Especially if you have mediocre internet connection. because I am a sitting duck and die to the most basic of opponents while using epic and legendary parts.Oh, and the player penalty when you leave a game prematurely (either due to rage quiting or got disconnected by reasons outside of your control, these people don't care) is essentally the developers telling you to play some other game because you have to wait 5 minutes on one screen before you can join another match. You cannot leave that screen because the timer will restart, extending your punishment. This is an awful punishment because you either have to wait 10-20 minutes of losing the game or 5 minutes before joining another one (or just play an actual good game, it's up to you).Punish the player by taking away the reward from the next match and allow players to leave matches! Don't force players to play a game like a parent tries to force their kids to eat their vegetables!YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!			"

								Absolutely a waste of time. There is always an issue with this game. Updates don't work and often render the game unplayable. Hackers and bots ruin multiplayer gameplay. Constant changing of game modes, physics, and stats of items make it impossible to keep a consistantly good record. Had 4 bots and logged in one day to find them all deleted. Riddled with microtransactions. Overall just cannot recommend. Good concept but executed very poorly. Held out hope for a while that it would get better but gave up. They often give out free ""premium"" time for the absolute ridiculousness that ensues but just not worth it.			"

								Having played this for 330+ hours, I can say that this game has become the thing that it planned to avoid: Pay to win.Judging by the negtive reviews, any sane person would know that. Playing this is merely going to damage you self-esteem as you rack up a losing streak as your mindless team leads you to defeat. We now stand and watch as this game crumbles from the best to a wasteland.I joined during the aeroflak update. Any hype in this game leads to disappointment.If you value your sanity, please steer clear of this. Stick to other games that dont Pay2Win or match unbalanced games where only the lucky win.			"

								i used to play this alot when it first came out and it was great. it had a fair leveling system so usually people who were a higher tier wouldnt rek you. then they replaced the skill tree with a simpler one like 1-2 years later and it was a big change but i adappted quickly and it was cool. then i stopped playing for awile because my computer broke and when i finally came back i was presented with this. i was mad because my once millions of RC was replaced by like 16000 dust and some of my cubes and wepons were missing. this saddens me to see a great game fall because of this update. in my opinion the creator should downdate it back to when we hade the tech tree also they should go consol because it would be fun to play with friends who arn't part of the PC master race.

TL;DR: This game used to be great. However it slowly descended into incredible grindyness and reliance on random rewards outside your control.I want to preface this review by saying Robocraft used to be a good game. Combat was fun, building was fun, and your performance was influenced greatly by your skill. To an extent, it still is fun. Fighting is still fun, and so is building. But what's wrong now is progression and rewards.Before the latest update (Epic Loot) there was an RP correction patch. RP is the currency you used to by parts. Players were earning too much in certain gamemodes, and not enough in others. They were made equal, however this was still a giant difference between old and new RP rewards. This extended the time it took to buy certain end game items by hours. If you sold a part, you received exactly half the amount of RP you used to buy it.Here is the bad part: Random Rewards. As you can probably tell, RP provided an easy way to predict when you could afford a part. Robots often need four to twelve of the same piece to function correctly. Building robots was easy and fun, it didn't take long for you to slap that shiny new Anti-Air Cannon on your robot.Now you don't get RP by playing. Instead you get a crate. This crate's probabilities of getting a better item are so small, you shouldn't even try. These crates do not factor in time played or the score you get, or any other thing you do in battle. It only cares about leader board position and wether you won or not. Parts you don't want can be sold (recycled) for a set value.Crates based on leader board position is a terrible idea. Currently, everyone is fighting against their own teammates for that shiny purple crate. Killstealing, and tower stealing are extremely popular tactics. However the problem has gotten better with armorgeddon, as all crates are boosted two rarity levels, meaning many people can get the purple (protonium) crate.For some reason, sell back prices (recycle rates) for parts was greatly reduced. IIRC, there was nothing in the patch notes for Epic Loot that this would happen. Recycle rates for the cheapest block fell from 50% to 10%. The highest recycle rate for any item is IIRC 33%. This is a massive artificial extension of the time needed to complete a robot.The second worst part about this update is we have not received a reason why Epic Loot was delivered to us. Freejam is giving the illusion of communicating with their player base, by making polls for which QoL (Quality of Life) features we want implemented first. Mark, Lead designer and CEO of Freejam released an article on RobocraftGame.com, titled ""State of the game, May 2016"" Mark says he doesn't want to implement one of the changes suggested by the community: put currency in crates. He says they won't do this because he doesn't want a currency based economy. My question to him is ""Why?""Freejam's community manager reads almost all threads on the forums. At least he says he does. He doesn't always answer them. You can't expect one guy to give an answer to hundreds of threads a day, can you? He does respond to some of them, but he never responds to many threads asking why Epic Loot was made, or suggesting solutions to the problems.Mark also didn't address any other solutions to the problem. Many of which are extremely easy to implement. One solution being to raise recycle rates of all parts to 50%. No response.You could say that Epic Loot was the straw that broke the camel's back. Me being the camel, breaking meaning me writing this review. There have been many terrible updates before this one, Team Orders, and Robocraft: Unleashed are good examples.Another problem with Freejam is that they seem to think we will stop playing the game after we get to Level 150 and have a robot we have completed. This couldn't be more false. If the game is interesting, we will continue playing.Honestly, don't expect this game to get better. Freejam has never completely reverted a major update, only one small feature; Friendly fire. We don't even need a complete reversion, we just need to buff recycle rates. I've never written a steam review before, I have trouble writing essays. Just let it all flow out I guess.Even though I only have a little over 100 hours, I've played this game since October 5, 2014.To Mark, CEO of Freejam:""Why did you think loot crates and random rewards for doing well were good for this game? What was wrong with currency? Why do you think we progressed too fast in the past?""I want this game to succeed. It used to be great, the best game I've ever played! I want this game to be like that. Way back in October, 2014, the game was perfect. The core gameplay was decided on. It made sense. Regular content updates like weapons, movement parts, and most of all, maps would be enough to keep me interested. I'm sorry, I just can't recommend this game to someone without them also writing an angry review and uninstalling too.If you see me in-game, I'm likely grinding.			"

								I do not know where to start;but ""For your own sake stay away from this game!!This game used to be a good f2p game which has the soul of competition while giving you the feeling that you are doing all the grinding to unlock further equipments via points and time.It also had premium boost which can give you and your team a boost (yes, that's correct that was affecting whole match) but unfortunately devs decided to dig in without listening their community and brought the current system, which is a total gamble.-Pros-You can use multiple types of weapons on your vehicle-Large variety of parts-You can use colorful nicknames for your vehicle-Cons-Has irl money to gamble option over the loot crates.Those crates may include the items which you had before and if you recycle them, they ain't worth it.-Tp&rp system completely changed, there is no in game money but a pixie dust which is hard to get-Missile launchers are hard to get and overpowered-Somewhat have power requirement for healing vehicles-You are getting healed after you got hit in a few seconds-Cubes are way more powerful than before, shields become less useful-Most of the weapons are nerfed except Launcher, it's a killer.-Completely useless premium-Maps still have glitches which should be fixed ages ago-Devs are nothing but stubborn, once they tasted the nice feeling of money, they decided to create their own Vegas.Long story short, you are witnessing a game has been corrupted thanks to it's developers.If you are interested in these kind of games, i can recommend Gear Up.

								First, let me take you back when this game was good. I was looking for a game that was, of course, multiplayer and really wasn't a big pay to win game like most of the free to play games on steam are. (Free to play does come with a cost). The game was easy to learn and allowed great creativity in designs of bots and strats. They added new blocks every update or so, that even furthered the game play by allowing users to unlock them in the tech tree and play enough games to save up and buy it. I've kept a watch on the updates and finally re-downloaded the game to see some of the recent changes, as its been awhile since i played. I was very intrigued by the new game modes and ability to put multiple weapon types on your bot at a time. Which I personally thought was a step up and further gameplay mechanics. However, upon entering a game I was quickly destroyed by a guy camping with these lock on missile launchers. At first, I was amazed at the power of these weapons but, after a few minutes of repeatedly getting spawn killed by the same guy started to take a toll on me. I looked at the block store and the price for one is outrageous. Owning one means you don't have a life, or you do and you wasted your hard earned earnings on an item that is OP. Now, of course, the whole loot crate thing which is a totally different story by itself. What happened to you play a game and you get money? Now you get random drops from a loot crate. The drops depending on how bad your team sucked. With this, i can see how this might be good for low-level people who take what ever they can get to improve their bot. In the late game, I totally waste my time and money by selling these 5 or so random drops to save up for an item I do want. Like those lock on rockets for example. Premium is trash. Currently have a 3-day premium from confirming my email, so first-hand experience! With premium, you get an extra 5 or so items that I think have a slighter chance of receiving a rare item. Which then I sell anyways.  The GUI for building your robot I think has improved greatly. I am now allowed to mirror blocks that make building speedier. Then there are premium paint colors! Seriously guys? I cant paint a block a certain color without premium? What a joke. Currently still trying to find the tech tree and will hopefully report back when I find it! My current ship was a medic flyer which I flew around the map healing, everyone. I joined my first arena match with it and like I said earlier, I was getting spawn killed by that little *****. I then realized after the fact that the nano disrupters now don't do damage to enemy players? What? They pretty much nerfed everything except those rare items and up. If you like to waste your money on this game and buy your way up the ladder than look no further because this is the game for you! Just enter your card number and instantly win every match you play! After a week or so of nonstop fun, you will then realize that it gets old and you wasted 20 or so dollars on a game you don't want to play anymore. For a game that started out with a lot of potential, I'm sad to say that this game has turned to a pay to win hell hole. I did enjoy this and have had good moments with this, and I do recommend this to new players who need a game that can be easily run on low-end computers. However if you have a higher end computer World of Tanks or Minecraft if you want to keep the creativity aspect. I will still keep on looking for the updates for improvement that might improve this game. Yes, I still do have hope, just very little. Meanwhile im moving to the dying cod franchise where I can experience the satisfaction of eliminating a team of little kids by myself. without having to pay to win.BTW- I did not waste any money on this game and I am proud to say everything I earned was earned legitly through game play. so I cant really fully say its a pay to win but it sure does come in handy!

Early Access Review
								I got this game as a gift several months ago. When I got the game, I encountered a game of creativity and of combat, which I liked. The game's ranking system made sure you were matched with comparable bots with comparable armaments, which resulted in fairly intense matches with two nearly equally matched teams. However, as of the latest big update, the game suffers from a horrible game balance issue. Weapons are now handed out at random, and 'rare' weapons are able to unilaterally dominate battles. The new crate system intends to reward good gameplay, but the tiering of crates is largely cosmetic, with the highest teir gear being practically the same rarity in low tier crates as in high tier crates. Their rarity is hardly a justificaton for the weapons' power, especially since for a few bucks, people can buy the highest tier crates. Robocraft discourages new players by pitting them against the power weapons with little to defend themselves. Robocraft discourages the creative process by making roughly three styles of vehicles the only survivable ones, and by making the power weapons so costly to add to a bot (in terms of pFlops, the game's unit of bot complexity) that if a bot is to be effective, it must be extremely basic with a power weapon on it. Robocraft discourages veterans of the game by making the level system and robot rank system nearly obsolete, turning the game's tech tree into a game of chance. The power weapons were originally only available by purchase, so the update did do good by taking previous 'pay to win' weapons and making them at least remotely accessible for free. But Robocraft is no longer a game of skill and creativity. Its balancing points have become a wheel of fortune, a wheel that can be greased by money (that runs a risk of being wasted since rarities still exist in the purchasable crates).In short, the game used to be fun. Once again in gaming history, crates corrupted the game.			"

Maybe if I would place a thruster here it would help me escape faster? What if I used hover blades as an emergency escape mechanism?But now... the game has changed, the developers slowly withdrew from their community, slowly started making their own updates... slowly. and now in the game's current state, its pretty much hopeless. I have been a loving player in this game, however the status of the game is P2WNG (Pay to Win Nothing Good). Its horrible, spend a bunch of money, get nothing good. Spend no money, get nothing good. This game turned from an amazing game to the worst free to play game I have ever seen or played.Absolutely horrible work freejam, all you care about is how much you have in your bank account.			"

								Inorder to protect you I must ask that you not play this game.First I will go threw why you wouldnt or might want to anywaysand then I will go threw what the game use to be.Reasons not to play this game.1. Pay2Win because PayNot2Grind is too light of a term when grinding for one thing you want can mean playing for weeks straight or longer.2. No game balance. You will just be thrown into a game where you most likely will not be equipt.3. Based on how well you did compared to other players in the match you will be given a crate with Random parts.4. The reward crates after a match contain 90% of the 20 worst parts out of around 200.5. Selling parts gives you very little funds to buy parts.6. No useful tutorials ingame. 7.

								You saw the other negative reviews, right? About how the devs are punishing us by deleting everything we liked. It could've been a good game, but the devs made it some kind of Electronic Arts version of League of Legends. If you are new to the game, go for it. But if you played before all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates, stay away from this one.			"

								Okay Okay, let me just get this right. They take away the Level Up system, where everyone has a fair opertunity to grow themself and level up to get stronger and better, they take away the GC and RC, and replace it with crap, now a brand new player can win a seeker or high level weapon and wreck everyone, wats the fun in that, go back to the old system, and keep it that way, why break something thats working, so if you want to get this game, make sure your ready to be dissapointed			"

								I remember when I played this game for the first time. I thought it was cool that it had these new concepts that I learned thanks to my friend, but this new update ruined all of that. I was excited to get back into Robocraft after at least a year of not playing it due to little mention from my friend, but when I heard how sad and angry he was, I new that the game me and him loved was gone. I played the update for 15 minutes and I already knew it wasn't the same at ALL, and the fact that they probably don't listen to us makes it even worse. I'd rate this game up if it were back to the good old times, and sure I sucked at the game, but my friend was great at it, he spent maybe 100 dollars on the game and now all e gets is crap. please, PLEASE, if you are reading this, if the creators are reading this, FIX. THIS. GAME. Thank you.			"

								Ths game is a lot of fun and the combats are usually pretty competitive.All was fine until the epic loot update and they removed the RB rewards for matches (used to buy whatever parts you want) and replaced by a random drop system.The random drop system is not fun at all since you can play for a good while without ever getting parts you will actually use and instead getting a ton of useless parts.  You then recycle them at 1/10th of the part value and end up getting maybe 1 usefull part per 10 to 20 matches.I totally recommend this game as it is fun, but be prepared to be ""incentivize"" more than ever to buy premium status.  And even with premium you still get that sad random drop system.Because that is such a turn off for me, I have to give a thumb down to the game at this point.I really, REALLY hope they will bring back the RP system, and if they ever do, I will be extremely happy to review this review :)			"

								Everything has already been said IMO. But to sum it all up: -Low Time to Kill (doesn't really matter what you build, you'll die within a second anyway)-Most movement parts feel very unresponsive and sluggish-Hard counter against air (Flak, Missles)-No skill and auto aim weapons (ION, PSK, Missle Launcher)-Totally unusable SMGs, which are supposed to be the jack of all trade weapons (inaccourate, crazy bloom and long bullet travel time)-Everyone can now be a one man army, since you're allowed to add as many diffrent weapons as you like-Top tier matches dominated by long range weapons (Rail)-Random LOOT CRATE drops are the only viable way to get new parts (only worthless parts noone would ever need, e.g. cosmetic masks, low tier stuff)Robocraft is basicially like Counter Strike, but all hits are like instant headshots (with the exception of SMGs) without even having to aim and sluggish movement (and therefore no way to actually dodge enemy fire). Well, and you can customize the looks of your player model, I guess?I used to play this game A LOT! I won't recomment this game to anyone anymore! In case you're insane and want to play RC anyways, don't use the Steam version! I only had problems with it so far. I can't even get it to start anymore.			"

								Abandon all hope, ye who installs this wretch.With the addition of the ""Epic Loot"" update, things have gotten quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When a match ends, you get a stupid crate, which may or may not give you something that's worth a damn. You can sell those items...for about 10-20% of their actual price. Thank god they didn't keep the insane multi-million price tags for some of the stuff, because the most common item you'll be getting is low-tier gadgets and blocks, neither of which are worth a lot.Gun energy seems to be whacked. Being unable to shoot with more than half of the energy bar left is annoying at best and infuriating at worst.The devs care little of their game and their players and instead resort to petty excuses and dismissing reviews (like this one) and comments as ""boring"".Weapons are not balanced, especially considering the lag compensation system is not going to help you. How do you like getting shot through mountains?The screenshots on the store page are deceptive and are not up to date. For instance, the medic gun (which looks like it shoots continuous beams) DOES NOT DO DAMAGE ANYMORE.The worst part about the game though, is the playerbase. While it is true that they have complained about many things that really weren't all that important, that is not what makes them bad. Some people say that the players are actually 'better' than those in LoL or DOTA 2, but do not be fooled - the players here are victims of a lobotomy gone horribly wrong. You will face teammates that are insanely incompetent, making you wonder if they have ever TOUCHED A COMPUTER BEFORE. You will RARELY be matched with half-decent or even good teammates. Your teammates will let enemies drive by them without as much as noticing them, they will fail to assist you, they will ALWAYS have extreme tunnel vision - in short, they will ALWAYS FAIL. It is insanely infuriating to see them fail at the most simple of things, like, you know, shooting the enemy that's IN FRONT OF THEM!But this is just an early access game! Ofcourse people are going to hate the updates!Here's the question - How long does it take for a game to establish its ideas, its vision, its identity? Five years? Ten years? I think not.For a game as simple as this, staying in ""alpha"" for so long is simply shameful. The game had atleast 2 total makeovers to my knowledge. How much longer does this ""alpha"" stage need to go on? As long as the excuse can be abused?The removal of tiers, the tech tree, the megabots - some people were not too happy with it. I wasn't too thrilled myself, but I persevered. Epic Loot update? I'm afraid I can't care any longer, especially when the devs throw around passive-aggressive comments about their playerbase.Take the review as you will.Abandon all hope, ye who installs this wretch.

								I remember this game being fun in 2014 before the devs started to phase out the veteran player base in favor of casual gamers. It's still beyond me why exactly the devs decided to do this but one thing is for certain, they had already created a fantastic, smart and challenging game. Then they started to chip away all those little things that made Robocraft unique and enjoyable untill only a shallow husk of it's former glory remained.There are many reviews here that describe the step-by-step process the devs took to ruin Robocraft so for the sake of keeping this short i recommend you to read them instead. As for the future of Robocraft, nothing good can come of the ""new"" direction that the devs decided to take the game in. As of late 2015 the game has been slowly dying, i only hope that the devs see reason and restore it back to the way it used to be before it's completly dead. I've now stopped playing the game, there's nothing good, fun or challenging left in Robocraft anymore...Shame on you Freejam, you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!			"

								MOBA meets Builder in this ""futuristic"" bot battle game. The most defining and successful aspect of Robocraft to me is that bot building is sufficiently atomized to be highly versatile yet not so much so that you would need hours upon hours to create a functioning vehicle (FTD anyone ?).The development team adds greatly to the game by being very active and listening to the community. One could feel that you would go around the game in a few hours and get bored shortly after the first rush of discovery. However, Freejam does its best to keep it fresh. The game is gaining in versatility without becoming too complex, this is a remarkable feat few can manage.My hat's off to Freejam for many wonderful hours of entertainment, and my recommendation to all to dive deep in the heat of Bot Battles.

								The core concept is still original and fun however ... I would agree with nearly every negative review that has been posted recently.The new Epic Loot patch has seen the cost of the game skyrocket. A month's premium access now costs nearly as much as a full price monthly subscription to a full scale MMO (consider the fact this is supposed to be an 'early release game') plus the new in-game loot system gives randomized  blocks with an extremely poor 'recycle rate' worth approx 10% of the cost to forge new pieces. It will now take a very, very long time for new players to accumulate enough parts to build anything. Or a lot of cash and good luck with the random crates.Despite having played 100's of hours on this game - until there is some major overhaul or rollback on the incredibly expensive pay-to-win  / random loot model Freejam has put in place I would not recommend it.

								After reading some of the negative comments, I must say it's not as bad as they paint it...The game's about building vehicles like they were lego's and putting guns on them and pin your creation against other peoples creations. It's fun! Satisfaction comes from seeing your creation bust up the creation of other people as you shoot them. At the end of the match, you return to your mothership to make repairs and/or changes to your ship before the next match. Repair costs increase the higher level you are, but you usually earn more than what you loose in repairs. At higher tiers it does start digging into your pockets, but it creates an environment where careful strategy against the enemy becomes the main focus, and not some rambo crazy kamikaze attack because you'll literally end up paying for mistakes with credits you can use to otherwise upgrade your ship.Sure, there are ""premium"" users, but that's not a huge deal... all they get are blocks that you can also get with some game-time. They still have to level up to use enough of them because of the ""CPU"" Point system, so it's not exactly Pay2Win (Because, I must emphasize that you can get what they can the more you play)My favorite part about this game is the physics engine. You can't just make any vehicle work out, so it's funny seeing people at spawn flip over onto their backs or flying ships going haywire because they can't get good weight distribution. Overall, it's a great game to pick up, play for a bit and then do something else. You won't regret it.Oh, did I mention it's a free download? ... yeah ;)Review Update#12/10/2015The game just keeps getting better and betterRepair costs are gone and new parts just keep flowing in!Optimizations are fantastic and with each Update comes a fresh breath of air that spices things up!

								Flop :( MAKE ROBOCRAFT GREAT AGAIN please :( The first versions of the game were soooo cool but i spent money on items that u can buy without real money now... so i wasted about 200€ for this game and got nothing left now. Instead of getting special items from real money they've implemented chest that u have to buy and many other funktions that you are only to unlock with PREMIUM. In my opinion Robocraft became a pay-to-win-game.I would not recommend this game because they'll maybe do more changes like this one, who arent really motivating to keep playing. If you feel same as me drop a like ( or a helpful ) so the devs of robocraft can see it.Robocraft died long ago...			"

								im not the type of person who has poured upwards of 1000+ hours in, but i have spent a good 500-650. so take this with a grain of salt i guess.i think the worst part of RC is the fact that now you can put whatever weapons you want to go with your bot. the whole point of a team based game in which you can pick different classes (or build diff robots) is to pick a playstyle you like, and when that playstyle can't work in a situation, someone else on your team with a different class (robot) who was built for that situation can support you. in otherwords, teamwork. now, although cpu limits prevent people from having very heavy SMG/other weapon tanks, you can still be a plasma/rail/medic walker/flyer, fufilling multiple roles at once. even if said bot doesnt excel at any offensive or movement capabilities it has, it's still NOT something that should exist in a teamplay class based game. robots like that sound like something a child comes up with who bends the rules of a game so they win every time. it's also worth noting about the removal of the pilot seat. it did have a weird damage absorbing mechanic (which nobody bothered to edit), and ejector seats are also kind of annoying. but they gave bots a design aspect in which damage had to be redirected away from it as well as the bot being connected somehow.there's also the repair on kill feature. conquest would be quite fun and more team based without, due to the fact that nano guns and medics exist. passive repairing, and repairing on kill ruins any need of medics and therefor team support that robocraft once had. next is how low the rewards for beating a match have gotten. even past the battle arena update with the new gamemode, the rewards were still good enough that you could build a new robot after a few weeks if you were that dedicated to the game. nowadays you barley get anything out of winning a match, and it could take you forever just to get one of the top-tier weapons such as shotguns and missiles.speaking of which, those weapons look cool and seem fun to use. unfortunately, they're reserved for those who are willing to put up with the grind to be able to buy them. why there isn't even just ONE down-tier version for each of the weapons is a mystery. and if it isn't, its probably a stupid reason.luckily crates are a thing, but due to how long it takes to get a weapon and how much money you need for crates, it seems like more of a cheap way of making money. sure it's not p2p, but with weapons taking around a couple of weeks to accumulate, it seems like fj is trying to force players to give them money. there's also the removal of the tech tree (or its still their but the weird gui makes it hidden), which wasnt even a tree after maybe conquest? the whole point of a TECH TREE is to unlock components that you want for your specific playstyle and bot design. a TECH SPIRAL does not give this freedom, and forces you down a set pathway that results in the stuff that you want taking longer to obtain. to make matters worse, the low rewards mean that you HAVE to rely on random crates. RANDOM CRATES. don't go and actually try and design something, and buy the parts yourself. just let the game give you stuff and you have to try and figure out how to combine that stuff. great choice.speaking of cheap money, it makes NO SENSE that the ability to color our bots with a wide spectrum, something that people have always wanted (but due to tiered armor being tiered you couldn't really have an artbot in any tier game), is very restricted. they don't even let you buy them once with gc and keep them forever. it just seems like another way of getting cheap money, but it isn't even that well hidden.lastly. despite all of this, FREEJAM HASN'T DONE JACK. i know there are a whole bunch of people who say that ""FJ just has a bit of a listening problem with the community, i'm sure we can send them a clear message somehow."" now i hate to shatter your dreams, but this is the exact same thing people have said A YEAR or even TWO years ago. now ill have to admit that i've never had too much of a problem with RC back then. i am by no means a ""true veteran,"" but i have been around before tank treads and after walkers (?) and stayed up until the pit and conquest were restricted. even back then, there were complaints. not great ones, and not too many serious ones. but they were generally about the same thing and even then, FJ probably hasnt read or responded to most. i can only recall 3 things that FJ has ever changed after listening to the community, one of which was weapon damage increases for everything except smgs for balancing, and the rest probably bug fixing. I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG SO DONT TAKE MY WORD. and before someone tells me or anyone that ""indie game compaines are small and need money and time quit yapping uwu,"" freejam has grown from 5 members to around 20-30 in the megabot/conquest update and now they have 40. some bugs have taken a few months to be fixed, despite them being more than an annoyance and posted on the forums atleast 2-3 times a week. which is inexcusable. and i understand that FJ as a bigger indie game company needs more money in order to continue development as well as give devs money for at home stuff. but even then, they could just do this by expanding the previous concepts that made the game excellent, as well as adding more content such as the top tier weapons in a balanced way in order to draw in new players and devs, more money, and speed up development. instead they have watered down the class system in the game in order to appeal to a new audience, who will probably get bored after a while. over time more and more people are going to leave until there's less people playing RC than there are on battleborn.making an indie game requires extreme dedication to your ideas and community, and feedback+quality must be put before money and more players. FJ has demonstrated that they clearly do not care about feedback or quality. dont download.tl;dr the denseness of freejam, the watered down importance of bot design, the poorly disguised money making tactics, the long grind, and refusal to listen to feedback, is going to drive FJ's ""new audience,"" and any othere ""new audience"" that they attempt to aim for every few months, until there's barely anyone left. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.			"

								After reading some of the negative comments, I must say it's not as bad as they paint it...The game's about building vehicles like they were lego's and putting guns on them and pin your creation against other peoples creations. It's fun! Satisfaction comes from seeing your creation bust up the creation of other people as you shoot them. At the end of the match, you return to your mothership to make repairs and/or changes to your ship before the next match. Repair costs increase the higher level you are, but you usually earn more than what you loose in repairs. At higher tiers it does start digging into your pockets, but it creates an environment where careful strategy against the enemy becomes the main focus, and not some rambo crazy kamikaze attack because you'll literally end up paying for mistakes with credits you can use to otherwise upgrade your ship.Sure, there are ""premium"" users, but that's not a huge deal... all they get are blocks that you can also get with some game-time. They still have to level up to use enough of them because of the ""CPU"" Point system, so it's not exactly Pay2Win (Because, I must emphasize that you can get what they can the more you play)My favorite part about this game is the physics engine. You can't just make any vehicle work out, so it's funny seeing people at spawn flip over onto their backs or flying ships going haywire because they can't get good weight distribution. Overall, it's a great game to pick up, play for a bit and then do something else. You won't regret it.Oh, did I mention it's a free download? ... yeah ;)Review Update#12/10/2015The game just keeps getting better and betterRepair costs are gone and new parts just keep flowing in!Optimizations are fantastic and with each Update comes a fresh breath of air that spices things up!

								Alright, before the rant, I want to say, the actual game is fun as ♥♥♥♥. If you don't care about what this rant is about, play the game for all I care. Also, sorry if I made any sort of grammar mistakes.This recent buisness model change is an absolute money-grub scheme. Now, instead of working hard for points to purchase items from a store, you simply play a game and after the game you have a random chance of getting a crate. In the crate are free items. Sound cool, right? Well, the rarest case has a REALLY low chance of dropping, and to get it in game you have to play a really long match and actually win it, usually with you as a top player. Now I may sound like I'm a hypocrite, saying how the system is no longer skill based, but rather luck and money based. Well, first of all, case systems are always luck. You never know what the ♥♥♥♥ your gonna get. The devs of this game needs to see that this buisness model in particular is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one, such as the one in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. No one likes it, it's stupid, it's and obvious cash grab. Now, it's got itself into Robocraft, because you can just buy the rarest case in bulk, and pray that you get something good. You could still sorta do this in the old version, with using Premium Credits and buying items with those. But at least then, you didn't have to rely on ♥♥♥♥ing RNG to get that♥♥♥♥♥♥ If I spend money to get something, I'm not be told 'oh yeha you bought this for this thing, so heres a ♥♥♥♥ton of crap that you dont need'. Oh, but wait, I forgot about the ~~ absolutely amazing ~~ Recycling Feature! Where you throw your useless crap into the incinerator and get points of which you 'forge' new parts. Sound balanced? ♥♥♥♥in' NOPE. The rarest stuff that people are buying the rare cases in bulk are insanely high in point value, so getting the actual thing you want is already a lost cause if your not consistently pubstomping the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥out of every game (which I'm going to say you arn't). The crap you recycle in the first place gets you ♥♥♥♥ing jack crap in points. I bought two ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spider legs by selling a rare spider leg. Is that fair? I should be able to buy 4 with the chances of getting that ♥♥♥♥ing Spider leg.Anyway, I wouldn't reccommend this game, because people early in levels can either just buy their weapons or just be ♥♥♥♥ing lucky for no reason. I would wait until the buisness model changes, which I doubt, this god-forsaken dev team has always been in for the money.			"

								Flop :( MAKE ROBOCRAFT GREAT AGAIN please :( The first versions of the game were soooo cool but i spent money on items that u can buy without real money now... so i wasted about 200€ for this game and got nothing left now. Instead of getting special items from real money they've implemented chest that u have to buy and many other funktions that you are only to unlock with PREMIUM. In my opinion Robocraft became a pay-to-win-game.I would not recommend this game because they'll maybe do more changes like this one, who arent really motivating to keep playing. If you feel same as me drop a like ( or a helpful ) so the devs of robocraft can see it.Robocraft died long ago...			"

								Used to be a good game, now Freejam just wants money. At first (or at least the first time i played it) it was a fun experiece of grinding and thinking, ""i shoukd be in tier 6 by now."" They updated it, took away the tier system, and added a new ""points"" system. this was pretty easy to deal with, as you still could buy items from the in-game store. next, the multiple weapons update, this took away the specialized comabat roles of individual bots, not to metion auto-heal which turned robocraft into ""shoot as much as you can then get behind cover"" as opppose to ""plan with your team or die."" then came the worst update, the epic loot, you can no longer buy items from the store, you can only get them by paying for crates, or playing enough to get the items you need. this completly ruins the purpose of bot design as you cannot buy new items, you can only wait for that weapon the you were saving up for before the update. mabye someday Freejam will listen to thier playerbase, mabye someday they will become less hungry for our wallets, until then, may we remember robocraft.

								Great concept, horible execution, devs pratically ignorant to those who don't have a hole in their wallet.I've played this freemium game at 2 different points in time, and I regret re-installation.Teams are balanced against each other, but your teammates often have way more or less power (roughly measured by amount of cpu) than you (ie 400-700 cpu bots in matches with 1500+ cpu bots), meaning you have to recognise who you should run from, and who should to run from you in order for a ""balanced"" match, despite people just attempting to blast anyone into rubble. Sure, you can recycle your unwanted parts for points you can use to buy parts you want, but the porportion of scrap you get for a part is so low that you could grind for 6 hours always getting 2 of the best quality crates per match (this asumes you win and be the highest on the scoreboard) and you'd still not have enough for a blue quaility part (part rarity at lowest to highest is white, green, blue, purple, orange). Premium time allows you to skip the slower-than-a-snail pace of grinding for those extra parts in the crate that they dangle in front of you but are locked behind a paywall, as well as a more recent 3x recycle points which should be the base rate for recycling for those who don't want to spend any money, as well as 12 more paint colors that people could easily do without.Will likely leave you annoyed, frustrated, and dissapointed as it did me.

								Dear Freejam.Robocraft Was a Great Enjoyable Game. something great to come back to after a long, tiring day, to let loose. Yet then that all changed.The Epic loot update, unlike it names sugests, made it the worse game known to man, within a couple of hours.It made me cry, for a few hours, to see my what was favorite game become this inslut. In the time i have layed down this game, to presure my other dreams and try out the other games that have been collecting dust due to my love for this game and when i picked it up again. It Became terible. The Epic loot update, Which happened in my absense unlike it names sugests, made it the worse game known to man, within a couple of hours.It made me cry, for a few hours, to see my what was favorite game become this inslut. The old Robo-Ranking or even messed up tier matching system, was better than this junk. Now they use cpu for matching. This is the main reason it sucks, robocraft wouldn't be this bad and this could of been a posstive rating if this wasn't a mechinic.Now the removal of the tech tree was too, a terrible idea.  this allowed Op things to exsist in lower matches which is another reason this game now sucks.they also changed the loot system, and the ecomny. By this i mean they Set EVERYONES BALNCE TO ZERO. geting rid of all the hard work grinding RP. Thanks! RP used to be the reward for playing matches. they changed this to crates. which depending on how good they were. Even from the best one you rarely get anything good.When i looked at these mechinics, i noticed something, These mechinics did not allow Free to Play to be fun at all.However, They made Pay to Play Awesome.You could get anything you wanted not only because everything is exepseive, but also the removal of the tech treePreuim also got 2x the amount of stuff from crates, Xp, and 2 more paltoon spots.I miss the old robotcraft, with RP, GC, Tech Tokens, without the overpowered almost unachiveble cubes. But the thing i miss the most was how fun it was. Back when they had good ideas for updates. I miss when there were tiers.Please for the Love of god, fix your game Freejam. Look at your recent ratings.Sencerely,Your Old FanPS.

								The game used to be good. Trust me, you don't want to play. The game has gone downhill for months now, it's not getting any better. The developers, FreeJam, are 1 million USD in debt to their parent company and are trying to swindle players into paying for miniscule, worthless ""features,"" such as different colors to color your bot and rigged crates full of garbage items in order to try and pay of their debt by septmeber. I'm sure that the game will only get worse as far as this goes as time goes on. Another thing, they say you can build whatever you want for free, they are wrong. You can only build whatever you want if you literally gamble your money for useless in game items. Not to mention that the game is STILL in alpha, after how many years again?Oh well, if you do play, for some stupid reason, don't support a failing company by buying anything. And still, you should avoid this game, there are much better alternatives that aren't developed by people needing to pay off debt by any means possible...			"

Sadly after the updates that follwed the implementation of the battle arena and boss battle i am giving up this game after 62 hours of playing it and reaching level 98 due to the fact that they have implemented micro transactions, loot crates and other terrible game modes, (And the devs literally said on there twitter they are changing the game and if you dont like it f&*k off just not in those words ) the devs got money hungry like other indie developers do after a year or two, It really is sad seeing such a great game become a microtransaction based garbled mess. Goodbye robocraft :(			"

								Robocraft. Robocraft is meant to be a fun enjoyable game but now this game has turned into a pile of s***. when I first played this game it was enjoyable up until the update came out now this game feels like a mobile game with microtransactions everywhere. when I first played this game you could buy the beginning weels for free and the blocks for free  now you have to use in-game money to buy everything and that has ruined this game.  and also the fact that they added Loot Crate's was a good idea. but here's the bad part you don't get everything from The Loot Crate's unless you have a PREMIUM ACCOUNT!!!. what is the point of there being Loot Crate's if you need to buy a PREMIUM ACCOUNT!!! to get everything from it and since you need a PREMIUM ACCOUNT!!! what is the point of the Loot Crate's ?!?!?!?.I am very disappointed at the Developers they have ruined this game this lovely game they have ruined.

								Lets face it, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It started as neat game with cool game mechanics and lots of potential with the currency sytems. But now it is a full on pay to win.   Lets start by discussing the currency system I mentioned previously. This currency system allows players to either farm currency or, pay for it. It had good potential for the unpatient players, but then, the unpaid currency rose dramaticly. The prices went from a couple hundred to a couple thousand for the unpaid currency. And no increase in player income, unless they purchase premium. However, the paid curency droped in prices. Costing hundreds and sometimes even just 25!   Before I get too negative on the game the mechanics are flawlessly done, paying attention to details such as wait balance and manuverability (can't spell). It takes the player into a whole new relm of thinking. They actualy have to pay attention to the physics of the game. Wow! Instead of just mindlessly slaping parts together you have to think about how it will perform in battle. For example, I can't just strap 100 cannons on my rig as it would be to large and heavy. I have to think do I really want a tank or a balanced vehicle. This mechanic aslo gives a bit more freedom to the player.   The graphics are what you would expect for a free to play game, decent, and can run on any machine. Although I can't really judge those as a have a patatoe for a PC.    All in all, this game had so much potential but coulden't execute it with it's cheesy pay to win and funding. It failed to complete it's goal. Unless it was make money and  I had somewhat of a time but the pay to win players dominate the Free to play players. And it becomes a mess of losing streaks. Overall rating: 6/10 Average			"

								Well i really used to like this game but then updates. mega bots where neutral in my eyes but mainly the updates after that where bad: Every thing can have every weapon, Remove of Mega Bots and i almost forgot, Loot crates Making every thing A lot more expensive changing the currency to robot dust or something wich you get barley any of.The currency and the map where one of the latest changes both not good and crates wich is just no. crates were probably the worst of the currecny update since i cant choose what blocks i get i just get some blocks wich i have aleardy surpassed ussaly. and remake them into dust and i cant make my tier of weapons with themthe abilty too put every thing on your own bot: before every one had thier special part they played in the game each bot had a special function now all bots have all the functions no one has 1 special function this made a much more fun experience as every one knew what they had too do snipers went and sat on thier mountains and  shoot healers stayed close too the front lines plasmas and SMGs where the front line attackers. now its just a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of all bots trying too get the killPower: not entirly bad it makes sense. But all those weapons together are just bad as explained above maximum lodout was a pretty bad updateMaps: so this has improved with mars and the ice planet being added back not to much hate for this part any more.Summary:most updates stated in here added something badand one last thing the developers apear to not listen too thier community even after all this they just apear to be making the game worse and worse time and time again and if  they manage to make the game even worse than in it's current state i will be suprised.My previous rating would be: 9\10Now: 3\10i hope the developers will some day realise what they're doing wrong and not taking thier hate as a joke if they are.I am disapointed what robocraft has become.

								I've started playing in spring 2014 and witnessed the downfall of Robocraft. The developers choose to dumb down the game and get feedback from random first time players instead of their long term player community.Freejam shifted within a few months their goal from making a competitive game to a low skill moba for kids. My honest advice... don't spend time on this game... it will make you frustrated and at some point becomes a money sink.The devs only respond to players who kiss their♥♥♥♥♥and ignore every viable feedback that is not supporting their current course of actions. Within the last year they have removed more than 50% of the game assets and game mechanics like progression system, tech tree, megabots (some form of end game), and dumbed down the building aspect.When i started playing you could build bots that had a clear advantage because of advanced construcion techniques. Today it doesnt matter if you are spending hours to build your bot or simply spam all your parts. Auto aiming weapons with no skill needed as well as auto healing poisoned the game and attracted hordes of casual players who even support freejam on their way flattening the skill differences.Well... i'm out. Freejam is a ridiculous cash grabbing company that ambutates the own game in order to retain stupid players (for cash grabbing?) instead of implementing tutorials and showing them how to play. I'm very disappointed.Also this is my first negative game review ever. Just saying...			"

								It is a very innovative game!It is filled with creativity, startegy and fun!My little brother loves LEGO, and so he built so many cool cars and planes with this game.On the other hand, Robocraft lacks diversity-more levels are needed(there are only 2 levels) and there is no driver options.Overall a very fun and addicting experience!

								By now I'm sure theres tons of reviews saying why this game is bad in its current state so ill be real quick here.1. Game doesn't require premium to play however you are gonna need it to minimize the moutain of grinding that awaits and thats with premium so imagine this game without it.2. Devs still haven't fixed bugs that have been in the game for a long time and they don't seem like they are going to.3. The only way to get the parts you want are to either get exceptionally lucky and get it in a crate (and your gonna need more than one most likely so good luck getting more this way) or grind more than you would in a mmo for crates that you then will take what you get out of them and deconstruct them for the bare mininum of points till you can finally get the part you want.....then do it a bunch more times cause you'll only get 1.4. A lot of the weapons are unbalanced they are either to weak to be viable or so strong that they will be almost all you will see in combat.Now currently the dev team says a rework of the crate system is coming......I don't know if it will actually make things better (i doubt it, this current system is a money hungry and I doubt they will completely fix that) but if you are considering playing this game I'd atleast wait till then. However as of now I can't recommend it even slightly.			"

								I was a fairly casual player, get a couple matches in and tinker with my bots for a couple hours here and there. I was even considering spending some cash when able.The original system was near perfect, you could play free and feel rewarded when you played well. Each match (solo and PvP) rewarded RP, which was the game's primary currency. You could gain RP at fairly decent rates if you played well, up to 50k a match or more, and it was used to purchase new blocks for your robot. Premium wasn't much of a game changer, double currency gain and boosted exp, along with full use of the color wheel when painting your bot.Now, after the Epic Loot update, I am very glad none of my money went to Freejam. That accomplished feeling when performing well and helping your team towards victory? It is gone, for good by the looks of it.Now, you get RNG loot crates (if you're familiar with korean MMO's.. yep.. those, minus the keys) that have a tendency to give things you don't want or need, and the only way to get what you do want/need is to recycle the unwanted parts for Robits (new currency). The tier of crate awarded is determined by how well you played as a singular entity, team play nolonger matters as long as your side wins and you did the best. Losing team all get the same low tier crate, regardless of effort.You only get Robits from recycling. Recycling might give you anywhere between 10 and 200 Robits, depending on the part and rarity (they also added rarity tiers) while the part you want will cost 20k or more. On top of that, the loot crates withhold items from free players, displaying what they could have gotten, all they needed to do to recieve these withheld parts is purchase Premium.Premium is no longer just contributing to development with the perks of fancy colors, more money, and a bonus awarded to your team. Premium is now dangled infront of your face every time you open a crate, teasing you with parts that are decidedly better than what is currently being awarded. While still giving you far less than what you actually earned with your effortsSo, after updating and seeing what the ""new"" game has to offer. I have realized that even if I bought premium every month, I would not be able to progress towards my goals at a reasonable rate.Before this update rolled out, I was just a couple thousand RP away from buying a set of mid tier legs for my new mech styled bot. After I updated, I had 244 Robits and no cashshop currency, and no compensation for said cash shop currency because it wasn't above the 100 mark (You could earn cash shop currency ingame, previously). I tried a few matches, then tried a couple solo matches, after roughly 3 hours I had earned around 100 Robits. I needed over 120,000.To think, this update was partially aimed at people like me, according to Freejam. All it did was ruin my love for the game.(The free product checkbox on F2P titles amuses me)			"

								This Game Used to Be very fun and now these new updates have made the game terrible and unfair. Guns like the Ion distorter can take out my bot in 2 hits sometimes one. The areoflak aways 3-4 and they dont even have to hit you they just blow up right next to you as if the bullets have sensors but those weapons are over-powerd even thoigh areoflak is good for long range and ion distorter for short, the new update made it so you can have both on one vechicle. Also the lobby system is terrible almost ever game I see half of my team small and low ranked robots while the other team is at my level. "

								This game is like a McDonalds. The ads make it look juicy, large and delicious but when you get it and unwrap it, its small, bland and pathetic.I have close to 1k hours invested in this game counting those from before i used it on steam. Like everyone else reviewing the game, it used to be amazing. You could make just about anything you wanted and as long as you had good aim, you could win. It was an amazing experience to build something and take that to the battlefield. As time went on and new mechanics got introduced, the game went from amazing builder and shooter experience to a disappointing and frustrating experience.TL:DR---Meta is broken, cant use good looking bots because box builds will wreck you. Flyers are near impossible to use due to flaks, missles and rails always focusing you. Not a fun game to play if you like to make great looking bots. its either aesthetics or functionality and most people go with functionality. Im not sure who is to blame here: the players whom will do ANYTHING to win like exploiting the most effective ""builds"" (if you can even call them that) just to win even what they pilot looks like garbage.or the developers which do absolutely nothing to discourage that behavior.if you look at the trailer of this game and you are excited to build an awesome looking helicopter or a plane, hoping to take to the skies well ive got news for you; as soon as you break the horizon, almost the entire enemy team will target you mercilessly and your gameplay experience will be limited to watching your teamates while your respawn timer depletes. The only way to survive as a flier is to fly low, almost at ground level  where you will be targeted by ground units loaded with teslas and shotguns which are the most powerful weapons in the game.the meta of this game is dominated by flying box drones, boxes on legs or floating plates with telsa blades/stealth generators.the game will harshly punish any player who prefers a good looking build over functionality.one last feature is the crafting. before you could earn credits by playing and could acquire what you want in a decent amount of playtime. Nowadays with the crafting and crate system, you can grind for hours and hours and not get what you want. If you want to get anything useful in an acceptable amount of time you will need to have a premium subscription.the game has entered closed beta and nothing seems to be done to fix the meta. dont be fooled by the catchy videos that lead you to believe you can have fun with a variety of great-looking builds.

								First off, I would like to say it has been absolute ages since I have played this game. And when I used to play the most (during 2014). I only managed to get a couple of months of playtime before the first bad update, that had made people start leaving. That was the update that got rid of tiers. I only came back to check up on it and see if it had improved any, and hoooooooooooooo boy, that was the worst mistake I have ever made in my entire life.First thing is first, this ""game"" looks nothing at all like it used to. To even say that this is the same game as the Robocraft people used to play is an absoulute insult. The current ""Robocraft"", is so different from the way it used to be, it might as well be an entirely different game altogether. And truth be told, the way it currently plays, it practically is! With the lootboxes, and market, and just the way the game plays with all these new weapons, nothing is the same as how it used to be. That is for the game that is.Now I don't know if any of the older players have checked out the official robocraft website recently, but there is one big change that gives off a huge red flag. The ability to comment on any of their posts is no longer available. Why is this? I honestly have no idea. But if anything, it speaks loud and clear, that the devs want nothing to do with interacting with the fanbase. If they even have one anymore, that is.They have started putting polls on their website though. These polls are supposed to let them know what the fanbase wants the most. But of course, with it being a poll the options are limited as to what you can pick. However there is usually a little part at the end that lets you write any improvements that may not have been listed. All I can say is that if we realy want the true Robocraft back, to use this section of the poll to the fullest extent. Especially since they do not seem to be listening to the people writing reviews about their game. I have already taken said poll myself, and have written about some things that may need improvement.In the end though, all I can realy say to freejam, is that you seem to have forgotten why you won the Indie 2014 awards. You won it because the fans voted for your game (myself included), becaue it was really well made! To say that you deserve such an award now would be an absoulute lie, because a large number of your fans have not supported your current desicions and have been leaving. And that is the only reason, you even got that award in the first place. Because people loved you. Now however......			"

HOWEVER, I can BUY it for FU**ING 4800 ROBITS!!!!!! Sure, like 10-20 Robits difference would be FINE, but NOPE! you have to change it by 3600 ROBITS TO ROB US FROM EVERYTHING WE OWN. thanks game!I had to thumbs down this game because of this.

								Why would Free-Jam do this. Tne game was at it's peak a coiple years back and then they added the crate system that made me quit as it was no longer the game it was and not very good. I came back 2-3 weeks ago and have suprisingly enjoyed the game. (Still prefered the older version) However; the BETA is the biggest pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥I could imagine. What was wrong with the game? Why do you keep changing the core mechanics? The first time round all my vehicles became useless and this time the same has happened. This game used to be my favourite and was becoming it recently. But Free-Jam if you do not sort out your game, I will unfortunately not be playing. I only wish for you to look at what people have said. Yes I see you talk to the community often and how you act on feedback, but from what I see in the game. You don't. I you will be able to see what is wrong with the game. If it is just me, sorry for the rant. For me I will not have robocraft installed on my PC. Goodbye Free-Jam, I hope to play this, what once was a great game, again.			"

								I'm preaching to the choir here, I almost re-downloaded this game after not playing for maybe a year. I figured I would check the recent comments first since I saw that recently it had a ton of negative reviews.Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't waste my time. Sad to see such a awesome concept of a game go to complete waste on this ""F2P"" marketing scheme.I hope someone copies the concept of this game and succeeds greater than these fat cats ever could've.

								When I first started playing this game years ago I fell in love instantly. The interesting building mechanics, the satisfying weapons and the pure creativity you could employ in your designs made it one of my favorite games of all time. I would spend hours perfecting my more competetive designs or just building cool looking pirate ships for fun. After a while the developers started making some questionable choices in game design and my enthusiasm for the game cooled off a bit. Eventually I stopped playing it completely and forgot about it.I came back to the game a while ago and played a few games for old times sake and I really wish I didn't. I actually cried when I saw the current state of the game. This really was a great game at one point so it's incredibly sad to see how the development has gone. I knew from the very beginning that this game had huge potential so to see it get completely driven into the ground feels pretty bad. Atleast I will always have the good memories.			"

								You see, Robocraft is a good game. If you wish to pay so you progress at a reasonable rate, that is. I do play the game, but I have noticed more and more premium benefits sneaking in along the way. Like 3x money from scrapping, or colors for your bot. Also, the highest end stuff is painstakingly hard to purchase or acquire without premium or a soul pact with lady luck.For a game about creativity, you do see the same kinds of bots over and over and over (plus a few more overs).There are:The 'great' tesla rushersThe astoundingly stupid missile launchersA gun on the floorFlying sniper dronesBlinking RailgunsThe game balance isn't the best to say the least. (Lock on missiles lack a counter).			"

								Long story short, game started out great but got worse and worse as the game was developed. Everything I liked about the game was ruined as the game was updated. Basically, they ruined the progression of the game making it more restrictive then it was before. There used to be a variety of bot types you could make from the beginning, but now it's more restrictive. All of my friends stopped playing this since then.			"

								Returned to Robocraft after a year to find many changes - many of which initially excited me, but then after a number of games realized that balance of weapons is still sorely lacking. I read how the developers want to move to a ""horizontal progression"" scheme, and while I agree with this move in theory, in practice it still amounts to a grind to attain what are currently the ""best"" weapons.Previously, the game had a kind of rock/paper/scissors balance between different types of bots, but they recently changed it so that you can use multiple types of weapons on a single bot. In theory, this should be exciting, but there were many balances that had been calibrated by the previous 2 years of development that were trampled on by this change. Despite the developer saying that they wanted to balance weapons, making even lower quality weapons effective depending on player design, in practice they are not.Matches now are dominated by users with long range missiles and close range shotguns, both of which cost an arm and  leg in terms of play time to acquire. Every other weapon is of such reduced value that most of my previous builds were rendered virtually ineffective. Despite having played over 200 hours of this game in the past, acquisition of the new weapons looks to be very tedious - too tedious to hold my interest in returning to the game. "

								I might not get the timeline right, haven't played in a whileI am also a pure f2p in robocraft.This game used to be epitome of a well balanced f2p game to me. I hope Freejam makes the game like that again.I've been on and off lately, but I've accumulated most of my hours before the dissappointing updates the developers brought us. This game used to be my favorite only because of the game mechanics of creating robots and fighting with them. I had many hours of fun playing well balanced battles with a great community. I wasn't particularly good at the game, but I still loved it. Then I left the game for almost a year, and when I came back, I was confused about the new system of weapons(tier flatenning), but I was fine with it, as long as the game is still fun and NOT P2W. I was around lvl80 out of 100 at that time, and I was saving up for a megabot, the badass giant that gets all the medics. THEN THEY REMOVED IT. WOW DEVS, GREAT. Now I grinded with my trusty little smg tank to go to wt used to be around tier 8-9. Soon they started rapidly adding new weapons and systems, which I didn't enjoy mostly because of balancing. Once I reached lvl100, they added the loot crate system, which was really ""the final nail in the coffin""-Rosefall. He was the most subscribed youtuber who makes vids for this game, and has left the game because of these updates... Moment of silence plz. I decided to stick with the game because I saved up quite a bit of RP. One thing I did enjoy at that time was that normal bots can have TX-1 parts, and having them doesn't bind you to only mega parts. Soon I built a very powerful smg tank with mega plates and T-10 plates. Having a hefty amount of RP was the only reason I stayed in the game. I played many battles and to be honest, I was quite happy about the gameplay because I had a good bot. After achieving lvl 120, I decided that was enough. A lot of robocraft players like to edit their bots when they get something new, and I did that for every level that I achieved (you gain 10 CPU every level before 100 and 5 CPU for every level after 100). Soon I reached some very high tiered battles, and that's when I realized the balancing with normal bots with special weapons/equipment(minigun, shotgun, telemport...) and mega weapons (Mega plasmas/ Mega smg). Since these equipments costs an obsurd amount of RP and have somewhere around a 1-3% chance of dropping in the most expensive crates, few people have it. That's where the developers got money hungry. People who would buy premium acounts and all that will have better equipment, and those special equipment they get really unbalance the game. I was constantly in games with enemies using mega smgs and mega plasmas that can take down my t10 shield in one hit, ONE HIT. Wtf. I was pissd off, but I kept playing because I felt the game was still solid, but after weeks of grinding without success for anything good. I said that's it and I left the game. I still loved the basic concept of the game, but the money-hungry developers ruined the game. A few days ago, I downloaded the game again because I wanted to see how the game is going and if there are improvements, and I felt betrayed by the fact that the best robot I've ever built that I've used for hours cannot be used in battle because of CPU restrictions. W tF It fit the restrictions perfectly before. i dont know what update they made and I didn't want to know, and I uninstalled.Overall, I feel like this game had great potential, but making a great game apparently wasn't the developers's goal. This game is definitely still worth a try if you didn't know how much better the game was before the updates, but I just can't stand the nonsense the devs put into this game. I hope the devs realize what they have done to such a great f2p game and and do something about it. THIS WAS MY OPINIONS ON THE GAME, IT'S F2P SO YOU WON'T BE LOSING MUCH IF YOU TRY IT.			"

								two words.Epic, and loot.Why.Just why.This game was AMAZING before, you could grind for a bit, get some Robits or whatever they are, and build your bot to your specifications with your chosen parts.""Pff, SCREW THAT"" -Robocraft Game Devs.Now, the new game mechanics didn't really bug me (Personally I didn't really enjoy anything but ground vehicles because flyers died so quickly), the new weapons got on my nerves sometimes but I'd still play the game with no problems with it, and the modules were definitely annoying, but not game breaking.Epic loot changed what robocraft is, it completely obliterated all forms of strategic building and other building techniques.I really wanted to keep on playing it, but without the ability to make small adjustments to a bot or anything like that without PAYING for crates just completely ruined it.The whole reason that robocraft was fun (for me) was because of the fact that you could edit and adapt and add and delete, all without paying money or by random chance.It might be slightly balanced if they got rid of all the stuff everyone already had so that longtime players wouldn't have these incredibly powerful (and now rare) weapons that no one else has.From what I've seen, this has made this game nearly as bad as Blackshot.(it is hilariously P2W and full of hackers)Either way. play it if you want, but be warned that you're not getting far without $$$.(I didn't play a lot of the Epic Loot update, if anyone finds something incorrect about this review, i'd love for you to let me know)- happy cash burning.

								I need to get this rant out first, then I'll talk what I like and disliked.I played this game like crazy.  I won't type out all that I loved about the Old Robocraft. As I won't put a deep feeling of nostalgia to me, and of Hardcore fans.So, here it is......Robocraft is dead to me now.  It has lost ALL OF IT'S appeal to me.  A year or so ago, I played this non-stop.  I enjoyed it to the point where I would wake up 5 in the morning just to play this.Now?  HAH.  No.  They put a !@#$ing crate system in this game.  WTH.  I don't want that !@#$ in ANY game!  And they also screw with the physics to the point where VTOLs are no longer possible.  WHY!  WHY FREEJAM!  GET RID OF THOSE AND PUT BACK THE LEVEL SYSTEM!Ok.  Now that I got that out of the way, I'll tell you what I adored about this game.2014, I saw this in my recommended games.  Looked at it, read the description, and what I saw was that they put Minecraft, and robots, together.  That description did no justice to the game those precious years ago.You would have somewhat incredibly intense games in the higher tiers, trust me in this, before they threw out the leveling system it was adrenaline inducing.  Three years later,  ""Hey guys!  We decided to f@#$ up the game even more by adding crates!""Why........ just.....why.........  We early Hardcore Robocraft fans understand where I am coming from....  It really makes me sad to see this game RIPPED away from me!  I am torn between giving this a jab in the face, or 100+ hours.  Meaning: I really, really, really, really want to give this game a thumbs up, but now, I... Just can't.  They messed things up when A lot of us hardcore fans said ""NO!  Please don't mess with it like that!""  When a friend told me that there isn't really a tier thing, meaning that any level can play any level, and that ANY level can use ANY itm, tore me.IN LOVING MEMORY,       The Old Robocraft. (2014-2016-ish years)                 Freejam, if you guys read this, change it back!  It was much better then!  Honestly, it was a lot better with tier separation and level requirements.   Please put the level CPU back!  I can't give this game a thumbs up now.  I'm sorry. "

								Game was perfect for me pre Epic(fail) Loot patch. Now it's just like a gambling game with more action.  Was planning to buy premium but nahhh.Cons You can't earn in game currency unless you recycle worthless parts for 30% of their value when you buy them. Free(Pay)Jam forcing us to pay for premium so we could earn more parts per crate. Before epic fail loot update you can do fine without premium. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot drops. They give still give parts like cubes and such even after the RNGesus fix. Your team will most likely win if you have the most advanced weapons i.e Homing Missles, Shotguns, that stealth device which I forgot what it's called.Pros Fun game. Addictive. That feeling of ""My robot will be better than other people's robot"" feel. You can build anything you want, from tanks to planes.Will stop playing robocraft until payjam fixes the game. If not then I will wait for that game similar to robocraft but more gritty called Crossout.			"

Mostly trash, I mean a few are good, but most completely disreguard the fact this game has faults and the ones that do simply don't do them justice or put them off as minor bugs/its to little to care about.------------------------------------------------------------POSITIVES------------------------------------------------------------------Building is good, honestly made me feel good when I went into arena and I didn't make a trash bot that can get rail 1 shot.- Its a good team game, if ya got friends- ITEMS. oh boy, this is both a curse and a blessing, let me explain. Now blocks are EXTREMELY varied in how hard it is to get them, meaning you have a 10X chance to get a rare then a legendary, but man when you DO get that legendary it feels Good.-Community isn't.... bad..... It's not that good either though....-------------------------------------------------------------Neutrals--------------------------------------------------------------------- You can make somewhat cool looking bots...- Makes ya think how to counter other bots- another game came out thats heavily inspired by this which is MUCH, MUCH better.--------------------------------------------------------------NEGATIVE--------------------------------------------------------------- Crates are pay2win and ill tell you why, Crates if you buy them only come in the highest teir, the teir which has the highest chance for legendaries, while other players grind you can get that legendary theyve been grinding and alot more if you just pay 20$THESE WEAPONS GIVE AN INGAME ADVANTAGE TO THE PLAYER USING THEM MAINLY IN LOW CPU BOTS. srsly, ever fought a plasma shotgun with hovers on it at low CPU? cant. you just cant. -  This company has been reported to ban or kick people that make negative reviews (One of the devs was a salty ♥♥♥♥♥ about it and got mad and kicked and banned a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of people)- Pay2Play and Pay2Win and Pay2Progress faster. Damn son.- some parts are just completely bettter then others. Not the next higher teir of them Im talking about like Titan Legs and  Spider legs and stuff, Spider legs dont last in a fight no matter how you try to protect them.- Tesla suicide bombers. need I say more?- Actual suicide bomers.- Suicide Plasmas- 1 block bots that are 4 hovers and a rail gun on a single block. these get into REALLY low level CPU games and can one shot MOST bots.- META bots,-  Veterans can get mad at this because we remember the OLD robocraft without all these♥♥♥♥♥♥things.- You can get out of the map.- Hackers everywhere ( Mainly ESP Hackers, I was not spotted And yet they did a 180 degree spin and one shot railed me in the chest. WTF)- Devs are fairly unresponsive - Support for this game is trash- Player base is mostly kids and full grown men.- I hear alot of sexual♥♥♥♥♥♥going on in chat sometimes...- I found a guy who was broadcasting porn through his MIC not once, not twice, but 3 seperate times.- Game does HORRIBLY made promotional offers.

								I had to put way too many hours into this game before realizing how unbalanced and glitchy it was. Maybe the devs will clean up their act in the future, but until then, this game needs work.It's a nice concept and it's fun, thus why I played so many hours, but it's just not quite there.I give it a 5/10 so I neither recommend or do not recommend this game, but if forced to pick one, I choose 'not recommended' for its flaws. But hey, if you wanna give it a shot, it's free, and that's your choice.			"

								Heres my story: When I got Robocraft, it was awesome. Use skill and creativity to create giant machines and dominate with them. 23.3 hrs on record may not seem like a lot, but I played nearly every day for 2-4 weeks. Then I couldn't log into the game. I tried again and again, every day onward, it didn't work. Then I just stopped trying. Some time later, maybe 1 or 2 years, I decided to take a look. The game I remembered was not there. No more tech trees. No more mega bots. League aspects. I was shocked. This was no more Robocraft. The dev's took away the genre. They said no more creative building, we need to make this as competetive as Dota. Have to say devs.... I know your smarter than to drunk drive, but what about drunk developing? It was on overhaul of things. They put things in like ""You've been temporarily banned from matchmaking due to leaving an increased amount of matches recently"". Oh, don't forget about the  EXTREME REDO OF BUILDING MECHANICS! No more tech tree. Here devs, take 666$, flush it down the toilet. That's what you did to everyone who spent a penny on building materials. Robocraft. At this point, too much has already fallen down, you can't pick yourself up anymore. I wished the game I remembered was still wedged in here somewhere. It's not.Used to be 9/10Now is 3.5/10			"

								Freejam is just ignoring all the players they made the game a grind similar to warframe's grind but this game doesn't have enough content to make you want to sit through it you have to play over 100 matches to have half the money you need for a legendary which you'll either burn out from not having any new stuff to keep the game new like me, or you'll cash out with real money and finally buy it soon realizing it wasn't worth it at all cause then you want to have two because people just aim for your biggest gun. And don't think about having more than like two or three good robots to switch from at a time to try and keep the game fresh like I said you'll need to farm for another 50 matches to save up for the parts to that (not including weapons) and if you don't pay money by then you'll definately burn out and lose interest in the game like I did. So save yourself the hours before you no longer like this game by just not downloading not worth the residual space left on your hdd or sdd.			"

								God damn, have the mighty have fallen. I had started this game around december of 2014, and it seemed interesting. The previous year came and gone without much issues with the updates... but then this year rolled around. And it looks like the game is under new manegement. I did not mind the removal of tech points, nor the addition of new weapons. But the straw that broke the camels back is one, important, thing. Nano disruptor's loss of damage output to enemies and therefore it's fall to complete uselessness. If you can heal yourself by just waiting, why have someone on your team with just nano disruptors when you can just hide somewhere and regenerate? The addition of lock-on weapons seemed like a good idea on paper, but it makes taking them on a nightmare when you consider that the new loot system has a good probability to reward these weapons. You should never, ever, EVER, have loot drops be the sole way to earn curancy and items. And more importantly, never have the RNG be too damn broad with the drops, as another reviewer has pointed out, it does not matter if you bought crates, odds are that all the drops will be comon or uncomon 90% of the time. I had to deal with Cryptarch Rahool in Destiny Year 1, and he was more fair with his drops even before Bungie fixed his rolls with engrams, than with this new BS Loot system. And what the hell is up with the ""Locked drops behind slots"" Deal? We got them out of those crates, give them to us, don't you dare shove a cupcake in our face and then take it away, because we don't have the neccecary requirements, considering these items are going to be hard as hell to get now, with the new currency situation. With the drop system in place, you have to break down items, just so then you can make new ones. Overall, Great ♥♥♥♥ing job with screwing over year long fans who enjoyed the game, and great job ♥♥♥♥ing over people who would gladly give you money with this backwater, money gouging system. You suck, because you made a once good game suck. Thank god for Jim Sterling.			"

								XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXFirst, a Story of the devolution of Robocraft :Majority of original players: I just spent hours playing Robocraft and I can finally buy a dozen of TX-1 cubes!Game Dev: We are gonna launch an update where cubes are no longer divided into tier. Congratulations! The cubes you’ve just spent >20k RP on now costs 10RP!Majority of original players: I just spent days of grinding in Robocraft and I now have spent hours to finally build my own megabot!Game Dev: Well you can’t use megabot anymore. Congratulations! Thousands of cubes and tons of time you have invested into it are now wasted!Majority of original players: Well at least I can still farm my RP and buy proper stuff in the store.Game Dev: You know what? We are introducing loot crate system so you can only earn back one-tenth of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff’s original value! Even if you pay money there’s only a slim chance for you to earn good♥♥♥♥♥♥Majority of original players: ♥♥♥♥ you game devs give our RP and Megabots back!Game Dev: Haha ♥♥♥♥ the majority’s opinion and ♥♥♥♥ what the players want. (proceeds masturbating with money which now replaces tissue)XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXThe game WAS great when there were boss battles (one high-tier robot vs many low-tier robots, for the newbies who can't play this anymore), tier system, megabots and ACTUAL CURRENCY. Then the game starts falling apart when some half-a** ed  think that tier-flattening on robocraft is good, and when they introduced epic l̶o̶o̶t̶  poop system. After you carried your whole team hard and scored the highest XP in every game, you get worthless♥♥♥♥♥♥for like 79 out of 80 games (despite earning the so-called protonium crate), while those that barely contributed to the team may earned a lengendary item from a silver or bronze crate. Even those who lose the game/worst  player in the game and only get a rusted crate can still earn a legendary item! This♥♥♥♥♥♥severely discourages people to improve and play well as the game barely rewards, or even punishes the skilled players with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crates.The matchmaking is also quite a joke. Instead of assigning a group of skilled players vs another group of skilled players to be more fair and equal, it is more likely that one or two elite players are put into a group of inexperienced noobs and newbies to ""balance"" a team, deliberately ruining the gameplay of those experienced players. In addition, the game does not consider the amount of flyers vs flaks when matchmaking, and so it is very common to see games where there are at least 4 flyers (or drones, to make things worse)♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a team with zero aeroflaks, or several aeroflaked robots being farmed by another all-grounded team.Speaking of drones, the introduction of camera control setting automatically make these space aids agile and operable by any 6-year old kids. And you know what? People don't really need skills to win anymore, as they just find another 3 to 4 guys to form a all drone party, and gg ez auto-win in battle arena in just 5 minutes, since the enemy team tends to give up trying once they saw these space aids ♥♥♥♥ing around. When you become one of those 5-man drone party, you don't even need to brag in the chatroom to show what a cancerous piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥you are. Isn't that wonderful? And the unforgiving server. As long as your internet is interrupted for just a second, it already disconnects you from the game. Instead of reconnect back to the game (which you can't), all you can do is waste another 5 minutes to get penalized for something you haven't done.Overall the game is essentially getting worse after every major-update, as it does not reward those that are good at the game, and the rate to earn in-game currency (r̶o̶b̶i̶t̶s poop-bits) is pathetically low nowadays.

								EDIT: GREAT NEWS EVERYONE THERE IS A NEW EXPANSION JUST TO MAKE THE GAME EVEN MORE SUICIDAL! HAVE FUN!I have had this game for ages and it used to be great - now it's just ok.Too much has been changed to the game, and while sometimes change and new things are good, I beleive it has spoiled a once awesome game. Weapons are unbalenced - there is a new rocket thing that I call the noob cannon, because it is too easy to get killed by one, dying is too easy in general, espect to die at least 10 times a match, there is no normal mode like there used to be and games are REALLY unfair now, say a team is winning and they have captured all the points, it makes it even harder because then their base shields go down and the winners go up, so if you start losing, you probably will.These are just some of the problems with this game.If you are a brand new player wanting to try out some newgames then go for it, but if you have either played the game before all the thousands of updates or if you are looking for a casual yet fun game that plays well, looks good and gets you motivated to get out of bed then I suggest you get a time machine and go back a few years...Seriously, look at the negative reviews, they are almost all from players with 100+ hours, they know how good it used to be.

								I used to love this game. Robocraft was THE game to play for me. It was totally free, you could every part that mattered, and everyone could play on a level playing field. I didn't really like the Maximum loadout update too much, But it wasn't too bad. Then the ""Epic"" Loot update arrived. They totally removed the two original currencies in favor of a ""robits"" currency. the value of your RP was divided by about 63, which wouldn't be too bad, if all of the prices were reduced by 63 as well. some items are slightly more expensive than 1/63rd of the price. They also totally changed how weapon tiers worked. instead of the lowest tier being objectively worse than every other one, each tier is now viable in it's own way. Unfortunately, this lets users create really annoying microbots. At the end of a match, instead of currency, you get a crate. This crate can contain ANY item. Which means it's totally possible to get worthless garbage in place of a useful weapon or item. Some of he items don't even recycle for very much, meaning the grind is even worse than before. All in all, I'd say this update really hit RC hard, which is a shame, because I LOVE this game. For now, I've very sadly uninstalled Robocraft. That being said, I hope Freejam will be able to bring RC back to it's former glory.Get well soon, Robocraft. We miss you.			"

								This last update is terrible. It is completly backwards from what a game like this should be. There is no progression and the loot system is terrible. There the economy is broken horribly and not it is impossible to afford to make nice high-level robots. It doesn't matter how many games you play, or even if you do better than everyone else, you'll still get loseless parts that are worth nothing. Because of this system the lower ranked matches are just as vaible to loot as higher matches so there are tons of high-level players destroying all competition at the lower ranks. This makes it very tuff for new players to ever upgrade and improve their robot. Freejam is terribly greedy and are obviously made the drop system to dope young players into spending money on these cases that are often full of worthless items. Do not support these guys. This is not good game design and they do not deserve any of your money or time in the game. Before this update it was heading in a pretty good direction, but this update make it something else, a trap for young players and a money machine for greedy game designers.			"

I miss the armor blocks, when railguns where not so op.... And when the driver seat was still here. Now, you need to buy the weakest gun. Back then, you got as many as you wanted for free, I should have got like 20 of them. And until the owners fix this game, this is the last time I will play this game.			"

								Game has gone from really good, to so so, to not good at all. If its broke they wont fix it, but if it works just fine they will rework and change until it doesnt work anymore. They are obsessed with rolling out new changes and ideas without fixing anything that doesnt work. Right now i can't recommend this game.			"

								Played this since the begining, and seen it change several times over the course of it's life. Just like many others say about the game. it's gone waaaaay down hill. imature comunity, bugs being exploited and ofc those exploiting robots builds. Sadly these are but some of the things gone wrong. other reviewers has gone in depth to say just what makes this game not worth it anymore and they are right.			"

								Please freejam...  Bring back tiers and the old in-game currency... Take away the LOML and the Aeroflak... Make robocraft great again.You have lost a lot of players over the past months due to the new updates that took away tiers and the old in-game currency and the update that ruined robocraft the most... The crate update. Please fix robocraft and I promise you will get back a LOT of players. THE END!			"

								This is (ahum was) actually a brilljant game, loved it when it came out. Some patches later they screwed it all up and made some kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥fps out of it.Building stuff is stil fun but you can just respawn if you get busted. (keeping 'classic' mode on the side is not working imho)			"

								THIS GAME... Used to be so fun. i spent so much time on this game back before the create system. back when they had mega bots. back before you could throw any assortment of weapons on your bot and you had to stick with one weapono type. that was awesome, it made it so your team had effective roles for winning the match. it made my super effective designs mean something because they were created around a certain play style so i could be of maximus use to my team such as the hover blade helicopter healing bot i built. super effective. or the plasma cannon tnaks or the quick smg 8 wheelers i built. they were awesome designs i spent hours making and now that the entire point iis to buy exploitive weapons and spam other bots or just load your bot with all weapon types, it has cheapened the experience. the developers have screwed this game. THEY SOLD OUT. YOU HAD A GREAT GAME AND YOU BLEW IT SHAME ON YOU			"

								Food for Thought:When I played this game way back when, I really enjoyed it. The scope of the game was large, but with a simplicity to it that could bring gamers big and small. While this was the time there where 2 reigned (2 modes, 2 type of bots, 2 weapons, etc), but you could do a lot with it.Then came the walkers, which I was excited for. While there were a few kinks in the new system, they were eventually solved and peace was restored. I had a well rounded, structurely sound walked with a lazer battery built into its frame. As I grew so did my bot, and I rose to be a fairly solid player.Then the freemium came.Where my bot fought tooth and nail in glorious combat was now being swept away by bots with literally a wheel and the ion shotgun. Now bots only had two legs and the standard OP gun of the month dominated the land, whereas I couldn't even buy a single cube now that the GC was completly thrown out. Then there are the crates, the very unfortunate blemish on modern gaming that unfortunetly will not go away soon. No matter what crate, diamond or rusty, you can count on getting several odds and ends in your lot, while the one rare item is locked in the premium slot.And so did Robocraft join the likes of Candy Crush and Clash of Clans. Why yes you can play the game normally free and get 1 crate if you duke it out with the bottom tier bots, but if you want to WIN you'd better be willing to fork over your cash for virtual boxes and weapons that make your free lazer rifle look like a water pistol.I look back on this game with both fond memories and pity. I long for the time when I checked for any weak points in my bot and the right tactics to gain an upper hand in combat. And now I bitterly remember the slap to the face as said experience was kicked in the cubes as my bot was vaporized in 2 shots by some kid who used his mom's credit card to buy all the good parts			"

								The game is sometimes fun and it definitly has a cool concept. But they make it almost impossible to make any cool robots because everything is so expensive, and the reward system is terrible with the ""loot crates"". Also the gamemodes are pretty boring and badly done in general			"
