												* I have played this game a lot more, but not on steam. This review only covers the new Pro Cyclist Mode.Pro Cyclist Mode is a new game mode in Pro Cycling Manager 2015. You create your own rider, where you can choose your riders nationality, age, height and weight. You can also choose skin colour and a profile picture for your rider. All in all you don't get a lot of customization options. The big decision is in choosing your focus in your career; are you going to be a climber competing with Vroome and Contador or are you competing for the green jersey with Sagan. Your starting stats are decided from what you chose as your focus, and the age of your rider.  As you start the game, you get the choice of 3 teams, usually from the country you chose. You can choose the worst team, and become the captain, or choose a higher ranking team, get access to bigger races, but having to ride for your captain. When entering your main hub after choosing your team, you get into the familiar career menu. Only here you have less options. The only thing you can really adjust is your training schedule. If you toughen up your training schedule, you will level up at a faster race, but of course you will suffer from more fatigue.Leveling up increases your stats in what ever area you are trying to improve your rider in. If you are trying to win the Tour de France, you will quickly get improved Mountain, Time Trial and Restitution. To level up, you can gain XP by training, finishing races in top positions and getting in the early breakaway. In the races you can control your rider with 4 and 8 on the numpad to move him right and left. Or using 5 and 8 to increase or decrease his effort. Unlike career mode, in Pro Cyclist mode you can't look at other groups other than the group, your rider is currently in, which means if you are in a breakaway, you can't see who is leading the chase in the peloton, and instead have to use other means to figure out how much of a chance you have of winning. All in all this game mode is a great improvement to a game franchise which desperately needed a new game mode.Check out my newly started Lets Play of the new game mode:

												(i have played every PCM from 2009)Oh boy, this is hard to say good or bad too.In one way, it's a improvement with the new Pro Cyclist mode, which is quite cool..... when you leave the bugs out.I mean, there's still bugs from the old versions...But if its your first PCM - buy it. If you know cycling, because else you will not know what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing.If you've played PCM before, the only reason you should have to buy PCM 2015 is the pro cyclist mode.To be honest, almost nothing has changed. A♥♥♥♥♥♥game if you're not interested in cycling, mediocre+ if you're like cycling and like the pcm series.Alternatives?There is none.. PCM has a monopoly in this kind of game, and therefore it's sadly the only choice. Is it a good choice? Kind of.If i were to give this game a rating, i would rate it 6/10			"

												I personally am liking the game a lot.Yes, its a little buggy and for the thirty five bucks I paid for it I do expect a game in the year 2015 to not have these types of issues. BUT...I am a cycling fan but this is my first video game of cycling and I find the Pro Cyclist mode to be extremely fun and addicting.  Trying to wrap my head around all of the manager stuff on first boot up was too much to take on at the time so I thought I would try the individual first mode first...I love it.After three seasons I am more than able to pick and choose what races I do, I just signed with Astana for big bucks and have only done one grand tour (Giro de Italia) so I am looking forward to the Vuelta and the Tour of course.All in all I would recommend game as long as you have a relatively newer PC and all of your drivers must be up to date on the said newer hardware because it does have a few bugs at the moment.

												I love cycling and every single year I expect cool things from this game. After release, my dreams are crushed. First of all, this is not a new game. Feels more like a modded version of previous releases. Except the Pro Mode, everything else is just old. They don't seem to care about going the extra mile and improving the product. The distinctive jersey's are trash. I play the game in 3D mode, and let me tell you, the graphics are very poor. Maybe they should sell the franchise to someone else, a company that knows how to make a proper game. And for the love of God, find a way to provide the proper teams with the proper riders			"

												I have played almsot every pro cycling game for the last 8 years. I really like the 1st player career mode, only a few weeks into the season but it is a great addition to a game that over the last few years hasn't added much. Which is why typically I don't suggest buying the new game until it has been out a while. As always with a new game it will crash occastionally and I'm sure they will put out patches soon as the game as only been out 2 days now. 1st person career mode:You determine what type of cyclist you want to be (sprinter, climber, stage races, et cetera).Then pick your team, typically a contentional or contentional pro team. You have a race director or tell you want he would like you do during the race (just like in old career modes you used to give to your riders). So he declares you the leader, or free element, or teammate, and gives specific instructions like don't attack, ride in the breakaway, follow counter attacks, et cetera.You have a small number of points that you are allowed to use to adjust your race schedule during the year, which is nice when you want to get more training in.You select how much workload for your training, which in effect hurts your freshness for when races come up, so you need to decide how many rest days you want.Overall just a great addition, and as always if you like the career mode as a manager that has changed a little, they do R&D now on equipment, but quickly other than that I didn't see any major changes from previous version of the game.So far I highly recommend this game if you like cycling. I will update if any major issues arise.			"

												STOP ALL THE PRO CYCLING MANAGER HATEFor a lot of people this game looks like a total waste of time, but that are mostly people who don't know ANYTHING about cycling. If you are a cycling fan, yes this game will fill up your hopes, if you take the time to properly learn it.That's the main reason why i love this game. It has such a big learning curve, and if you take the time to properly try out strategies, and don't just full out attack at the beginning of the stage, the game is really fun.BUT you will go crazy after some time because of bs happening all over the place :D			"

												Pro-cyclist mode is very fun, easy to enjoy but hard to master. Besides that, it is basically the same game of 2014 with better graphics and very well optimized for modest computers.It is so relaxing to look at the roads, cities and villages while ordering actions to your team from time to time...Highly recommended.Cyanide/Focus: congratulations for the ""hype"" of these days!

												This game would be great if the developers were concerned at all about what people that paid $40 for. The idea and concept of the game is fantastic. The fact that the AI riders seem to react differently to my rider then the other 199 AI riders is flat ridiculous. Im not the top ranked rider so why can any other rider decide to breakaway but if I do or follow a breakaway the pack is right on my heels? How are riders able to maintain when they are completely out of both bars of energy? If that happens to me my rider drops back like hes sitting still. When is pro cyclist mode I can see my teammates killing themselves to keep up yet still maintain and recover as fast as I do when I keep my bars almost full. Then lets get to the crazy numberous amount of bugs that no one seems to be working on or care about as they are posted and made awhere of. Im into season 4 of pro cyclist and now all the sudden my mouse pointer freezes on the screen and you have to move your mouse around guessing where it is till you get lucky enough to scroll over something with it and the icon changes colors a tad. Yes the game is playable like this but I refuse to waste my time trying to figure out where my mouse is. Ive had the game over a month with alot of crashes and a pop up that asks me to send my data to help the developers work on a fix. I cant find anywhere that someone from the game has responded or gave info on any fixes for the future. I dont really write reviews but I feel like this time I didnt get even half my moneys worth when I cant continue to play the game and dont know if I ever will be able to.			"

												Excellent game.The Pro Cyclist mode is very good and doesn't overload you in options and strategies. Good for getting a feel for racing in lower quality races  before moving on to bigger things.Being brand new to the game makes controlling an entire team a little difficult, especially with the less than adequate in game tutorial. Other than that the game is very well done, worth the price.			"

												This game crashes fairly often and has some non-game breaking glitches. The game auto-saves, so the crashing is at least not causing me to lose any progress (yet). Bug 1) The game will sometimes get stuck on ""Downloading Water Physics"" or something like that, when trying to do a 3D race. Bug 2) The game will randomly show you / try to start up a race that you aren't taking part of.The two above glitches can be fixed by clicking on a team name, bringing up their info and clicking the X above them. Then close down the mode and restart it.Bug 3 -the most annoying of all-) Sometimes when you do the ""Quick Simulation"", all the riders show up as ""Withdrawn"" and the board makes no movement to the overall classifications. This is particularly bad when doing a one day race.Still a fun game despite the issues. "

												Terrible game. The majority of the race maps have not been updated from the previous edition and are based on 2013 routes. The interface has taken a huge backwards step and the rider fitness screen is now completley unreadable. Also the lack of Continental teams makes many 2.1 races pointless with sometimes only around 70-80 riders taking part (e.g. there are 6 UK Continental teams but once again only 2 make this game.) Considering that in the 2014 edition it only takes around 1 hour to fully set up a new team on the editor the lack of effort that has gone into the details of this game is insulting. I would advise you buy the 2014 edition instead as it will be cheaper, the maps are basically the same and the interface is far better.			"

												If you like cycling and managment games this is basically the only game for you, and it shows so many bugs such as cyclists going through cars, the game crashes fairly frequently doing while finishing a race or simming a day. this is the first PCM game i've ever bought and unless theres some drastic improvements quickly i can see it being my last.The game also needs to improve its interface and how it gives players information, i finished 7th in a race and at the result screen it said i ""withdrew"" no indication as to why, my rider was then injured for the rest of the season but i wasnt told as to what the injury was or how long it would take to recover from, this is the type of information i expect in a simulation game.There is the potential for a good game here and if they improve on certain aspects i could see it becoming one of the best sports managment simulations but reading through forums and other reviews it would seem that this game is barely an improvment on previous years and some of the bugs from those games are still present. I cannot recomend this game in its current state			"

												This game is by far the best cycling game in the world. There are two main modes that are commonly played throughout the community (Career, and Pro Cyclist Mode) Career-The career mode is great if you like to control a whole team. The pros about this mode are it is easy to understand. You can change every aspect about your team and can master the manager part. It is always hard to choose which team you want to choose at the beginning of a career, and this game helps your choices. You can choose between any of the three   divisions to select your team (Cya World Tour, Contintental Pro, and Continental) You can filter alphabetically or by the amount of stars they possess (Overall Rating) The cons about this mode are, when selecting a team, they should also give you sponsor details (i.e. Sponsor Budget and Length of contract) Also in this mode there are no major advancements from pcm 2014. Overall this game mode is adicting and very fun. I would recommend this mode to anyone who likes a team and realistic aspect. Pro Cyclist Mode-This mode is amazing. You can control everything about your rider during the race and out of race (Height, Weight, Complexion, Nationality, you can even change the picture of your rider) The gameplay of this mode is outstanding. There are no downsides to this mode except you should be able to do something with the money you earn. I would reccoment this game to anyone who likes fantasy due to the fake Cyanide Cups at the beginning and the fact that you are not a real pro cyclist.Overall this game is the best one out there. The gameplay is amazing no matter what mode you play in. It's super addicting and I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not at the controls. This game is for people who truly love the sport of cycling. If you don't know much about the sport, the tutorials will help you further your knowledge about professional cycling. I'll give it a 9.25/10 rating because of the crashes the might happen in the loading screen. Tip: Don't Click ANYTHING during the loading screen of a race.			"

												This is the 4th or 5th time I have bough a version of PCM....and I keep getting dissapointed. Many teams and riders are not licensed, so they have fake names. This can be corrected by downloading a community made database, which is very helpful...however still bothersome. Also the game has crashed quite a few times, and there are some periods in some of my games that I can get past because of this.Overall I do enjoy the general feel of PCM, but the requirement of a custom DB and the many crashes makes me feel like I have wasted my money. Maybe I will buy another version in 2-3 years and see if anything has changed. Based on the history of this game series though, I doubt it will.			"

												Even though this game crashes a bit, it is still fun to play. The pro cyclist mode is fun, it is actually my favorite mode, but not totally complete because even if you are the team leader, you cannot tell your teamates to get bottles, relay at the front, protect you, or not relay at the front if you are tired (which they sometimes do). The AI in this mode sometimes does not understand that you may be going onto a climb, which makes it easier to bring back a breakaway group. For some, the mode looks bad as you ""cannot"" control your rider as you can only tell him to pace and other actions and move from side to side with the number pad. The normal manager mode is fun but if you are only looking at that mode, the only difference between pcm15 and the older games in the series is the ratings, age, and teams of the riders which you can chage with downloading databases off sites like pcm.daily. The track mode is unchanged and is fun to play if you have nothing to do. The one-off race is like last year and is basically unchanged. The game is very fun, but if you do not understand cycling, then the game will feel very strange and awkward. 7.5/10			"

Its UI is rubbish, no I tell a lie, its worse than that. I was thinking of getting the old Commodore Pet out to see if that will improve this. I have had constant battles trying to unblock ports to play on multiplayer. Crash after crash and not talking between bikes. Do you know what, its not worth it, can't be a***d any longer.

												I actually really enjoy this game.  Both the career mode and pro mode are a lot of fun, but like so many other people the game is crashing for me constantly.  I had hoped that since I purchased it so long after release they would have worked out the problem with patches, but as of Feb 2016 it's still a huge problem.  I've tried loading the game with the default settings as well as the updates and database patches, and have problems either way.  It's too bad a really fun game is ruined by the companies inability or refusal (not sure which) to address the bugs.Update:  after experiencing a few crashes with the original game, I downloaded and installed a new database and ""fixes"" from PCMdaily.  This just made the problem worse, causing me to be completely unable to proceed in my carrer in PRO mode after about the 4th race.  I decided to start from scratch and uninstall the new database and game, then re-install the base game again without any mods.  So far it's been working fine for me through about 10 races, with no crashes.  Hopefully this time around it continues, but I still can't change my recommendation yet until I see how reliably I can continue to play.Update 2: Well, I made it almost through an entire season with my pro after the clean install, but then started getting the crashes again.  I'm about to give up on this game.			"

												Well, generally i like this game, it is a lot of fun. A good simulating game. But Cyanide dissapoints me again. Now after over a year it is still a lot of problem after countless updates and patches. U get the feeling u buy an unfinished game with pro Cycling manager. And its not the first game that has major problems. Its a shame because the career mode is generally a lot of fun. But Cyanide shoudl improve and make games that actually works. Suddenly it crashes. Sometimes u cant proceed to the next day or year in career. And all this happens for no reason. Some satges simply wont work. Like the time-trials. All this is totally ridiculous. And i cannot understand why cyanide cannot fix this with all its updates. Also they should make the game with real names of teams and riders. Not come with a new database u have to install to get this, which also creates more crashes. When u buy a product like this its fair to expect that it actually will work. Here Cyanide disappoint time and again. A shame for the nice game. It shows that it creaters dont value the customers. As said i like many things with the game. But seriously cyanide should make games that crashes a lot more rare. EA Sports manage it and many others. Why is this so hard for the creaters of this game?? Therefore im not sure if to recomend it, because its many bugs. FIX IT AND SELL GAMES THAT WORKS WHEN RELEASED!!			"

												As a massive cycling fan and amateur racer I am hugely disappointed in this game and that the powers that be think this piece of software is actually worth paying for.The game crashes when trying to load the 3d race element, the only which is the only reason I bought the game, the micro micro mangement is just too in depth and it almost like having to wipe the backsides of you riders, some of it is wholly unecessary.If you are considering buying this game then my advice is don't , it doesn't work as advertised.

												Decent game, but I must admit I thought they`d make more changes to the career mode with more options and challenges. I played the 2013 game and after a couple of seasons into the game it feels quite monotone. This gives me the same feeling. All teams and riders still not licensed. Although I must say that I did enjoy the pro cyclist mod, but that also gets very monotone in the lenght.  + Graphic+ Pro cyclist mode- No new features, other than the pro cyclist mode- Not all teams and riders licensed   "

												Worse money I spent on Steam ever.I played Pro Cycling Manager 2014 for hours, and even though the game had many defaults, I enjoyed it, obviously. PCM2015 is like the same game, not quite as good, for 40 € again. Shame. Bugs are not corrected. There are actually more bugs implemented. No effort is made to increase the pleasure of the game. The attempt to create new gameplay with the solo racer mode is weak. One tihing for sure, I won't buy PCM2016 "

												Wauw.... this is the best pro cycling game, but it takes for ever to run, u hae to click through every day, EVERY DAY, sometimes there is 7weeks between races, the game dosnt auto simulate to the races, u have o wait 7 weeks in game, its like an half hour of real time just to play u first races. Og yes the pro mode is also broken, my sprinter dude was 79 in sprint after first season, why have u done that?  we want to create our own riders in our own carere. The new mode is cool in some way, but u cant really do nothing, u have 3-or 4 options u can do, and nothing more. The career mode, u have remove the best part of it, and u dont help players to planning a season, i understand why ppl are running away. It feels like u dont care at all...  U will get a big minus from me, iam disapointet that u removed the young riders from career mode, the pro mode seems doll and way to easy, and u had done nothing for the career mode, all in all this game is the same as last year, But 1 plus, the game dosnt crash...

												Oh, God...Let's start by saying that sooner or later will have to pass some sort of law that distrust companies like this to bring out products that are not working , are untested  and are incomplete...Several years of new versions, new features and then...At the current time, the 3D race is... simply unplayable! For many players the 3D race simply fail to start and crash at the loading.Then, well, one try to use the quick sim feature... and then discovers that the game simply crash MORE than the past versions.We are talking about 20 total crashes for 4 hours of play, for now.The new great features and game mode? Nice, but not very polished.You gain money, but you can't do nothing with that; the developing of your player is so fast that you become a sort of Froome in a couple of season; and for the Career mode, the old bugs still persists.However, the game at least introduce some new pretty design, a new, awaited, game mode, and a some nice improvements.But, at the end, is still and always the same broken product!It's frankly unacceptable!This company is one of the biggest in Europe, and is still not able to solve bugs (stupid bugs, like stability bugs, not logical bugs!) before releasing his main product.Finishing, don't buy the game now: you'll finish to asking Steam for a refund.Wait, and check back in the following months, also checking for community mods.

												OK.  I've spent over 550 hours playing the pro rider version of this game (which is a hell of a long time by anyone's version of addition).  But I haven't actually played it for an entire week.  Why?  Well for the 4th bloody time the game has just taken a huge investment of time and effort and just packaged the whole thing up and dropped a vast turd on the whole thing.  Entire well developed pro rider scenario just GONE.  Two times winner of Spain.  One time winner of Italy.  Fourth placed result in France.  BANG  whole thing gone.  Can see the cdb files in my documents, but the game just won't recognise them.  So I've tried loading them for a week, and now , just can no longer be bothered.  If Cyanide wants to get in touch with me with a solution I'd love to hear it.  But THIS IS THE FOURTH BLOODY TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.  And even though I loved this game, it's just not worth the trouble.Creating a rider and investing hundreds of hours in their development does not deserve to be greeted with a complete scenario crash.  It is seriously not suitable for windows 10.0. When you've got a 2 Gb graphics card and the game only detects 115Mb in graphics memory, and you spend HOURS trying to fix this...  Too buggy.  Too temporamental.  Too heart breaking.  Yes DC Universe online can be bloody annoying, but compared to this game it's a walk in the park...  Immersing yourself in a senario and gthen having the whole thing just crashing is heart breaking.  Unless you are an idiot, DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME WITH THIS WASTE OF HARD DRIVE SPACE.			"

												Well, to cut it short, PCM 2015 is... an unexpected step behind :(.There are two main problems that plague PCM 2015The new Cyclist mode is great, it's a nice idea, but the AI seems weird. Whenever I simulate, I always get near last position, despite my cyclist being already decent stat-wise.The second thing is... the UI. It's a disaster, I don't know what the devs were thinking. PCM's 2014 UI was perfect, it had a nice graphics, nice buttons, smart placements, everything.Now: - the menus are a mess.- there are tons of UI bugs everywhere, going from buttons that can't be clicked on because there are UI elements over them, to scrolling pads not working.- the new icons are ugly. And believe me, that's stuff that I usually can't care less about. But these look like they were made by a photoshop beginner, while last year's were pretty damn cool.- the fonts are simply unreadable. Again, I just cannot understand why there was a need to change things. It was perfect in PCM 2014 but now everything is barely readable, and I'm mostly speaking - unfortunately - about the in-game races.There's an option to expand the interface but if you do that, it'll lose focus, so it's still ugly to see.I really hope that the patches will fix a few things but unfortunately I doubt that a complete overhaul of the UI will be considered, so this year is done. Sigh. I still can't go back to the old PCM simply because of the new Pro Cyclist mode. However, the reality is that, if it wasn't for that, last year's version is currently better.That said, the perfomance of the game has improved, the loading is faster and the races are smoother. There are also some nice little new touches that make the experience in itself a bit better, but so far it's not enough.			"

												This is basically a sports management game and not a cycling game. As far as I can tell I was never able to directly control someone riding a bike. The line which states “Pro Cyclist: a new game mode where you create and control a cyclist from the start of his career and turn him into an international star!“ does not mean you will ride a bike. I gave up on this game early so I won’t say much.  So I am writing simply as someone who plays video games. Pros•	Management tools•	Decent graphics •	Thorough tutorial•	I am confident if you are into managing a cycling team and not into riding you will have a good time.Cons•	You don’t ride a bike•	The world is kind of empty for watching cyclist ride around a track•	You don’t ride a bike "

I purchased and installed the product, and it crashed on the first run. After looking at the PCM solutions page (in French), I found many recommendations centered around virus checking software. I personally run McAfee Internet Security. So I decided to turn off real time scanning while running this program. Surprisingly, it has never crashed since. I tried to run it again later (after a couple of days) with real time scanning on, and again PCM crashed. Thus, I am now having a blast with PCM as long as I turn off my real time scanning off while playing. Definately worth the purchase if you are an avid cyclist.			"

												This game is strange because i love playing it i love cycling and i loved all the other PCM games. i get really addicted in wanting to win all the races and the satisfaction of winning against the odds is brilliant, But when you look at the game its exactly the same as all the other PCMs. The sprinting mechanic (in pro cyclist mode) is awful and teamwork doesnt come into play because it doesnt play out like a normal bike race. Ive lost 4-5 save files in 80 hours of gameplay and the national and world champion jerseys are awful. It has some commontary still from 5 years ago and cyclist's faces are all the same. But i still love the game because i love cycling and i love PCM. Dont buy if you dont really care about cycling don buy if you like cycling only buy if you love cycling and PCM.			"

												Well, what else can I say. I love cycling so much that I don't care about the negative reviews. So far Cyanide is the best producer of Cycling simulator game in the market today. There are certainly some bugs and lot of improvements to be done, but I still enjoyed this game as much as I've enjoyed the previous versions.It's so rewarding to see your Pro cyclist in a pro mode beating the likes of Froome, Contador, etc. In the mountains and be able to replicate Jens Voigt's ""Shut up legs and do as I say"".I will certainly recommend this game to those die hard cycling lovers. I honestly say that this game is quite improving and I hope someday they will hit the mark where we fans will said ""well done Cyanide"", still hoping for that version to come.I suggest that you visit the community sites like PCMdaily.com for some realistic databases. So I will give this game a rating of 8/10, for bringing up some new contents.			"

												I LOVE this game! I bought Pro Cycling Manager 2015 without having bought any of the previous versions. The graphics are pretty nice and the game is just overall great! I've been a cycling fan for a few years now and it is my dream to be riding with the pros. The idea of Pro Cyclist Mode is fantastic. Being able to model a rider after me made the game soo much better.I am a little annoyed at the loading times for each race if you choose to 3D race all the time. I understand that this is because the world is having to render. Apart from this minor let-down, I would happily recommend this game to ANY cyling fan.The game does start to become ""not interesting"" after a while however all you need to get you going again is creating a new Pro Cyclist.The $20 I spent for in during a sale was well spent in my opinion.

There are certainly some bugs and lot of improvements to be done, but I still enjoyed this game as much as I've enjoyed the previous versions.It's so rewarding to see your Pro cyclist in a pro mode beating the likes of Froome, Contador, etc. In the mountains and be able to replicate Jens Voigt's ""Shut up legs and do as I say"".I will certainly recommend this game to those die hard cycling lovers. I honestly say that this game is quite improving and I hope someday they will hit the mark where we fans will said ""well done Cyanide"", still hoping for that version to come.I suggest that you visit the community sites like PCMdaily.com for some realistic databases. So I will give this game a rating of 8/10, for bringing up some new contents.			"

												This game is strange because i love playing it i love cycling and i loved all the other PCM games. i get really addicted in wanting to win all the races and the satisfaction of winning against the odds is brilliant, But when you look at the game its exactly the same as all the other PCMs. The sprinting mechanic (in pro cyclist mode) is awful and teamwork doesnt come into play because it doesnt play out like a normal bike race. Ive lost 4-5 save files in 80 hours of gameplay and the national and world champion jerseys are awful. It has some commontary still from 5 years ago and cyclist's faces are all the same. But i still love the game because i love cycling and i love PCM. Dont buy if you dont really care about cycling don buy if you like cycling only buy if you love cycling and PCM.			"

												It's a very complex game and close to reality, in my opinion. It's a game in wich a good team work have much chances of winning, rather then individual work. The PCM progress edition to edition, and I'm pleased with that. Congratulations!			"
