												I'm only two hours in.,.. I don't know where the game ends but so far after a dozen or more apartment visits it feels like a whole lot of nothing going on. The character ruminates on events happening outside of her control, but I don't know if there is a challenge or fail state. It just keeps moving forward, even without completing all the apartment work. So I'm not getting much out of this right now. You do only two things: Look around and ""Click 'x' to sympathize"", to borrow from Call of Duty Advanced Warfare. And the looking around is excruciating because for  a game with little environmental scenery this game moves like a sloth. Even on lowest graphic settings it has the same frame rate drops as the highest setting. It's clear that this game needs graphical performance tuning.(ADDENDUM, June 22): It turns out that I'm missing half of the ideas in the game just by doing the chores alone. Angela expresses her thoughts in a the form of a diary and the way to see that is to sit down in the one lounge chair with a sheet over it. There are a lot of striking ideas being expressed in this moment that it is a shame if you miss it... And it's easy to miss because if you're out of time then you won't sit.(FINAL UPDATE, JUNE 24): Finished the game. There is an intellectualism in the writing, but the game is boring and frustrating. I enjoyed playing the vinyl records because they broke up the otherwise dire soundscape. Moving around was always a problem and on more than one occasion I found a chore item impossible to do: Thoroughly scoured the apartment but didn't find the objective. I appreciate the idea of trying new things in gaming, and there is one crucial diary entry that illuminated why this game exists, but otherwise the game was thematically all over the place and full of mood swings. It felt more like a gaming transposition of someone's blog than an actual story. In that regard I felt as though I had been tricked into someone else's indulgence.			"

http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/sunset-review/Sunset is an overall disappointment to anyone who enjoys immersive, interactive fiction. The game meanders around, providing more style than substance, and offers nothing new or engaging to experienced players. Not only does it feel like a slog to get through, but it hangs around far too long after it’s worn out its welcome. It’s hard getting immersed in such an innocuous and boring character, which makes it all the more disappointing that she’s supposed to be the one thing we’re to latch onto.Slow, immersive games may be one of my favourite types to play. Something character driven with an engaging story, and a level of immersion that makes me forget who I am for a while. When I first saw the trailer for Sunset, a game set during the 1970’s rebellion in Central America, I was beyond excited. The game had the interesting premise of being set in one apartment; you’re a housekeeper overlooking the destruction of your home from the penthouse of a socialite. Some may dislike these types of games, but I would argue that narrative-focused games like Gone Home can be a low-cost and effective means to telling a story, and living an alternate life.However, my experience with this game ranged from being downright bored, to slamming my head in frustration.The game follows the day to day work of housekeeper Angela Burnes, a young African-American woman living in Central America, inside the wealthy home of Gabriel Ortega. Gabriel is never home, and asks Angela to come by every scheduled night right before sunset to complete a chores list. You have one hour a night to get in, complete the list, and maybe find some spare time to write in your journal. As the game progress, so does the revolution inside of the country, one that can be seen from all sides of the high-rise apartment.The premise seemed interesting to me, and perhaps it did on paper as well- however playing this experience turned out being much more of a chore than I anticipated, even knowing I would be a housekeeper. Nothing about the game engages- there are very few exciting incidents, huge revelations or even puzzles to solve or challenges to complete.Doing chores is simply a matter of walking over and pushing a button; the camera pans to a shot of the city, and then back with less time and the chore completed. I get that participating, or even watching as you complete these chores would’ve been boring, but cutting away and showing nothing completely undermines the whole nature of trading shoes. Even though I hated how unengaged we were with her profession, sometimes her boss leaves her requests like “stamp and mail letter” or “hang picture”, leaving you running around the house looking for where this task is. After starting a new day, when a task says ‘water plants’, and you complete it in five seconds, it really undermines the wait between new information.Obviously, the chores don’t matter- it’s the story that you’ve came for, but unfortunately it’s just not very interesting. You start out the first few days with barely any interaction; just you walking over to boxes, clicking the button, and then seeing the completed work. When you do start to gets mysterious notes from the boss, they’re mind boggling simple- just something for Angela to write a semi-flirtatious message back on. This is the majority of character building you experience.Sure, there’s also inner monologue delivered, but even that’s fumbled. The main character speaks out loud thoughts to herself, but then some are restricted to just lettering on the screen. Sunset is rife with poor grammar, so those sensitive to that should run for the hills. If two forms of narration wasn’t already enough, we also have a diary that fills in any gaps- but there won’t be many considering how condensed the story is. Instead, you’ll get moments of her writing about The Doors, Jim Morrison’s death and describing the origin of blues; you waiting for the slow transition between handwritten passages to finish so you can move on.I don’t even understand why the diary is needed in this story. On your ride up to the penthouse, she fills you in on what’s happened since her last visit. Because of this, the diary is filled in with time filling fluff that makes me like Angela less as she exposes boring ideas and thoughts that could only impress kids in a lunchroom. Her vapidness is on full display here, with thoughts like “mobs frighten me,” or talking about “the absurdity of explosions”.Hector is an interesting character as well. Like Angela, this curiosity comes from how they fail to act like real human beings in normal situations. Hector leaves notes lying around, saying the most random things. They’re usually presented as a thought he had, and not a direct note to anyone in particular. Later he stages a war room right in the middle of his living room, after having the place ransacked by government agents. His complete disregard for his or Angela’s safety makes him look incredibly foolish, and makes her seem all the worst because of it.There is some smart game design going on though. The apartment does feel alive, changing through the years, more so than any of the characters. Plants grow, special events leave messes and billboards outside of the windows change. The apartment feels used, and arcs in its own right, almost feeling more like a character than either of the two. It’s genuinely disheartening to come into a mess, and gaining satisfaction from making it right.The experience is a slow one, but the game does start to get interesting towards the middle. Hector is unable to get back into the country, Angela’s brother is being held as a terrorist and the back patio needs its weeds pulled. There was one moment of sheer heart stopping fear I experienced, when a window was broken, as gunfire filled the neighbourhood. After that, the game forgets what a climax is, and the game just starts drifting; lazily and to the left. I think I went several months, certain I was at the end of a thoroughly unsatisfying conclusion, but it just kept going. The game wouldn’t end- and when it finally did, it was so upsettingly bad, I threw my headphones off and decided I would give it some time before I started writing.I wish I could say this was the end of my complaints, but it isn’t. I had severe frame rate issues and graphical hiccups that I had to contend with. The game froze on me several times, and reading through forums, this isn’t an isolated incident. Angela’s voice actress is beyond awful- she sounds like she read her lines in between sips of tea, washing down handfuls of Xanax. I’ve never heard someone talk about war atrocities like it were a bad customer service experience.In fact, some of the pleasure I did take out of the game was making huge boxes in the house dance by constantly zooming in and out, which for some reasons caused every box in the house to rotate or move for no apparent reason. This became distractingly enjoyable as Angela would sit in the only chair she can journal in, comparing herself to Thing from The Addams Family. Overall, this is a boring war story, a bad interactive narrative and one of the buggier games I’ve played in a while, and I would suggest fans of this genre move onto greener pastures.			"

												This isn't a good game, even when you come at it with an open mind. As a hidden object Gone Home-like, it fails on many parts due to its poor communication/UI and limited, shallow level. As a narrative experience, I'm finding myself constantly confused by the flip-flopping protagonist and the seemingly random thoughts that don't have much of a link to what's happening outside the window. Coupled with some very long and grating diary entries and a LOT of filler content to artificially increase its length, this isn't going to get recommended.At its full retail price it's insanely overpriced, even on a 50% sale it was overpriced. The quality is just not good enough. As a side note, when you look at the developer's dev diary and subsequent Twitter reactions to comments about it, I just can't support Tale of Tales no matter how much they've apparently 'given' to the indie scene with their pioneering art games. They disrespect an entire medium and audience because their game flopped. It flopped because it's a poor quality game and the marketing was abysmal (a significant amount of comments say they didn't know it was out).			"

												6.5/10this was a hard one to ratei personally really like it when games try to take on a serious issue in an imaginative approach. sunset did an excellent job of submersing the player into a world surrounded by conflict, taking an unusual passive approach. having the player in the role of a housekeeper was a brilliant way to put the player in the shoes of a civilian, even in times of war responsibilities must be kept. i wan to see more games attempt this.however the inescapable truth was that this game was about twice as long as it really should be, to the point where i just kept asking myself ""is this ever going to end?"". i put in around 6 hours, and for a story like this it really should have been more like 2. and the price didn't justify the content. i see that there's some replayability in the story, but i was so exhausted by the end that i simply didn't have the time or the patience.in summary:this game should have been 1/2 as long and 1/4 the price6.5/10			"

												Others have done a great job outlining the faults of this game. So I'll just post what I wrote to Steam when I requested a refund:I was on the fence about getting this game. It looked gorgeous, and seemed like it would have an interesting story with actual gameplay (like an adventure game), but Tale of Tales reputation is not very good. I took a chance and got it, played about an hour and found it...lacking. I'll never buy an ""art"" game again. And the next day after I bought it, the devs announce that they're shutting down! And then on Twitter they had a meltdown and wished death upon millions of people. They tweeted tons of stuff that was so offensive and hateful, I just cannot knowingly give money to people who have wished me an agonizing death and have so much hostility in their hearts. And their games suck. Good riddance.			"

												Perhaps you heard of Sunset, even backed it on Kickstarter, and imagined life as a houseworker in a hot climate with fierce political tensions. You'd work for this man, cleaning his house, making many choices and experiencing a riveting narrative throughout. You will be disappointed.Creators always have to think of the best medium for any creation, be it music, art, games, fiction. In this respect, Sunset's a token videogame. It should have been a web app or mobile game. You walk through a 3D environment and click your buttons just like a videogame, but the connection is so minimal that it's clear you're here for the story: which is just only passable. You're expected to search the apartment for clues as to what's going on, but the process of doing so just isn't enjoyable.I set my walk speed to high so I could breeze through the chores. This renders Angela as a high-speed automaton responding binarily (two choices) to each action -- and this wasn't even communicated well. Where you'd expect to hover over an object and hit Y or N, (yes or no for positive/negative? sure!) you apparently have to move your cursor north and south of the object? Anyway, it took me a good few minutes to figure out how to water the plants one Day. I'd prefer to just tick an optional setting of, ""highlight all important objects"" so we can do away with the illusion that the game should be immersive.The 1970's filter over the screen held charm for about 30 seconds. It's annoying in the day. At night, the apartment can become hard to see, and damn if I'm going to waste my precious (and pointlessly timed) minutes turning on each light so I can see. Another optional toggle for the filter would be appreciated, and I have a suspicion that it's cause of a few performance issues people have. On that note, it is presently a little jittery in regards to performance. War games employ explosions, many NPCs everywhere, intense calculations, reflections, etc. and they still run better than Sunset, which takes place in a single apartment.I will await a patch for further play. But no patch will avert the reality: they could have dedicated significantly more time to writing more options for these notes and other choices in the game, if only Sunset weren't a videogame. It plays like a web app could.			"

												Sunset is one of the games I most wanted to love this year, but somehow am finding it impossible to. It's revolutionary in many ways, exploring what a game can be, and I love that about it. But nearly everything else about it is frustrating. The user interface is one of the worst I've used. Your character has some kind of neck issue which prevents her from looking more than about 30 degrees off the horizontal, and as such, if you want to look at something that's on the floor or on a low table, you have to back way up and look at it from about 10 feet away. There's a zoom function, but it doesn't help much, and it's still completely counter-intuitive. You'll spend a lot of time walking up to things then slowly backing away until you can see it, then backing away a little more until your character considers doing something with it. The elevator button controls aren't always intuitive, and I found myself sometimes giving my employer the big middle finger by accidentally just skipping an entire day's work when I didn't intend to. The faded retro vintage visual filter is MADDENING. It's supposed to set a certain tone, but the majority of what it does is make it impossible to see anything. Turning on lights usually makes it worse rather than better. There are copious adjustment settings, but most of them make the situation worse, and there's no way to return to the default settings short of having written them all down before you messed with them and then putting them all back to the original settings based on your notes. Also, the visual options panel covers the screen, so there's no way to see what effect your adjustments are really having other than guessing from the tiny strip that remains visible and then jumping out, seeing if it helps, and then going back in, which is a really tedious process. The game's soundtrack is really touted, but as far as I'd played so far there isn't any music at all, other than if you go find the stereo and start it playing every time. Your workload varies by day, but so does the amount of the house that's accessible, so on light workload days you don't get to spend the slack time by exploring the house, because most of it will be closed to  you. You also can't take care of tasks that need doing that you never have time for, because often the ways to trigger those tasks are closed off. Which takes me to one of the worst parts of the game: The bewildering job of performing tasks! You'll get a task like, ""Wash the windows,"" and then it's pixel hunting on the grandest of scales to figure out what specific thing will give you the window washing option. Standing in front of the windows? No. Going to the broom closet and standing in front of the bucket that has cleaning supplies, a squeegee, etc.? No. No, you have to find a lone bucket with no tools sitting half covered by a newspaper. Wow, thanks. I only wasted like five minutes of my hour trying to figure out what would give me a related option. Also, the beginning of the game tells you that sitting down will prompt your character to ruminate or write in her journal, and I gather that this is where a lot of your character's development is supposed to happen. However, it never worked for me. Any time I sat in any chair all that happens is my character just sits.I haven't finished the game yet, and I'm interested to see how it pans out by the end and whether the story is so compelling as to erase these irritations. Maybe I""ll update my review at that time.			"

												The positive: Really interesting premise, setting and art style. I was invested in the story despite its unusual presentation. I appreciated that it wasn't about aliens or zombies or hitmen. When the game started and I realized I would be doing chores I was skeptical, but it won me over pretty quickly.The negative: I'm really forgiving when it comes to clunkiness, especially in indie titles, but this one just wore me down fast. After a while I just couldn't ignore the flakey controls and poor optimization, and I opted to watch a lets play instead of actually playing it (Hence the extremely low # of hours played). If this were an Early Access game and I could expect these issues to improve I'd say absolutely give it a look, but as a finished title it's just shy of worth it. I've got to give it a thumbs down unless you're specifically into unusual game design.I'm actually looking forward to the next game from these developers. They've convinced me that they can craft a fun experience out of unique elements. I'm hoping it's something in a similar style, just a more polished technically.(Side note - Not really a plus or minus, just something to keep in mind if you're sensitive to motion sickness - this is the only FPS I've ever played that has made me feel nauseated. My wife couldn't watch more than a few minutes before almost throwing up. Pretty weird.)[Edit: After writing this I checked out the developer to see what else they were up to. Turns out they've shut down. That's a damn shame.]			"

												Ok i did a video review, that i will post below, so ill try and just give you the cliffnotes. im going to start with the cons because thats what the majority of this ""game"" is made of.CONS:Poorly written story, with bad pacing, and amaturistice dialogBoring and uninteresting characters, all two of them (Three if you count the brother)The most boring and repetitive gameplay i have ever seenPoor animationsPoor optimization (major frame rate issues)Buggy (Lighting, clipping, and crashing are the big ones)WAY TOO LONG (Its a boring slog that youll be forceing yourself through half way through the game)PROS:Good soundtrackInteresting concept (but poorly done)Interesting setting (70s latin america, but this wasnt taken advantage of)so in short DONT buy this, get Gone Home. has a simmilar concept but its done so much better. yes gone home is shorter but its much more interesting. UPDATE:After contacting Steam, the dev, and The Humble Store directly requesting a refund from one of the three i recived a reply. The Humble Store (the only one of the three that responed) finaly responed and in less than a week i had a full refund. Please note that I made this request before Steam's new refund program.UPDATE 2: steam did eventualy reply but told be to talk to the humble store, and like i said humble issued a refund.

												in Brief: absolutely no gameplay, except for walking (slowly) from a point to a point in bright 70s decor. Story's dull and progresses (very slowly to the uneventful end) through text messages, paper articles and heroine's monologing. Authors should have written the book or the script for a drama.I realy don't want to bash on artsy / indy stuff, but this ""game"" is plain dull, i played through it as i was doing awfully borring chore. The worst is the lack of interaction and vague consequences of actions – I didn't have the feel that I affect the story or that my presence matters. Everything you do is pushing buttons. And when the heroine said that the war is over, a huge boulder fell from my shoulders and I felt the real relief to know that this torture have ended. That's the most powerful emotion this game brought from me.I'm sure there are slim number of people who would like the concept of it, and maby find the ideas game bombarding the player with smart and insightful, but they banal and beaten to the death since the 1st men got hit with a stick.Also, the game performance is awful.You want narrative driven games – try Telltale, at least, these are exciting and manage to show more than one location with only character.P.S. I was playing in it, 'cause I was assigned to. Finished it 2 times (the most fun I got was when I was hunting for hidden books and right behind it – keeping the calendar to date).---UPD 06/23/15: My sincere condolences to the developers, it's always a tragedy when yet another studio goes down the drain, but they brought it on themselves: reaching for wider audience without understanding it preferences; wasting money on pr, that doesn't affect true auditory; copying others and not trying to be true to themselves.

												game mechenic is that you get 2-5 tasks which range from wipe widows to help copy documents, all accomplished by walk - click,and the process is static screen so there isnt any content particularly relate to that process, its a walk (in the same house) experience, and during each day of work , there will be a monologue tells you the progress of the story, its a very experimental interaction novel actually, the 3d enviroment doesnt provide so much entertainment, if there is any. btw, the graphic performance is not very good, means the graphic is laggy, but dunno whether this problem is incidental just to me. the price is also too high, personally i think a 4.99usd will be just.

												This game could have been better if the pacing was faster. I felt the story literally dragging me along each time I was supposed to enter the apartment. I like the story telling mechanics, but I was disappointed that we didn't see more of the regime effecting the world around the apartment. I couldn't truly feel for the characters because the protagonist merely ""described"" what was happening. I think this game could have showed more of what was happening than rely solely on the descriptions of the protagonist. Overall, this game is really repetitive, but has a great story. I wouldn't recommend it simply because I was getting bored of the protagonist telling me what was happening with the world.			"

												The worst part about this game is the price, that was the real killer. If it was around $5.00 or so, then I could see investing a little time in it. The game is exactly what it says it is, a walking simulator. That can work in some cases if the story is intresting enough or the interactions in the world around you are unique. Sunset, however, lacks both. It takes far too long to get invested in any actual story/drama, The interface is choppy and annoying, there is no real goal set up (that is to say, no end in sight), and to top it all off its grossly overpriced. Don't buy this game, or at least wait for it to go on sale.			"

												In Sunset you play Angela Burns, an American living in a fictional Latin American country under an oppressive regime. Angela is the housekeeper for Gabriel, a powerful man in the government. Though the backdrop of civil unrest and revolution is potentially interesting, the game itself often isn't.Each day you take an elevator up to the posh penthouse. While Angela narrates some thoughts you are presented with the list of tasks to do, though you can do more (or less) if you'd like. The main mechanic of the game, is that you can perform tasks warmly or coldly. How you perform these actions affects your relationship with your absent employer. I didn't even notice there were options on how to perform tasks until a few days in. Then all of a sudden, after choosing to paint a wall red instead of blue, leaving some lights on, and moving some slippers, Angela and Gabriel were on the cusp of a romantic relationship.The idea of romancing your boss, especially given the nature of the working relationship, wasn't one I was entirely comfortable with. The fact that Gabriel wasn't even present in the game, and Angela never met him, made it even more strange. However, once I was started, I continued down the romantic path to see where it went. After a while, Angela and Gabriel start communicating via notes left around the apartment, though the content of these notes don't seem to affect Angela's narration of the world events.Sunset started out on rocky terrain by making the gameplay about housekeeping. That's not really something I want to do in my own apartment, never mind choosing to pretend to do it in a video game. The story isn't strong enough to make up for this. It takes a long time for anything interesting to happen. Days and days went by before the gameplay started integrating into the story of civil war. About an hour in, I was quite bored. Eventually, some interesting tidbits of information start appearing, but they were spread so thinly throughout the game.The game isn't completely without charms. The voice acting is good, the music is great, and I enjoyed the increasing focus on art in the latter parts of the game. But it's just not enough. There are good things in this game, they are few and far between. Had the game been 2 hours instead of 4, I think some of the issues could have been solved, but as it is, Sunset just wasn't an engaging experience.			"

												Well this game looked very promising but in my short 40 minute experience it really didn't deliver on what it promised. There is little to no interaction with objects in the world and the story is solely told through a voice over, which after a while becomes monotonous and boring. I would have liked there to be more story telling to be uncovered through notes, objects so it makes you feel rewarded for exploring the environment. The tasks of cleaning the place just seem arbitrary after a while. The story is OK but I felt after awhile just frustrated and bored.It is a cool concept and they obviously took a risk and if I didn;t get a review copy of the game, I think I would feel a little hard done by spending 20$ on this. But if you are into that kind of thing its worth a try, if not you could check out my playthrough!

												This game is a trainwreck. I wanted to like this, I thought it was supposed to be a good, artsy game. Instead, its a cynical cash in. The writing is atrocious, and the game didn't even get a copy-edit. The voice acting sounds phoned-in half the time. Game is set in the fictional world of South Amerca, in fictional 1972. Why would you set a story in a real continent and year but not use real events or country names?Sunset tries to be Gone Home, but the exploration is so underwhelming and it pretty much plays itelf. There's no real game here, as 'cleaning the floor', for example, means clicking the broom once and watch time tick past. Story items are only explained a little bit, one sentence or two for each, and the character you play as doesn't even need to see items to comment on them the next day. You get achievements for looking at the books scattered around the house each day, but why should I care if this guy reads Brave New World? You look at Life is Strange, and they tell you why the pop culture it references is worth looking into. Sunset's just like 'here's a book one of the devs likes'.I don't know if the people who made this have ever done anything physically before in their lives, but, I'm sorry, a young woman isn't going to assemble a 500 pound mobile scuplture suspended 20 feet in the air with no tools and no ladder. What were they thinking? The only thing that I got any sort of kick out of was the space station chairs from 2001 A Space Odessy, and man is that a random thing to add.The game bombards you with trite poetry, rife with spelling errors and ridiculous statements like 'fire, a symbol of comfort.. and destruction'. Really? The color pallet in the house is more abstract and less on-the-nose than the writing. And then, in the story, they just randomly introduce elements into the mythos. I decoded a document because I was snooping around, and so for whatever reason I now have a brother who's a resistance leader. Why didn't we mention anything about this before it was of major relevance to the 'plot'? There's absolutely no incentive to explore the game's story, anyway. And the character doesn't even know herself. She's black, so obviously she would refer to her own school as 'the black school', right? Riiight.Oh, and the game performs horribly on my machine. They even have a setting where you can reduce the graphics to look like Journeyman Project (1992). I kid you not, the lowest graphics setting looks like the Sega CD and it still runs like garbage. And why do the carpets at the begining look like snow, even in the advertised screenshots, but in the sunset 'levels' the rugs are gone?Stay away from this boring, unthoughtful title. The developers obviously wanted to have as little to do with it as possible, too. I'd just like to thank them for dispanding before they had a chance to make a sequel.			"

												When I first played this game, it had numerous issues. It crashed on startup, by which I mean the first 10 times I played it, it either shut itself down without an error message or froze and windows forced me to close it. It also made me physically sick, and didn't run well. It also had issues where if I zoomed in on an item (to collect an item), the game would crash. There's been no patch but I have fixed some issues. Originally the game made me sick but that can be fixed by playing on Low Settings instead of Min and changing the FOV. No problems there. The game does have frame rate issues. I've talked to a few people who had the same problem, some with a desktop computer. The games frame rate does dip below 20 at times. For me, it runs between 15 and 40 fps on low settings and changing the settings doesn't make a lot of difference. You have to make choices in this game. This game is about choice. You get two options: a red or a blue option and you pick which one you think suits best for the way you want to play the game. There is also a lot of variety of your interactivity with the world. There are books to be found. Records to be played. Lights to turn on. There is a lot of it, and that's one of the great things the game has going for it. The ambient noise is also really good. The crackling of records. Helicopters flying overhead. I love the ambient noise. There's nothing better than sitting down, and hearing the crackling of a record and some beautiful music. It's definitely one of my favourite moments of the game. The explosions actually scare you, as you have no choice but to..sort of hide from it. Same with gunfire. Although in other games it would terrify you, there's nothing you can do about it. You just live in constant fear that the next person to get shot/get blown up is yourself. The game revolves around you, a Gringo housekeeper. As such, you get to know the nooks and crannies of the house very well. There are indoor and outdoor sections. But also as it is set in a house, there aren't a lot of variety to tasks ""clean this"", ""mop that"" so if you want a variety of activities, this isn't for you. However you can explore, crack codes, discover secrets, etc. and that's one of the things I love most about this game. Would I recommend this game? Truthfully...I don't know. If you like so called ""walking simulators"" or you love indie games, then I'd say yes. If you can look past the issues I had at the start, then I would definitely recommend this game. But as the issues I had at the start, and still have seem to have ruined the whole experience for me. I can't. It takes me out of the world. Original Review: I wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. I love Latin America. I loved exploration games. I love political games. I love games that aren't just a ""Kill the Russian guy"" ""go to this place"" type games and so I was really looking forward to sunset. I know I have 0.3 hours on record, and that's literally nothing. But the performance just isn't there. The game freezes, shuts itself down, runs very poorly even on low settings. I really want to love this tale of tales, I really do. But I can only judge it on what was in front of me...and that was nothing short of poor. Not only was the performance bad, the camera seemed to have this really strange messed up fish eyes lens whenever I looked at items of interest which just made me sick. Maybe later I'll review it again and give it the positive that I hope this game deserves, but until then - it's a thumbs down from me. Sorry Tale of Tales. :(			"

												I've been waiting a bit for this game and quite looking forward for its release. But that changed after I played for an hour, and was met with slow-paced storytelling, boring chores and not that great aesthetics. The first thing i noticed how little flattering the graphics were. Sure the lightning and color was nice, but pixelated reflections and textures that melts together utterly ruined that for me. Especially when I checked the trailer again to see if I was maybe remembering it to look better. On a side note I also thought the sound was a bit off. Not sure if it's the quality they used, but I didn't get in the mood they were going for here.It has bizzare controls, instead of one button to interact with, they have four. Why? The chores are boring. I know that you're a housemaid, but still, I think they shouldn't be in the game. Not those at least. I feel the only key selling point this game have is the story. I did enjoy how they caught me off guard at one point, but that was because the story didn't pick up before too late. I really hoped this was going to be better, and now I'm going to to something else than playing this again.			"

The game seems to be interesting, but performance issues like this can't be overlooked.It runs very poorly. Even when played on the minimum settings provided and at a fairly low resolution, the frames still drop below 30 every now and then.And as far the visuals of the game go... Well it's not exactly Crysis.So I do not understand why it runs so awfully unless the optimizing has been neglected.I hope they can improve that, but until that I can't recommend this to anyone, unless you have a beast of a PC.

												Sunset presents itself as a narrative-based experimental videogame, an experience constructed from its character, exploration, interaction and time management.It's neither of those things.The narrative, which reads like Cold War fan fiction written by someone who skimmed through a Che Guevara biography once, runs along the game almost unconnected of the actual gameplay or your actions. The themes and conflicts are unsubtly spelled out for you, in what feels less like fiction and more like low-tier political propaganda. The dissonance between the ""importance"" of the plot and the little influence you have as a character is never resolved, all wrapped up by a pretentious, cliched non-ending for a story that never went anywhere or said anything as important as the game takes itself to be.The main protagonist seems less like a character and more like a megaphone for the developers to spout their views from, having little to no agency in the plot besides pointless busywork, which the developers would like you to think are important choices. A ridiculous concept considering there's a literal war happening outside the walls of the room you're locked in. The themes are constructed with zero respect for the historical context of the events, culture, symbols and conflicts referenced, with no nuances or decision given to the player of what to think or interpret. It's narrative hand-holding pretending to be educational.The gameplay itself, which scraps the bottom of what could be considered a videogame to begin with, is an example of what Tale of Tales considers to be ""experimental game design"": that is, to remove those essential elements from which videogames are constructed, rather than reconsider or expand on them, leaving a game that seems built as the equivalent of removing the wheels and motor of a car and pretending this is ""an advancement in automobile technology.""It runs horrible in most computers, and seems completely buggy: the first time I ran it, the 'activities' didn't load into the game's engine, leaving a barren level with nothing in there to do, making me think that I was actually playing the game wrong. An hour later, I realized that it was the game being shoddily made. The solution to the bug? Run the game again and hope that it works the next time. And that's on top of the ridiculously bad performance and cheap ""Photoshop for Dummies"" GUI.And even when I could ""play the game"", I discovered that the game's 'activities' were nothing but button prompts, followed by title cards informing me that I had done the activity, which puts this game below the definition of an actual simulator, into what can only be considered to be a text adventure with a low-effort level rendered on top. THIS GAME IS JUST NOT FUN. There's no progression, nothing to learn, no skills to apply, no puzzles to solve, and even ignoring the gameplay, it's also not fun on a narrative level. There's just nothing compelling going on here.So, considering the game's text is incompetent, the gameplay cheap and pointless, and that the title might not even work when you run it, I think Sunset can only be regarded as trash not worth any asking price, and an insult to the craft of videogame making AND gaming audiences everywhere.

The instant left clicks could have been replaced with smaller minigames and this would have been a much better experience.Of my 4.8 hours, 3.6 were afking for cards and the other 1.2 were me actually playing.

												Really strong premise, and a bold subject, but sadly the mechanics really seem to fall short of what the game seems to be trying to do. There simply isn't enough to do in the game. You find the objects that you can click on in the apartment, and decide to do A or B, with the knowledge that you will A: increase romance, or B: increase neutrality. For a game trying to handle political upheval and socioeconomic injustices between classes and nations, this really isn't enough. There's a little to explore in the environment to drive the narrative deeper, there are a few events that occur, but overall it just comes off empty. If the goal was to create a sense of absraction from the outside world, an isolation from real life in a penhouse stronghold, then the monologuing from the player character throws it off, being too rightous and full of revolutionary potential. And the romance throws this whole potential narrative out of whack. If the goal was to show the potential for one person to make a difference, for the individual lives of disperate groups to intertwine, then the lack of gameplay choices really suffocates this narrative. And the monologuing again has a tendency to not fit, throwing revolutionary ideals around while you post cutesy notes around. It's a powerful game for about half an hour, or until the first instance of violence happens. After that, it's pretty lame.			"

												This game has lots of very interesting and unique ideas that completely fail to come together. I love the idea of a Gone Home-style game where you learn about a character's personality through their living space, and making the protaganist a housekeeper provides a great justification for this and adds the potential for a bit more gameplay that what walking simulators normally have. The idea of watching a major revolution as a complete outsider who wants nothing to do with either side is also very interesting. Unfortunately, this game plays and runs terribly and fails to deliver a great story. Every day you have one ""hour"" to clean Ortega's apartment and do whatever tasks he has set out for you. You can do most tasks in two different ways, and choosing one will influence your relationship with Ortega. Instead of letting you choose between the two items on the same screen, you can only see one option at a time and will often have to awkwardly walk around whatever object you're trying to interact with to find the correct angle to trigger whichever option you want. When you do manage to succesfully interact with something, you are rewarded by the screen fading out and a seemingly somewhat arbitrary amount of in-game time passing. This process gets boring quickly, especially in later days when Ortega gives you fewer new tasks. It's also important to note that the game runs inexcuseably badly even though it has very simplistic (albeit pretty) graphics.I also did not get invested in the characters and larger plot of the game. One of the biggest issues is that you are supposed to learn about your character through her journaling, but journaling is only triggered when you sit down, and then you have to watch her journal painfully slowly as that day's hour slips away. It's frequently literally impossible to complete all the day's tasks and also get the full journal entry. Your interactions with Ortega often feel very flat and limited and you are never really given much of a reason to care about the revolution.This game takes lot of fantastic ideas and handles them all terribly. It's very disappointing and incredibly overpriced.			"

The game itself is repetitive and dull and the presentation of the plot falls flat. I went into this expecting story, but the presentation and lack of exploration and/or gameplay really sank it for me.The idea of your actions affecting the storyline is interesting, and that concept does present some interesting persistent elements in the game, but overall it ends up feeling like an unfinished or poorly-executed mechanic (e.g. turning lights on to make the apartment feel more inviting ends up being a very boring farming-type process).I think the concept is excellent and the plot is intriguing, but there's not enough going in terms of gameplay and overall execution to make it worth the purchase.

'Choice' games really need to feel you are following a story of a character you care about.

THIS GAME SCORES [*0* | 1 | 2] = ~17% (0%-33%)Since I couldn't really play it, I can't say if it would be 1of4 or 2of4, so I'll just give it a 1of3.Got this at 90% off (->2€) but still refunded it. Reason: Broken interface. (Most of the 31 minutes game time were spent changing options and contacting the devs via their website.)Maybe (or maybe not) Sunset is a great creation on some level, but the devs failed the interface too damn hard for me to ever find out. Therefore, I rather don't force myself through this and choose to ""send them a message"".BROKEN MOUSE CONTROLMouse speed depends on frame rate (so, even depends on where you look). If you look up and pull the mouse down quickly, you end up looking straight ahead, but if you do it slowly, you end up at the bottom, so this is absolutely not a mouse acceleration issue. (Even if so, whose fault would that be.)Something is just really really broken with the mouse controls. The horz/vert mouse speed options are effective, but the speed is much too inconsistent, so it's not remotely a working fix.Another problem: In the optional very cool 2.5D mode which prevents converging vertical lines (Photographers know what I mean.) which I would really like to use, the vertical mouse speed is always at max while you stand still, but is at whatever you set it to while you walk around. Bro-ken!The game otherwise looks very good, has FOV slider with wide range, etc. - one would think that all is well, but the mouse control is primary, it's what connects me to (or keeps me away from) a 3D 1st person game world, and it's just to damn broken in this case.That's why I suggest to stay the hell away from this game.

You play as the worlds laziest maid who is given a few tasks such as cleaning the windows and arranging flowers (something that should just take minutes) and spends hours justifying her more then generous paycheck with her her halfassed cleaning attemps all the while bittching about how she is an independent women trying to be an engineer and treating the world like it placed HER in cleaning dutys and also being stuck in a city sieged by war (wich you will never see). During the days you have the choice of chosing Clean halfassed for more then needed time and sorta halfassed cleaning for even more time, then if given enough time  you didnt waste cleaning the floors you can pay a visit to ghost chair wich will make you hillucinate over pretintious journal entries and also respond to your employers sexual harassment via sticky notes with sarcasm or cold blooded put downs.

Nobody wants to buy a game where you clean the floor, we have reality for that, we play games to escape from our real lives and do things we can't do normally. Go on big epic adventures. Enjoy a well crafted story. Or just experiment with the mechanics. It's supposed to be about fantasy, and entertainment. Why was it surprising to them that nobody liked this? Then the developer berated the community and said we didn't want to buy your game because we were all horrible people. This is so bad. I played this for 15 minutes, I'll probably never play it again. You just sit around cleaning the house, then you go to the next level and clean the house again. I'm supposed to empathise with this character, but you made a gross miscalculation. I don't.

Sunset is an interesting walking simulator indie adventure with charming graphics and an interesting story.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are Angela Burnes, a housekeeper. You are trapped in a beautiful city that was turned into a warzone. Every week, you have to clean some rich man's house. You have certain tasks to do, but the main thing is to discover other things in his house which lead to a surprising story.Pros: Concept of the Game | The thing I like the most about this game is its ... interestingness. Yes, this is a word. At the beginning of this review, you can see that this game is a walking simulator. Ergo, this game is not for everybody. I understand the disappointment of some people, but this game requires your absolute attention and taking your time to play. And this is what I appreciate it for. Visuals | So, this game looks really nice. I admit, the colours may seem a bit unusual, but you'll get used quickly to the feeling that the surroundings give you. The Sounds | NOTE: I'm not talking about the soundtrack | The sounds are pretty good in my opinion, however, this game doesn't really have a constant soundtrack (see cons). I like how you can actually hear footsteps and there are also some outside noises. Achievements | There are a hundred achievements and they all reward you for paying close attention to the game. Just by doing regular task as you're supposed to, you're not gonna get many. It's a nice way to make a player play the game! It seems bugged in some cases, though, I didn't even realise there are achievements in the first playthrough but after clearing my data, the achievements were working again. I might be alone in this as none of my friends I asked were having the same issues. Amount of Available Gameplay | The shortest time you can spend to complete the game is supposedly an hour and a half, but if you are willing to spend time on it, you can get hours and hours more. A similar system was used in Life is Strange, which you could beat in 12 hours or 20, if you took your time. OS and Steam Integration | Sunset includes MacOS and SteamOS support and gives you Achievements and Trading cards for playing.Cons: Steam Controller Support | I had bad issues trying to play with my recently acquired Steam Controller. The touchpad sensitivity is pretty much nil and I had to swipe multiple times to turn around for a really small angle. The sensitivity slider in the options menu barely helped. I just played with my keyboard and enjoyed the game, probably more than I would with a controller. The Soundtrack | Although I like the sound effect quite a lot, I am disappointed in the lack of a proper soundtrack. A calm loop song would fit into the game really nicely and I would spend much more time in this game. I mean, there are a few songs here and there, but it's not always present. Also, there is an OST DLC available for 4$. What does it include? No idea. Pricing | 20$? How about no? As much as I enjoyed this game, it's not worth that much money. 20$ is a fair price for Rocket League or CS:GO, but this games just lacks in content to justify that price. I'm not even sure in 10$. Sorry.The final verdict:A nice, yet heavily overpriced walking simulator. I really enjoyed playing it and I could probably even get a few more hours of gameplay out of it. It gets slightly repetitive over time, but I mostly liked Sunset for the experience and the feeling. This being said, Sunset is not a game for everybody. If you like slow-paced walking simulator adventures, this might be for you. If you don't, go check out some other games.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												Another pretentious walking simulator? Yes! This is one I liked.I couldn't tell you exactly why - maybe it was the unique experience of being a black maid cleaning some rich guy's place during a revolution - but I found it oddly compelling, at least enough to want to see the story through to the end.The artwork was certainly different, and the apartment design was very mod-70s. I guess that appealed to me too - you don't see that sort of thing very often. The serious pretentiousness in the story (and everything that surrounds it) is sky high. Not sure why it clicked with me, but it did.Without a doubt, this game will be an acquired taste. Performance is not great - luckily it doesn't need to be. That said, I was playing on an i7 4790 4GHz with an Nvidia GT 960, so...weaker rigs could conceivably find it unbearable - dunno. "

												This is not a game for everyone. I love walking sim, story rich, choice-based games (this game, exactly) so when I heard this game was in development back in 2014 I waited eagerly for over a year. I was not disapointed.I think this game is beautiful, for one thing. I was taking screenshots like they were going out of fashion. The story is also compelling and I loved hearing it from Angela's perspective. The orange and blue options were simple but they worked: they made me think before doing (which could have easily made the housework repetative). I thought that sometimes the journal entries were long and dull, I sometimes only listened to a few lines if the content was irrelevent to the current situation (often during a certain part mid-game where there were no lists and NO BREAKS FROM THE JOURNAL). But the writing was beautiful and it was important they touched on Angela's childhood and life as an African American woman.So yeah, I'm giving this the thumbs up. But make sure this is your kind of thing.  "

												Sunset has a few gameplay issues (yes, sometimes Angela doesn't always go exactly where you want her to, yes, there's very little indication of what you're supposed to do at the beginning...there's probably a lot of nitpicking to do) but it makes a perfect use of the music, the -thoroughly researched- aesthetic and the general atmosphere of 70's Latin America to create a lasting experience. I don't believe this game has a message (it lets us peek into Angela's mind, who has a lot of opinions, as a well-rounded character should, but doesn't try to force them on the player) but rather that it tries to create a place for the player to reflect - on war, art, love. The strength of the narrative is not the journal excerpts, as interesting as they might be; it is the fact that every detail of the gameplay and the surroundings has been designed to help carry it forward. In that sense, it is much more of a ""real game"" than those who have to beat you over the head with what they're trying to say.It's certainly possible to be unmoved by Sunset - it is a peculiar game. Personally speaking, I think the strongest game experience I ever had was watching San Bavon slowly burning because of me while letting a requiem fill the air of the penthouse.			"

												It's hard to say it's a good game, hard to say it's bad, most definitely it is unique. I have enjoyed previous ToT games more and I knew Sunset will be a tough one. Sunset is driven by amazing narration, that made me feel emotions towards absent Gabriel and imposed a strange connection with the penthouse. But I also felt that at some point this excellent narration just broke it's legs and I wasn't interested anymore. Postomodern discourse was compelling, but was it enough to fill the blank spaces? The same with the apartement - beautiful, but slayed by the bad optimalisation and frame rate drops. On the brighter side, I sympathize strongly with Angela, one can rarely find this inteligent character in video games. Nevertheless, I liked the experience and I plan to read some of the books left by Ortega. Sunset raises some important questions on art, equality, relations between society and government and standard of living - and I hope for that reason it will be remembered,			"

												This game is one of the worst walking simulator I played. The 'walking simulator' genre is one of my favourite (actually maybe my favourite) and I play most of them. I had heard from some friends that this game was no masterpiece, but when I saw it in a bundle for 1$ I decided I would take the risk.Well, the game first of all runs horribly. Given that the graphics are far from beautiful, the performance has no reason to be this low.Other than that, the game mechanics are quite boring. In a 'walking simulator' the atmosphere is what counts, you have to be involved somehow in the story, in the environment. It is a 'walking simulator' (not meant negatively, for lack of a better word) so there is no action, there is nothing to shoot at, and of course if you don't deliver a thick atmosphere and great voice acting or good lore, you are not offering much to the players.The 'plot' is barely there and the whole apartment / city / civil war thing, which could have been a great basis for a good involvement in the atmosphere/environment doesn't deliver. You don't feel it, and the little lore you can get about the protagonist's life by sitting on a chair and letting her writing her diary is naive, simplistic.Honestly I didn't find anything good in the game. The house (apartment?) itself is very badly designed, the proportions are weird, of course it's meant to be a big modernist expensive house with lots of big rooms, but the result is that it looks incredibly empty and out of proportions compared to the character. If you do more or less everything, the game will last around 5 or 6 hours. If you can resist that long and don't get bored after the first hour. Definitely in my worst 5 in the genre.			"

Sunset is a game that will either bore you, or move you deeply. Personally, it has become one of my favourite games, thanks to the subtlety and beauty it displays. Sunset encapsulates one year of the life of Angela Burnes, an educated and ingenious African-American woman who emigrated from the US to the imaginary South American country of Anchuria in hopes of finding another, different if not better, life, and got trapped in a civil war. She now has has to work as a housekeeper in the apartment of Gabriel Ortega, a rich citizen and lover of the arts. For the player, this translates as having to accomplish some mundane tasks, such as dusting statues or setting the table for dinner. However, it is barely the focus of the game, which is based upon a narrative that can be accessed through Angela's thoughts (namely the diary she keeps, her reflexions in the elevator and her remarks when she interacts with some objects in the apartment).Coming to know, little by little, who our protagonist is, what her thoughts are, is a beautiful experience, and it can be magnified by the relationship the player chooses to make her have with Ortega: while some may argue that a romantic relationship issuing from written notes between two people who never meet each other is a stretch, I reckon the game makes it work. And if the player doesn't want to go in that direction, a more neutral, friendship-based approach is possible. The political intrigue also adds a layer of oppression in the atmosphere of the game and plays an important part in understanding Angela's story. As the action is set in a context of civil war, violence always lingers in the background, visible to us only through the pillars of smoke that can be seen from the windows and the oppressive whirring of helicopters.The art itself is absolutely gorgeous. While Angela's gestures can be a little contorted, the apartment itself is a joy to the eyes, and art lovers can entertain themselves by finding the multiple references to various painters or sculptors that are visible through Ortega's possessions (Braque, Calder, Mondrian, to name a few). The lighting and shading changes constantly over the hour that Angela spends in the flat and sets a breathtaking ambiance. The writing of Angela's diary is good, and the plot unfolds slowly, but surely, leading to an ending that I personally found pleasant and quite unexpected.The world building is also impressive: we can see that the developers took time to research South American history (there is a strong parallel with the 70s in Chile) and culture, and enjoyed revisiting decades of design and architecture. The soundtrack, composed by Austin Wintory with numerous collaborations from fans that helped raise funds in the Kickstarter, is diverse and ranks from jazz to traditional folk songs, and even includes an entire requiem by an imaginary Anchurian composer that is inspired by Bach's work. From my point of view, it really did play a key role in creating this peculiar, enthralling atmosphere.I didn't experience many technical problems, only a few glitches when Angela has to choose between warm and neutral actions, and some difficulties with the Steam overlay. Unfortunately, I doubt Tale of Tales will release a patch to correct these malfunctions since they are now working on other projects than video games.Overall, I wouldn't recommend Sunset if you don't like games that take their time and are very character-driven. On the other hand, if you enjoy admiring art and subtle characterization, then I would advise you to let yourself sink in the atmosphere of this admirable game. It is worth it.			"

												Sunset is a beautiful game that I can only accurately describe as unique and singular in its experience. It has its issues, but it's a good game, especially on sale. Keep in mind, it's basically a walking simulator, so it isn't for everyone. Essentially, you play a young woman who is hired to clean a man's apartment for one hour each week while he is not there. You have a list each day of what chores to do, which you can choose to fulfill or not. You can also explore the space, examining objects, playing records, unlocking diary entries, and doing other tasks that can affect how the story unfolds. As each day progresses, you are engrossed in a story about the corrupt government of Anchuria and the struggle of the rebel forces to overthrow it. Strangely enough, your choices will influence your involvement with the rebels and decide how the story plays out (supposedly - I've only played through it once, so I haven't tested other choices).PROs:+ voice acting: Angela has a warm voice that can add such depth to the simplest of dialog. Great talent here.+ visual style: the retro colors and modern architecture make the space very surreal+ story: a young woman's role in possibly overthrowing the government of a wartorn country, all determined by what she does for her faceless employer? Sounds weird, but I'm into it.+ achievements: you can get a number of achivements in how you approach the relationship with Gabriel and what tasks you do (or don't do) around the house+ atmosphere: sounds and visuals go very well together, as well as optional information you can find by examining book covers, sitting in the covered chair to access diary entries, etc. Playing records while explosions rock the city is also oddly charming.+ drama: the events unfolding around you and the surrounding city makes for a tense, exciting atmosphere despite your confines to the apartmentCONs:- performance: I have a gaming laptop and there were still framerate issues on lower quality settings, which was somewhat frustrating.- clarity: the tasks you are given for each day are sometimes vague to the point it's unclear how to carry them out. (ie. ""organize papers"". What papers and in which room?) You'll likely waste a good amount of time trying to find out how to do the tasks rather than exploring.- shallow decisions: while you do get to choose how you do your chores, as well as what all you do, the results seem to be very subtle, which isn't necessarily a good thing.- gameplay mechanics: having only an in-game hour to accomplish everything AND explore is near impossible at times, especially when faced with the confusion of how to do everything on the task list. Navigation is also a pain, as I kept having to find my way around invisible barriers that made moving around a real nuisance.- price: with the technical issues present, I wouldn't say this game warrants more than $10, maybe $15.All in all, it's up to you whether you get this game or not. I got it on sale for $5 on the Humble Bundle store, and I enjoy it thoroughly. It has its shortcomings, but if you want a unique experience, this would be a good game to get on sale.			"

												A really immersive, touching and atmospheric little game. The gameplay is all about subtelty and exploring the environment, very much ""show not tell"" for a lot of the narrative. Of course, if that's not your thing, you won't like it; maybe that's why there are so many (undeserved, in my opinion) negative reviews?The game starts deceptively simple - you make your way to a high-ranking official's flat every afternoon, and have to complete a to-do list around house chores. Thing is, after a few days, you start noticing that you can complete the tasks in a couple of different ways every time, and that by exploring and looking at the right things you can start building a slow relationship with the flat owner. Your choices *will* affect the game, sometimes in unpredictable ways, and it's fascinating to see the characters develop through the choices they make. The story is also highly personal and although the every day actions are pretty trivial, there's a real sense of sadness, anger or even danger at various key points. That was a really nice surprise.Graphics-wise the game has a very 1970s feel and palette obviously, again maybe not to everyone's taste (I personally really hate everything 70s!), but really well designed and elegant. It also makes a lot of cultural references to 20th century art/literature/music, which is quite interesting. It ran perfectly on my 2yo mid-range gaming PC, so no issues there. Controls were very simple, could have done with a little more explanation (for the alternate choices for example), but definitely not a deal-breaker.Tl;dr: try it, and like me you may get a really nice surprise. :-)			"

												Sunset is difficult to describe, it's about many things, but none of them are in your face. You play as a housekeeper of a man you've never met face to face, and can choose whether to do your chores with warmth or coldness. If you choose to do them at all. And along the way you learn about things, write in your diary, and make a little space for yourself in a stranger's home, in a country you'd just moved to.The only downside is that it can feel a bit 'heavy' to run because of the game engine.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Sunset is a game developed and published by Tale of TalesI really wish I could praise this game but the premise seemed very interesting, and the story has a lot going for it in terms of premise but in terms of execution, it falls flatThe game itself is extremely repetitive and dull and the presentation of the plot falls flat. I went into this expecting story, but the presentation and lack of exploration and/or gameplay really sank it for meThe idea of your actions affecting the storyline is interesting, and that concept does present some interesting persistent elements in the game, but overall it ends up feeling like an unfinished or poorly-executed mechanicI think the concept is excellent and the plot is intriguing, but there's not enough going in terms of gameplay and overall execution, think twice before purchasing Sunset...

												In regards to negative reviews. This is not a game for everyone, it may take that you have some interest in 1960s/1970s history, politics, aesthethics and that you get the references that are made during and in the game. It may also run a bit slow on certain computers but don't let that stop you. If you give the game time and take a break looking at its beautifully made environment and interesting characters it will reward you very well.I was hyped for this game way before its release and it did not disappoint me, other than my computer ran it a bit slow but I've (re)played it quite a lot and I love it to bits. Extra plus for the awesome backgrounds, badges, cards and emoticons that you get as well.Very much not your traditional point and click, but one of the best games I've played, ever.			"

												I enjoyed it; I think you probably have to like either walking simulators or dating games to enjoy it, but I like both.  It's sort of an anomoly as both a walking sim and dating game.  As a walking sim, the space you move around is pretty restrictive, and as a dating game, your choices are just yes/no and the game is pretty clear about which direction you're pushing things.  Not sure why leaving all the lights on is super-romantic, though.  The apartment you walk around is pretty nice and the use of lighting is really good.  I recommend it if you like walking sims in a nice/evocative enivronment with sort of a dating game thrown in on the side.			"

This game is a beautiful story of two people who fall in love despite never meeting face to face. Or not, because you can make decisions that influence the story.

												This game was a wonderful experience.  Honestly, I could spend an afternoon just turning on the music and wandering around the apartment by myself.  I loved the feeling that there was a world going on outside, although I wished they'd done a little more to hide the sparseness of what was created outside of the apartment—just make it so I can't look down and see there are no streets! :)  But the sounds make up for it.  The story progression provided by subtle changes throughout the apartment is great.			"

												This game quickly became one of m favorites as I played it for the fiers ttime. I understand why it may not have been everyone's cup of tea. The developers took several risks, not the lesat of which is choosing a protagonist with whom many gamers may not readily identify, and making hers the only character players see and hear from during the game. Then there is the setting of the game. While the story takes place in the capitol city of a country in the midst of a military coup, the game takes place in one apartment which, though in the city, seems far removed from the drama and danger of the fight between the military coup and the rebellion. The explosions and gunfire are seen and heard through the windows of the apartment. Only rarely does the external politcal struggle and guerilla warfar invade the aparment, and then the player, though the protagonist, onlly sees and experiences the aftermath. Iin fact, the two main characters -- the protagonist and the owner of hte penthouse she his hired to clean once a week, just for one hour before sunset -- aren't even major players in the political intrigue and warfare. Of the two, the protagonist is the farthest remoived from the action. Her involvement is limited to choices that influence of assist her employer and/or her brother -- who is a leader of the rebellion, and the other unseen and virtually unheard major player in the rebellion.The developers set themselves up with several significant challenges, which forced them to make choices that would have the effect of severly limiting the games audiende, but managed to produce a compelling game that still haunts me after playing it through just once. Initially, the protagonist seems almost to enigmatic to engage players, but her voice grows stronger and her character clearer as the game progresses, influenced by the player's choices, much as the story line itself. The developers risked the game being monotonous by essentially limiting the story to once character's view and voice, and then only in one place. Gameplay is essentially a series of apartment visits, punctuated by tasks that are by their nature mundane, even when they influence the direction of the story. The only changes are the external state of the city and the fighting, and the internal state of the relationship between the protagonist and her employer. Those changes are reflected in changes to the apartment that are mostly subtle from one visit to the next, and only become more dramatic as the story draws to its end. While its ending drags a bit (at least the one ending I played), the story is made no less compelling for all its subtlety. Perhaps this games fails to satisfy some because it straddles the line between classic game and interactive fiction. The apparent focus on the latter may have led to game mechanics that frustrated some players The developers certainly took a risks that would limit its appeal. But where Sunset succesdes it does so preciselly because of those risks.			"

												When you reach the end of the game it is really beautiful to see how far video games have come.  I feel like this game would have been perfect for 2002 when we were insecure about video games being a high art form.  Art is all about timing and today we just don't need a video game that is so dedicated to art that isn't traditionally fun.  Video games as art is working out just fine.  Games like The Last Of Us are combining art with reliably fun concepts.  We can have fun, beauty, depth.  We don't have to choose between the three anymore.  I really feel for the developers who rage quit when the game was critically panned.  A lot of people didn't really play the game and judged it too quickly as soon as they clicked on a chore.  It actually turns out there is fun to be had by establishing a routine for the main character and disrupting it by having a war happen all around you.  There is fun to be had through the immersion.  People didn't always give this game a fair chance and I apologize for them.I must admit the major flaw of the game comes up immediately.  The narration.  It's kind of like the mostly unnecessary narration in Grey's Anatomy.  The way Sunset is designed the story has to be told to the player.  The actress just wasn't able to put on a convincing performance.  I found myself enjoying the immersion instead of the narration.  Great acting could have gone a long way in this game.  Recommended.  See for yourself how far games have come.  Admire how much effort was put into a concept that is no longer workable.			"

												I enjoyed this game. I really liked the premise of watching the world from your hour of time to clean a man's apartment. I also liked how your actions could affect your relationship with him, even though you don't meet him at all.I did find it strange that turning a faucet on or off would affect the relationship one one or another (one way for on and one way for off), but everything else I understood. It was really difficult to find the tasks you were supposed to do sometimes, so I suggest looking at everything thoroughly every day, no matter what the tasks are. While a bit overly dramatic at times, this game was a quick play through and I did enjoy it.			"

												This was more of an interactive artistic experience, rather than a traditional game. If you're expecting typical gameplay, this isn't it. Mechanics are simple, you work as a housekeeper, each day your time is limited to one hour. You can do your work, or not, I thought it was interesting that you had to balance what your character had to do for work, and what ""you"" as the player wanted to do - in this case, find out more about the story through diary entries. These entries only appear when you sit in a specific chair, and time progresses faster when you are sitting down.It definetly has a slow burn to it, but I thought that the character's performance was excellent. I also absolutely LOVED the music, as it is written and composed by Austin Wintory (I've you've played Journey, you'll know how beautiful it is.)I played this on a Mac, I'm not sure if it may just be my set up (it more than met minimum requirements) but the game ran horribly, even on low settings. I haven't tested it on a windows computer.			"

												This is an intelligent, tension building game. The colors and atmosphere were amazing. The voice acting was skillful. There is no direct death/killing (bonus for me), but it did have several moral quandries around causing death to others (double bonus as I enjoy moral quandries.) I loved the little details and might play through again for the side things I didn't discover until far into the game.On the down side, I'm not really sure what happened at the end. The credits rolled and I kinda went 'What?!"" I wonder if it will become more clear on subsequent playthroughs.			"

												Sunset is a very... interesting game, to say the least. You play as Angela, a young woman who has apparently moved from her home to (what I think is) a fictitious Southern America country. The game is set in the early 70s and, as Angela, you are tasked with... doing chores?! Yeah. Seriously. You'll spend the first parts of the game just doing chores for this man that you work for. As you do the items listed on the scrap of paper, you can also find different things to do outside of the list. The objective seems to be, ""Do the items on the list while the story slowly unfolds.""The game looks interesting, in terms of its design. It looks really nice and has a great feel for the era, if not a bit artsy - in a good way, though. There's also some music that you can play (if that room is available) that's actually pretty nice to listen to. Unfortunately, it's not often that a record player will be available to use, which is a bummer - because there is no background music to listen to. The game begins to feel ""alive"" around July 22nd, when things start to pick up. This is where I'm currently at, but I decided to stop and jot down some initial thoughts. I'll probably update this again once I get further and, eventually, complete the game.Initial thoughts:- Game feels real smooth- Original setting- The colors are very ""vibrant"" for the time/setting. It really feels like you're in the era.- Game is very quiet. Feels perfect, but also makes you wish there was more music lying around the apartment to play.It's not a Telltales-esque game; rather, it feels more like in the same circle as Dear Esther or The Moon Sliver. Very story-driven, not much action or much to do (early on, anyways).As of right now, I'd be very cautious about purchasing this game. If you're a huge fan of games in this genre, then yeah - it's right up your alley & I think its setting and story-telling will be just as compelling as others. However, if this isn't your style and you may be interested in getting into this type of genre, I'd look for a cheaper game first, to get a feel for how these games flow. Spending $20 USD may be hard to swallow for some people who prefer more to do & finding disappointment here.			"

												There are maybe some kind of ""mini-spoiler"" in my review, but i think it doesen't matter. I don't think that there is the right and only solution in the game so my choises are very unimportent for the gameplay.At first. I really liked the game. I can't explain it, Sunset is.. not a usual game. its different. It works with a kind of soft skills. there is no hectic, no kind of action in this game and the mechanic is quite simple, right. but it makes me think. i finished the game 2 days before and i still remeber situations. yesterday i started it again. its a mix. on the one side you get in touch with the military szene outside the window. with all the danger, the bombs and war. Angela is woried about her brother who is a kind of rebell. on the other side you comunicate with mr. ortega. i get warm with him. than comes the situation, where i should decides what to do. should i do something what might brings mr. ortega in danger? is that really a thing i could decide?I am very happy, that i bought the game. this is my first review and i only write it because there are quite many bad ones. Sunset is not a game for anybody. the theme is special. but i must say, normely i hated war-szenarios. i'm more a kind of happy-ever-after-type. But for a person like me it is a nice confrontation with this theme. i startet to identify with angela. and i was a little bit upset, when i finished the game. it is like reading a book and make some desisions for the protagonist. it gave me a good feeling. and that is enough for me. :)oh, i played the game in english with german subtitles, and it worked very well.

												Worst cleaning sim ever! (But my favorite story driven point and click)This is a point and click with a deep story (and no stupid ""find these 12 objects"" mini games) that takes roughly 4-6 hours to play through. A fictitious South American country set in the 1970s is in the beginning stages of a revolution. A well educated maid never meets the powerful man whose apartment she cleans, but she gets to know him through his activities, notes, and belongings. She subtley changes his mind about the current events, and helps change the future of her country.I'm playing my second play through now. :)			"

												Beautiful, poignant, and introspective.  If you liked Gone Home, or Dear Esther, I strongly recommend Sunset.  The game's story is told from a unique perspective, one most usually dismiss or deride.  This is not a power fantasy.  It's about one person doing the best she can in a difficult situation.  She has little power or agency, yet the ways in which you are able to influence the world still feels satisfying.One last note, make sure you try to end the day with finding the white-draped chair and sitting in it. You'll get snippets of Angela's journal. I didn't discover this until halfway through, and I'm looking forward to playing through again to try and read all the journals.			"

												Sunset is a very powerful interactive experience!  It's rare that I'm moved by a narrative anymore, but this game is one that has really made me feel a lot of things, and will stick with me for a long time.I do need to point out that even on a fairly powerful machine, the performance of this game was pretty bad at times.  Thankfully the pace is slow enough it really didn't detract from the experience, but clearly the developer could do a lot more optimization for future updates/games.  I susupect these issues came from doing dynamic lighting in Unity 4.x, where as Unity 5.x handles these things so much better now.  Also, strangely the graphics vary from sometimes looking gorgeous and stylized to other times looking muzzy and washed out.  But stick with the game... it's totally worth playing even with these technical issues.			"

												I'm sorry for everyone who gives this game a quick negative review about being a Gone Home clone, walking simulator or simply for doing tasks.None of it is true.But I do understand how this game is not for everyone, it's an experience you have to be willing to fully dive into. It's an emotional adventure for eyes, ears and mind.Too bad it suffers the fate of many epic female protagonist games, that it gets easily despised by mainstream gamers.The story is great, the character interaction (yes, you can absolutely call it like that) is beautiful, there's replay value, you can just sit around, do nothing and listen to the music for half an hour and it wouldn't be wasted.This game is a gift.

												Having recently read about Chile, Allente and Pinochet -events that in my opinion are clearly referenced throughout the story- I found this game very moving. But then again revolutions always move me.I loved the art, and the references to known works of art in combination with the political discussions and the discussions and comments about socioeconomic disparities that tie in with art, the collection of art and it's appreciation. I loved Angela, who at times reminded me of course of Angela Davis, and the complexity of her thoughts and emotions. This game made me think and feel, and this is the most that I can ask from a piece of art.If you liked Gone Home, you will most likely love this. If you've played other Tale of Tales games and enjoyed them, you will probably enjoy this one too. It doesn't take long to see if this is your cup of tea or not. Play an hour of this, or watch the first 30 minutes of a walkthrough and it'll be easy to see if this game is for you. Many people didn't like it, the fist 10 or so most helpful reviews here on Steam are negative, which is why I felt the need to write my thoughts and give it a thumbs up.Tale of Tales has come a long way since The Path. They finally found the best recipe for a balanced interactive experience. This is trully an art game. It saddens me that the commercial failure of Sunset brought the studio to its knees and almost to its end. I don't always love Tale of Tales games, but I appreciate that they exist and create new things that no other studio does. I think videogames as a medium and in order to progress, NEED minds like Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn to imagine them in new, unconventional ways. It's because of this need that their games have influenced many people, even if they never had a commercial success of their own.It makes me feel hopeless that ToT, a studio we need, might close because their best game, and a really good one at that, didn't sell enough. Sunset achieves everything it sets out to do. Whether you enjoy this is up to your personal preferences, but it is excellent in its construction (even if the controlls when chosing between the orange and blue options are a bit wonky).			"

												Sunset is about love, war and all the emotions in between that one could feel during those kinds of times. Set in a turbulent country you play Angela a foxy house maid who is curious about her employer. Gaberial Ortega. You will clean the house and accomplish menial tasks but more then that, possibly influence a country's fate.  The game is set during the 70's and captures the feeling and design of the times perfectly. From over the top wallpaper to Angela's bell bottomed pants. The house is designed beautifully with detail in just about every nook and cranny. You become intimately familiar with this setting. When things change you know it. This is how the game mostly progresses. Small changes and small interactions over a long period of time. Giving you only one hour to explore the apartment and make or change the future. While this works for the first two acts of the game and fits the story up to that point. This losses its purpose and meaning when you reach the final acts. It becomes silly for Angela to leave and nonsensical. Also for her to be locked out of rooms. The story also tends to drag itself out a bit. Making some days feel like bread crumbs of character development or the story. Mind you this represents the passage of time. Which sometimes can be boring, however Sunset forgets its a game still. I felt some of the fat could've been cut off and still been a great story. The game itself suffers from some graphical issues and frame rate drops. This can be patched out.Musically the game is stunning. Although the amazing soundtrack that was composed is somewhat lacking in the first two acts of the game. Making the game feel very quiet. However despite this, Sunset is a beautiful game with a deep message. You just have to be patient to get that message.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

The 70's setting is refreshing and ToT did a hell of a job on bringing it to life (In an empty apartment, mind you!). The story is well executed, though I wished the diary entries had voiceover, too.

												A beautiful game that will put you in the main character's skin more tangibly than most games i've played. Beautiful story, original mechanics (being a housekeeper/bystander during a revolution) and interesting message.The game really shines in its atmosphere. You'll arrive each day before sunset to clean the apartment and the apartment would naturally evolve, like any apartment after a week. You'll grow to really love that apartment. Know its rooms, its nooks and crannies. You'll get to know your employer and his habits, his interests and concerns. The story will really begin when he'll leave you your first note thanking you for your hard work. You spent most of the game alone in that apartment eager to read his notes to find out what he wants to tell you or what he was thinking. I admit, the social justice themes get old after a few hours into the game. Yeah, war is bad, we get it, but it gets really stale. Luckily, you can avoid all that by avoiding writing the diary. I think the criticism this game has been getting is unfair - the game is quite good.The story is disjointed at times though... some things don't make any sense and will leave your head scratching. Clearly written by amateurs. Nonetheless, it's a better story than a close equivalent Gone Home for example.Overall, it's definitely worth it if you're looking for a different game like Gone Home and are interested in some social justice/anti war monologues.

												There are brief moments of clarity, insight, and humanity in this that mark the experience as worthwhile. The game is smart (as in, smartly written, and almost spare in its approach to interaction) but it doesn't bludgeon you around the head with its erudition (I'm looking at you, Talos Principle...)There are very clear nods to ideas and discussions that someone with an elaborately useless fine arts / humanties background would appreciate. And there are games that are played with the interface and the ideas of video-game conventions - the checklist, the arbitrary timer, the old modus of hunt-click-interact that we've been trained on since we were tiny little half-formed gamesters flinging cursors around the pocket-pixels of old Lucas-Arts adventures. But it never rubs your face in it. There's a set of simple tasks, and then those that are hidden - implied. Big questions, that might not gel with your own politics. Hey - what of it? Play through the character. Try to get inside her head - work through this little fragmentary window - filtered through genre conventions and cliche and bias...If we only watched the films that made us comfortable - if we only read literature we agreed with - we'd be lesser for it. Same for games. This is a worthwhile game. This is... interesting... despite its flaws. And it's... engrossing. It took about four hours of my evening without my even realising - just flicking through - day to day. "

												Firstly, this review is independent of any opinons I have of the developers and their opinions.I feel like this game is somewhat under appreciated. It's a game that you have to value and appreciate for its mood, story, and the methods in which they tell this story. I'm not the type to be into games that are overly preachy, which this game's dialog can be a little more of, but I found the way in which you unveil the story to be a lot of fun. Every day you're given a set of chores that you can do in different manners: warmly or coldly. The choices you make affect how your employer, Ortega, feels about you as a housekeeper and a person. SPOILERS PAST THIS POINTThe story of the revolution and political climate is expressed through the entire environment. Nothing about this game is explicitly spoonfed to you. You listen to the gunfire, watch the skyline fill with smoke, observe the newspaper headlines scattered around the apartment, and so much more. It's a complete experience that isn't for people who are waiting to have a story thrown in their faces. I rather liked the writing in the game, as it felt personal and the way someone of that era and background would be talking. I never had any problems with doing the chores, except for one day in which it was actually impossible to do everything listed (this is intentional, as Ortega will note the following day). I was even able to do more than what was asked of me by actually being a housekeeper and maintaining the home, such as changing the date on the calendar and turning on the lights every day.Overall I thought this game delivered everything I expected it to when I kickstarted it. Yes, it is not a game for everyone, but I loved it anyways. I played it twice over: once doing whatever the heck I wanted and second to actually try to romance Ortega through my chores and replies to his notes. I wouldn't hesitate to play it again and take the time to explore more of Angela's thoughts and narrative.			"

												This is a thought provoking, slow burn of a game set in one location.  Despite the use of a single level, there is enough variety to reward exploration.  The wonderful soundtrack also helps in setting the mood.   Definitely play it on a summers evening with the sun low in the sky for maximum effect.On the technical side, there are some performance issues, but the devs have provided lots of options to tweak with.   My only beef is with the selection mechanic as the interface seems to steer you to particular choices over others.In short, I enjoyed the game, despite some initial reservations.  From the looks of the achievement list, it may be worth replaying for some alternate paths through the storyline.Story Tip: persist with the diary entries in the latter stages of the game.			"

												Sunset is a stroke of genius. It's ahead of it's time. It's a game about experiencing someone who is not you. It 's a fascinating idea that I one day hope they get credit for. An emerging narrative that challenges the players own preconceived notions, perceptions and experience is mind blowing. It deserve high praise for innovation in interactive entertainment. Gamer Crap: It's played in 1/2 hour increments (or less time depending how you play) then back to the title screen. As you repeatedly play the game again, the story progresses and you start to see how things are changing. It's clever. There's some achievement hunting in the form of finding books/magazines.And as a Buddhist, I'm eating this game right up. It's about you, other people and society as a whole. Brilliant.			"

												This game is awesome. It is beatiful. It is calm. Makes you think and lets your mind wander.You literally are a housekeeper and do housekeeper work by walking around in a large flat.  It is the story about a military coup in the background that evolves and keeps you interested - also a sort of love story starts.From a technical standpoint it is not very polished and requires quite some Ooompf for the actual graphics you'll see.Anyhow.If you are mostly into AAA titles, you might be totally bored. On the other hand, if you are interested in alternative and creative new concepts (do you like the sundance festival?), go for it!			"

												Ok first things first: If you don't like games where there is not a lot of conflict or action, this game isn't for you. I feel like I need to get that out there. There's a pretty large group of people on here that this game won't appeal to. It's artsy and filled with long sections of sitting on a chair watching text scroll past. Also the game runs pretty poorly so definitely not recommended if you don't have a decent PC.That being said, I liked it. It begins with an interesting concept: You are a maid, cleaning the house of a famous art collector, during a revolution in the fictional South American country, Anchuria. You have one (ingame) hour to look around the house before sunset and find out as much as you can. What follows is war, love, art, hypocrisy, nostalgia and anger. which I must say is pretty impressive considering most of this story is told through small bits of dialogues and diary entries. The writing is pretty great although it is sometimes held back by the format. It's hard to feel any sort of urgency when everything happens offscreen. Things happen but you never really get to see any of it because it all takes place inside this one house. The diary entries are pretty long and I take issue with the fact that you can't scroll through it and read at your own pace, but these end up being the games best feature. At least, I played it a couple of days ago and I'm still thinking about what makes this character tick. This is basically the reason I would recommend it. As for the other production values, the game has a nice aesthetic and the music is fantastic. So points for that as well. However, there's some more little issues that I have with the game, mostly in the fact that the game time is padded pretty significantly, overstaying its welcome a little bit. There's also the issue of the price tag. I got this in a Humble Bundle so it wasn't much of an issue but it's only 5 hours long and a lot of that is pretty much the same thing, so I can't justify the £15 pricetag, even though I know what the company has now dealt with.So yeah, if it goes on sale, buy this. It's worth a shot, even if it's just because it has some things that are really interesting in it's core.			"

												If you like Dear Ester and Gone Home, you would most probably like this.  It's a narration game like Dear Ester with some additional interactions and scheduling thrown in.  There is some interesting drama and a nice story.  It's simply another narrative game, in this particular genre.  No better or worse than any other, but the story is good and has a decent presentation so I give it a thumbs up.			"

												History is often made by the actions of  kings, presidents and dictators who act in accordance with their ideologies or their ambitions. They rule above the clouds, pretending to be gods, as they play their horrible wars and sordid plans. Sunset gives voice to an educated  and intelligent woman, who happens to be the janitor of a rich appartment, in a very poor country, during an undeclared civil war. It is an intimate and intense experience.			"

												This is an interactive narrative. I've seen many people complaining about the ""gameplay."" If you go in expecting anything more than a walking simulator with a great story, you're going to be disappointed. Think of this game as Gone Home with choices. Things you do in this game certainly affect the outcome and that, in a way, is the point of the story.			"

												""If we have to go to war, let's fight to re-establish the peace""Games are constantly encouraging us to explore spaces. They offer us maps to explore, often with trinkets hidden in their most distant corners. But video game spaces have rarely felt as dynamic and worth exploring as the apartment in Sunset. It is, in a world where many games boast of their world being '31.5% larger than that other game', a relatively small place, a handful of rooms all in all. Yet over Sunset's modest running time it changes in ways both radical and subtle - changes that allow the game's narrative, characters and themes to germinate. It is worth exploring the apartment thoroughly afresh every time you leave the elevator, because it's the hidden details you'll only find if your paying attention that give this extraordinary game its depth. Book covers hint at characters' states of mind, the situation beyond the apartment walls or maybe just offer a neat little gag. Notes carefully placed out of the way allow the game's central relationship to develop, all without a word of dialogue being spoken. Eventually more radical changes fundamentally alter the mood and identity of a place that had become to feel familiar, safe... a home?Repetition, too, is deeply ingrained in video game vocabulary, many games proudly demanding players to repeat the same tasks over and over again for typically arbitrary rewards. And repetition is key to Sunset too, but in a way that's not interested in wasting your time, but instead to use routine and passing time to expand the game's scope and depths. Every visit is the same yet different, the routine subtly varying over the course of the game. It quickly becomes apparent that the tasks assigned to Angela are of little concern to anybody involved, the 'excuse' to get this woman into an apartment for an hour a week. You'll be lulled into a comfortable rhythm, only to be legitimately surprised and excited when its disrupted - never in gaming history has a ringing phone felt so revelatory. There's an extended section in the middle of the game where very little happens for quite a while - yet it's possibly the bravest part of the game, that uses time in a way to create a sense of unease, dread, and impatience in the player and protagonist. 'Dead time' it most certainly is not, and a sharp riposte to games that artificially extended their running time for no reason at all.Angela is an atypical video game character to say the very least. She is not defined by her race or gender, but they're an integral part to the rich thematic tapestry of Sunset. Her inner monologue, delivered in poetically brief snippets, reveal a character who develops in fascinating ways over the course of one year, her actions subtly guided by the player's decisions within the game. This is a game of binary - orange and blue - choices, but of impressively nuanced morality, aware that the subject matter being addressed here is rarely black & white.Sunset is a game about art, about love, about freedom, about literature, about politics. It is, notably, a game about war, but addresses it from a perspective that feels unique within a wider cultural landscape, let alone video games (a medium in many ways that has developed over the years by trivialising war). Actual combat is only ever glimpsed or heard from a distance, yet it is as complete an exploration of the victims, contradictions and consequences of war has ever portrayed in an interactive medium. The characters decry the destruction and the death caused by the military, yet also find themselves conflicted by the 'necessity' of fighting. They fret over the impossibility of peace and freedom without more suffering. They reflect in horror at the consequences of their actions, while celebrating their victories. This is undoubtedly an anti-war game, but also one with a deep understanding that it's more complicated than 'war is bad'. Most importantly, nowhere does the game lecture - it asks us to ask ourselves questions to which there are no easy answers. Even Angela herself is an unreliable narrator, her point of view far from the definitive one. We can empathise without necessarily agreeing.If we're talking about 'graphics', Sunset is imperfect - the frame rate is inconsistent, the animation occasionally wonky, and some of the assets uninspiring. Yet aesthetically it is a triumph. The more you play, the more it becomes evident that the hit to performance was a worthy compromise given the quality of the art. The impressionistic reflections, gorgeous shadows and dynamic lighting in the game make for many ravishing visual moments, many of which you will stumble across by chance. The game is presented as a perpetual magic hour, approaching twilight, complemented by the stylised light sources within the game itself (the surrealist neon yellow staircase impresses every time). The artfully applied soundtrack enhances the atmosphere, too - Austin Wintory's economically utilised compositions are fetching, while many of the game's most potent moments come from the times when you put on one of the records you find scattered about the place, and just go exploring.Sunset is from an (almost) alternate dimension - one where video games are formally adventurous, thematically provocative, overflowing with nuance and intellect. It is a very rare breed indeed.			"

YouTube™ Video: Ep 1 - Angela Burnes, provisional housekeeper (Sunset gameplay from Tale of Tales) 

			Views: 10,488		

			Welcome to Let's Play Sunset Episode 1! A Tale of Tales Kickstarter, Sunset is a first-person narrative-focused game with decisions that impact the player’s emotional experiences within the game.		

A rare perspective of war from someone not participating in it, a la This War Of Mine.  Sunset is an alternative take on the point and click genre meshed with a first-person narrative.  While your actions and decisions do not influence the civil war happening in the streets, they do allow you to view how deep the rabbit hole goes.While the initial gameplay is a bit repetitive, the game gets interesting the more you investigate.  Sunset will be what you make of it. If you just want to run around and complete your tasks, you will surely leave disappointed.  If you let your curiosity guide you as the story unfolds, you will thoroughly enjoy Sunset.The game is relatively quiet at first, but the soundtrack kicks in after a bit.  If you're a fan of composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Banner Saga) you won't be let down.I had some fps drops in various spots (down to 20ish), something you wouldn't expect from a game like this.  I am running an i5-2500k with a 290x.If you want a peak at gameplay you can check out my video, but i strongly suggest you give this story a shot on your own.			"

												If you like interactive fiction, Sunset is a solid game to play with a few caveats.  It can be a little boring to actually play through, as you're essentially doing the same thing each chapter (finding things to click on), though each chapter plays out differently.   However, the story advances nicely and is pretty unique and interesting, and there is an element of exploration as you try to find notes/books/tasks.  I did find myself invested in the story and I actually cared about the choices I made throughout the Sunset.  The basic idea behind the game is clever, to experience a governmental coup through the eyes of a citizen/maid and her connection to someone close to the government, but I think more could have been done with the game's mechanics.  Still, I recommend playing Sunset, I enjoyed it.			"

												When it comes to traditional video games, there is no publisher/developer that is so out of the box as Tale of Tales. Their newest game Sunset reaffirms their place in their unconventional line of video games that rely far more on the narrative and what the player does with the information they are given rather than a set goal. Tale of Tales' games aren't meant for those who want to have a clear goal in mind or who prefer games to stick into the very restrictive bindings of what they think a game actually is. They are meant for those who want to experience just how interactive media can be used to tell a compelling narrative.Sunset is told from the viewpoint of a housekeeper named Angela Burnes, who is cleaning the house for the wealthy Gabriel Ortega during a huge revolution in the fictional South American country of Anchuria. Every day, Angela comes to the apartment before sunset to do the tasks that Mr. Ortega has left for her. The player gets to choose whether or not they want to do everything or how they want to do it. These choices are what shape the games overall narrative. You never know what sort of impact your work will have until the day after you do it. Sometimes it takes even longer for Mr. Ortega to notice depending on what you did or didn't do.The entirety of the game takes place in the apartment of Mr. Ortega, and the elevator to get there is the game's menu screen. It's a small setting that you're responsible for changing as the housekeeper. Everything you do affects how the apartment ends up looking. Whenever you come back there will be small items moved or new tasks for you to do that will change the place. It gives a sense of accomplishment or progress when you do these small things despite the game not having a set goal. Your job as Angela is to get through every day as a housekeeper as the world falls apart around her. The apartment is like a sanctuary, and while chaos explodes outside, which the player has the option of viewing, the apartment is the one place where Angela feels safe.Full Review [www.noobfeed.com] "

Your boss however is none other than General Ortega, an influential political figure.You talk with him through brief notes and perform mundane, but not meaningless chores, since the way you do them add up and indirectly impact your relationship, the plot and ultimately the whole country.We’ve never experienced anything like this before, although the pace sometimes seems too slow.A beautiful new way to tell a story that gets8 mops out of 10.

												Sunset is a story based exploration game played in a single penthouse owned by Gabriel Ortega, a rich businessman. The game is set in a fictional latin american country lead under military dictatorship and shortly after the start of the game, riots begin occuring near the penthouse. You are playing Angela Burnes, his housekeeper and you visit his penthouse once a week to clean up his♥♥♥♥♥♥ When cleaning up, you will be presented with 2 different choices. The blue choice will help you build a neutral relationship with Ortega while the orange choice will make him like you more than he should.You have exactly one hour to complete the chores and leave the penthouse, before the sun sets.As you clean Ortega's house, you will begin seeing notes left by Ortega himself, for you to respond to. You can choose to ignore his notes or write back. All decisions you make influence the further development of the story.You can also do various different things in the penthouse such as sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥listening to music from his headphones or looking through the window and blabbering nonsense.Sunset is a very interesting game that gives you the opportunity to create a genuine relationship between two people who have never even met. The most interesting parts of the game are the books that Ortega leaves around the penthouse and his behavior after you've done something special in the penthouse.The books that you can find scattered across the rooms help you form opinions about Ortega, specifically zooming to read the name of the book. If you do not zoom and read the name of the book, that will not be a factor in your future opinions about Ortega. There is also the fact that he leaves classified documents in the open for you to see in case your relationship is leaning towards the orange color.The other very interesting aspect of the game is the fact that you can do unusual things in the penthouse such as positioning his shoes in a circular pattern or building a pyramid of a few toy soldiers that you found. Ortega will not touch these creations. Even several weeks after doing this, it will stay intact while half of the penthouse items will change positions.When playing Sunset, you really feel like every single choice you make, every book you read and every action you take during that one hour, matters and that the relationship between you and Ortega is changing.In the first 5 minutes of the game I thought this would be a boring waste of my time but then I realized that I really want to figure out who this Gabriel Ortega guy is and can I eventually have sex with him.

												This was a very bold game in it's exploration of the relationships people have with other people, art, war and larger society. I think the most beautiful thing about this game was it's tribute paid to classical art. The soundtrack is gorgeous and many times while playing the game I would just sit back and listen. But for that reason, it's not a good game to play if you're looking for something more fast-paced. There is no action inside of the apartment, you are in a safe environment onlooking the destruction of the city around you.I also didn't realise I could press Y or N (or click above or below the mouse) to perform actions positively or negatively until the very end of the game. Hilariously, I sent my boss rude messages without even noticing I could change them, wondering why my character was so mean-spirited. I'm looking forward to playing a second time and seeing how the gameplay changes with a positive relationship with my boss.All in all, I absolutely loved it because of it's explorations of art, philosophy and human relationships (also a POC, female protagonist!!) but was not impressed with it's tedious gameplay. I would suggest this for people who enjoyed games like Telltale games (Walking Dead, Game of Thrones etc), Gone Home, The Novelist, Papers Please, The Stanely Parable and Dear Esther.			"

												Sunset is bold as it turns a seemingly boring ""game concept"" into an emotionally engrossing journey that consumes you with it's story. It has a been too long since the ending of a game has left me breathless, confused, and wanting more. It has been too long since a game has had a story so good that the intentionally mundane gameply just sucks you in more and makes you feel like a real, normal person, standing in the middle of a story. The game sends deep messages and shivers up your spine anytime something story relevant happens. It has been too long since a game has made me, or anyone who has played it, this emotionally consumed with a story.			"

												Like all other games by Tale of Tales, Sunset is a visually striking as it is interesting and engaging to play. This game stands apart from previous ToT games, however, in that is a less abstract, more filled out game, with a storyline that is not left almost entirely up to the player (see The Path, Bientot L'ete, or Salome). It is still a game very much in the ToT style, however. The amount of detail in the apartmetn, the ever-shifting light and ever-changing setting, is absolutely stunning. I will agree with other comments about performance issues, but it's not enough to keep me from enjoying the game, or from being totally swept up in the beautiful story of Angela and Gabriel.Tale of Tales has always been my standard for the ""not-games"" or ""visual novel"" genre of gaming. There is no combat,  no puzzles, but there are choices the player makes that determine the outcome of events both within the apartment and in the entire country.Sunset is a beautiful, engaging piece of art that you can explore, caress, strike down, or discover. I cannot recommend it highly enough.			"

												Okay.. hadn't heard of this game until today when it was announced the game developers 'Tale of Tales' are closing their doors, it was hotly reported on FB by many Games News publishers/journalists.I watched the ad and thought.. this is right up my street as far as weird indie games go.I feel.. as other critical members have said.. it dragged on in places, however I disagree with them on the point the UI was awkward, it was simplistic and I feel like the devs must have.. this immersred you into the beautful love story the experiance became.I'm torn whether or not to recommend this game.. the slow chunks, the painfully frustating confusion about small nothing puzzles.. but the opposite is true.. there were moments of delight for me, seeing their love blossom ever so delicately, touched me in such a way, I might think it was real when I forget about playing this game ten years from now. The voice acting of Tina Marie Murray was excellent, delicate and emotive. But again.. I experianced many glitches in my copy, like the controller wouldn't look properly with the right thumb stick, and then would for no reason. That kind of glitch undoes the beauty of the interface, that you are telling a intimate interactive story, when so much thought's been put in deep immersion, and then broken. This game NEEDED everything to be competently coded, not that it was bad/bad, just it need to be *perfect* to keep those vibes going/flowing I also had 'wild textures' and no outside at one point. But I turned some settings off and it seemed to fix it.The art is superb.. the styling, the lighting was odd, too much haze and neon in there, that obscured too much of the game.The plot.. is a spoiler fest but.. on the whole I enjoyed it, I didn't like the scribbling noise she made in her diary, this would have been much better voice acted, as we are ment to be hearing her thoughts as no one else is there when she speaks, so logically this is her mind. It would have eased me.I dont know what to say.. the bad bits were *bad* and convserly those slim moments.. touched you with lasting delight, As a love story.. I think it was much better than the swash of love films that are out there, as 'a one woman play'.. *this* medium of game is far better showing the great story than a play or a movie.I have no idea if this was bad or good game. o.O			"

												“Five years to get a piece of paper that says I’m an engineer. All so I can clean this man’s house,” Angela muses as she steps into the penthouse apartment for the first time. It’s spacious and empty. Gabriel Ortega, her employer, has tasked Angela to clean the floors, move some boxes and open the blinds which leads to a huge balcony overlooking the city. The view is spectacular, but there’s trouble on the horizon. It’s 1972, Angela Burnes is a black American woman trapped in a small fictional Latin American country called Anchuria which has just been shaken by a military coup. Nobody gets in or out and Angela has been forced to take up a housekeeping job in order to get by. This is the premise of Sunset, a first-person exploration and narrative game by Belgian developer Tale of Tales responsible for more experimental games such as The Path, Bientôt l’été and Luxuria Superbia.Once a week, an hour before sunset, Angela will return to Ortega’s apartment to do whatever tasks he has set out for her. Ortega is still in the process of moving in and Angela can help him with unpacking and decorating. It is a nice process in which the apartment looks a bit different every time Angela returns to it. Angela only has an hour of in-game time to do these tasks which amounts to half an hour in real time. However, doing these tasks will advance time more quickly. Of course, besides these chores, Angela can explore the apartment on her own and interact with objects. Certain tasks can be done in two ways: professionally and with a distance or Angela can choose to spice it up a bit with a personal touch. Also, Ortega will leave little written notes all over the apartment to which Angela can also choose to respond to in a certain manner. Or not respond at all. Or not even perform the tasks. All of these choices will impact the nature of her relationship with Ortega. But even more than that, it could potentially impact the revolution spreading through the streets of San Bavon.While mechanically simple, as all you do is simply press a button, it’s still a fascinating and intriguing concept. With most games offering larger and larger worlds, it’s nice to see these different takes on the concept of game worlds. A more intimate, personal approach. Re-visiting Ortega’s apartment over the course of a whole year, seeing it evolve and change and seeing Angela’s impact on it all is rewarding. There are also some snippets of the outside world delivered outside of Angela’s thoughts and Ortega’s notes. Some days you will be able to hear the gunshots and bombs going off in the city, you will be able to see helicopters and planes whizzing through the sky. It all contributes to the immersion and atmosphere very nicely. You genuinely feel that passage of time and that something is actually going on.The writing is very good for the most part, especially regarding Angela’s monologues and her voice acting is convincing as well, but some written exchanges with Ortega feel somewhat forced and unnatural. The graphics, although technically modest, are very pleasing thanks to the wonderful art style that truly brings out that 70’s vibe despite the fact that the whole game takes place in a single apartment. I also have to single out the superb soundtrack which offers some fantastic, mostly acoustic, latin and operatic music with a few truly standout tracks. Most of the game is very silent, so when you have the option to turn on the radio or put on a record, it makes a real impact.Unfortunately, the game suffers from severe technical issues. It runs better on beefier systems, but on more modest ones (although they still exceed the necessary requirements), it runs very poorly and oftentimes turns into a proper slide show, particularly when you play the game for longer periods. I have also experienced multiple freezes and crashes. You don’t lose any progress, but it is still very annoying. And even though by its nature the game doesn’t require any quick reflexes or anything like that, the performance issues directly impact the immersion and atmosphere which are both as crucial for this type of game as fast response time is crucial in a competitive shooter. This is unacceptable especially considering that the graphics are technically very modest and that the entire game takes place in relatively small space. It’s just a poorly optimized game that simply should not have shipped in this state. I had to turn the settings to low as well as lower the resolution to get it into a playable state and even then the performance wasn’t great. Also, the controls are a bit loose and unwieldy and when you closely approach any object, for some reason the camera distorts in a fish eye lens type of effect. I have also experienced a problem where I couldn’t interact with anything until I changed my settings from 3D to 2.5D. It’s just a whole list of serious and odd problems that simply shouldn’t be there.Despite significant technical shortcomings, Sunset is a wholly unique and intriguing game that draws you in thanks to its captivating premise and setting, solid storytelling and exquisite sense of style and atmosphere.6 OUT OF 10 (FAIR)			"

												Ordinarily, you would think of style over substance as a pejorative. What I find so interesting about Sunset, though, is the extent to which style literally becomes substance, successfully carrying the narrative by virtue of what you can tell it is attempting to be rather than what it actually is.Is Angela's characterization all over the place, particularly with regards to the lack of impact that your decisions have in her relationship with Gabriel? Definitely. Is there much in the way of understanding why their flirtation really kicks off to begin with? Not really. Do totalitarian governments identify and take a serious interest in the immediate families of celebrity rebel leaders? Certainly. Does it make a lot of sense to think of someone who works for one hour a day as an icon of proletariat grind? Nah.I mean, why don't they just get together? You never really know.And yet, when you look at their shared love of art through the exceptional visuals of the game, the narrative of the war that comes through Angela's words, and the overall concept of people slowly growing together through a shared sanctuary from a chaotic world, I'll bet everyone in the world would come to more or less the same exact conclusion of what this story is trying to say.Whether you're prepared to forgive it for all that is up to you. Something that leaves so much in the sky is not really for me, I don't think, but I appreciate deeply that Sunset made me feel what I think it wanted to without having actually brought me through it.

												I liked Sunset. It's not what many would consider a traditional game, even of the adventure variety. There are choices to be made that impact the relationship between Angela and Gabriel but this largely about capturing emotion of a time and place. As someone who can remember the early '70s, the game does a good job of reflecting the tumultuousnes of that time period. Angela's thoughts and feelings seem at times to swing from one side to the other, but that was the nature of that time period. This game is not a historical game in the sense of capturing actual events, but it does capture some of the  uncertainty many had back then. Today, eveyone seems so certain of their positions. Sunset is a reminder that not choice is obvious and the outcomes of our choices are not certain.No, the game doesn't capture these things perfectly. Also, I'm of the belief that, generally speaking, games are primarily entertainment (the same as TV and movies). Detailed analysis is in the realm of books and lectures. But at times (rare, admittedly) TV, movies, and especially games because of the interactivity can capture feelings in ways that may be difficult for more precise forms to capture. Sunset reaches for and largely hits this goal. It will not be for everyone. But if you have played other Tale of Tales games or similar games like Dear Esther and enjoyed them, then you should definitely play Sunset. If you've never played any of these, but are looking for something different than the average video game, then you will not find a much better place to start than Sunset.			"

												Sunset is a fascinating and unique game of a type I wish we saw more of.  It's very much like reading a novel; I'd say it's one of the most elegant attempts at making a game be a novel that I've ever seen.The graphics are fantastic.  As some have noted, performance can seem unexpectedly poor on a low end computer (reminiscent of ""Tex Murphy: Overseer"" back in the day, for me, on my weaker machine).  But on my newer system, the graphics are flawlessly smooth, delectably stylized, and I can't imagine wanting to change a thing.The game is unusual in that it seems a bit as if you can do your job as poorly or disinterestedly as you please with absolutely no negative feedback.  This is unusual, and takes a bit of getting used to.  Eventually, the story begins to offer a plausible explanation for why this might be, but I didn't trust this concept for a good while.  I plan on doing a second playthrough shortly to test the theory that I am completely free to sociopathically disregard the work I am (theoretically) being paid to do at all times.  The game mechanics suggest that this is really how I was meant to be playing the game all along in the first place.Really the only negative thing I have to say is that I have a suspicion that a few of the Steam Achievements might be buggy.  I definitely saw things that would make me assume I should have a few more of them than I do, and all of the ones I think that about show 0% of players successful.  Hopefully a patch will clear that up in the near future.			"

In BriefSunset is a unique, profound narrative game about art, and people, and it made me fall in love.Most valuable resource: The unique, incredibly well thought-out use of gameplay.Of interest to: people interested in character, relationships, philosophy, and art.Tale of Tales have a history of very cleverly using gameplay elements to construct an experience.  These are the same people who made The Path, which messed with your expectations about player choice, and game advancement, and Bientot L'ete, a multiplayer game about loneliness.  With Sunset though they have excelled themselves.It's the 1970s, and you are a black American who left her homeland for the Latin American nation of Anchuria for personal reasons, and now finds herself, engineering degree and all, working as a maid for a rich member of the ruling elite.  Gameplay is very straightforward: once a week you arrive at his house, receive a list of chores, and have an hour to do them.  Although you're on the clock, the game doesn't feel like a time trial; it's more about making choices.  The game is repetitive, but in a completely engaging way; each day is the same house, the same basic routine, with different chores, but very quickly that stops being the point as you slowly learn more about the man you are working for, a man you've never met but whose house you routinely occupy.Against a backdrop of a military dictatorship, the game has a lot to say about progress and tradition, about art, and people, and war.  It uses religion, and art, and music as its motifs, and the diary entries and commentary of this person as whom you play is subtle, and gentle, tangential to the points the game is making, letting you think about it, think it through.  A lot of art games that have something to say jam it down your throat, but Sunset is happy to just talk, just show you things, and let you experience people, and then think about it and see to what conclusions you come yourself.  Because it isn't forcing the issue the game can be quite high-brow without pushing people away with pretension.There are collectibles in the form of a selection of literature that pertains to the issues raised during the game, and obscure music discs.  The collectibles hint at some of the ideas in the story, but they also make you feel like the house you clean is occupied by someone else; you get to know him a little by his books, which is, again, such a subtle thing.  That he leaves these books and records out at times feels deliberate, like he wants you to see what he is reading for some reason, to share in his music, building a strangely, unexpectedly strong connection between you and this person you've not yet met.  This game could easily feel sterile, with its modern house and its simplicity of location, but instead these little touches make the experience instead feel intimate.The game has one hundred achievements.  I don't believe the developers did this without thought.  For me, at least, finishing the game with 71 achievements made me feel like I still didn't fully know Ortega, which, given how the story progresses, is quite a profound way to end.  If this was the intention then these developers are artists who paid great attention to every detail of the gaming experience.There is so much more to say about this game, but I want to avoid spoiling anything you may take from the game through your own experience of playing it.  If this sort of narrative experience sounds like something you might enjoy, take a punt and play Sunset.  All art is subjective, but for me, there is every chance that this delicately crafted story will be my game of the year.			"

												Glad I played it - but also now glad I've finished it.I'll try to keep it short, as others have covered many of the points I wanted to make below.Some positives I took away from it:1) You play the entire game in a flat. By yourself. And it makes you feel part of something.No cut scenes, no narrative, you're just in the flat - but manages to give a fantastic sense of 'world' outside.2) I've no idea if what I did mattered. Normally in a game you're popped into a world and told to change it.My world here definitely changed - but I've got absolutely no idea if *I* changed it. I 'did things' from turning on hundreds of light switches to faxing off secret plans - and 'other things' happened as I did so. I'm reasonably sure some of my actions influenced my employer, but the impact of that, on the world he inhabits - I've genuinely no idea.That's actually quite an impressive mechanic, managing to give me a sensation of layered influence over a stack of things, I never see.My negatives:Really just concerned with that last point. I turned on so so many light switches. I developed my own routines of how I'd go through the flat. I got obsessed with ensuring lights were on  and the calendar was updated each day - and got genuinely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when I realized I'd not updated it, prior to starting a job that would run out the clock for that game-day.I've come away with the feeling the devs were trying to make a point (maybe they weren't and it's a gaming Rorschach test, but I digress). However, I feel they made their point, but in doing so they overlooked my enjoyment. Bluntly, for better or worse, most of us play games to feel empowered in some way. It's intellectually interesting to demonstrate this doesn't have to be the case - but maybe takes away from the enjoyment of the paying subjects.I imagine there's a spreadsheet, or stack of post-its on a board, where the ""story"" was plotted out in abstract, and dutifully mapped into the game day by day - but then nobody with fresh eyes gave feedback.Games it reminded me of *opens list of Indie-hits from last couple of years* were:Gone Home, for the solitary exposition in a fixed environment - although think there's still a sweet spot to be found between the magnificent lack of environmental-progression in Sunset, and Gone Home's ""you've unlocked a room""Stanley Parable, for messing with tropes - just Stanley gave you a quick pay-off on challenging them, Sunset lets you indulge and simply leaves you hanging. Conversely though, Stanley never felt it had any depth.Lifeless Planet, for me loving the concept and execution - but having got the point, just wishing there'd been an editor involved in the process to wrap it up sooner.Papers Please, this is a late edit, but finally worked out what it's missing is what this game had - the balance between the mundane job, and allowing you to make exceptions. PP didn't quite have the world, but the mechanic was less obtuse.Re-reading, I feel the review comes across as negative, which wasn't my intention. It's a unique game I'm glad I played, but just can't help feeling it could have been a bit better. Just a slight bit more ""gamier""			"

												Sunset is a game where you play as a housekeeper in time of civil unrest. This masterpiece of a game has a very interesting story to tell, on a very pleasant way.What is it?Sunset takes place in the fictional metropolitan capital of San Bavón, in 1972. You are Angela Burnes, the housekeeper for the wealthy bachelor Gabriel Ortega. The whole game takes place in his apartment. You have to do chores for Gabriel, each week between 17h and 18h. You follow the events of the ongoing civil war and, like all civilians amidst war, Angela does not directly influence the outcome of the story.Read more on GamingBoulevard[www.gamingboulevard.com] "

												I haven't finished my first play through yet. I'm doling this game out a couple game days at a time, to give me time to reflect. There's no surges of adreniline, or pats on the head, just thought proking atmosphere that gives me the feels. Your effect on the world is delivered through voice over and change in interactions with your employer. Gabriel's apratment seems a small place to explore, but it's a lens that lends perspective out of proportion to it's size. It can be difficult to get everything on list done and still have time to journal. When I can't find a task quickly or find the covered chair (the only one you can journal in), I do get a bit frustrated. I do always try to explore as much as possible to find the various notes Gabriel leaves as well as his literary and musical offerings.And yes, this game is horribly optimized. I suppose that's the drawback of being a game studio of two.			"

												I said ""recommended"" but only because there's no "" Only if you really like walking simulators"" and even with that in mind I'm still not sure. I bought it pretty much on release and played through entire game once. Thing to note is that the game have different endings based in the way you play. Each day you have a set of task to complete, and you can complete them in one of two ways, influencing the story. And to be honest I felt like the game mechanic was in the way of story telling, and the fact that the story just basically stops halfway through the game just to pick up at the and does not help, I actually felt like I'm doing chores. There are some cool thing to discover every other day and just nice touches here and there, ( especially all the books you can find, I really liked those) but it's just not enough. I don't know, at the end of the day: Pick up if you're into walking simulators and it's on some sort of sale, otherwise you probably want to skip it.			"
