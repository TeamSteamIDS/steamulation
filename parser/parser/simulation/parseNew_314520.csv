												Broken, lacking depth, arcade rubbish. The words that spring to mind having now played 8 hrs since launch. That the developers have labelled this a simulation and imagine it is worthy as a release candidate beggars belief. Pick one of 4 rig types that you are limited to carrying when you are fishing, pick one of four baits that you are limited to carrying and that's your terminal tackle sorted, seriously? Where do I adjust boilie buoyancy, hair length, my shock leader, and link length, pick hook type and size independent of the chosen rig. Where are the method feeders, carp poles, marker floats, bait boats, baiting sticks, feeder rods. Where are the oils for soaking boilie's, the pva stringers and bags, and the selection of groundbaits and particles for the spod rod. Why the hell are worms, luncheon meat, casters and maggots awol in a fishing game that features roach bream, tench and carp. Where is the window dressing such as alternate clothing, bivvies, bite alarms, landing nets, et al. Everything I would expect to see at launch from a title labelled an accurate simulation of European Fishing.Then there are the game mechanics that are present but not working correctly, even the basics such as fish control and landing glitch frequently, fish that run for 20 meters under the bank, line retrieval that bears no relationship to what I am actually doing or seeing, fish that become stuck under the tip of my rod, fish ai that is unaffected by wind direction, then there are the constant stream of bites, how I wish that fishing for carp and cats was so easy irl.I could go on but if you do not have a clear picture of this title yet, there is little point. It clearly has potential, graphically it looks good, but as a simulation of angling it stinks, as a release candidate it stinks, it is just not good enough; at best it is a shallow, broken, arcade game.

Cons:- The game looks pretty bad. They clearly spent a lot of time on their foliage, but for a game that's all about staring at water for hours on end, their water effects are absolutely terrible.- - There are no water physics at all. Even when you are reeling in a fish the water just remains static and boring.- - Even on Ultra the water doesn't reflect the sky or surroundings.- - You really can't see into the water. They don't have fish swimming around the bottom. They don't really have visible weeds or anything like that. It's just murky brown blandness.- Lack of variety. You are basically limited to several different types of carp, and one or two lakes also have catfish.- The net mechanic. It's awkward, it hurts the flow of the game, and I suspect the mechanic was mostly added to avoid needing physics for the fish.- There are no physics for the fish. You can't pull the fish out of the water with the rod while you're reeling it in. You never see the fish satisfyingly thrashing in the water, on the hook, or in your hands.- You can't get your line caught in a tree.Pros:- The casting physics are a fun novelty until the rest of the game ruins the experience for you.- It's cheaper than a fishing license. Also you don't need to go outside.The pictures and videos on the store page definitely make the game look better than it actually is. It's not the worst purchase I've ever made but I've already uninstalled it and probably won't ever be playing it again.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, as a mature gamer and a UK course fisherman, i was intrigued the moment i saw this title. Mainly because it wasnt based on lure fishing for bass, which it seems 99% of fishing games are.  The first thing that struck me on playing it was the beautifull training lake, it was a while before i even cast a rod out as i was strolling round the lake in awe of the lush scenery. I struggled a bit at first with the fishing mechanics, but soon got used to it, and with practice it became very natural and pretty dam realistic. Im so glad i stuck with it for a couple of hours and got to grips with the controls, because now after several updates and much practice i am enjoying this game more than ever and would highly recommend it to anyone.The most impressive aspect of this project i feel, is the direction its heading in, although the updates arent super regular when the do hit they bring massive improvements and content. Phase 6 added a massive new lake, boss fish, landing net mechanics, a tackle shop and much more. All of the additions were well implemented and brought a lot more structure to the game. Unfortunatly i have now bought all the best tackle and saved up quite a bit of money for future tackle shop items. But the fact that its the first game i check everyday when im looking at whats been updated is testament to its genius. With the promise of Tench and float fishing equipment to come my mouth is watering!There are still some bugs of course as it is early access, but the devs are active enough and seem to be working on them. There is also online multiplyer now which works but is still very much in Alpha. I truly hope this gets the support and backing it deserves as it is, by far, the best fishing game ive ever played, already and theres still content to come. My advice to the devs on this one is please keep up the good work and keep heading in the direction your are... oh and hurry up with my Tench :POverall the good massively outweighs the bad and in my opinion is already a worthwile purchase.

Early Access Review
								[Early Access - Phase 5] UPDATEYES! You finally have a sense of freedom in freedom fishing. Game mechanics feel good, though I feel like now I'm throwing so far I might hit mountains the far distance. I liked the triple spinning wheel bug as well, sadly it is going to be fixed.[Early Access - Phase 3] UPDATEWhat I like:- Casting is a lot easier. I didn't find myself trying over and over again to get a goot shot like in phase 1, and I didn't have to move mymouse all across the table (mouse mat was sufficient :)).- Improved visuals. Some of the things that annoyed me about the first release was some basic but unrealistic/immersion breaking visuals like a rope-thick line and a very wobbly fishing pole. These have been fixed now, at least to some extent. The line is pretty good, or perfect in terms of thickness now and the pole has just about the right stiffness to it. I still experience motor-boating and pole glitches kind of often, but the basics are a lot better.- Character feedback. Another issue I had that has now been improved on is the characters feedback to the force of the fish and so on, when you are fishing. It is very pleasing, and I didn't find my self getting thrown off by the characters reactions this time - big +.- New features. The fish variations are great and I managed to catch a few during my testing of the game. Leader boards are great. Adds a lot more to the game and actually makes it worthwhile to play the game in its current state. I didn't manage to go too far up the rankings but it was a lot more fun and exciting to catch something and see how far it will get you.What I could see improved:- The fish AI. It was a lot better than first time I played, but I still experienced fish going from 10-80yds in a matter of seconds when fishing from some spots (especially the little closed spot without a lot of room, had issues). The fish also seemed to not care about swimming through landscape as I frequently saw fish going directly throw rocks/trees and sometimes into the land/road/path on the other side of the lake.- The force on the pole when having a hook is ok, but the line is not always acting accordingly. I frequently experienced a pole arced and bent like a bow, while the line acted as is if no force at all was being aplied to it.What I didn't like:- Reeling/catching fish seems to be bugged sometimes as I have found myself reeling in for a solid 10 minutes two times in a row at the same fishing spot without anything major happening to the yard indicator/other. I frequently feel like having no idea whats going on underneath the water. Like if I'm catching a fish and it's almost in reach (5-10ish)yds I'm just able to keep reeling in without anything happening. The line should be rather short at that point, but it feels like it's extended by 100 miles underneath the water. Also while reeling, at times when I was not able to pull the fish towards me (maybe extended the line underneath the water) I was still able to steer the fish to the left or right which makes no sense. While reeling I often wondered if the game had bugged out, if I was doing something totally wrong etc. Didn't feel very responsive. I think the latest updates have been good and have improved the game in areas where improvement were needed, but some fundamentals are still flawed. Pleased with this update :)-----------------------------------[Early Access - Phase 1] ORIGINALI understand the game is in early access, but I just think it is lacking in too many aspects, and I think the developers should have waited a bit before releasing it to the public and accepting your money.What you get to see in this early access is basically a few tutorials and trials, so you can get a feel for how the game and the mechanics are going to be implemented. This is fine, it is content-wise what they claimed it to be. I would be satisfied with this amount of content, if it wasn't because of the bare basics of the game not being very well implemented at all yet. For a dedicated fishing simulator, it doesn't do a very good job at simulating what real fishing feels like. On top of that the mechanics felt clunky, the visuals didn't feel right and the main point of the game (fishing) felt really awkward, unreal and unresponsive.Problems with the visuals:- The fishing line looks thicker than the pole itself, and I know it has to be easy to see on screen but there has to be a better way. The line also seems a lot heavier than an actual line (which is as light as a snowflake flowing in the wind), when you look at how it reacts with the physics currently in the game.- The fishing pole looks way too rubbery/elastic compared to a real pole. Very wobly :). Like if you shake your hand a bit, it might go all bananes.- The tension on the fishing line is the worst part about the visual issues. Very immersion breaking. When I have a fish on the line, the string tension is very unrealistic. It doesn't matter if the fish is 40 yards away or 10 yards, if I'm reeling in or being idle, the string looks all the same. I get no real feel for how far away the fish is, how hard it is pulling and so on - other than the numbers I see on the screen. I found this to be very immersion breaking, it didn't feel at all like I was having a hook!Problems with the game (fishing).- When I'm reeling in I have no idea what is going on underneath the water. Sometimes I was reeling in for a long long while, but the yard indicator stayed the same, and there was no other visual feedback. I didn't know if the game had glitched out and my reeling didn't do anything, or if the fish had managed to extend my line by another 100 yeards underneath the water for me to reel in afterwards. I think it would be nice to get some sort of idea of how long your line is, and not just how far away the fish is. Because this just felt so weird when I couldn't feel the force in my pole, and just stood there reeling in for minutes from a minor hook.- The fish (1 kind in this early alpha) is very athletic, it goes from one end of the lake and back in a matter of seconds. It does this for a while, then suddenly stops. Like it spend all of its energy traveling so fast from one end of the lake to the other and then suddenly colapses. It also bites the hook very frequently, so the food must me scarse around this lake. :)- As mentioned earlier you get almost no visual feedback or cues from the fishing pole, the string or the fishing guy. When you get a hook the pole, string, and the guy - they all just act as if there was no force pulling in the other end of the line. In contrast to this, the fish is going crazy underneath the water as I mentioned earlier. It just feels so unrealistic and weird. This would be okay as a side game in GTA or something like that, but this coming from a dedicated fishing simulator was disappointing.Problems with the controls:- Something feels really awkward about the controls, I have a hard time pointing out exactly what is causing this.- I think one part is the mouse sensitivity. You turn very slowly while the pole is very wobly and when you throw the line out into the water I almost have to move my hand all across the desk to get a good shot.- The throwing part does not feel consistent. Sometimes I get a really nice shot, but the next time I do the eactly same movement (with minor differences ofc), the bait may end up only 11 yards away and in another direction. It just didn't feel right.All in all, I think the basic features should have been better implemented when releasing a paid early access of a dedicated fishing game with this amount of content. I don't see a point for anyone to get it yet, UNLESS you are very interested in fishing and can't wait to get a glimpse of what this new game will look like.[Deleted the last 5 paragraphs to make room for the phase 3 review update].

												I don't want to submit a negative review at this time... but issues mentioned since the start of early access have not been fixed.  ""full controller support"" shouldn't mean move a mouse cursor around with your thumb stick to interact with menus.  also warning for those with surround/eyefinity setups, it's broken as well.  will update review upon patching as the core mechanics of this game are well done... it's just a few things (especially the controller support) that are making it un-playable for me.

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW BASED ON PHASE 4 RELEASE.Dovetail Games Fishing is one of those games that come to mind as unique. Or maybe even niche. Because the people who actually do fish, will be outside doing actual fishing. It makes you wonder why to even make a simulation based on it? Well to be fair to DTG, they hit the nail on the head. The game is still Early Access, so a lot of features of the game are unavailable, but as they develop it, you can really see the game shine through the cracks of it's early builds.The whole idea of fishing and just relaxing and enjoying doing something that doesn't require hard manual labour, is top notch. The game itself is based around a lake which you now, have complete control over. You can now walk and fish in different spots, you can now, change your lures, and you can even put your rod down!The attention to detail is amazing as the whole atmosphere projects a warm sunny summers day morning and the ambient sounds of birds chirping away to the splashing of over excited fish is simply sublime.To their advantage, is that the developers of the game at Dovetail, enjoy fishing and do it often. So the game is being made by fishers for fishers. I myself am not a fisher. But to play this game is to encapsulate what I do enjoy. A nice relaxing morning or afternoon in the middle of a green area.I would recommend this game based on ""Phase One"", and this review is based on ""Phase Four"". As such, I'm still going to recommend it. Quality. Absolute quality!			"

								keeping in mind this is Early access I bought it full well knowing it's not a complete gameThe game looks amazing in graphics departmentThere is not a lot to do just yet but it does give a look into what they are trying to produce, this game has a great future for an area in the market that is rather shallow and not a lot of fish biting, but if this game stays on track on full release it maybe a feeding frenzy.If you are into fishing and want to watch a game grow into something great, cast a line and catch your self a deal on this record size catch :)Will visit this again after there planned updates			"

												Huge improvements from early versions in every aspect of the game. It's not perfect, but pretty close and in my opinion has retaken the title of best fishing game on steam.Its still being developed and new content worked on so the future is bright for this game, deserves more of a player base. Great immersion, you really do feel like your by the lake and once you get the hang of the casting and fighting mechanics its a lot of run reeling in the monsters. I would like to see fish animations in the water worked on when you have a fish hooked but apart from that really enjoying this title.			"

												Been with the game since it first hit EA on Steam, after breaking 100 hours I thought I would share my thoughts.As  there are not a massive amount of fishing games on steam and even less which are 'serious-semi serious' this one stands out. Graphically pleasing and with its current state and latest update its easy to hope in and play with friends and on your own. You can get stuck in and learn easy enough through a simple tutorial process after that its up to your style of fishing. While there are not a massive variety of fish species to be caught (something to be improved on?) what there is there proves a challenge to catch and some of the larger specimens are a great fight, the addition of boss fish and extensive tackle choice to unlock keeps you playing for a long time and the community online are a good bunch, never had any problems there.Had a lot of fun and hope it continues to be supported and more content gets added,  for me a good 8/10.

Early Access Review
								**Early Access Review Stage 1 (11/4/14)**Yea!-Realistic fishing game on PC-Looks Good-Great intro priceMeh!-Early Access/ early stage Alpha-Only 1 type of fish-Casting looks very promising-Could give something of a stats for fish when caughtBleh!-Menu is very clunky only works with keyboard-In game mouse sensitvity is awful-Tutorals need to be unlocked-Weird physics issues***Presentation-Game looks great for the stage the game is in, but there are some clipping issues with the water. But the fish and your model look pretty good overall. The water and reflections also are quite nice.The menu screen is barebone and only is navigated by keyboard. The options are barebone with only having settings for mouse sensitivity, audio levels, and Graphics detail (low,med,high,ultra), resolution with being able to select fullscreen, window or borderless window. Setting the game to fullscreen at 1440p would not display properly and only worked via windowed mode for me.Mechanics-Casting is decent once you get use to it, but suffers from mouse sensitivity issues where you have to turn it up a lot or you will be doing the picking up and dragging and repeat to start your backswing for casting. Sometimes even while releasing the line it will shoot forward then bounce back oddly. When the line is in the water it is pretty smooth sailing, and reeling in the fish is fun. I just wish upon landing the fish it would at least make up some numbers for you so you can keep trying for something other then landing another generic fish. Also be aware that the current plans is to only add in carp til a much later date.***Lowdown- As of this review the game is in very early alpha, but looks promising. With a great intro price of $7 ( which is said to increase as development continues), its a good time to buy to support pretty much the only modern realistic fishing game on steam or PC pretty much. This is only reason I recommend this game at this stage			"

												I do not really understand why there are so many negative reviews especially considering the alternative fishing games out there. I actually expected a lot worse from the game and what people may not know is that the developers originally hinted that there would be only one type of fish in the release and everything else would be DLC. However they apparently changed their minds and put out a release version with a decent amount of content. I havent encountered any problems with the release version of the game and for anyone who thinks he might enjoy a fishing sim this is not a bad choice at all. My hopes are that the developers will continue to fine tune the game and I wouldnt even mind future DLC if the additional content is decent.Bottomline is a recommendation for anyone who doesnt expect call of duty - modern fishing.This is my first review and I am mostly writing it to balance the mixed reviews which I personally consider to be a bit unfair.

Posted: November 9, 2015
												This is not going to show as an ""Early Access review"" but as far as I'm concerned it should be. DTG pushed the release on this (Nov 2), perhaps to try and counter Fishing Planet. It was a mistake because the bugs and problems with this are numerous. Some of the glaringly obvious:-- Fish that SLIDE sideways, they don't swim at all. Sure, their tails wag but that's the model, not the AI. They almost teleport they move so fast sometimes. Even the biggest fish around the 40kg mark, bounce and slide around like a Smartie in a blender. I've written script for fish and rotating them ""naturally"" is a pretty simple task. Adding proper inertia and momentum is a little trickier but certainly doable too.- The casting is not bad (with practise) but a 50m cast, to the opposite side of a lake, which looks to be 150-200m away, is up on the bank. 2 winds of the reel and you're back in the middle of the lake at 30m or so. In some cases you can't even see where your gear is until you bring it back to under 30m.- Reel winding is shocking. A 5:1 reel, with zero tension, should be bringing in close to a metre of line per turn. You can literally turn the handle 50 times and get back a metre of line. I made this observation in the forums and was told it's an ""audio"" problem because I mentioned I should at least be hearing the clutch slipping. Did they answer about not being able to wind in with zero tension or that my reel acts like it's  1:25 ratio?  Not even mentioned.- Fish snap off, for no reason, in some places on some maps. Can't even be bothered reporting it.- The fish ""fight"" is only really differentiated by time. A BIG fish in RL can and will run for 10's of metres non-stop, sheer power. Smaller fish dart and dance. Some of these 40kg monsters swim like a Goldfish and you get frustratingly stuck with a bouncing yo-yo fish, 7m out and 5m deep, going nowhere. Some smaller fish, where your breaking strain is 3 times that of fish, simply ""lock up"" 10m out and just pull against the line. You cannot wind them in, you have to pump and wind like it's a 10kg carp.- 15lb Touchdown line is borked. Unlimited drag. Max it to 100% and skulldrag your fish straight in. I mentioned this is a pretty serious exploit because XP and TP (the currency) is linked to catches. There are also live tournaments against real players and anyone NOT fishing 15lb will lose - obviously. Answer from devs. ""It's up to you if you use it or not"".- Tournament scores do not update in RT, in some cases not at all.- ""Boss"" fish are able to be caught one after another. I caught 5 in a row, from the same location, using the same gear, line, bait. everything.- My favourite. You can catch a ""Boss"" fish (all independently named) on Rod #1 and while you're taking it off the hook, Rod #2 goes off and presto..... same Boss fish. I've caught 3 in a row on this, others have caught the same Boss 5 times in a row.- FPS is capped at 30fps. Yes folks. UE4 engine, PC game, CAPPED at 30fps.- AMD users are suffering all kinds of glitching, gamma, flickering and crashes. Devs say it's AMD and/or Epic (UE4). Anyone who playes the multitude of UE4 games out there (Ark is one of the most popular) knows that AMD cards are NOT suffering this across the board.- VERY short gameplay. In 40 hours, much of it playing the broken tournaments, I am nearly maxed out and own almost everything. - The gear. Some of it is so similar (or lacking in gameplay neccessity) that it makes accumulation pointless. BUT, you need to buy item #1 to be able to buy item #2 so... accumulate you do.Look. I've had enough of this, I've annoyed myself, sounding all whiney and sooky. I could go on but just the attitudes of devs to problems you officially document is pretty poor. A whole lot of pseudo-surprise, ""we'll look into it"", ""our testing didn't do that""  etc... all the while telling you they're working on more content, and given it's Dovetail Games, it'll be mostly DLC.For now. IF it's on special it might be worth a look because they MAY address these issues. $20 for 40 hours is probably not too bad so I'll not complain too much more.IF this had been an Early Access title my review would be completely different and my tolerance for errors would be much, much higher. But when you release broken titles... Shame.5/10It get's an up.... Just. It is fishing, it's kinda relaxing and looks reasonable. It will be good for awhile but you'll run out of fun very quickly.

								This is basically a first stage tutorial teaching you how to cast and land fish. The game needs lots of extra A.I. and lots of different scenarios. Otherwise it will run straight into that deadly trap called Boring! Also fishing isn't just about Carp, there are a lot of other species out there, all needing different approaches  to catch them. By this I mean Float fishing, Fly fishing and Stalking to name but a few. The Graphics seem to be okay, but a bit on the basic side. I had everything maxed out and to be honest I didn't see any difference at all!I think that to Charge People for the ""Game"" at the moment is a BIG mistake! Get more into it then you can sell it for peoples hard earned cash. To actually sell it at this stage of it's development is rather cheeky to say the least!Finaly, I will recommend this game, but very reluctantly, as it has a lot of scope. Now it's back to the men and hope they fill the gaps and provide us with an interesting game that will keep us going for Day's!			"

								Having clocked over 1000+ hours into this ferocious bad boy, I can safely say that this lake only contains one carp. Like, not one type of fish, but specifically just one carp. Just one guy I keep catching over and over again, only to let him go. It reminds me a lot of the complicated relationship between Batman and the Joker, so if you think about it, this game is at least as good as Arkham City. Highly recommended if you truly want to get into the mind of a man utterly obsessed with catching one fish, again and again, only to let it go. He doesn't even look happy when he gets it.			"

								Its a great fishing game concept, awesome graphics, realistic play. But its not ready yet. 1 Lake to fish in, no records of fish, no achivements, basically if your happy to fish 3 times a day to see what you catch. I see alot of potential, trophies would be nice, mutlitplayer fishing with a mate on same lake whilst chatting via mic, at least 20 lakes more, etc etc, i would say this game is 40% complete at the moment.

												I was not able to play this game at all. I use a three monitors on PC system and this does not support that. There is no way to manually change the resolution. I read a post message asking why there was no support for 3 monitors and the response was "" Because We Don't Have 3 Heads"". I will not support a company that treats it's customer base like dog waste and this represents a company that only wants the peoples money and when it have it, push their nose in a pile of sand! I'm want my money backI have shut down two monitors and with it running on the one monitor it locks up! I try to run this for 62 minutes.			"

												game is broke at the moment waiting for them to install auto reeling .to go with autocasting and autonetting becuase we the public are not smart enough to know when put a net in the water or how to cast a line straight.even worse if you catch a fish it will snap the line on the lowest drag setting.this game needs serious work to get it back to how it was.

												I wanted to like this game. Controls seemed good and seemed like an overall great fishing game. My PC isn't the greatest but it runs everything else fine. (Currently playing BF1) Had to refund the game when it crashed 5 times in 2 hrs.I might buy it again in the future if they ever patch it. I did get in touch with Dovetail support. They just said a new update was coming soon. Glad I got a refund it's been a few months.TLDR: Wait for the game to get patched to buy.			"

												Firstly the closest I have ever come to actually fishing, is this game! I knew nothing of fishing or it's intricacies until I ventured onto this game. My Husband and Son have been plaing this game for a while, and to be honest, it is great viewing as well as playing. But I wanted to have a go myself and see just what all the fishy fun was about. Cue my guy, Wilhelm. Wilhelm is going great guns. He has 3 rods; Kenny 'Fishing' Powers, Ray Bream-ero and Doug Heffer-Carp. The delight in pulling in a fish that takes a while to land is thrilling and just so satifying. An Acheivement that is as unexpected as it is awesome. So about the game; well, go through the tutorial or Acadamy to learn the basics- if you know nothing as I did then this is the  place where your fishy education begins. Then feel free to go and complete the challenges you have unlocked, or free fishing and just enjoy the game's beautiful ambience. The graphics, the fish detail, the weather, the sounds within this game are just fantastic. Immersive and peaceful. The gentle plopping of fish as they leap out of the water, or the sound of the wind as it begins to rise (shadow detail also shows the tree shadows moving in the wind) or the pitter patter of rain. I just simply love playing. There are levels to go up, a skill tree for tackle and bait. Earning Tackle Points as you catch fish, complete challenges and finish tournaments (the latter has either a live daily match or in game AI tournaments) means that you can develop your fisher-person to be the best in every field or go for one particular area of expertise. There is nothing quite like landing your first big carp, or first fish, but the ultimate (next to Boss Fish) is catching a HUGE Catfish!!!! Notes on gameplay: -* Have patience. Learn the tension gradients that are applicable to your tackle- losing a fish that you have spent 5 minutes reeling in only for it to get away can be gutting. Learn your rod's capability* Equip your net at 4yrds or less to get the instant land- anything above 4 and you wont be able to manouvre the net to catch the fish. * Screenshots are addictive- But awesome to show off those catches that made you feel proud. Please do take a peek at mine if you would like to see the look of the fish. * Character choice is limited- but there is no need to have a full on customisation option when all you see mostly is the back of your character. * Learn about the rigs, the best bait for that rig and go fishing where the fish you want to catch hang out. * Read the Boss Fish Menu and descriptions they are awesome* Don't be disheartened Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is the best tacklebox- take your time and have fun with the game. * Make as many fish related puns as you can- this is a source of never ending amusment. Life is but a Bream :-) * Slow life down for an hour! Take the small joy of a days fishing and be at peace. No traffic, no bosses moaning, no stress- just one rod at a time, one fishy at a time Enjoy and 'Carp-i' Diem ;-P AngelDelight81 xx			"

												This was touted as a new frontier in realistic fishing simulation, but unfortunately it is far from finished if that is the actual goal. I bought it during EA with the assumption that the game was going to be improved by leaps and bounds. This is not the case at all with very minimal gameplay updates in my opinion. Sega Bass Fishing type games were more arcadey, but had heaps more depth and appeal than this game does. It is a shame because I was really hyped for a great fishing simulation experience that was advertised. Avoid this one is my conclusion.. doesn't look like it will ever get anywhere near good.			"

												ok so I'm only 6hrs into this but heres my first impressions.man did we ever need a eruo based fishing title! so damn tired of bass spinning. the physics in this are very impressive BUT they are let down hugely by the outdated graphics, I ve seen others post about the water effects and have to say yeah they are at least 10yrs out of date, even fantasy mmo's have better water visuals than this, and for a game based on water thats pretty bad. The fish fights are great, you can really get a sense of the fish, ONLY if you ignore the fact that visually your line is entering the water 2 feet from your feet when the fish is somewhere in mid pool. the 30 fps means that on a high end system things are just not smooth. the camera positioning is bad most of the time, Course fishing is still not on the horizon and is a big hole in the title, when it comes it will need a huge graphics update to make float watching even possible and i suspect that is one of the reasons for the delay.with all these negatives you will wonder why I have it recommended??? well a coulpe of reasons, firstly because its euro based and secondly it has very impressive fish mechanics where normally games fish are spawned, euro fishing goes to the next level of having the lake and its inhabitants being ""live"", no mean feat.considering the potential market in europe alone, this title (with updates graphics) could be a goldmine.

												This was a great game to begin with, although it had its issues. Graphics are not great even on Ultra. Casting took a bit of time to learn but not that hard. The baits that you carry with you in game do not hold their descriptions, only their name, so it is hard to remeber what hook it goes best with and what fish to target. The biggest killer for me was adding AUTO-NETTING. This took the thrill out of the game for me. Before auto-netting, I was able to really battle fish to the edge of the lake and then try and aim my net whilst tilting my rod. Had me in all sorts of weird positions haha but it was fun. I logged in today, noticed auto net feature, and had to wait several times with a fish at my feet and no way to net it because the games decided the fish was not ""tired"" enough. Now, the game is boring and repetitive. There was some resistance to the auto-net feature on the forums, and this was ignored by the developers. They should have allowed auto-netting as an OPTION, not as the only way to play. Well done devs, you killed this game for me. Do not bother buying if you want action, its no longer there.UPDATE 20/Oct/2016:After not receiving an answer on the forums about a possible re-implementation of the manual-netting option, I contacted the support team at DTG. Scott from DTG answered me quite quickly and was very professional. Unfortunately, it seems while the team is considering the re-introduction of this much needed game mechanic, there is nothing further to announce on the topic. This means I am shelving the game. Without the action and the thrill that manual-netting brings, I am afraid that no further updates will make a difference towards my enjoyment of the game. I would have liked to continue playing whilst other updates were being worked on, but there is no point if I cant have fun. This post is not meant to be inflammatory, it only aims to provide people who feel the same way an opportunity to think about whether or not this game is worth their money. If you enjoy a good arcade fishing game, then pick this up because you will get some enjoyment out of it. If you want a simulator that gives you more options rather than taking them away, perhaps you should wait until the manual-netting option is re-introduced and is set in stone, at which point my review of this game will be positive. If you find yourself getting bored really fast, chances are its the arcade style netting mechanic.As it stands I find myself getting increasingly frustrated when I have a tiny roach sitting at the edge of a lake, mean-mugging me and laughing at me, behind the safety of the auto-netting mechanic, while it builds mud castles at my feet before it gets tired enough for me to automatically pick up. It makes me feel like tenderly kissing it on the head before launching the little bas#%!$ across the water of the lake like a flatrock.In any case, I would once again like to thank Scott from DTG support for listening to my reasoning and getting back to me so quickly. If you are not getting any responses on the STEAM forum, give the support team a try, as they do listen and may be able to let you know how long you may be waiting before an aspect on the game you currently dislike may be rectified. So to conclude, if you are after a decent arcade fishing experience by all means pick this game up. If you think auto-netting will affect your enjoyment, wait until it manual-netting is re-introduced. It may take 6 months, a year, who knows really, but the game might be cheaper by then.			"

												I got this game yesterday and played roughly for about 5 hours. I have never before played a fishing simulator yet it was easy to pick up the basics. After figuring out how to set up my tacklebox I enjoyed catching fish in one of the beautiful lakes in the game. Although fishing is a patience game, it is still quite dynamic and you won't feel bored. The graphics in this game are nice and the fish are really detailed, my computer couldn't really handle the game so I played at the 'low preset' but it was still all really good looking! I recommend this game if you want a fishing simulator!			"

								Very good fishing simulation with beautiful graphics.  The 2 things that are taking away from the game for me are: 1) Netting is the most difficult part of catching the fish which is silly. 2) I play with a mouse and keyboard and usually the only indication I have a fish on the line is a beeping sound; this really dispels any illusion of the fishing experience.  Get rid of the beeping sound altogether; the bend of the rod, the sound of the reel, the erratic movement of the line in the water.  Those should be the indications that you have a fish going for the bait.**update**I just caught a fish without having that beeping sound let me know the fish was on the line and it was great.  The rod bent and the reel started spooling out; so much more realistic.			"

								Not a bad effort for an early release. Casting is easy enough with some nice aftertouches. Hopefully we will have the ability to customise terminal tackle, baiting options, spodding, PVA bags etc etc. A underwater camera would be a nice but not entirely neccesary touch.I would like to be able to use a marker float so I could plumb around for features etc. Would make the enitre experience more rewarding rather than the current cast and catch mechanic.Bite alarms would be a welcome addition.Sponsorship gained through winning matches would also give some sort of career progression. Better rods, reels, tackle, bait, bite alarms, customisable bivvies etc. "

The visuals i game are gorgeous, from the lighting to the movement of the grass near by.. Very nice looking game, runs perfectly on my setup ( full rez ).. only thing i can fault it on is the baits that can be used. It would be nice to have a feature where you could mix your own ground bait and add attractors to the baits and having more species of fish would be nice too.. Cant have everything right.. But other than that i love this game, the modeling of the fish is great, it actually looks like a mirror carp when you catch it compaired to other games on here that just use the basic shape of a very large carp..

												I think most of the negative reviews come from bad experiences pre- and early launch. A lot of the bugs and issues have been fixed now, so I can definetely recommend this game. It may not be the best fishing simulator, but it is still an enjoyable game.A few positive points:- An in-game shop with a very extensive set of possibilities for your tackle boxes: reels, rods, lines, hooks, baits...- Several fish species: multiple carp species, catfish, bream, roach...- different bed types: silt, gravel and weed. You have to keep this in mind when choosing your hooks and bait.- Enjoyable and relaxing ambient sound.- The thrill to keep fishing to get to the top of the leaderboards, and/or set a personal best. There's also your profile with statistics and fish species and bosses you have already/not caught. Each lake has its own unique bosses.- There are also online tournaments, tutorials, AI competitions and minigames which all reward in-game currency and xp.Negative points:- A few graphical bugs.- The time to wait for a fish to bite is sometimes too long.- Some players find casting too hard. I find it easy (after a bit of practice).In general this is a very good game, but for some people this may be too expensive because you can get bored soon.			"

								Great game, you can see the fish swimming about, you can see bubbles, ripples, fish jumping, and when you get a take you can ether get a screamer or a soft touch, but the line will move under the rod showing that an actual a.i fish has picked up your bait and is moving about with it, you can set up your 3 rods and fish a pre selected rig, chod, gravel, silt depending on the bottom, or you can walk around with a single rod and cast to showing fish, the game is in a very early state right now but is better than anything else ive played,  multiplayer will be put in at end so expect lots of weekend competitions and a good communtiy and the graphics are great too, casting follows real physics and can take alot to master.    only one pond at the moment but you only need one pond at this stage, you cant choose your rods or custom baits but theirs options to indicate that will come, the spod rod is present to bait up with  and you can line clip spod and rods to hit your spot everytime, you can pull back you rod mid cast to hit your line clip, this is a great tool for any novice angler to practise with if they never have carp fished, used a spod or dont understand the line clip, and ive proven to myself on this game that being pro-active will get you a fish on the bank, it adopts sit and wait or go to the fish tactics.

												SIgh.  I really wanted to like this game, and in truth I did for a short while.  Obviously some things need to be fixed, and added for this to be a decent fishing simulator.  I would expect setting the hook, casting baits as a bare minimum.  The reason I've given up on the game?  Casting sucks.  They have this free casting mode where you wildly swing your mouse backwards and forward and cross your fingers that its a good cast.  Its pathetic.  I understand its about timing, but the game is so choppy that the timing is probably being thrown off.  This combined with the 3rd person at a random angle POV, means you can't aim properly.  I would say 1/10 casts goes where you want it to go.  Maybe 3/10 are ""acceptable"" and you just leave it where it landed.  For free fishing and tourneys--no problem, but if you do any of the challenges, its simply impossible.  I would say remove the challenges until you fix the mechanics of your game.  I may check this game out again in a few months, but only if an update has been made.			"

								Let me level with you. I've never been fishing in my life and I've never been tempted to do so. But even from the perspective of someone who has no interest in the actual sport this game already seems really addictive, and appears to be a realistic representation of the real thing. Bearing in mind the fact that the game is currently in very early access you get a fully formed tutorial and some casting challenges to start things off. The game looks fantastic too. Here's my first look video:

												un peu dur a prendre en main  surtout pour les lancers. Mais une fois maitriser, c'est juste un plaisir. la peche a l'etat pur. La recherche du poisson, la préparation des lignes, le combat, le plaisir de mettre au sec un gros poisson, la deception quend il casse la ligne. tout y est.les moins: -les lancers très dur a maitriser                - au début on est un peu perdu au niveaux de la jouabilité                - pas assez de zone de peche               - a quand la peche au leurre avec du gros brochets, sandre et j'en passe ? les plus: -un graphisme agréable              -des combats intenses et qui peuvent durer un moment               -le materiel assez rapide a debloquer              - des poissons enormes ( dont un silure de 45kg qui m'as mis un combat de 40 mn)Bref un bon jeu de peche qui se doit d'evoluer pur devenir le jeu de peche ultime.

												TL:DR Best fishing game on SteamPros: has 2 casting modes so accessible for newbs or veterans of fishing games         looks pretty nice         goes well with rum         nice rapid competition format         good balance between fun & infuriating         my sports fishing nerd neighbour loves it         good variety of fish/equips types/sizes         very moreish         on sale for under a £10 at the momentCons: Havent found a high res option          no Pike/Perch/trout/salmon         doesnt appear to be a way to change character without exiting gameVerdictUp there with the original Pool Nation as 1 of my favourite sports games for under a tenner.  Yeah it has some flaws but the good outweighs the bad by far IMHO.  Great game to play with a few friends, bottle or 2 of rum & no swear jar.			"

								Dovetail Fishing, one of the best simulators I tried. I feels like the real fishing at a lake. The simulator has been redone in Unreal 4 and is it better than the Train Simulator game engine, yeah! The fishing experience is really realistic and you will have more chances to find fish. This is one of the best simulators in the market. Comparing this to other fishing simulator games, I find that Euro Fishing is better. So if you are intrested in fishing...

												I must change my mind on this game, when I purchased into the EA it was supposed to be general fishing, and they switched to only euro fishing. It was what I was looking for originally, and no longer is due to a direction change by the dev team. Does it make it a bad game? Not sure. It's not what I'm looking for and that's what I base my recommendation on. You might like it, you might hate it. I've not played it since EA when they switched.			"

												More bugs than your bait box and more arcade than the simulator the developers claim it is. Limited tackle and baits which only make me think they will try and sell us the missing content as DLC. Buy this game now at your own risk, if you want a fishing experience for the time being play fishing planet, its free and gets regular patches/updates.I want to like this game and it DOES have some good points but the fact that its such a limited experience and the fishing mechanics are so disappointing make me regret buying this game, should have thrown the money at Fishing Planet instead.This title is at a crossroad, get DLC greedy and watch this game be niche at best. All it will take is fishing planet to drop some European fishing locations and you guys will be in trouble, unless ofcourse you manage to dupe more ppl at the steam store.			"

Early Access Review
								So this game is very early in development so I cant say a whole lot on it right now.  However what is available right now seems to be running pretty smooth.  Its a lot of fun to wrestle the fish once it is caught, the graphics right now are pretty decent, the skill level required right now makes it a bit too easy but hopefully that will change over time.  I cant recommend this game in its current state.  I would wait until its full release before purchasing it.With all that being said my only fear is that this game will be a play to win type of game.  If you want to catch that bigger fish then you're going to need to spend real money to get that tougher fishing line and so on and so forth.  Really hope that isnt the direction this company is headed, but I have a huge hunch that it is sadly.			"

Early Access Review
								//First release alpha review:ENG:The coolest & the most realistic fishing game on Steam, but...The game is cheap, but very little content. Game info and ads does can confuse users and the game is not really as big as it looks. The game is really Early Access the game.The game is on the one hand, therefore, difficult to evaluate and write reviews because the game is not really enough significant content, which could be something to say.The game is and looks promising, but the game missing a lot of things, what i like to see in this game. The game is not really any free-form fishing game such as Rapala Pro Fish game, even this game have ""Freeroam mode"". The game is on the other hand does work, but it should be much more greatly simplify the mechanics of the game, which would be more content and less visual beauty.More than that the game is like most of the cheap games, so on the desktop fish in the fishing game where you fish place.In the game there is only one game mode and one of the really small ""pond"" fish place and one fish species at this time. The player can not even change the place of the fish pond and walk freely in the environment. The game does not include a lake or sea fishing or even a motor boat rides.Also fish in artificial intelligence does not seem to be very good or even the environment seems to be enough interaction or vitalization and the environment there is not much else in life.The player can not change the gear or fishing supplies and the game will also be maybe possible to include additional content later on a charge even though the game may not be worth it.The game is missing a second over the fishing feeling, because the fishing area seems like it would be an empty place, and the game area seem plausible. In the game there is no other artificial intelligence fishermen, which would be a nice addition to the game, so the player is quite lonely when the game is also not have a multiplayer game mode.It is, frankly, this is a lightweight desktop fishing game. The game run the same as ice fishing or angling fishing, so this is not a hardcore fishing game.Sad to say also, that even the cat could cry this game, because the cat would not be able to fish the cats do not have enough fish to offer. x3I fear only that the game is going to be a long time Early Access the game, even years. Very few of the game is not over yet reached the level of the Early Acces. So the game can stay many players short-lived.I can recommend the game, but I would recommend the game actually later if the game actually add more content. :3//Ensimmäinen alpha julkaisu version arvostelu:FIN:Tyylikkäin ja realistisin kalastuspeli Steamissa, mutta...Peli on halpa, mutta todella vähän sisältöä. Pelin esittely ja mainokset hämäävät käyttäjää, eikä peli ole oikeastaan niin iso kuin miltä näyttää. Peli on siis todella Early Acces peli.Pelissä on siis toisaalta vaikea arvioida ja kirjoittaa arvostelua, koska pelissä ei ole oikeastaan riittävästi merkittävää sisältöä, josta voisi jotakin sanoa.Peli on ja näyttää lupaavalta, mutta pelistä puuttuu todella paljon asioita vielä, mitä itse haluasin nähdä pelissä olevan. Peli ei varsinaisesti ole mikään vapaa muotoinen kalastus peli kuten Rapala Pro Fish -peli. Peli on toisaalta ihan toimiva, mutta pitäisi paljon enemmän huomattavasti yksinkertaisemmasta peli mekaniikasta, jossa olisi enemmän sisältöä ja vähemmän visuaalista kauneutta.Enemmänkin peli on kuten useimmat halvat pelit niin, työpödältä kalastettava kalastus peli, jossa kalastetaan paikaltaan.Pelissä ei ole kuin yksi peli muoto oikeastaan ja yksi pieni ""lampi"" kalapaikka sekä yksi kala laji tällähetkellä. Pelaaja ei pysty myöskään vaihtamaan kala paikkaa lammella, eikä kävelemään vapaasti ympäristössä. Peli ei siis sisällä järvi tai meri kalastusta tai vaikkapa moottori veneellä ajelua.Pelaaja ei voi myöskään vaihtaa asusteita tai kalastustarvikkeita ja peli tulee myös ehkä mahdollisesti sisältämään myöhemmin maksullista lisäsisältöä vaikka peli ei välttämättä ole sen arvoinen.Myöskään kalojen tekoäly ei vaikuta kovinkaan hyvältä eikä edes ympäristössä tunnu riittävää vuorovaikutusta tai elävöitymistä sekä ympäristössä ei ole paljoa muuta elämää.Pelistä puuttuu toistaalta kalastus fiilis, koska kalastus alue tuntuu kuin se olisi tyhjään luotu, eikä peli alue tunnu uskottavalta. Pelissä ei ole myöskään muita tekoäly kalastajia, mitkä olisivat kiva lisä peliin, joten pelaaja on varsin yksinäinen kun pelissä ei ole myöskään moninpeliä.Kyseessä on suoraan sanoen, tämä on kevyt työpöytä kalastuspeli. Peli ajaa saman kuin pilkillä tai ongella kalastus, eli ei ole kyseessä hardcore kalastuspeli.Surullista sanoa myös, että jopa kissakin voisi itkeä tätä peliä, koska kissa ei voisi kalastaa kun kissalle ei ole riittävästi kalaa tarjota. x3Pelkäänpä vain, että peli tulee olemaan pitkään Early Access peli, jopa vuosia. Monikaan peli ei ole päässyt vieläkään yli Early Acces tasosta. Joten peli voi jäädä monella pelaajalla lyhyt ikäiseksi.Voin suositella peliä, mutta suosittelisin peliä varsinaisesti myöhemmin jos pelissä olisi oikeasti lisää sisältöä. :3			"

												Sadly, real fishing is more fun than this heap.  I wish I would have gone real fishing, then I could have broken a useless fishing rod which I'd never use again instead of my mouse which I use all the time.  Actually, figuring out how to post this review without a mouse was less frustrating than learning how to cast in this game.Spent 15 minutes on the first tutorial which is supposed to teach you how to cast.  Introduction is buggy and the game runs terrible on ultra settings.  Character selection is super limited to 8 premade toons, most of which have disproportionatly sized heads.  I name Big Earl and set off to learn to fish.  I have to spend approx 8 minutes of that first 15 holding ""E"" to claim my peg.  Why?  There is no one there, in fact, there is no one else around in view at all.  Anywhere.  Hold on, just a few more seconds holding the E key.  Wait.  Aaaaaaaaand.  Nope.   Ok, now you've claimed your peg.  Inventory, ok, lengthy explanation of how to cast, sigh, ok.  A few more minutes of blathering and I can finally try to cast.  I try and fail at total control casting about 30 times in a row.  I'm actually quite sure it was really just the first failure, and despite being told if I fail I can just reel in and try again, I can't.  I haven't been told how to reel, so pressing that button doesn't work.  I have to quit, load up freeplay, fail around for another 10 minutes where I am finally prompted to press R to reset a failed cast.  I go back to the first tutorial, I fail the cast again, but pressing R works!  Magic!  Why was I not told in the tutorial?  After another 5 minutes I finally complete the casting tutorial.  I load up the second tutorial, and promptly fail casting again.  First steam refund.  That's how bad this is.  I have 350+ games and I return...this one.  Worst game I've played in a very long time.  Dovetail Games, I hope you have medical and/or psychiatric help covered in your employee benefits because anyone involved with this probably wants to kill themselves.  P.S. Good luck trying to sell $5000 in Train Simulator DLC.			"

												Fishing. I love it all my life. It was the only thing my Father and I did together as I grew up.My dad was a student of fishing. By that I mean, he tied flies, he read,  etc. I started fishing in England.Catching Roach, and other river, stream, fish.This game doesn't remind me much of my fishing experiences through life. I live on the shores of Georgian Bay, Ontario.Muskoka region, and all around there are a huge divesity of fish here in Wasaga Beach.  Sturgeon in the Nottawasaga, rainbow trout runs up the river from Bay. Salmon, carp, catfish, brook trout, brown trout. What I'm saying is a title with ""simulation"" in it, should at least try to be realistic.Its a sterile, boring, bland, and not realistic to my fishing days. I'm not saying the ""type"" of fishing is what I don't like, its the game play, that's way off.  I wasn't hoping for much more, but this is taking bare bones a bit too far.If this is the only type of fishing you Europeans can do, save up and come to Canada. You will then feell like you've really fished. And see again how far off this ""Simulation"" is.Graphics ...bland, weak colours, water is from circa 2005.  No underwater shots, to see the fish use its particular abilities to throw the hook and run with the bail screaming on your reel.  The sense of weight, the feel like you are working something toward you, careful guiding it around obstacles , lowering rod tip when you think the Fish is about to jump. Basic stuff .  But not even that. All you have to do, is basically Horse the fish in. No light tackle option to really use skill in playing a fish inI can't recommend this game to anyone,  Its just a shell of a game.5 perch out of 10.   There are no fish in school in this game, they're all drop outs.			"

A good enough concept; graphics are reasonably solid, equipment is diverse, and there are good sized fishing locales which can be roamed pretty freely. Cooperative play works well in my limited experience playing this way, however be aware that another player can stand literally on top of you, completelyt obscuring your view and making it almost impossible to see, and therein do, anything at all--something as ironic as it is nonsensical, given that another player is cannot, supposedly, fish the same spot as you concomitantly ('Pegged' areas become player unique territories once pegged by any single player). This just one example of how poor game design makes Euro fishing contravene its own intentions. And logic.Euro Fishing is ultimately  rendered frustrating and not really worth playing owing to bugs, and some extremely poor mechanics--specifically the striking and netting features. Both are awkward, clunky,  drudgerous  and generally difficult to negotiate with a keyboard & mouse setup. With respect to the former,  you have to really slide backwards with your mouse very quickly (and quite excessively)  quite a distance to succesfully sink in a strike which may or may not bug out irregardless of line tension. It's not easy to get right, and Lag spikes compund this problem considerably.The netting mechanic is, quite simply, spectacularly and singularly awful, and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up or done away with entirely. Because you cannot simueltaneously control your rod (with fish on) and the net at the same time, it is extremely difficult to orientate either so they allign, which is what you need to do in order to succesfully land a fish. What5 this tends to result in  ( along with many, many lost fish) is aa kind of rage-inspiring comedy of errors to the tune of:Reel in fish a little closer to the bank. Pick up net. Fish takes out more line, making iut impossible to net fish.  Drop net. Reel in fish a little. Pick up net. Net not at correct angle in order to allign with fish. Drop net. Repeat x3. Get frustrated. Attempt to skulldrag fish in as close to the bank as possible in order to compensate for abysmal ( and entirely not sensitive enough) netting mechanic. Drag suddenly gooes from not tight enough to too tight. Line breaks, lose fish.And over and over ad nauseam.Perhaps the system is easier to negotiate with a controller. I have not played Euro fishing this way.In any case, the game feels rushed, malformed , and  compared to something like fishing planet, is more annoying than it is enjoyable--additionally, there's not enough that's great about about it to allow one to look past its considerable and multivariate problems.Score:3/10.

								It is limited in what you can do so far, however what there is play makes excited for the next stages. The casting is pretty realistic and fairly easy to get the hang of. Catching and reeling in the fish seems like it still needs to some work. Since the pond is so small it doesn't take much for the fish to get into the weeds and snap the line. It would be cool to have a picture in picture of fish undewater as you try to reel it in.			"

								Nice Game and comes with nice graphics and ambient sounds of a usual  lake setting with birds chirping and fish splashing,bees buzzin which is very relaxing and the ocasional plane overhead now and again.There is one lake atm with many cast off areas or pegs to choose from.Gameplay is good and the fish put up a good fight and sets the realism nicely,taking your time is a given and if your too hasty you will lose that fish easy  :)Casting is achieved with mouse movements back and forth while holding rmb and then a  rmb release,easy to pick up once you get the hang of it after a few practice casts and has a wee tutorial with some mini tasks Am only new but the last patch(phase 4 i think) looks like it has brought the game forward immensely on the right track and im looking forward to the bright future of this game from the devs ,this game is probably the best fishing game ive played even in its early access stage,from fishing games on my tablet and so forth from google play store etc etc There is only currently carp in the lake which i was a bit disappointed  also with a lack of content as i fish for pike in real life  but no matter a fish is a fish and im currently at a catch of 20lbsAlso there is currently no multiplayer BUT there is a leaderboard in game which the devs monitor and there you are put into a competition on the forums which is worth a looksie based on your leaderboard achivements,its still something to tide players over till more updates come .

								Not worth the $ in its current state - its more of a simulator proof of concept, with a few gaming components. The tutorials and challenges are a good start, but the freemode fishing is limited to a single venue, and one type of fish - Carp. No multiplayer, no campaign, no career & no shop (although its planned). The game is missing content - which is to be expected of an early release. A leaderboard mechanism is in place though...Look forward to future developments :-)			"

												Improved a lot since launch. Devs seems to be very active and that is good! Monster carps are still way too easy.Live tournaments: very aadictive. The bad thing is sometimes you catch the fish and it doesnt count towards your score. Im pretty sure its nothing to do with UNIQUE catch. 4/10. Worth: £5,- MAX at current state. (edit 6/10.

												Bought this game while it was in Beta....It wasn't that bad during Beta......Once it was fully released the creators got sloppy and greedy....Offered it to M.S changed the coding and the gaming errors started, bad patches, game killing patches, having to roll back patches.... Game via XBOX ONE and PC is unplayable, constant problems and crashes....DTG are more interested in selling the Live Tournaments than fixing the game, you can't even complete the Tournament without a Fatal Error game crash.... and even to that point you will be pulling your hair out because of other problems.DTG need to do a complete Roll Back to BETA - simple as that, they've made a bundle of cash from this game, so they need to start again with experienced programmers.... or they will will have screwed many people over with a game that should never have left BETA.Until then, AVOID.

												Not going to lie, it has its issues. Now with that most sims do, and they are still working on it which is good.  But it keeps me playing so it's doing something right. The fishing is much more real than most ""sim"" games that are mainly arcadish style fishing, which is fun. I myself wanted something more real, and this is it for the price you can not really beat it. A lot of reels/rods/baits/line/rigs you can unlock (ingame monies that is free not microtrans at all so you don't have to worry about that. The graphics are pretty good for most sims, they could be better but like I said they do still do updates which is awesome so it could change. The physics are pretty good, need slight weaking, and like lines bug out some and not snag/break really really fast randomly(that is very very rare though). But all in all I would say if you want a good fish sim you could play with yourself, or friends online get this. For the price it's a steal even at 19.99usd, I got it when it was EA so it was like 8. I tried many fishing sims, and most either tried to hard to be complex, or were way too simple, this one is about right.  Boss fish for an extra bonus to try to catch them all is a awesome thing too.			"

												I simply CANNOT recommend a game where a fish can snap your line if you have 0% drag set.  That is one HUGE problem that must be addressed before I even consider the possibility of considering to reinstall this pile of failure.  Other problem include, but are not limited to:- fishing line flying in random/odd directions when using the True Cast system- gear being unlocked in your tackle store but not being able to be put in a tacklebox- curvature of the fishing pole is not smooth, but rather straight lines at angles to give the impression of curve- mouse sensitivity slider is either super fast or super slow, no variation in between (I had to fine tune using mouse drivers to find the right dps)Fishing Planet is free (yes it does have its own problems but not as bad as this game) and feels way more polished.  This game still feels like it gets taken care of when other games are taken care of first.			"

												This is not a fishing simulator.The fights arent really fights.The interface is terrible.And forget about using the basic cast control.  They ""offer"" this is as an alternative but it casts to the same spot every time and you can't pan left or right so you're locked into where they decide you're going to cast.The mechanics are whacked.... on a one hour day, clear sky, it takes three times as long or more to get a bite compared to clear skies using  a three hour day.Truth is I don't know how long it takes to get a bite.I tried two separate days and gave  up on both days after a game hour.it's terrible.  don't waste the cash on a ""maybe it could be ok"".Seriously.Namaste			"

												I'm really enjoying Euro Fishing so far. Once you're done with the tutorials and you've tried a few of the casting challenges, the moment you get a bite in the real game is actually really exciting.  I've been badgering another friend to try out the multiplayer with me and we tried it for the first time today and had a lot of fun.  Seeing his score go up as he caught things was really exciting.  The true test of a good sim (in my opinion) is whether it stays with you between plays, making you want to try out something new you've thought of, or try and do something better. This certainly did that for me, so I can very much recommend it.			"

Posted: November 11, 2015
Preface: This review is a ""compare & contrast"" with another popular fishing title released around the same time, Fishing Planet. I like both and think they're both quality titles, but they do different things well and will satisfy different tastes. This review is meant to help you decide which one you might prefer. I wrote a similar review for FP, and will update both when FP comes out of early access.+Enjoyable, pleasant environments you can actually exploreDTG's Euro Fishing really nails the old adage ""There's more to fishing than the fish."" The different lakes have a real sense of place, and they're all beautiful locations that are a pleasure to be in. This is helped by the ability to actually walk around each location and fish from different areas. Being able to explore and discover your own favorite spots adds a lot to the feeling of authenticity. While Fishing Planet may have a greater diversity in locations and environments, only a few tiny areas in each place are open to you. +Nice photo-op payoffs after landing a fishAfter landing each fish, DTG's Euro Fishing gives you a little photo-op with your catch. This might sound silly, but it actually adds a lot to the game by providing a sense of closure to each catch and a sense of personality to the fish. It's why Euro Fishing is one of only 2 games I ever bother to screencap (the other being Kerbal Space Program).+The fish look really goodThe fish themselves are well done, and thanks to the photo-ops you get some time to really look at them. Fishing Planet's fish look good, but not nearly this good (and w/o a good photo-op moment, you never get a clear look at them anyways).+Real MultiplayerYou can play multiplayer matches with other people on the same lake. FP, while ostensibly an MMO, is so highly instanced its multiplayer is basically a chatroom added to a single-player game. That said, both communities are very friendly and helpful, and FP's multiplayer features haven't been fully implemented yet.+Actual casting mechanicsThis is a blessing and a curse. Casting is an actual skill to master in DTG's Euro Fishing, which makes it satisfying when done well and frustrating when it impedes you from catching fish. Landing the perfect cast to catch a unique fish you know is hiding in *that* weed bed feels like an accomplishment. Casting your rig into your foot over and over again for 10 minutes gets aggravating. FP's casting is much easier, but is nothing more than a power meter.+Real ""unique"" fishMost areas have a number of unique named fish. Since IRL people fish stocked, managed lakes where you must release your catch, some fish gain names and reputations (one famous carp even received a burial from anglers after it died of old age). These unique fish are well-implemented, and catching one is a fun accomplishment. They go a long way toward adding personality to each location. FP's unique fish don't have nearly this much to them, and seem to be just very large specimens of the species.-Not much variety of environmentsAll of the locations in DTG's Euro Fishing are stocked lakes. While you can walk around and explore them all, they all lend themselves to the same kind of fishing. Compare that with FP, which has a much greater diversity of location types.-Not much variety of fishing stylesDTG's Euro Fishing currently has one kind of fishing: ledgering. This is a rather sedentary form of catching fish, where a weight holds your line to the lake bed and you wait for a fish to pick up your hook & bait. Float fishing will be added in a future free DLC, but currently you only get to do one kind of fishing: ledgering for carp & coarse fish. Fishing Planet supports both float and spin fishing. Spin fishing in particular is a much more active method of angling, and FP even recognizes different techniques and styles of presenting the lure.-Not much variety of fishLake fishing for carp & other coarse fish is the focus of DTG's Euro Fishing. No trout, no pike, no crappie, no bass, no salmon etc.-Not much equipmentEuro Fishing's selection of gear is pretty small, and the descriptions do a mediocre job of explaining what it all does. Fishing Planet has a dizzying amount of gear, which supports its greater variety of target fish, locations and fishing styles.-Landing mechanic is a messNetting & landing fish is barely functioning at the moment. It beats FP's landing mechanic (it has none), but it won't take much for FP to release something far superior.-Mediocre water effectsA fishing game really needs better water. It doesn't cripple the game, but it doesn't compare well to the water in Fishing Planet. Considering how much time you spend staring at it, I'd have hoped for something more convincing.-Weak NPE (new player experience)Euro Fishing's tutorial is mediocre, but it actually has one (which is more than can be said for FP). However, it does has a really helpful series of videos to help those completely new to coarse fishing. Unfortunately, the lack of a wiki will hamper those who want to dive deep into the game. This is a similar issue with FP, which lacks a real tutorial but has a great WIP wiki.			"

Early Access Review
								With Phase 6, I think it's even clearer than before that this game is going to turn out to be something good. It started out as a very solid, albeit bare, fishing game, but with every update features are added, and mechanics are dialed in some more. The team seems to be listening intently and working hard to put out as much win in every update as they possibly can.This update brings a working multiplayer mode, which consists of the training lake (only) and up to 4 (iirc) other people fishing. There is a (half-working atm) chat function that lets players on a lake share tips and brag about big catches, which is very cool (if I see someone landing many fish, I tend to ask what bait they're using). Using chat while on a peg is problematic, though, due to the hotkeys for keyboard controls not being disabled while focus is on the chat box. My whole peg has been closed many times because I tried to chat, heh. The chat box also has a bad habit of ignoring sentences. Other than that, multiplayer is definitely working and enjoyable.The quality of the fishing experience gets better with every update (imo), and the team behind it stay on the forums, getting feedback and making changes based on what they see and hear. Force feedback on a 360 controller is much improved, and the controls, for the most part, make sense. However, general consensus is that a mouse gives much better control of power for accurate casting. You carry a tackle box and up to three fishing rods, and gain new gear by spending money earned from catching fish. Lake bed conditions and other factors make the careful choosing of bait and gear an important part of the process, as well as knowing a good spot or two. One can have 3 fishing rods baited and in the water at a time, and alarms on each rod (audible + light) let you know if something is nibbling and running with anything.There are occasional bugs (flying fish, SPOD-arm until restart), but nothing too bad. After the features get hammered out better I am sure that the few there are will be dealt with accordingly.If you like fishing and video games, this is a pretty safe bet. Just don't expect it to be a polished experience at this time.			"

												I really enjoy this game and after being able to upgrade my rod, reel, hooks, and bait/lures I'm starting to catch the bigger fish on the bigger lakes. I have a ton of fun playing this game and find the environments and ambience really relaxing. I don't actually use the feature where you can lay down rods and watch for bobbers just because the type of fishing I usually do results in me catching a fish pretty quickly. Various types of carp to 80LB Catfish. I have tons of screenshots for the different types of fish that I catch. I've had nothing but fun playing this game and have played the multiplayer a few times. The multiplayer is pretty much the same as single player but there are other people fishing at other parts of the lake, or at the spot right next to you. I'm sorry a lot of people haven't been able to run this game or have had bad luck catching more varieties of fish. I have about 50 hours in this game at the time of writing this review and I have a blast every time I play.			"

								The fact that these guys made a fishing game and not a zombie game is the only reason you need to buy it. I would also not listen to any bad reviews about this game becuase they have no clue how to fish. For the price currently it is totally worth it, and this game can only get better.I will not do a full review yet, but i shall provide my thoughts for now.Pros:             -Looks great             -Casting is easy, they give you tutorials to practice             -You can walk around and choose your spots             -Game sounds are good             -Catching a fish is so much fun :)             -The DEVS are great and listen to what we sayCons:             -Still Alpha (duh!)             -Only one type fish (not sure if there are more but i did not see any)             -The fish fighting Mechanics needs work, currently looks like a stump drifting in the watermy alpha rating is 8/10, and i cant wait to see what is next!!!!Awsome :)			"

								So, fihing is one of my great passions, and generally angling games are not!Why? Most angling sims are based around American sport fishing and that's just not my scene. The exception was a now quite old title called Fishsim, which ticked many boxes but fell short of the complete feeling package as a true angling simulator.>>>Carp anglers take NOTE, this game is sponsoed by Korda!!<<<Enter DTG Fishing, an alpha build game/sim that a mate told me about here on Steam. I viewed about 20 seconds of the first intro video and my money was out of my wallet. If youre an angler and you're looking for a REAL angling simulator, moreover a Carp fishing simulator then head over to the DTG Fishing store page and see for youself.It's got beautiful scenery, true to life looking water, bivvies, swims and buckets. Realistic sounds and a feeling that you really could be back on the bank. The detail comes right down even at this early stage, to clipping up a cast, feathering a cast and an awesome casting mechanic with realistic rod compression and lead trajectory.I'm going to revisit my review as the game develops but for now a solid 8/10 from me already, just for the intent that the dev's have shown on what I think will become THE angling sim.

								I didn't know a lot about this title, but I figured $8 is pretty cheap with I believe more future content to come, so it could've gone either way with myself liking the game/sim or it being a dissapointment.  I am liking the game a lot.  It is relaxing and I like how you can do all the fishing with just your mouse.  Several control aspects of fishing are covered.  The mechanics are well done, and it takes a while before you learn the tricks to pull a carp out of the lake.I'm not the Steam expert, but this, imo, is definetly one of the best deals I know of on Steam before the Christmas 2014 sale hits.  So make some room on your desk and fish using your mouse.My review is good for the Nov 11, 2014 version of the game for $8.  I missed out on Arma III for $24 and that later went to $54, so I am glad I picked this up for a very low $8.			"

												Been a livetime carper angler expected a lot from this game....Sadly that it have so many minor things that are not working like they should.Would suggest to wait a little longer before you buy it, but if you can live with the minor faults, go get it !The core is on a very good base and at least there are some very good things in it, hope the Dev's will getthe things sorted out soon.So far the Dev's are working on it and it improves everytime.

												What a great game. Its got great potential, just needs all bugs sorting out keep seeing flying fish LMAO. Multiplayer is really good and can actually fish together on same peg which is fun. A couple things I hope they bring to the game is more baits maggots, pellets, luncheon meat ect. Would be good if they bring more fisheries out in near future and equipment. GREAT GAME.			"

I use an XBOX controller and I'd love to see a vibration mode in a future update. Overall it's good but it does require a powerful system to run it with high quality setting.

												Apart from the following, which please need to be changed, this could be awesome- Nearly all of the scenery glitches all of the time and it looks ugly and hurts my eyes.- You get a run that often that you cannot actually ever have 3 rods in the water at the same time. It's literally a run every 10 seconds. Because of this, there's no 'strategy' required at all. Just turn up to any water and flick just one rod out and catch constantly until your bored (5-10 minutes), and then quit. Even using 18mm baits with size 6 hooks doesn't seem to slow the catch-rate.- There needs to be a catapult/ bait boat option AND a way to select the bait your sending out.If these issues are sorted that would be fantastic.

												On first look i was a little unsure, i thought it would be like a BASS fishing game but on further inspection and watching videos this was a game i had to buy. the detail in the lakes and weather are amazing, also the detail in the fish the way they move through the water when you hook one and how the big fish put up a resistance, you really feel like your sat on the bank waiting to catch a record breaking fish. if you enjoy fishing or just want a game to pass time on this is a game for YOU!!!!!!!!Must Buy you will not be dissapointed.Note: Casting your bait out seemed a little tricky at first, it does requre patients and it will pay off			"

												I was a little apprehensive buying this game, due to the reviews, but I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Haven't had a single crash or glitch since I've been playing.Overall, this game scratches the fishing sim itch very well. Haven't had this much fun since the original Trophy Bass from Sierra back in the day. The tackle machanics are simple and it's easy to gain the tackle points to unlock the gear you want to specifically target fish. The dynamic weather and changes in fishing pace really add some depth: you're not going to be catching them quickly all the time, and you have to consider what's in your tackle box and your surroundings.Landing a fish is fairly straightforward, and I think that's been my only real disappointment. After a while, the bigger fish will just give up and swim straight to you, so I imagine tweaking the AI would be needed to fix that. Catching a 40lb carp or 60lb catfish should involve more than just holding the rod tip high and keeping the reel butting pressed down.Casting seems to be another bone of contention with a lot of folks. Give yourself the time to learn it and it's easy. If you can crank up your mouse sensitivity, it helps a lot. Between the short, flipping casts and the long casts, you can cover any  area you want to near the peg you're fishing.A few tips if you find yourself stuck with some of the common problems:-You can't select a rod, change rig or put your rod down unless you're standing close to the edge of the peg-If progression seems slow, try free fishing at some of the later-stage lakes. The individual fish can make you way more tackle points than a tourney-Casting just takes practice. Don't get frustrated, make sure you're not underneath trees or in an area where you're constantly hitting the opposite bank-This game is somewhat resource intensive, keep that in mind if you're on an older PC. Might need to adjust a few things for smooth framerateIf you're looking for a fishing game, this one is hard to beat currently. It's relaxing, enjoyable and definitely exciting when it needs to be.

								Game mechanics are already in good shape and the game looks beautiful too. So far you can only catch one type of fish and you don't get any statistics of it like weight or length which is pretty important for a fishing game imo. The cheap entry price and the promising game features as well as being the ONLY fishing sim on Steam so far make this a must for any fishing sim fan. :)			"

												Total garbage. Don't waste your money. Can't even cast to fish. Mouse support is programmed so you pull back on the mouse to start your cast, about 2 inches, then you push the mouse foward to cast, you need to move it about 2 feet. . . and then to cast will go behind you, into your head (requiring a game restart) or it will actually cast the line about 1 yard into the water. It's not about timing or a learn to play issue, I've been trying to cast this stupid worm all morning. Yet to fish.Do waste your money.			"

								28 Aug @ 6:33am	Well What can i say...What a game. just unreal!! cannot stress how much this game has potential .. loving it Be good when we can decide what bait goes into the spod ect.Just so much can be done !! down to Maybe have the options for bivvys ect? !! would be decent .. also new alarms? delks/ sirens?    Or am i just going over the top? lolanyways you see what im getting at :)UPDATE:Update: 1 Oct @ 7:11pmThe game has come along a hell of a lot since i first purchased .... cant stress the effort ect they are putting in .. the community isnt exactlly the biggest here at dovetail fishing but they take each and every comment into mind! The introduction of catfish tench , roach are great! Also loving the new lakes some bugs are rather annoying but thats expected at the end of the day they game is still in beta mode untill the end of the month.. THIS GAME WILL BE THE BEST FISHING SIMULATOR ON THE MARKET WHEN DONE WITHOUT A SHODOW OF A DOUBT! Great work guys keep it up! John			"

												Only a few hours in but really enjoying it. Heard a lot about this in Early Access but wasn't sure it was for me, until I heard about the MP which looked pretty good. Wasn't disappointed. The casting is really excellent, as it feels close to the real thing. They need to add more fish types, like Bass, but I guess that will come over time.			"

												what have i bought paid £7.49 on sale thinking i got a bargain instead i got alot of carp, my libary says ive played 90mins steam support says ive played 2 hours so im not even sure if i can get a refund.upon trying to load up the game i just kept having it crash, it asked me to register but wouldn't register and either crashed if i didn't choose skipfinally got it loaded and choose multiplayer i had to walk around and find a peg, casted out and the game bugged out and unselected my rod.The graphics constantly keeps bugging out besides having a gtx 860m at 4GB and there's a constant flicker on back of my characters cap, other players names just show ""Username"" where their name should be plus none of them are able to speak english it seems just as i start getting somewhere the sever reconnected me to a different game.There's many other games of this type i choose this on sale as i had it on my wishlist for a long time plus it had controller support and achievements but it seems painful and now when i take the reviews more into the game seems like it was better in early release, how does that happen!

								I got this not long after it came out and there wasn't much content but I still had (and have) high hopes for it.Loaded it up today for a quick game to see how it is doing and peg selection is better, now have 3 rods and can change rigs (looks like more is coming to the end tackle part too which is nice) Caught a 19lb 4oz mirror, followed by a 5lb bream :) I hope more species like tench etc are in the pipeline, other fishing methods would be welcome (like waggler) to make it a really good allrounder.One thing that made me really happy was noticing a multiplayer option (locked atm) which will be awesome I'm sure.con: lovely looking comfy carp chair in peg but you can't seem to sit down yet, feel like a right plum stood up watching my rods lol			"

								Are you an angler? If yes, this is your game. If I have to compare this game with the others from the past, this work is the most definitive masterpiece from all times. It aims for the relaxing side of lakeside amusement. No need to reel in to catch  your bass or pike, just use your wits to select your most effective rig, choose your most attracting bait, make a precise throw and wait for the bite. If everything's in harmony, you don't have to wait too long. The bite alarm will go off, and there you go... The fish fights, kicks, struggles as long as her energy keeps her moving. Is she big? Well mate, she will make you sweat because the rod behaviour and the the line tension are as realistic as in real life. It's not a rare thing, when you fight with the fish for 20 or 30 minutes. Keep the tension downs for a sec and off she goes... Your fish swims away like a lightening, and you stare at your empty hook thinking: ""How's that possible?"" On the other hand. If you're the better one: your catch tires out, lying exhausted on top of the water , you're still have to use your net to catch you prey. One wrong move, and the sleeping beauty awakes and off the hook... In short terms: This game is awesome, even, if it's in early acces stage. I just can't do anything else, only to recommend it!			"

												One of the better fishing games around on steam. Easy to learn, Online is bassiclly were its at.. able to host public and private servers.NO DLC required...  Jump directly into the game, open up your fav Cheat Engine 64 and follow my simple bu effective guide to Unlock all the stuff from the tackle shop... (doing this DOSE NOT give you avantage over any one else online. (PS this game dose not use vac, nor dose it make you a better fisher..) I highly suggest playing through the Tutoral first before going directly online....graphics are decent.. zero lag..  Controls are easy.  Works on Win10 x64just stright up finishing and relaxing  with out the worry of a payWall.. 10/10

												So there are a lot of fishing games out there.. this one in particular is a very good and pleasing one. Nice dynamic range from weather to physics. I really enjoy the UE4 graphics in this game because the environment ( fishes , places etc ) looks so superb. Together with Fishing Planet , easily TOP3 worldwide for me. According to more contents... are there going to be more baits , rods etc .. fishing places and specimens ? Maybe adding fishes like pikes, trouts , salmons ? Or more options for customizing your rod, depth ( all in all more content ) Looking forward to hearing from you Dovetail-Team !			"

												A Good Game.Very relaxing to play, I know nothing about fishing and never been fishing before. Since it was by DTG I thought I would give it a go. The only downside to the game, is it can get pretty boring if none of your friends are playing at the same time with you, I actually ended up buying the game for my friend during the sale as I didn't want to ""waste"" the game, I wanted to get a bit competitive :D . Singleplayer iv'e touched once and left in seconds. I rarely play this game, but when I do, im impressed. Good work DTG :)			"

								Несмотря на то, что игра находится в раннем доступе, она стоит своих денег.Плюсы и минусы:1+) Красивый загрузочный экран;2+) Красивейший начальный ролик с прекраснейшей задумкой;3+) Простейшее обучение с ачивками;4+) Элементарное управление;5+) Свобода выбора у персонажа на водоеме (учитывая то, что это симулятор рыбалки).1-) Ранний доступ. Этим сказано все, начиная от отсутствия выбора водоема, заканчивая некрасивой водой, отсутствием поплавка, стрекоз и т.д., а так же малый набор природных звуков и отсутствие музыки.Хотел бы я как-то связаться с разработчиком, и объяснить, что я ожидаю от данной игры. Но не знаю как, увы.Despite the fact that the game is in the early access, it is worth the money.Pros and cons:1+) Beautiful boot screen;2+) Beautiful initial movie with great idea;3+) just learning achievements;4+) Simple management;5+) Freedom to choose a character in the reservoir (given that it's the simulator of fishing).1-) Early access. This says it all, from the lack of choice of the reservoir, ending ugly water, lack of float, dragonflies, etc., as well as a small set of natural sounds and lack of music.I wish I could somehow communicate with the developer, and explain what I expect from this game. But I do not know how, alas.			"

												Pros; Very fast actioned fun, Very small specific details on the fish which makes each one look unique, Tackle is very realistic  in terms of size and texture, Boss fish make you addidcted to catching a certain fish, Graphics are fantastic they look bright and vibrant, Menus look very neat there is no confusion navagating around the game.Cons; Way, way too many bugs and crashes which sometimes make the game unplayable (developers need to fix this!), Casting is of somewhat bad as you can only aim using a powerbar which is unrealistic, the manual casting is also unpredictable and too hard in my opinion, not enough places to fish and can get boring fast, the fish are usulally fantatic but the large catfish specimans don't fit on the screen! You can't view the whole of your 80lb+ beast! Overall: Very nice game, developers need to patch bugs and chrashes but other than that it is a pleasure to play, I hope one day new species and lakes will be added as well as new tackle and matches. I rate the game a 7.3/10 after 40 odd hours it is a little bit repetaive but if you want a queit relaxing game to play Euro Fishing is one of the best. Don't expext a action packed non-stop simulator as there will never be a good one.			"

								Ok Review Round 2, Now with fish in my basket. Ok all issues i was having with the mouse has been corrected from what I've expirenced so far. The ability to move around the lake is great, didn't know how big it really was. The fight with the fish put out seem to be on par with their weight, bigger fish bigger fight. This fish do seem to move about the lake on their own with their own free will, this is awesome in the real factor. Two things have caught my attention, 1) The rod graphics in the phase 2 video and what happens on my screen are completely different, my rod tip does not react like the one in the video, only the very tip bent and moved with the fish, not the whole rod. 2) When walking and turning using the mouse there is alot of blurring, don't know if its intentional or not(wasn't a big issue). Fun game, waitting on the next update.			"

												There are a lot of reviews saying this game isn't good, but overall I enjoy it. The fishing may not be the most realistic in terms of fish behavior, but it is a newly released game so I hope there will be some improvements later on.Some reviews say this is a ""Fishing Simulation"" so it needs to have all of these different fishing tools and adjustments. But I don't think that the average player would want to learn how to adjust boilie buoyancy, hair length, shock leaders, ect. Also regarding the comments about how long it takes for a fish to bite, people would not want to sit for 15-30 minutes for a fish to bite so of course Dovetail would speed up how often you get a bite.And lastly the complaints about the graphics, its not a AAA title, don't expect groundbreaking graphics. The water could use some improvements, but the grass, fish, trees, and characters are fine the way they are.Overall in my opinion this is a great game just to sit down and relax, or try and compete with friends to see who could get the biggest catch.

												I totally agree with that float must play, this is very important more fun so please guys we believe u can make that waggler dance lol.. And that little bubble on top of waggler should be option on/off . It could be better to see just high vision float more realistic:) Thanks guys for all job done so far really top game!!!

												Pros; Very fast actioned fun, Very small specific details on the fish which makes each one look unique, Tackle is very realistic  in terms of size and texture, Boss fish make you addidcted to catching a certain fish, Graphics are fantastic they look bright and vibrant, Menus look very neat there is no confusion navagating around the game.Cons; Way, way too many bugs and crashes which sometimes make the game unplayable (developers need to fix this!), Casting is of somewhat bad as you can only aim using a powerbar which is unrealistic, the manual casting is also unpredictable and too hard in my opinion, not enough places to fish and can get boring fast, the fish are usulally fantatic but the large catfish specimans don't fit on the screen! You can't view the whole of your 80lb+ beast! Overall: Very nice game, developers need to patch bugs and chrashes but other than that it is a pleasure to play, I hope one day new species and lakes will be added as well as new tackle and matches. I rate the game a 7.3/10 after 40 odd hours it is a little bit repetaive but if you want a queit relaxing game to play Euro Fishing is one of the best. Don't expext a action packed non-stop simulator as there will never be a good one.			"

												this game is awesome for the gear, bait, casting,fish types almost all is very well presented with decent controls but it all is ruined by extreamly unrealistic physics while fighting the fish even if its fifty pounds it looks and feels the same till out the water and for a game that nature is supposed to look great what happend with the water did the devs forget to add wind or splashing looks more like a mirror than water and thers no other life but u and the fish. this game had great potential to show the European style of fishing not just for boring bass but was instead a wast of cash only by if u are a real diehard an gotta get you fish-on      5.5/10 the potential  :-(			"

								I'm hooked! Honestly this fishing game is relaxing,easy to learn and fun. Still in early devolopement but has huge potential.Apparently the pond is close to an airport-only thing I don't like is the airplane sounds. I gave up fishing about 5 years ago(got outfished by a 6 year-old girl with a pink barbie fishing rod who was 10 feet away from me) really destroyed my ego ;(Can't wait to see what Dovetail brings to this untapped genre of fishing simulation. Hope to see  Bass,Trout,Perch,Catfish,Walleye,Pike,Musky,Crappie in the game and maybe some boat fishing with trolling.			"

								review as of Phase 6.The game is really shaping up and looks great, plays great as well.  Everything seems to be coming together nicely.  Every phase seems to have a rough bit or 2, this one it's the newly added netting mechanic.  However, when issues arrise the team certainly listens and adjusts the problem areas accordingly.  It's a fun game that has great support and a team that listens to the community feedback.  Don't know if you can ask for much more from an Early Access game.  Looking forward to what the future brings as for the present, very good and just gets better.			"

												This is my 3rd review after the latest phase, better casting and graphically excellent, but still this does not make me want to play it, Maybe its me but i Still prefer the true cast as you get with all the trophy bass games, This game just does not grab me like other older  games even the old Jack Chartons fishing game on the Cbm64 and gone fishing not graphically great but so playable i hardly put them  down, This game has Great sound and graphics but game play for me just dont make me want to play it as it stands .Also i cannot say buy it or not  i still put  as not recommended at the moment but thats my own views . This phase 3 is the best so far and its going in the right direction			"

												I have no idea why people are giving this game a bad review. Players are saying that the controls are whack but I just dont see it. Its supposed to be challenging and just one of those things that you have to master before you throw a perfect cast every time. I even found reeling in the fish was a nice challenge also (for me) but others may not think its hard and just pick it up fast. The only thing I have seen in the negative reviews that I agreed with is the textures and water quality but im running the game on ultra so it didnt bother me. The other presets though are kinda ugly but not ugly enough to give the game a negative review. I am a carp fisherman in real life and this game represents that well. The game is very fun and addicting but definantly not worth 25 bucks with the amount of content but if you get this on sale right now its worth it. If you are a fisherman this game is a must have. Hope this review helps people that cant decide whether or not to buy			"

												This is a great game, very addictive but with some work needed.First the good,I like the fact you dont have to grind it out just to use some good tackle. when I walk into a fishing shop im not asked ""what level are you?"" ehh! the lakes look really well, digger lake is my fav' with all its nice we pegs snuggled away for me to find. Stalking suits me best. having used the Unreal engine is good as many know it and sets a sturdy base for game stablity. No doubt ill keep euro fishing installed as Im always saying ""just one more fish"" before im done today. Now, the bad (sorry it has to be done).The game feels very, alpha still. there are a load of areas that need tweeks. ill start with the tackle, ive found the strongest line isnt the 25lb but the 15lb SUBLine (Stalking section). with the 15lb I just set drag to 100% and pull in anything that I hook up without a single danger of the line going tight and snaping. Of course the down side is if your fish goes real loose it will come off easy, or when you get a bite you may loose the fish before you even get to strike. this I dont mind though as its just like getting small hits as with real fishing. The rate of catching BIG fish is un-real, its like match fishing for roach and hauling in big carp and cats. The landing net just about works but again, it still works just needs more time spent tweeking, like most areas of the game.So I would say this game is totally worth its price. Im really looking forward to the free float fishing DLC and the other areas the Dev's have sites on. A BIG factor im worried about though is the leveling, once on level 20 thats it. no need for any more XP. The game is JUST about ready for release and no more and I think the Dev's know that. There's plenty of work to be done but I for one will be supporting its progress.--EDIT--After the poor release of the patch its clear the dev's are un-able to put any effort into fixing the game. looks like it will stay half built.... Cheers!  V'			"

												Must say that I absolutely love this fishing simulator. Everything works like a charm and the graphics are really good. Your tacklebox will eventually grow as you play and get more TP (tackle points) to buy stuff for. Be patient because you won't get it all right away, but that's the beauty of the game. You don't have to spend a lot of real money to get what you want, just fish and collect TP (tackle points) and you will eventually be able to buy the stuff you want, without use of any hard earned money. I only hope that one fine day we will be able to catch some barble and perhaps fish in a chalk stream or two, who knows the developers might already have taken this into consideration for future updates.  10 out of 10 possible stars.

												Are you kidding me. After trying to cast oh I don't know at least a couple hundred tries at least. I once managed 11yds. The rest of the time it was 2 or 3 yds and sometimes it was behind me. I got it juring early access and thought well surely they will fix this so we can a least meet  the minimum useful distance of 15yds some of the time any way. I get it that it is a timing thing to the casting but I mean this is absolutely ridiculous. So I wasted my money on it. DON'T waste yoursWell it wasn't me or the game. I went out and bought a new video card and it works beautifully now. So that being said the optimisation for older computers is poor. But with a decent video card it really could be one of the best fishing games ever.( (e.g. gtx750Ti). This replaced a 610. Big difference ddr5 memory.)  I love the look and sounds and now the gameplay as well. Look what you made me do Dovetail. hehe. I love it.  Disregard my negative statements unless of course you can't afford a new video card. lol			"

												yesterday i got a £5 steam vaoucher and bought the game Euro fishing Dovetail. So i installed it then opened it but then it was real glichy and laggy when i went on the basic learing of fishing. And i still have 826,563 MB on my laptop. but i still recomend this game becasue on YouTube the graphics looked really amazing. thank you and have a happy new year			"

												I bought this game for the xbox one and could not get it cast more 2 or 3 yds.   So I bought it for the PC to see if the problem was with the xbox one.  It was not.. You cannot cast more than 2 or 3 yds in this game.  I would give this game a pass and buy some other fishing game...  This one does not work.After some research on the internet I finally was able to get the PC version of this game to work.  So, I am going to change my review to a more positive review of the PC version.  However I still believe there is a problem with the Academy in the Xbox version.  The casting just does not work.  That does not make the game unplayable as I found out.  You do not need to do the Academy part of the game in order to play the game.  Just skip the academy on the Xbox.  The free fishing part of the game seems to work just fine on the Xbox.  So, I can recommend the game now knowing that you can skip the academy.  But, it would  really be nice if Dovetail Games would fix the academy on the Xbox.  If, in fact, Dovetail claims it is working as designed,  then change the design and make the casting in the academy on the Xbox work the same as it does on the PC.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT** Since a dev popped in here and apparently can't read I feel that I might want to clarify my review for those others who I guess also can't read like the dev.  I AM NOT REVIEWING THE GAMEPLAY!  I AM WARNING FELLOW AMERICANS THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR THEM AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  This is for those who read reviews more carefully than store pages because we all know how stuff gets left out and details omitted on the store pages. This is for those who are looking for an American fishing game and I am here to tell you it is not.  I also in my original review below have doubts that there will ever be something for Americans. This is a very simple logical result of looking at how long it has taken them to get this far. They are not yet close to having carp done. In order to do lets say, northwest American Salmon fishing it would require at least an equal amount of time because locations, gear, everything is different. To do even catfish which they could borrow alot of stuff from the english carp world it would take months. Now I am not programmer but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see if it takes them over half a year to do 2 fish species with a few sub-species thrown in, then it will take a simular but not as long time to do a single other species. Does this game play ok?? IDK I don't play it anymore and I couldn't tell you because i am not English and I wouldn't fish for a carp if you paid me money to.  But if they ever do add any American species I will be the first MF'er to let yall know.At the moment I cannot recommend this game due to one simple reason. The fishing is foreign. They do plan on having more fish species but for now its just carp and bream. Carp is a throw away fish that noone wants to catch in the US because they are full of bones, eat terrible and are considered the garbage of fish here in the US. Guess English folk love them but here they are junk. Bream is a fish your kid catches here in the US while your fishing for ""real"" fish. Its a kids fish that you can catch here in the US without even trying.  So really just have no desire to fish ""ponds"" for carp and bream. When the game gets completed I will give it another review. But I have my doubts that any American fish will be represented well because of the disconnect they seem to have to our fishing world(US). I don't think there is an American among them and fishing in England is apparently vastly different than it is here.			"

												This game is a complete waste of money!As it is a simulation, it will take you time to try and learn the controls, to do the tutorials, to get an idea of the mechanics of the game.At that point you will realize how unrealistic and how restricted the game.You will realize that the Multiplayer is just an Online Scoreboard and that the description of the game is nothing like what you have just played.It will be right about now that you try and apply for a refund... and have it rejected, because you spent more than 2hours trying to figure out the stupid game mechanics, to realize it is a crap game.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Playing Solitaire Blindfolded and No Hands will bring you greater enjoyment than this!

								OK.something of important it's done.The devs have made some changes and add a few things very important and now i can see a game sim fishing that is starting really.many things now are better but....i suggest to .....1)some animations of fishes are not made 100x100 well...i see sometime a fish moving back but pointing ahead this is impossible in calme water because there is not a current that can give to fish the force for to move back and so it would change the nose pointing.2)it's very important let the players end the action of getting fish on board instead it finish some yards before.that is not realistic.3)we need to have different kind of tools for fishing for example different kind of rods and so on.The possibility to use different lures and to can set the distance between the weight and the lure accordingly with the bottom height.4)it would be nice to have some AI that move around and some that fishing like player,this would give to sim  more realism and involve much the player...a desert rest a desert also if it is a beatifull desert.For the rest i can say...go ahead so now you have start really to work on a sim.

								I find the game very interesting it has a lot of potential and the features it has right now are quite fun.But there is a lot of work to be done, and hopefully I did not spend my money on another early access game that gets a couple of bucks and then stops.Hopefully we see more of Dovetail Games Fishing.I really hope this was only 1/1000th of the game.

It was cheap so im not going to complain too much but they should not even be selling this right now untill they get it straight!!! Go ahead and buy it and see for yourself. It would be a great game if they get it right. Oh and btw, if you are trying to use an X Box controller on this it doesnt work like it says in the specs.			"

												The game crash very often.The game himself is not bad but there is almost no content.I cant realy say if i recommend this game or not.EDIT: I am in the closed beta of fishing planet that will release the 11 august on steam as open beta FOR FREE.Right now,the closed beta of fishing planet as ALOT more content and boats are going to be added at the full release as well as sea fishing.They already added nearly all fishing types with 8 maps for now and they are planning to add alot more.A new map is coming tommorow.Come on Dovetail Games,work on the game! Its been a month that you didnt update the game!Also,when you guys update the game there is not alot more content added. Fishing planet add new content all 3 days! Right now im wondering if the game is already abandonned...EDIT: Ok they just started a beta with ALOT of contents.I tested it out and its very fun.Not polished yet.Game is not abandonned!I just wish they add more fishes other than carp. 2016-01-05 edit: Turned out to be euro fishing.They attracted us saying that they will add all types of fishing so we bought it.Now they totally changed the thing so they have less things to do to make the game complete.They said ''We start with european fishing then we will add other types of fishing''.I first bought the game planning to do some lure fishing but now its ''euro fishing only''.They should have said it earlier...Oh wait,if they would have said it earlier,nobody would have bought the game :P Waste of time and money.Pass your way.

												I just purchased this game, I must say that the graphics look okay, but this is not the most important thing for me. For me it's all about the gameplay which counts, almost everything is done well except one thing, and that's the feeling of the controller. Dear Developers, I don't know if you ever played the good old Nintendo64 game Zelda the Ocarina of Time which had an excellent fishing mini game in it. When I used to fish with the Nintendo64 controller I could feel what I was doing, there was a certain resistance because of the so called rumble pack especially when I caught something. I could even feel if it was a small or a big fish. But in this game I can't feel anything at all. This was a big disappointment for me and to be honest I now regret the fact that I bought the game (because I bought it thinking the controller function would work well, but I was wrong). I think you missed a great chance to make this a great game only because of this :(. I hope that ""Fishing Planet"" will do a better job by providing a better controller setup in the near future.

												When i first saw Euro fishing advertised in the total fishing mag i said i had to get this game, being an avid carper and gamer, this was ideal when commitments prevented me from getting on the lakes with my rods.  Sadly issues with the game caused me to be disappointed with it. after writing a review,  i was pleased to see that the developers where taking on board the views of gamers, and i am pleased to say they brought out a solution to the biggest problem i had with the game which was the casting.   This issue had prevented me from getting into the game. but now with the basic casting method i can enjoy the full range the game can offer.  the game offers something for everyone and with developments into improving the game, it will be a great game/simulator that  provides all the experience of fishing with out actually getting out there, i can see this game encouraging younger gamers to put down the mouse and pick up a rod for the first time.  As for future project i would love to see the team add the white acres lakes in cornwal perhaps, there are 13 lakes there offering a wide range of fishing.  but in the mean time they are doing a great job.  keep it up guys.  Tight lines guys			"

												I really enjoyed Cabela's Big Game Hunter, and tried Eurofishing looking for the wilderness ambient and fishing/hunting strategy. I am enjoying the game, but I must say that casting by moving the mouse and clicking the right button at the same time is messy and inpractical. Anyway, by adjusting the mouse sensibility (middle position) I found that it is a lot easier. Still, I wish it could be done in other way.Lakes are great. Each one with its unical features, including boss fishes. I hope they will add some more lakes in the future. Those available are located in various countrys, and tough the lakes themselves are fictional, they strongly resembles the real lakes of those areas.My main complain is that you don't need much strategy for fishing. I mean, you mainly search for a nice peg, or go stalking. Fish move through the day from one area to another. But there's nothing that you can do to catch a certain species (well, except for the kind of bait you use), or going for real big fish or lake bosses . I would like the game to be more rewarding for the patient, strategic player, but devs tend to make this games more rewarding for begginers, in hope that they won't put down it due to initial boredom. The devs had stated that they are adding float fishing for free in the next weeks, so I hope the game will grow and get better. The store is a bit small, I would like to have more items to buy, including clothes, customized equipment, and so. Oh, and Multiplayer is ok, but is not my thing.Last, but not least: I feel that the game is not very optimized. It won't run fluent in the typical laptop. My GeForce 840N doesn't handle it very nicely. You better check the requirements.As a clonclusion... a very nice game, **if you like these kind of games**. I am in hope that the game community will grow and that the devs will create exciting new scenarios and items.			"

												Well, after logging over 100 hours play and the game undergoing several updates I have to change my review from being positive to now being negative. The devs have promised much from the begining but have not delivered. They seem intent on making this an arcade game for toddlers rather than the simulator it was supposed to be. Bugs are not fixed and more are introduced with so called updates. The egarly anticipated float fishing update is a joke, you can't even do basics like set the depth, clearly the people behind this game are not anglers! I hear people saying its the best fishing game on the market but lets face it, how many fishing games are there to compete with?			"

												.....VERY IMPORTANT PART BELOW......This is for people have no save issuesI have fixed my no save issue with this game. Please visit the forum as Dovetail have pinned my post regarding how to fix this.http://steamcommunity.com/app/314520/discussions/0/358415738201068385/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that's out the way onto the review.I have been playing this came in all stages from alpha, beta, Live.And i can honestly say that they have got a little gem of a game here. If you are not into fishing then this game is not for you .......AT ALL........ you will find it boring.The gameplay is at part ok i find it very easy to catch fish. I just adjust my drag to suit the fish size, and then just hold left mouse button until it is tired, and move my rod from left to right to adjust the strain on my rod ,then hit E to land my fish. Rinse and repeat.......... This needs improving in a big way. How they would do that i don't know.Allso i have yet to lose a fish due to snags in the water this needs improvement or introduced.Allso the UI in the menu needs improving in a HUGE way. Please for the love of god allow me to left drag my mouse button in the Tackleshop so i can go where the hell i want to buy things. The way you have it where i have to keep left clicking arrows FOR, up, down, left, right, to get to where i want is a pain in the backside.I would like see a splash screen or something different when you beat your PB in species of fish that you caught. The same screen over and over again when you caught a fish does get boring and gives no feeling of beating my PB it's just the same old screen. If you can't do that then give me the option to turn the thing off in the menus.And please make the boss named fish more in your face, Bigger font or different splash screen. sometimes i don't even know i have caught one until i load that lake up again and think what the hell when did i catch that.  Like i say need to improve the the fish screens when caught.Multiplayer is ok, same as single player but with real people ...nuff said on that one.Graphics are nice.... nuff said on that one.Overall the game is really good if you are into fishing like me in real life then this game is for you.The things i commented on do not affect gameplay they are just the things i would like to see improved :)Overall 7 out of 10			"

												I like the game but there are a few bugs and issues I have. This game has a lot of potential though. One very annoying bug is in free fishing during a long session sometimes you get a bug where you cant set down you rod.. This means you will never be able to control your other two rods again. This is unless you quit and restart free fishing.The casting is another problem I have some sort of power meter or bower button should be used to guarentee you can get at least some distance.. Over use of the power button could be compensated by less accuracy..Ive also had many occurances where I catch the same fish 3-5 times in a row.. However this could be due to the fish staying in the same area and chance? Things I liked, and what i'd like to see: Playing fish is really enjoyable. By far the best fishing sim out there all things considered, just the casting and occasionalo bug that gets annoying. More accesories need to be added such as PVA bags to allow you to send out your hookbait with more feed. Groundbait would be nice too. A slingshot might be a good addition too , this allows more feeding options. Whereas im stuck to using single baits.. I hope they continue to refine the game as it does feel in complete, not that much unlockable products in tackle shop ect. I would not reccomend this game yet as I feel like I said its not finished. Thanks for reading.*** Since the updates the casting improvements have addressed my concerns as well as bugs I expirienced. The shop has been filled a bit more too which is good Hopefully my character won't get deleted either.			"

												Best Fishing Game I have played in a long timeSo let me say that this is one of the best fishing games I have played in a long time.  The game has issues.  Hopefully they can fix them.  So if it has issues then why is it the best I've played in a long time?That would be because fishing games aren't made often and when they are they are very arcade now.  No multiplayer and no tournaments for multiplayer.  So what about this game?  Okay I'll tell you the goods and bads and leave it at that.The goods--Good looking Environment.  This includes the water.  I have mine set to highest setting and the water looks great.-Fish graphics are really great.  Fish look very real and are done very well-Fish are swimming in the water you are fishing in.  Yup there are fishing swimming around that you have to hope come across your bait.  The most I went without a bite was 20 minutes, but its also because I didn't move.  It's not arcade feeling and feels like real fishing because of waiting longer times sometimes than others.-This is Euro fishing.  I did't think I would like it because I like to bass fish and such, but I was really wrong.  Catching fish off a peg is great.  You put your rods in the pegs and wait and then hear your line screaming and the peg screaming too.  It can be intense sometimes.-Hook and bait size matter.  These things will make the biggest difference on what size fish you can catch.  Too big of hook and bait and a 8 pound fish cant eat it.  Although they make your peg light up sometimes trying to.-Rod bend is really nice and your player is graphically sound-You see fish jumping out of the water or bubbles where they are feeding-Huge selection of rods, reels, and line.  Bait selection is pretty good and or amazing for bottom fishing.  Since its not bass the amount is good.-This is a 3D game and lake.  You get to literally walk every inch of the lakes and can fish with one rod or use a peg with 3 rods.  This is not that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fishing planet game where you are stuck in one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ section of a non existant lake or river.-They hold tournaments all the time and you can play solo tournaments-MULTIPLAYER!!!!!  You get to fish with friends and watch them reel fish in!!! Holy crap and even can see their peg light up and hear their line screaming out.  -You get to walk all over the lake and decide where to fish-Good amount of lakes to choose from although you will be basically fishing the last 2 lakes which have the biggest fish.  -BOSS FISH!  There are boss fish in game and make you want to fish all the lakes and even for small fish to try and catch these rare guys.  They go from 2 pounds all the way up to 100.-You can use 3 rods and even use a bait rod to throw bait into the water over your current bait to help get bites.-You can fish night or day and can host a session or join someone elses-Easy to pick up and learn.-Different types of things to fish on.  Gravel, Silt, Weeds-Weeds around lakes are obvious and only a idiot can't find them-Love the netting system.  People are idiots and don't know how to net the fish so they complained a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton and now they are making a automatic netting system.  Really hope they allow us to use the old manual system.  It makes it more realistic and fun.-Casting system is really good and if you dont do it right you wont be casting far.  Easy to learn, hard to master-Pretty RealisticTHE BADS-Here we go-Tension and drag system is not working correctly in game yet.  Its pretty bad, but even then its still fun to catch fish in this game.  Makes me wonder how this company could screw this up since its literally a core part of the game mechanics-Rod, reel, line make no difference in catching fish.  You can use the starter rod setup and catch the 100 pound cat in game.  Just have to keep your tension at 16 and dont break it off and wait for fish to tire.  Then you get him in-Fish seem to be on a rail system when caught.  Almost like they aren't swimming.  You really can't influence how the fish moves or which way.  Although if you hold your rod far right or left they do seem to move that way eventually.-No player made tournaments yet.  LAME!-The fish really don't effect the water.  yea they jump and make a splash, but when hooked they wont do that.  They make small splashes when close, but thats about it.-No in game voice chat just message system-The company doesn't seem to be worrying about the really important aspects of the game and just fixing small stuff that are being complained the most about.  They really need to pull their heads out of their butts and fix the tension and drag issues as well as the fish on a rail system and not really swimming when caught.  Although they said they are fixing rod bend so we will see what that is.Conclusion-Although the bads seem really bad I still have a lot of fun with this game.  I have been fishing since I was very young and I have played very few fishing games that made me enjoy it.  This game has and I even meet some new players on there and we fish together.  Its a great game and if they can fix some core issues it will be a absolute beast in the gaming/electronic fishing genre.  This game has so much promise its crazy.  I know its weird to say that about a game thats out and being bought.  If you see it on sale its a must buy in my opinions.  I paid the full 20 and think it was well worth it.  They will be adding a new lake soon with Pike and lure fishing for the pike.  So I am really looking forward to that.  Hope this helps!UPDATE:  They lost my character who was top level with a ton of TP like over 60,000 and I had a lot of stuff unlocked in game.  All my boss fish I caught everything gone.  The only response I got was a link to their bs site that said nothing about how to fix it.  Because there probably isn't a fix and they know it.  I no longer support this game and hope it burns into the ground.  The game updates have been abysmal to say the least.  Not fixing important bugs or even the drag and reel system that isn't realistic in the least.  It's like a really bad game made by 2 people who don't give a crap about any of the players.  They seriously updated and took out maual netting.  One of the few good things about the game and now its even more arcade because you wait for a fish to lose stamina while reeling endlessly without effecting the fish or you lose it for slack line.  Terrible bs and the Devs need to be held responsible for all this crap and not actually fixing the important stuff.  Thank you!  DO NOT BUY OR SUPPORT THIS GAME!			"
