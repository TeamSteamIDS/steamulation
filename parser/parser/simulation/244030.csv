								Take on Mars is possibly one of the most unique concepts to hit the steam store in a while. It's a game, of sorts, but more than that, it's a tool for learning and understanding the challenges inherent in exploring a planet far removed from our own, as well as providing a toolbox to this end. A very well thought out toolbox at that, which includes a tech tree (recently added), Multiple survey sites, and even now includes Deimos. You are placed in charge of the Mars Space Exploration Agency, provided a budget to build, launch and research landers, and rovers, and tasked with exploring and analysing scitentific points of interest. Completing these objectives nets you further funding. The game part comes from balancing the needs of developing technology and launching appropriate craft to the right sites. Funding -is- tight here, so it's very easy to box yourself in on the first few tries whilst you get the hang of how it all works. For that reason I really, really advise that you read the tutorials, go and do a bit of research on the web, and study the tech tree. Work out what you need to build, and apply an objective based approach to proceedings. This is not a game for anyone who isn't extremely patient and willing to invest in a concept which as an open ended project, is very different from pretty much anything that's come before.As a niche product though, it should be applauded, because Bohemia has created a genuinely unique experience, one that if you've the time, the will and the inclination, provides a richly rewarding and deep journey, digging into the historical background of the Red Planet, and mixing a subtle element of managing your technology whilst exploring and unearthing secrets as you go.

								Absolutely incredible game... but also not for everyone.This is basically a highly realistic space simulator. The amount of detail and attention to realism is fantastic, making it really feel like you are controlling a rover on Mars. You visit actual locations on Mars, use actual scientific equipment to learn actual things about the geology of Mars. There is even an (optional) way to sync the game with the actual time on Mars, so you need to actually schedule your day around the 24.75 hour Martian day (like they do at JPL). Future versions will even include an (optional) light delay between sending and receiving commands.No explosions, no aliens, no ""story"" other than building a successful Mars exploration program. There are countless games out there to provide your fix of those things. This game is different, and that is why i absolutly love it. The gameplay IS quite repetitive, but one again so is the real deal. Drive a bit, analyse some soil. Drive some more, analyze a rock. None the less I find this very relaxing and engrossing, a nice way to unwind. Also, with Modding, there's no reason you can't break from realism and begin a long cruise around martian sand dunes in a dune-buggy while blasting ""Road Trip"" music from iiTunes/WinAmp/whatever.If you are fascinated by Mars, like to keep track of what Curiosity is up to, would like to visit mars, and think it would be fun to drive a rover really slowly and drill holes into rocks (aka the real deal)... then you will like this game.Simply Put: The closest most of us will come to visiting Mars.P.S. The game is in Beta/Early access as of this writing, so for all i know in the future they may give you more freedom on what you can do, or include sci-fi ideas like a manned mission.P.P.S. Regarding some negative reviews here - keep in mind it is in Beta. Some of the things being complained about here are almost certainly going to be fixed or changed in time. If those reviews  scare you away from buying it, check back when it is completed.			"

								It's your own Mars (and asteroid belt) Exploration Program simulator.In the game you control probes or rovers in real time (unlike in real life, where their control sequences are preprogrammed, and in emergency they are automatically put in a safe mode). It isn't only about exploring Mars, but also its moons and asteroids. You can also operate rover on Earth.The objectives are quite repetitive (ride there, shoot photos, analyze air, soil, rocks, take a sample, all this to get funds and unlock next levels of available hardware which you will send to Mars next), but it isn't a boring game. You need to be careful to not break the equipment (or wheels), and watch out for strong wind, as small rovers and probes are quite light and fragile. It's currently in active development, so some things may still change and a new content (like sample analyze results currently having a placeholder) will be added.It's a great game for space geeks, people who like realistic vehicle simulators, and other people who want to view Mars from rover's perspective.

								""My God, it's full of stars!""I have had this game since the early versions and even then it felt like a shop ready product and not early access, and the new updates have just felt like free DLC.The screen shots tell the story of the graphics, they are awesome, and the whole game looks like that.The realism is, well I've never sent a probe to Mars, but it feels pretty bleeding real to me. And the realism is the key to your enjoyment of this title. If you want fast paced action on a future Mars then move along (I've seen posts saying it's boring, pah!).If you're like me and absorb yourself into a sim about the current exploration of Mars, with all the slow analysis of rocks and atmosphere and the chance to take photos that look very similar to NASA pics that comes with that then buy this game, clear about a month in your schedule and prepare for a real, scientific and indepth exploration of our solar cousin.As real as it gets. Stunning sim. 11/10.			"

								I'm not sure.  I want to like Take On Mars, but overall I don't find it a very engaging game.TOM wants you to play the game its way, or the highway.  My first play through and I spent all of my money to build a super-lander.  It had a robot arm, soil scoop, atmosphere sensors, the works.  I managed to get it down on the ground and thought to myself: ""Whoo!  Let's do some SCIENCE!""  And then the game said, ""Yay, you explored this region!  Now do it some more, elsewhere!""  Wait.  What?I wasn't able to use my robot arm or soil scoop.  My atmosphere sensor was useless.  The game had intended only for me to complete a set of explore-the-area objectives before it would unlock the next set.  I realized then that Bohemia Interactive had a much different idea of SCIENCE! than I did.  To me, spending my wad on an uber-science craft made sense.  Cram as much science as you can in a single big-budget mission so you can unlock more technology.   But I was thinking like a scientist, not as a game player.And that's where TOM lost me.  The game wants me to play it like a game.  I was expecting a simulator.  For something that bills itself as a simulator, I found this really disappointing.Science tasks earn me money, and I spend that money to research better science-making gear.   This system feels hap-hazard and slapped together.  Why not have a separate budget versus ""science points"" (much like in Kerbal Space Program)?  Why is the science objective-based instead of having ""wells of science fact"" that are tapped and eventually exhausted (again, like KSP)?In fact, playing this game just made me want to play KSP instead.  Which is a real pity, because TOM looks great and it could be a real contender for introducing people to the act of managing a space program and how extraterrestial science works.I restarted my game and played it The Right Way and was able to upgrade to rovers.  I was excited at first, because I thought this was a chance to do something interesting.  Only to realize that ""interesting"" meant holding down the ""W"" key for hours on end, driving a slow rover across the Martian surface.  And this is where TOM completely lost me.  Suddenly, it wanted to act like a realistic simulator -- Oh you have to DRIVE AROUND to find interesting science!  In realtime!  With no automatic navigation system!At that point, I just stopped playing.  I haven't bothered to unlock the next set of objectives, and have yet to set a human down on the surface of Mars in TOM, and that's a real pity.Oh well, at least my science base on Duna is thriving...

												I have 92 hours of play time in Take On Mars.This is the only review I've done since joining steam 8 years ago. I can not in good conscience allow this game to be released without saying anything. This game was not and still is not ready for release. It is still full of bugs and crashes a lot. I've tried so many work arounds I've seen on the forum and elsewhere to stop this from happening but to no avail. Personally, I feel like I shouldn't have to do something like all that just to get the game to work at it's basic level.The game crashes when you try to scroll with the mouse wheel. It also crashes when exiting to the main menu. The worst crash for me, is when you try to overwrite a save, the game crashes without saving and deletes your current save on top of that.I think a fair amount of the issues could be temporarily remedied by incorperating an auto-save feature into the game. Or even a quick save button. Like just pressing F5 to save for example. As it stands, you have to go through a few menus just to save. It gets tedious to do this every five minutes in case the game decides to randomly crash. Then you wouldn't lose hours worth of work when it does.The discussion forum is full of threads about crashing issues. A lot of people can't even get the game to start running. I've spent hours going back through the thread's and I've come to the conclusion that these developers put the game into release to make one last cash grab and then wash their hands of it.And this game is certainly not worth the 26.99 they want for it. Discounting the problems this game has, I would say with how basic it is, it's worth maybe 10 to 15 dollars at most. I really regret the 30 dollars I spent on it a few years ago.The thing that really bugs me the most about this game is the power production. I had to download a mod increasing the power production of the nuclear reactor just to be able to play. In the vanilla game, you have to build 11 nuclear reactors to power one simple device continuously. With resources as scarce as they are in the game, that is just rediculous. And solar panels are a joke because they produce even less power and obviously none at night. And the night lasts far longer than the day. And there are no batteries you can make to store power for use at night so wasting resources to build solar panels is pointless.TL;DRThis game is an obvious bug/crash fest and cash grab. The devs obviously want to wash their hands of it. Please, protect your hard earned income and do not buy it.			"

								This game is strange, if you love space, or more specifically, love Mars than you will love this game. You take on the role as a space organisation mission director, you choose which crafts are launched and assign them tasks which you have to do. (Atmospheric readings/ photographing crater rims/ taking surface samples.)On the face of it this game is incredibly boring, driving a rover isn't the most fun, especially when it goes at around .2m/s! The game gets a lot more fun and satisfying with the pay-off, finally taking that photograph or completing the assigned objectives is such a nice feeling, I just can't put it in words.You can also take control of the lander, controlling it's decent however this is incredibly difficult and best to do with a joystick which has had it's ratio of steering changed in the settings because turning how you think you would turn will almost certainly flip it over and smash it into the ground, often costing you 1000s of M$ from your space program, when I first done it it resulted in my space program's bankruptcy.I can't give this game too low of a score as it is still in development so please take that into consideration before purchasing this game.9/10, it does what it says on the tin and it does it well.> I've noticed little to no bugs> Great fun for someone who loves astronomyThe reason it is not a 10 is due to some minor issues which are not really worth mentioning.

								I haven't gotten very far (it takes time!) but this is one is a jewel from the start. Let me explain why:Pros:+Real time mode for hard cores+Survival mode with time skip for easy cores+No 3rd person only first for realism+Not only mars, also Deimos, one of Mars' moons+ Lots of areas with planned content+ Multiplayer (Haven't tried it yet)+ Science researching (Uses money and time instead of science like in kerbal  Kerbal Store Page+user friendly science tree+Useful community guides  !!!Please read them if you are a new player! Very helpful!!! +in game editor for scenarios with steam workshop compatibility*May be other good things that I haven't reached yet or forgot*Cons:-less content then I'd like-sending people to mars comes later, much later(unsure how much later)-bugs like sky crane landing on rover and getting it stuck-worry that devs will drop it-unable to send rovers to mars unless a mission is there-no ""science sandbox"" like kerbal Kerbal Store Page Good game with plenty of room for improvement. If you have the money for it, then I'd suggest this game for you.			"

								This is a great game, if you’re into this kind of stuff. Otherwise I guess you’ll hate it, which of course would make you a heartless monster.TakeOn Mars certainly is no GTA Mars. Getting to your next target can and will require prolonged use of your W-key as your rover crawls over the martian surface at a snail’s pace. But hey, you’re rewarded with actual education! Now isn’t that fun!?While you progress through the missions the built-in encyclopedia presents you with tons of actual facts about Mars which you could also find on Wikipedia without having to carefully drive your rover down some crater wall first.So if you feel “ready” for a “more or less accurate” simulation of Mars exploration this game may be for you as well. Otherwise I guess it’s more likely you’ll be bored to death and back.Seriously, it’s awesome!			"

								An interesting ""game"" so far.   There is a ton of potential here and I look forward to what the developers have in store.   This is a hard core sim, make no mistake about it. You start with a small sum of money and essentially have to launch probes and gather data.  You can research upgrades so you can create better probes and eventually rovers.  It is slow going,. and you wil invest a lot of time just to get the payoff of meeting the mission goals.  That payoff is well worth it!You will question yourself and make mistakes.  It can be a frustrating experience to build what you feel is an excellent rover for a mission, only to have it blown over when you make the mistake of landing in an area with hurricane force winds.  Ouch!  But you end up going back for more because you want to get it right.I have been playing with this the past few days and am hooked.  My 7 year old loves driving the rovers around and if anything, it has opened his mind to asking a million questions about Mars and space exploration.  That is a huge win and worth the cost alone for me. "

								If you are a Space geek like I am, you will likely enjoy this game at any and every stage of development. If you are thinking about persuing a career in space exploration or aerospace engineering, you will likely enjoy this game. That said, it is a very slow game. I have read through entire books while driving from one place to another. The simulation of tools and cameras is very good and the game excels in that respect.  However, many features are not implemented yet but it is getting better and more complete. I highly recommend playing with a joystick as opposed to a controller. Also, because it is a simulation for an activity that involves sitting at a desk for the part you are playing, it takes a little role playing to get the very most out of it. Get a cup of coffee and a book or two and pretend you're working at JPL driving a real rover. It makes it a much more enjoyable experience, just don't break off any wheels while you're reading. That would not be good for your (pretend) career.			"

Early Access Review
								Well what a hidden gem this game was. I nearly didn't bother buying it as I was put off by the association implied by ""Take On"", as I wasted money on the godawful Take On Helicopters (Sorry, but it is).Anyhoo, this game, even it's its early access form, is one of the most original, unique and strangely engrossing games I have come across. The only other game that has really attempted something similar is Mars Colony Challenger, and that isn't too bad considering it's a one man job. TOM takes it to the next level, with great visuals, a wealth of information, atmosphere and good old relaxing gameplay.The single player Space Program game will not be for everyone. In it's early stages it basically consists of launching increasingly advanced probes and landers on Mars to gather scientific information. If you complete a mission you get extra cash and funding, used to create or research more advanced tech such as Rovers etc. It can get a little repetitive but you will learn more about Mars in a couple of hours of gameplay than you thought possible. Some of the missions are quite challenging, and instructions can be a tad unlear, but when you get it right, it's satisfying. When controlling landers and rovers there is a real sense of reality about it. The second stage of the single player is the manned mission. Where you have to survive on Mars while conducting missions etc. You need to mine resources, build your base, so on and so forth.I have not started this stage yet, but I am assuming it somewhat similar to multiplayer. Multiplayer is where the game shines like a Martian sunrise, but it's also a bit of a dust storm at present too. The basic premise is players work together to build their colony. It is in it's initial release, so expect more depth to be added, such as the survival mechanics and resource gathering being required. When it is fully fleshed out, you will have one incredible sim which will encourage some great cooperative gameplay. Multiplayer games can also be saved to all clients, not just the host. Allowing for continuing session play on your favorite base/project.Multiplayer is flawed though. A severe lack of server commands for the host is just one problem. There is no way to kick players, and there are some idiots out there. They will spoil all your hard work, build crap you dont need, drive off in vehicles, change what you have constructed or just be general pains in the ♥♥♥♥. As well as a kick/ban function, the game lacks any means to remove items you dont require or make by accident. Often your well planned base can end up looking like a junkyard. Also, the object count can seriously impact framerates, so the less rubbish around, the better. There is also no way for the host to ""lock"" items in place. Whixh means that any idiot with a tool can tear things apart or adjust constructions that you have spent time building to your own design. It should be possible to disable the tool function for other players as seen fit, or to mark a construction as ""locked"" or ""complete"" etc so that no changes can be made without the host consent. As far as I am concerned, the host is the guy in charge of the mission, and should have the controls to achieve that.All that being said, multiplayer is freaking awesome when you get a couple of good players. A random player joined my game and we spent hours constructing a base complete with control center, observatory and raised landing pad. We had an encircling balcony on the control center which was just missing some patio furniture. It was very satisfying, especially as we built most of it in the dark and didn't really know what we had accomplished until sunrise. Unfortunately the game then became somewhat unplayable due to the large number of objects. We felt like we were walking in slow motion and it took so long to accomplish anything else that we called it a day. Hopefully this issue will be addressed and improved by the Devs. Multiplayer is still in it's intitial release of course, but it's a good initial release.The Dev team is very active, and take a lot of interest in their players. They obviously have a passion for this game that I am certain will see it constantly improving all the way to full release. They are not trying to milk cash from an early access game like some, and the price you pay for the game at present is more than worth it.All in all I am rating this a 9/10. Innovative, interesting and well supported. Buy it! Just buy it.			"

								I hate to say it, but it appears this game has become vaporware.Over the past year alone it has changed release date like 5 times, and recently they even dropped having a release date entirely.They say this is to give it more time to be a finished product, yet they have not in the past year made much effort or progress on the game at all, despite being a real development studio. A solo indie developer works faster than they do.It seems they have lost major interest and/or funding, I can't imagine any other reason for being this lazy with something so promising.They also say they are working on major things behind the scenes and are holding back content, but they have provided no real evidence for this. At the terrible state the game is in, you would think they would just show this so called content, but nope.The game right now has more bugs and issues than a swiss cheese has holes.These same bugs and issues have not been touched at all for the past 2 years.The game it self remains to this date so extremely buggy and crashy that it is difficult to keep playing, despite having supposedly been so close to release.I really had high hopes for this game, I wanted it so badly to be a proper finished game, but that day may never come.At the pace they are working at it will still take many years to finish.This developer seems to be full of false promises and lies.I still check in several times a week on what's going on with this game because I love space games so much, just in case something happens, but I have been doing that for more than a year too so...Well, should things ever improve I will delete this review.I would never make this exception for any other game doing this badly.UPDATE:To nobody's surprise, they released the game without fixing any of the bugs or crashes, added none of the requests people asked for, and no extra content other than a ISS you spend 2 minutes inside.... Multiplayer is a total mess because of this. Welcome to vaporware.. :'(			"

								I have been playing this one on and off since the game first appeared on on early access. I really enjoyed the early stages but it there were a few bits that made it not quite right. But of course, it's early access. However I have to say that I have recently got back into the game and it has changed almost beyond recognition. The latest addition of multi player has added so much more to the game. I am sure other developers would have been tempted to release this as at the very least a paid for DLC.It is still early access, the plan is full release in June, (I am writing this in Aril), and I think that all that needs to be done is a bit of polishing to make it a great game. That said, the way the game has developed in the recent months leads me to believe that there will be a lot more than just a bit of polish.There are no aliens to try to kill or avoid, you need to eat, so you grow your own food; you can't do this till you have soil and water.; you can't get this till you have the right machines..... Oh, and your suit does not hold much oxygen. Run out at your peril!One thing I would say, the controls are a bit hard to get to grips with. Rotating stuff to get it to line up has taken me ages!I love the vehicles available and the workshop integration is great with some really interesting stuff appearing.In the space program side of the game you can choose to run in real time or game time. Real time, as the name suggests, runs at the right rate and so when you are told 45 hours to research the next bit of kit you need you have to wait 45 hours. Perfect time to drop to multi player for a bit I think :-) With game time you can advance time so you can play as quickly as you want. You need to develop probes, landers and rovers to map Mars and test soil, rocks and atmosphere. I must find Beagle-2 and give it a nudge to see if I can get it to start up :-)So, yes I do most definitely recommend the game, it is great value, the devs are fantastic and all in all this is what early access should be like.

Early Access Review
								Notice: A lot of reviews are poor about this game because it is early access and people don't bother to read that they're buying an unfinished game. Actually READ what people have to say and don't be taken in by metascores.Notice: This is going to be detailed, so if your not into that skip to the next review, you have been warned!Take on Mars - a game designed with a single purpose in mind - explore, and eventually colonize Mars. Take On Mars - A Survival Game unlike any you've played. There are no enemies here except nature herself, but she a fierce one. Even without her Pets - Take on Mars is proof positive space travel is dangerousLet's talk about the campaign mode later for now I want to talk about the Scenerios:Manned Missions to locations including Earth's ""Backyard Mars"", The Moon, and Mars itself are playable as of the current revision, more over they are playable multiplayer. The Multiplayer system is highly reliable from what i can tell minus the fact that the entire game is prealpha. The best part about manned missions thus far is they are strictly co-op, although there's talk of a future competitive mode. Your astronauts will attempt to build and maintain a base in manned mode - the ways to do this vary but in general you need three major resources - Food, Fuel, and Water. Food is self-evident so let's talk about Fuel - The fuel is a methane/oxygen electric hybird, that is to say they can run off methane or electricity. Newly built vehicles come with a full charge of electricity but you'll need to preform some basic chemistry to get the Methane and Oxygen depending on where you choose to play (Earth,  Moon, and Mars have vastly differing resources). The best part about the game in my personal opinion is the resource management - it's all very realistic and highly accruate. Of course if your on Mars, you not only need Food and Water, there's also no air to breathe outside your craft - that's where suits and helmets come into play - they recharge when you put them in holders, and the oxygen drains away as you use them, the helmets and suits can be stored in inventory in order to preserve oxygen in sealed areas but in general this does not restore your tanks. Now there's three primary resource gathering machines in this game, one for rock, soil, and Atmospheres (gases) - Of these three methods there are about 10 - 12 (edit: closer to 20 ""chemical compounds"" now supported) different base elements that can be divided among the various conditions, and these can be refined into molecules that use the same elements into a new chemical. It's all very highly thought out.Also with updates they have added the ability to ""Scout"" the maps for resource deposits which eventually become depleted (not for a *very* long time though - unless that sector was low to begin with). This is preformed with Hand Drills, and Gas/Soil Collectors and Lab Tables and Equipment.  Chemistry aside you may be wondering ""if there's no air where's the Food Get the Oxygen?"" - good question, Hydroponic Farms are available for construction which (as of yet) only produce potatos, which fulfill both your vitamen and calorie needs (collectively ""Food"" Needs) Other supplies can restore only one or the other but in general these are limited. Radition is a very real factor - take shelter during solar storms or roast outside - your choice*. Water is just a simple matter of a water fountain and/or a space fluid pouch.Also at some point in the cycle they added powering your equipment to the mix - which by release should apply to all ""constructable"" machines in manned multiplayer minus the water fountain and the Hydroponic Farms (For obvious reasons)So all told Manned Missions can already be very cool.So...chemistry aside you also will want to provide a base to operate out of during the manned missions: There is a simple building block process that creates virtually any shelter you want (but be warned though simple it's easy to make mistakes at first and end up with a junkyard of shelter parts) My advice is find a mission on Mars say a multiplayer designed scenerio, and deconstruct their base to see how they are put together, this will save you alot of headaches in the long run. Nearly all of my 15+ Hours in this game have been spent in manned missions, however there is also a more primitive pre-manned phased called ""Space Program"" in which you don't send men, but machines to Mars, and it is reflective of budget and/or time constraints that the real space program faces. Space Program is like ""Campaign Mode"" for your everyday RTS - it's got somewhat of a goal, and there's specific objectives to meet, not always revealed all at once. When you first land you have a large cache of supplies (in cooperitive settings) in multiplayer; but that will quickly prove to deplete (faster on higher time compressions and/or with more active players) quicker than you want; the MDV (Manned Descent Vehicle) is home away from home at first but eventually as described above you wil want to branch out to a real ""outpost"" or even ""modular"" design.For the Campaign Mode there are some things that have changed recently - including the completion of a ""manned Story Mode"" - this is optional but part of the planned ""Overall Experience"" - you need not play through the Campaign to play multiplayer/scenerios. The Campaign allows you to choose from two modes: A Robotics Phase, and the Manned Story Missions, Manned Story is largely uneventful to be honest and is largely at the current time a largely incomplete feature - it lacks serious challenge and the implementation of critical limits - Unlike Multiplayer and Scenerios which can range from ""Very Easy"" to ""Extremely Realistic and Hard"". This said the story mode is a great way to learn the game (assuming you've atleast done the tutorial first!) in a non-challenging enviroment. The Real Gem of this game is in Multiplayer which is also kind of left as an open development; Bohemia Interactive has said they will continue to update the game post-release so even once Feburary 9th Rolls around we may still be receiving what I would consider ""new content"" - even if very minor.Allow me to explain what people have been worried about with regards to Feb 9th as well:Most people who've played the Early Access version know the games bugs and traits initimately -- and they are worried that BI will stick a ""Passing Grade"" Mark to this game and abandon it - this doesn't seem to be the actual case of what is transpiring here to my knowledge; Because of Time Limits from Publishers or other entities unknown, they are trying to release before a deadline; even thought they have every intention of completing the game afterwards - it -may not- be in an acceptable state immediately after release. I would expect the game to continue to develop new traits and abilities - especially during manned play even after release, with the number of bugs largely controlled to a soon-to-be non-public test and dev branches. This game still shows great promise - even if it is releasing a bit ""half-baked"".All in all Great game lot's of details - Worth a try for sure.8.5/10 - It's got some room for improvement but it's largely a great game.Review Edited: 6/23/2015 to revise paragraphic flow (No Major Changes to content)Review Edited Again: 10/5/2016 to account for small dynamic changes.Review Edited Another Time: 1/26/2017 to account for Near-Release Changes.If you do decide to purchase Take On Mars (TKOM) there is a setting I recommend for younger audiences to be toggled on as well as anyone who has problems with Nasuea via Proxy: In the options menu of the main menu under the gameplay tab there is an option called ""Gross Visual Effects"" - it recommended for aforementioned audiences to turn it to ""OFF"")*: The Interior of the MML Science Truck and MDV HAB are both radation proof - you have been advised "

												I really wish the developers would play their own game or maybe they do and can't fix it. This can be a magnificent title but the glitchy graphics and movement engine they are using almost destroys the game.The main issues:- Trying to move objects or place them is an exercise in frustration. Only the most patient players will put up with this.- Moving feels horribly sluggish. I am not sure if they are trying to go for realism but it destroys playability.- If you turn your head too far when trying to fine tune a placement of an object your feet do this weird shuffle which causes your whole body to jerk. This also frustrates being able to move and place objects.They need to fix object placement and movement above all else as a matter of urgency. Other games do object manipulation so much better. For example Kerbal Space Program and Astroneer where objects snap together easily.Yes this is a simulation but if the gameplay frustrates the player then they will not play it. A tentative thumbs down for this title until they make some urgent improvements. "

												I still can't recommend this game. Most of the problems I mentioned back in 2015 still exist in 2017, and as it's now been released, the ""it's still early access"" excuse doesn't apply.The only thing I can think is the person with the purse strings said enough is enough and forced a release date regardless of the state of the game.If you enjoyed the book ""The Martian"" then I'd keep an eye on this game, it might yet still blossom. At the moment though the space program part is as boring, tedious, buggy and unpolished as it was 18 months ago, and the manned part is so buggy I've not been able to get past the 4th mission. At one point my character teleported outside the truck from the driving seat and of course suffocated.The final straw was when your character ""sleeps"" time doesn't pass, so of course trying to complete the missions in a world of bugs is not helped by pitch darkness, blurry vision beyond 20 feet, and comical physics.A definate no, and given that the game is now ""released"" I'm unsure as to whether that will change.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Early Access Review - October 2015I can't recommend this game at the moment. It's not what it says on the tin.I bought it having looked at the screenshots, watched the videos, and read the reviews thinking it was a base building/ mars colonisation game. It's not at all.The main campaign of the game is just sending probes to mars, which involves pick a location, then watch the probe land, then depending on the mission you click ""Capture"" to either take a photo or take a sample of some gas. After a couple of hours you can make a more complicated probe that requires you to press one or two other buttons.Eventually you'll get a rover, which is just a tedious experience. In my experience it always ends up hundreds of meters from my target, which then means I have to remote drive it to the location. It travels so slowly that it can take 15 minutes just pressing the forward key to reach your destination. Sometimes your rover runs out of power so you have to wait for it to recharge from it's solar cells. This takes around 15-20 minutes, and you can't skip time, so this is a good time to make coffee and maybe have a sandwich, perhaps have a tidy up of the house.There are some single mission ""screnarios"" that have astronauts in them, but having played them that component of the game seems pre-alpha. It is very clumsy and unpolished. Arms and legs clip through walls, nothing has tooltips so you don't know what is interactable and what isn't, an issue compounded by the fact there are no tutorials. The UI on the 3D printer made me laugh out loud, there is no UI, just a list of things you can make in no particular order.			"

								Here's a slightly biased review by a space nerd:Take on Mars is the most beautiful space simulation game I know. The available locations are created from real-life satellite data and look stunning from every perspective. In Take on Mars you can build and control everything from landers, to rovers and even the ""Zero-G Probe"" that you can fly around Deimos and the asteroid belt (great fun by the way!). Also, you can play the game in either ""game time"" mode which allows you to fast forward time when necessary (e.g. to speed up research or wait for better martian weather) or you play in ""real time"" mode where you will have to wait in real life. You also get a variety of realistic science instruments to put on your vehicles and after you are done with your main mission you can keep doing randomly generated side-missions that suit your vehicle.The rovers are the center part of the game and your rovers progress similarly to the real rovers: Your small rover is similar to the ""Pathfinder"" or ""Sojourner"" rover, the medium rover looks more like the ""Spirit"" and ""Opportunity"" rovers and your king of all rovers, the large one is close to the ""Curiosity"" rover.Also they are working on a multiplayer build that allows you to build bases on mars and moon with your friends!All in all I am really happy I bought this game and especially people who are interested in space exploration and simulation will like this game. However, you will have to show some patience at times because especially rover missions can be time consuming.In short here are the pros and cons I can think of:Pros:+really, really beautiful visuals and incredibly detailed landscape+realistic terrain, real sites on mars+procedurally and randomly generated side missions+campaign mode including tech tree and budget+editable scenario missions+explore Mars' moon Deimos and the asteroid belt as well+weather changes, you can get into dust storms+multiplayer is in the worksCons:-You will need a lot of patience at times-might experience bugs at this pointEarly Access Note: The game can be played very well at this stage, bugs only occurr rarely. It is resource-intensive though so you need a good computer to run it. "

												I'm very disappointed - so much potential wasted in half-baked beta sold as actual game. I wonder whether people at Bohemia Interactive know that ideas like testing (SQA) and user experience (UX) have been conceived long time ago. I heard that TKOM was in development since 2013. Seriously? What were developers doing for four years? Designing new bugs? Here is the list (incomplete) of 'features' I have found out while playing the game:- when I load saved campaign I have to 'press any key' twice - why?- the graphics is blurry! I guess it was meant to simulate depth of field, but it resembles severe case of tunnel vision instead- there is no user manual- rover missions are designed in absolutely pathetic way - on several occasions I have sent a rover with black and white camera, only to find out later that color photos are required to complete the mission - description of required equipment of the vehicle clearly indicated 'BW camera'.- Terra Imager, the camera capable of taking color photos, is considered black and white when it comes to completion of missions where color photos are required.- on several occasions I was stuck in a mission because there were photos to be taken, but one of markers was not turning green (in open terrain, pretty close to the rover), or a marker was inside a boulder- when I drive a rover, something really strange is going on with solar panel (there are no other power sources on board). For instance: during the ride charge is 20W and drain is 30W, but when I stop the rover, the drain drops to 0 (it's not realistic, but I can live with it), but charge drops to 10W! Why??? Of course it's 20W again when the rover starts to move- animation displayed during time skip is simply awful- just after start of a campaign, several locations are described as 'all missions in this location have been completed' - by whom?- from time to time whole mission control room turns black and I have to restart the game.- level of detail in mission control room was probably designed with ZX Spectrum in mind This is not to say that the game is worthless, there are several aspects that are pretty good:- technology tree is rather short, but organized in sensible way- Mars shown as far, lifeless, desolate place.Long story short, currently the game is piece of you-know-what, but in few months it may become something worthwhile. Meanwhile, I'm getting back to absolutely fantastic Kerbal Space Program!			"

								Take On Mars is by far the best space simulation game I have ever played. There are many building and customization options, large maps, and even a singleplayer space program mode where you can advance your space program through the tech tree, landing black and white picture probes at first, but with work, you can land high tech large rovers with atmosphere processors, color cameras, and drills. The game also has a cool feature called the Mars Encyclopedia, a book in which you unlock pictures and paragraphs about Mars by completing missions. You can also build your own levels that you can play for custom missions. Another amazing feature of Take On Mars is the multiplayer feature. You can literally set up a server that is easy to connect to anywere in the world in just two clicks. Also, the develepors listen to the community's suggestions well, and they update the game often. If you are interested in an awesome space simulation game, Take On Mars is the game for you.			"

								Loving it.  I played around with the missions for a little while and then jumped to the onlne part.It takes a little while to get use to before you realise how simple but complex this game can be, you will need to either youtube how to play when it comes to building and understanding survival or ask someone to help explain it to you but after some practicing you'll be fine....just.Day 1 of knowing what to do, I land, got to a point, building a shelter....realised my o2 is on 0% diedDay 2: Tried again, got lost  forgetting where my base was, solar even kille me with radiation.Day 3: Found old base, upgraded it and built some more.Day 4: realised  night time alone is scary....started to think watching Alien is a bad idea on mars.Day 5: Did not sleep , thinking alien will get me.Day 6: Friend came to help, he decided to blow my transport up and run off with 3D printer.Day 7: Living on water and vitamins... sent a S.O.S call to Nasa and ESA....waiting for resupplies.

								I can see this game becoming the next great survival game with the manned missions, but due to the lack of content, and a small modding community this game will always be a hidden gem. Overall the best part of the game is the manned missions, and the ability to play mutiplayer. You can build a bases grow food, and explore parts of the Martian surfaces. The maps sizes or decent, and graphics are amazing. I recomend this game if your a space nerd, or if your intrested in the survival aspect of it.			"

								This game has alot of promise and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. Some things need more accessible tutorials in it and more player control but it's great fun so far. (Early Access at time of writing this review). If you are in to unmanned space missions and wish that you could drive rovers around on the surface of Mars to perform science experiments, then this game does a great job of fulfilling your dreams of working for NASA. With the potential that I see in this game, I give it 9/10.			"

								I've now spent over an hour trying to get into this game, but it's extremely unforgiving. You start the game off with $3 million. Research can easily bring that down to $500 thousand. Basic probe missions net you $150 thousand, but you *need* at least $50 to start these.Spent 30 minutes surveying Mars with probes these basic probes that I cannot control, taking pictures of the land. Ran out of money conducting research, and I could not afford to fund another mission (game over).Spent the next 30 minutes restarting the game. Surveyed all of Mars and built up my funds, so I researched a controllable zero-G probe. Think of a quadcopter, for space. This was obviously more fun to survey things with, as you actually got to do something. Only problem is that if you are too sporadic with your in-flight maneuvers, then components break. Components break, you lose control of your $1 million probe (yes, these ones cost $1 million). Good news is that if you don't screw up, you net $1.5 million. Otherwise, you're pretty much screwed.I spun my zero-G probe too fast, lost control of it, and went from $1.9 million to $900 thousand. Really really frustrating spending a half hour getting to this comfortable point, just to have it all fall apart because I held the Up-Arrow too long. It was then not worth the time to try and recover the funds.I would love to continue this game, but the knowledge that the game assumes you have about playing it is too much to learn without hours worth of trial and error, which means restarting your game multiple times, which means taking at least 30 minutes to an hour or more to get back to where you were.I DO recommend this game, I just don't know enough not to continue to get frustrated by it, so beware.

												SECOND REVIEW: I am now updating this review to reflect the launch update and information that i found due to the comments made by Mr. Monochrome and INFIDEL in the comments below. I admit changes have been made and the game up to the point i have progressed to is working, that being said i still beleive this game needs alot more work in that the tutorials are incomplete as far as explaining all you need to know when it comes to the machines,the mission objectives are poorly worded and easily misinterpreted, and still no guidance in game on how to complete the unmanned missions and still make money. This game is frustrating and i personally believe that most gamers will lose interest due to this fact in very little time. If the developers decide this is worth there time it would bring many new players to this game and could grow by leaps and bounds community-wise maybe even to the point of the ARMA franchise.  In conclusion as i stated before DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE FRUSTRATION.FIRST REVIEW:First i really like this game, maybe even love it. This is a honest reveiw and i hope it is taken that way.   This game is broken even in vanila, true it is early access, but it is coming out of early access on the 9th of this month. The developers are silent, there are no explanations or reason that this game should not work at this point. I have played this game with an open mind as to having small bugs or glitches, but that is not even the problem. The vanilla manned story seems to be broken at the point at which you need to set up soil extraction machines to gather fuel. The power is connected and rechecked multiple times and reran tutorial to check yet again and still the resource barrels will not attach to any machine or storage device which stalls your progress to a halt. The robotic missions seem to work okay, but again little to no explanation as how to progress along without going bankrupt and halting your exploration.The atmosphere and enviroment of both the manned and robotic missions is believable barring a lack of realistic logic and science as to how a flare would burn in space, not being able to scavenge dead astronauts space suits/helmets, empty crates on a space flight, missions popping up in areas behind you and you have already drove through with the rover, solar panels barely charging even though its bright as all ****, and others that im sure i cant even get to because of the afformentioned. That being said the game has great potential given that the developers will be more vocal on what is going on  as far as fixes and general information.  Breakdown:                     1. The game is broke                    2. There is little to no guidance within the game or anywhere for that matter                    3. The developers are silent                    4. Community content is irrelevant being 2+ years oldDO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Unless you really like being frustrated.			"

								Okay, I love this game, really, I really, really, really do. Wish there was something between positive and negative. But some things have kinda been in limbo for a fair amount of time and it makes me question what's exactly going on over at BI, awhile ago they broke suits for manned missions, meaning randomly, you'd start either freezing to death or burning to death, even if wearing a heavy suit, come back a year later, still happens and modders have tried to fix this to no avail, I believe this happened shortly after they changed how controllers functioned in the game.There are also a variety of bugs that have been in the game since day one and haven't been squashed, but they add more 'content' before fixing them, meaning they're building a massive stack of bugged content. Hell, sometimes the game just dies from the Player dying. It wasn't so bad, but as soon as random deaths started happening, it just took me right out of the experience.Basically, I loved this game, but God damn the bugs are killing me. I'll change this review as soon as a variety of the bugs that kill the experience get squashed. (That said, it's still better than NMS :P) I wish the devs the best in this endevour as honestly, this, for a long time, was my go to game to have fun and feel immersed on another planet.EDIT 27th Sep; there is a mod that increases thermal protection so you don't die every 2 minutes, still this should be addressed officially.

								OK first off, I love this game.. yes there are bugs, missing content ect, it is in Alpha right now. but by far this is the best sim I have found with space (Mars) building things ( I totally enjoy building thing ). survival, mining, building, thinking, if this is you then I would give it a shot. the first time i built a rover and landed it and took a soil sample.. the feeling you get is worth the bugs and glitches. I would say this is not for everyone because there is no combat, weapon crafting, PVP, PVE ect. but i think this game is more of a relaxed type sim, well unless your running out of O2 and there is nothing neer you to refill haha. <-- happends to me alot. but on the plus side of that my brother plays also and he jumps in the Mobile Lab and hauls butt to me so i can get to the airlock. ( tip: dont let you brother drive the MML with the rear lift gate down.. when he gets to you and you have 20 secinds of Air but there is no airlock door, well you take his suit and get to watch him sufocate. :) anyways A+ from me for this game, The Devs are really working hard to pull this together.

												I can survive the poor quality UI, the wasted time due to lack of direction on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions, but this game is so incredibly buggy. I can't walk through an airlock without dying either by being throw viciously out of it or because the character has walked too hard into the wall and is somehow suffocating in a pressurized room because his mask is broken.Or how about not being able to use the poptent because I had chosen to walk 10 degrees right and found it first rather than 10 degrees left and found the other part of the mission? Or how I found some machines but they just won't work despite plugging them in. Can't put an empty barrel on it. In Mission 4, an hour and a half in.Does bug testing just not happen anymore? Don't buy it. Wait until it's 80% off two years from now when they've half-heartedly released some patches.			"

								I bought Take on Mars (TKOM) a couple of years ago, following an article in PCG, while it was early in it's early access phase.  It was at the time monstrously, hideously, gloriously broken.  How broken you ask?  Well, most of the main game didn’t work and while there was a game engine for clamouring around on Mars, trying to build anything usually resulted in catapulting fragments of base hundreds of meters away.  Your character on Mars also lumbered about like an arthritic pensioner in the final stages of terminal collapse, and it crashed at the merest hint of a physics-object conflict.  And yet…I kept playing it.  Slowly, glacially slowly, updates came out.  Months went by at one point where a build made it impossible to play at all.  Most games like this, I’d have shrugged, written off the purchase price as an object lesson in looking before I lept and moved on.  But I’ve never uninstalled it, and periodically, between games of GTA, Kerbal and Metal Gear, I’d pop back to Mars to see how things were going.  As a result of my continued curiosity, I’ve somehow managed to sink over 60 hours into this game now, and rising.  It is still, safe to say, far from polished.  Movement is still a challenge.  Building anything before starving to death or running out of essential minerals, certainly in the core ‘manned exploration’ missions is a Sisyphean struggle.  But it DOES payback in spades in giving you that feeling of being the first person on Mars, exploring in a hostile environment.  Survival SHOULD be challenging, and every minor victory feels like a grand slam.  Didn’t starve to death before getting the mobile lab down?  VICTORY!  Managed to work out how to build a working, modular 3D printer? VICTORY!  Damn…out of resources to build anything else though…Don’t buy this game if you’re lucking for something easy to play, honestly hours can be sucked in and you’ll only make teeny, tiny progress.  But what progress you, and the developers, make in TKOM, will really feel satisfying!  See you on the dawn side… "

								If you like Space Sims and want to play something different from what there's actually on the market, buy this game. if so youìll have a lot of fun with it. The sensation I've felt when the cargo bay of the lander opened and I was in front of the vastity of the amazing martian landscapes, it's something I can't describe. But if you are not that kind of gamer, get away; the game is slow, frustrating, buggy and lack of dedicated servers to play with friends.			"

								I like this game, because it's slow. After a very extensive FPS, it's the best choice to relax. The only problem is the lost saves: if a new version published, the old saves became corrupt and I have to start the campaign from the beginning, what is very frustrating.			"

								At this point, I cannot really recommend this game.It started out as a Mars Rover/Probe game which is currently all you do in the campaign part of the game. It's mostly complete with some missing features such as science results, I think the rovers still never actually run out of power and last I played it, it was still confusing as to what type of science a POI actually wants you to do. The biggest problem is the amount of time it takes for a rover to get anywhere. Obviously the rovers are slow, but there's no auto navigation and while you can trick the rover into driving forward without having to press a button constantly, you have to keep correcting as the rover will constantly veer off course.The second part of the game, where the focus seems to have shifted entirely is the manned section, which is very interesting in theory, but falls short in terms of actual gameplay. Everything you do as a Mars colonist is very buggy and clunky with physics going haywire at the slightest provocation. For example, I managed to take out a bulkhead out of the large vehicle when trying to open a door, decompressing myself in the process. This is in part due to the UI being tied to game objects, which require precise clicking and even though you can change from interaction with the center of screen dot and cursor you can move independantly of the view, the UI is inconsistent about which input it will accept.Another issue I have with object interaction is handling basically anything - you pick up an object and when it's in your hands, you can control how far from your body you hold it by scrolling the mouse wheel, the rotate it with one key and rotate it in a different way by pressing a modifier button in addition to the rotation button. Most objects won't connect with another object unless they're position in a particular way and when you add the weird handling of objects, pile it on top of the physics you will probably watch the resource container you've been fiddling with fly off into the distant martian landscape.Content is being added but I'm not even interested in trying it out any more because the underlying issues persist and it seems backwards to add interesting things without having a stable framework that would allow you to have fun with all the elements present. The game is supposed to be nearing the end of its development cycle and I don't see it changing much in ways that would make it fun to actually play.In short the game has many interesting elements that are combined with clunky, buggy gameplay, making a potentially fun and interesting experience dull and annoying.

								This is a great simulation game for all science/engineering enthusiasts. Don't expect it to be an action loaded, entertaining game like an FPS. It focuses more on exploration tasks and is based on real NASA rover missions which are currently in progress (e.g. ""Curiosity"" and ""Opportunity"").Consider that this game is still in alpha/beta development and therefore you'll find bugs and unfinished stuff. A big advantage of this game is the moddability which offers a huge potential. Think about what can be done with this in future...That's exactly the reason why I would also like to recommend this to all modders. You really should create some awesome mods with it! ;-) "

								If you liked the movie The Martian with Matt Damon, then get this game. It is brutal, it is unforgiving, and it is hard but then again you are surviving on a hostile planet in a game set in the near future. You may see reviews of Mixed but much of this was based on the developers taking a little while to get the manned mission to Mars. Beforehand it was a robotic section and teaser of the manned.The title is new future complete and the only EA is them polishing it up and squashing bugs. It is a thinking mans survival game and a lot of fun. So in Steam review fashion:Vented my airlock without a suit 10 times, would play again: 10/10			"

								I ve had this since it first released on STEAM, but only got around to really messing with it lately.  Back at its first release it was really nothing but send probes to MARS and try to get money to send Rovers to Mars so you could drive them around. NOW. You can play it out in a campaign and work your way from probes to manned missions. Or you can play in manned mode right away. The game includes an editor to create your own mission, scenario's, add-ons and play how where you want.. from Earth to the Moon, to Asterdoids to Mars to other..Currently you only need to worry about providing a food source and water for your astronaut. But you will see quickly that on mars or any location with any amount of moisture in the soil or air its pretty easily done. Although they need to keep their habitat pressurized, failure to do so has no affect such as sucking you and your O2 out the hole or door.. you just choke to death.  Building is not an issue as your not required to have resources, only a 3d printer included in your mission. SO. Its fun, and the vehicles are really a neat thing to mess with. BUT It has a long way to go yet. I say its going to be a great simulator of space, but not yet. At this time if its on sale grab it if you like astronauts and space, it will keep you busy, but otherwise its kind of like Stranded Deep in space. Once you mess with it a bit thats it... Unless you take the real time campaign mode ( minus the days of flight to Mars ) and play it for a while to. BTW.. Meat and potatoes are you friend in this one.			"

Early Access Review
								Initial thoughts/review are only after two hours of gameplay - but I will come back to comment more in-depth as I get deeper into the available content.I never buy an Early Access title without following it for awhile first, to feel it out, and get some sense of dev/community interaction. This is no exception. Let's start here - for what they are charging for Early Access, I was pleasantly surprised.  It feels clean, well-executed, and rather than feeling overtly incomplete, rife with ""ragged edges"", it's actually pretty tidy in terms of how playable it is ""right now"", and how features that aren't yet ready are addressed, such as the presence of the blue ""Early Access"" icon that you'll occasionally see as you work thru the UI.Granted - while that statement in and of itself doesn't speak to the quality of the final product, what it does speak to, for me, is that of a team that cares about the Early Access users' experience along the way; consideration of the ongoing relationship between developers and players -  equivalent of that waiter that stops by your table to acknowledge you - even if they can't take your order just in that moment.In short - it's a nice touch that it would be addressed at all in this manner, and I hope this continues as the title matures and all features become available.  Other thoughts:This game won't be for everyone; it's methodical, a ""quiet"" game, a game for fans of astronomy/exploration, no doubt -and encompassing elements of building, strategy and simulation. Along the way, for those so inclined, there's plenty of science trivia. I see it as casual, but with purpose and intent, and good in that you can pick it up for hours, or minutes, with the option to ""bend time"" as needed if you want (or need) to move things along.  I like how the UI manages to be fairly straightforward/intuitive - you can pretty much dive in and figure things out very quickly,  and yet what lies ahead clearly points to indepth gameplay/strategy; it's easy to get into it, but you immediately realise - this is not going to ""stay"" quite so easy as you progress through the research tree - and your available budget.Speaking of that - the big budget your team have been granted isn't as much money as it may seem - don't spend too much, too soon.   The research-based ""talent"" trees cover everything from soil analysis and robotics to power management, but consider where you invest first, and how much, as you gradually build up funding for the various probes, instruments, protective elements and such that have to be added, tested, paid for, and successfully implemented - and once you do go for launch, don't assume everything will go to plan.   Fragile, precise, expensive instruments...limited budget - now let's throw in some insane Martian winds? Hey, what could go wrong? (...insert a little nod to Kerbal here).From the initial rough probe that bobs around helplessly on the surface like a lost bowling pin, there's a long road ahead of you to get from aforementioned bowling pin to footprints on the surface of the Red Planet.That's the ideal formula for me, anyway - in terms of time, and in terms of learning curves - accessible, but challenging - casual, but with clear directives.I think it's one of the fairer-priced titles in Early Access - fair and modest for what I think is a promising title, especially when I consider what I've seen for far higher prices on Steam.I hope to loop back to this review once I've logged more hours, and I hope to add equally positive comments.

												That the game released in this state is a disgrace, even from Bohemia. It's discussed at length in other reviews, but it is an unoptimized bug fest. There is a lot of content, plenty of good ideas, but it's like nobody thought about how to make it enjoyable for players. The controls are the clunkiest I have ever seen. Mind you, I play ArmA a lot, so it's not the complexity nor the variety of control schemes that repulse me, it's just that everything from the mouse movements to the character animations are absolutely atrocious. The game doesn't let me enjoy it, and that's reaaaally frustrating for the simulation / space enthusiast (and early-backer) I am.			"

								I recommend this game for anyone who loves a good simulation like myself. You're going to hobble around with a little rover at .5 m/s doing various scientific sub missions so you can slowly afford to build and launch larger landers and rovers with better instrumentation.Development does face a lot of small delays at the moment. Though so far in my experience, the dev team is very up front about the reasons as to why, no behind the scenes stuff and that's something I appreciate. If they need extra time for a completely legit reason, that's fine by me.			"

								I bought this game and played it for 2 hours straight. All I was doing was launching probes at Mars but knowing that everything I was seeing in game was rendered off topographic maps of the area and craters is astonishing. So much detail has been put into this game that it is worth your $17 alone. Now this game isn't for everyone and I am a HUGE geek when it comes to games like this but just the fact that I am taking an object with such in-depth attention to detail is just what makes the game. I cannot recommend this game enough if you have ever thought about the colonization of another planet or if you are just a curious science teaching working on a Astronomy lesson, this is a great way to learn more and more about the celestial bodies around us and a more intriguing way of taking the colonization into your own hands.

That said, this is one of the more polished early access games I have encountered and it looks as if it is just going to continue to grow.The way the game is designed though, I feel like it will eventually turn into something akin to Skyrim if a large enough fanbase were to get into it as the ability to mod the game allows for the creation of amazing things.The editor is a little wonky though, so hopefully that will get some more polish as well.All in all, this is one of the best space sims I've played so far.

If you can get in a go multiplayer server with some friends it is quite fun. When you are in space you will walk slow and drive slow. It will take time to do anything and everything.

I would recommend this to people for the multiplayer side, the singeplayer side is awfully terrible and down right boring. The game is now in its beta stages, and i was one of the few people to be on the alpha (i think, i had this game for a long time, it should have moved on. or i was always in the beta stage.) and now i see that they added a new campain for singleplayer manned survival.Very buggy and unoptimized, still runs a solid 15 fps, for a decent pc. (with somewhat printed things)It would be nice to have a thing for unprinting or something, because the wire barrels are really not needed.But in conclusion this game is not half bad, (and i dont know why i waited so long to review xD)7/10			"

I realize it's an early access title but the fundamentals aren't really there. The physics engine is jittery and jiggly almost to a comic degree and the career mode is pure grind that will have you do the same thing over and over again to do a different thing over and over again. Here's hoping as least some of this changes before release. Details:

								PROS:SO, Their i was..I Don't even know how to charectorize this game, simply incredible, and im surprised its not being shown to NASA or Space-x as a sim for space exploration and psychological study of our prime canadites we are sending on the MSL project (Mars Science Lab). This sim is so realistic in every way, from the rad counts and how solar flaires happen, all the way to airlock seals and intricate grid systems, i mean, even the solar panels get more dusty in storms.. This doesn't seem sci-fi at all, but more sim realistic..the single player campain has a full training system, vehicles, and what not to teach you about the controls of all the diffrent vehicles and what have you. The construction lab where you build your own rover, the tech tree of diffrent teirs to unlock depending on how much funding you got with successful missions, and even the wiki information thats ACCURATE on current findings as you explore the missions.watching the sky crane or landing sequences, or even the total destruction or even partial one that can happen if you really mess something up..You can sample the dirt, drill, take atmospheric readings, its just nothing short of content rich filled exploration.. thats just chapter one...The multiplayer works as well, and building with friends? theirs nothing like it. They GIVE YOU the engine tools to build models or import them from other graphic programs, the workshop community is vast, and even the scenarios, the scenarios are fun, never the same no matter how you play.those pictures posted? IS ACTUAL GAMEPLAY. Its that pretty.CONS:Being in early access, the lack of dedicated server support, and sometimes the infintile lag on certain maps is horrible, but happens rarely, when I find this happens, you will need to start a new map to get rid of it, but again, this is early access. Their are some random crashes, however those are related to engine problems that are activley being worked on at the time of this writting.The game could use an auto save feature option in it that the user can toggle.Good job developers, coming from a guy that swore off of early access games, i gave you a shot, and so far your not disappointing. please don't with the official build :)			"

								Take On Mars is a diverse, sandbox, martian simulator with lot's on offer from constructing and sending probes to Mars in the MarsX Space Program to building various bases and habitats with your friends in multiplayer. I've followed this game for a while and since the beginning of 2015, it has had a few critical updates improving and editing the gameplay experiance. Also it feels alot like The Martian :D. When playing this, you must bare in mind that it is early access - so do expect bugs and glitches thoughout. Here are the pros and cons (in my opinion) for the current state of the game. Pros:- Beatuiful scenery and fantastic, realistic gameplay.- Various scenarios and features to play with.- Very easy to create addons to upload to the steam workshop.- Updates and roadmaps to continuously improve the game.- Fun multiplayer which can provide hours of entertainment.- Simplistic HUD for anyone to understand.- There are so many destinations from: test environments on Earth, several craters on Mars, The Moon, Mars' moon Deimos, the Astroid Belt and low orbit space stations around Earth and Mars.Cons:- Bugs and glitches which can affect your gameplay experiance.- Lot's of features which you wish were implemented but aren't.- Limited gameplay in the Space Program mode.- Building can be complicated, confusing and frustrating.- There are no tutorials for manned missions.- The price seems a little high for this kind of game.The pros outweigh the cons in my opinion and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is intrested in space games, simulation games or sandbox games.

After tediously waiting to build up in oxygen in one of the missions, I lost a load of progress after the game crashed when trying to overwrite a previous save (I lost that save too). They released a severely broken and limited game. Avoid.			"

												Interesting topic of exploring Mars. However the game is still developing and has a long way need to go. Very intriguing gaming mechanisms at first, but getting tired soon due to duplicated work. All in all, after years of developing, it's still can not be called a proper game. Do not suggest to purchase right now.			"

								Here are a few things I've noticed while playing Take On Mars:-Airlocks and other doors are broken.  Airlocks are intended to permit passage between exterior and interior spaces without depressurizing the interior, as opposed to depressurizing everything BUT the space between the two airlock doors.  And regular interior doors have a chance of depressurizng everything as well, even if the pressure on either side is safe.-Damage to space suits is global, rather than on a per-instance basis.  In other words, if you damage the legs on your medium suit, then take it off and put on a completely unused heavy suit, the legs of the heavy suit are also damaged.-It's insanely easy to get stuck in geometry.  Attempting to get unstuck is also risky, as the physics engine loves throwing players around at high velocities.-Things that look like they should fit together don't.  For example, the corners of airlock corridors have the same radius as regular curved walls, but refuse to be attached to anything but airlock passageways.-The editor is both difficult to use and completely undocumented.  There's no indication that snapping is even a thing in the editor, making it impossible to construct a base outside of the scenario itself.-Mouse acceleration is ridiculous and impossible to disable, meaning that a movement of the mouse as small as a few centimeters can sometimes rotate the camera completely around three or four times.  (Keep in mind I'm not talking about mouse lag, which is thankfully nonexistent, mouse speed, which can be changed using the incorrectly-named ""mouse resolution"" setting, or the ""fluid camera"" setting, which can be disabled.)I do understand that this is a beta, and thus a number of the things I mentioned will probably be addressed before the game is officially released, but for now I have to give it a thumbs-down.

								Honestly, I haven't played this game enough to give a full review on it, but I'll say what I need to for now. Take On Mars is a (fun) space survival sim that was made by the makers of the Arma series. And I have to say that it's a pretty good game so far. I haven't tried a couple scenarios, I haven't tried the Robotics campaign fully, nor have I even been able to get the time to try out multiplayer. But from what I have done (messing around on Mars Island in a helicopter, floating around in space in orbit around a planet, getting ejected into space via jetpack, etc.) can give me a basic idea that the game is pretty good. It could do with more content with items you can build or do, like more things to do in the vast area of space. With the build system, it can get frustrating when working alone, but become a lot easier with friends.Honestly.... it's just space, what the heck do you think it would be? Boring? Ok well.... sometimes. Smash some bots in the campaign, fly a heli at Mars Island and crash it like an action movie would. Have fun for Christ's sake! It ain't all about Mars now ain't it? Ya got the Moon, can basically recreate the Neil Armstrong moment. Just get out there on Mars or the Moon and try not to die, either alone or with friends.			"

												The game is based on a great concept, but the actual implementation is poor.When I played this is early access I assumed the painfully sluggish item placement was still in dev. So when this was released, the first thing I tested out was placing objects. Objects still bounce all over the show, and the weight of your body and suit (feels very heavy in game) don't match objects... which can bounce around like a sugar-rushing toddler.Osiris: New Dawn is still in EA, but already sratches the itch this game could have - but with quite a few more aspects to it, and definitely better physics. Empyrion is another game that plays better in this space. Neither of these games are ""realistic"", but I would argue neither is the Mars ""bouncy house"" physics engine. :)  Glad to see there are some that have enjoyed this, but personally I was really surprised to see it released in this condition.

								There are many reasons that I like this particular game.  The first and most important for me is that it takes place on a planet that I had an obsession from my early days (Yeah just like Douglas Quaid! )  Although I was never a fan of simulation games, there is something in this title that makes me getting back at several times of the day. As I'm playing more and more I actually can't really consider it a simulation, but a slow paced adventure-driving game. In my head simulations are crazy difficult and too much complicated. Here things are simple - Press up and there you go - but it also has the depth with additions like upgrades and some kind of fun missions like photographing specific locations or even scooping and drilling.  The mood and graphics are more than excellent and generally almost every aspect of the game it seems that has been worked with much love (+1).  To be honest sometimes I wished It had some little surprises - just a tiny evidence of alien life (just a scrap) or maybe some caves (!) but I guess that's what mods are for..  I'm really happy that this game exists and it is a great companion when I'm not in the mood for fast action stuff.  "

								Love this game and totally recommend it! First - don't get fooled by the bad reviews. They complain about bugs, slow performence, etc.First off, this game isn't released. You need to accept that.. some of the bugs are actually really, really fun and cool. Though, the game is in early access. I would seriously hate for the game to go down, but I don't think it will. :)Take on Mars is very realistic and a REALLY, REALLY good Sandbox game. The campaign so far is really good. There's an awesome editor mode for making your own scenarios (and just for awesome role play), kind of like Arma III. I love that!The space and planet mechanics work great. Not in an equally pressurized place with no oxygen? Your oxygen in your lunges gets forced out of your mouth and you eventually die, unless you are smart and have a space suit on.There's an awesome damage system, meaning you can crack your helmet and break a big component of your suit, and it takes lots of your oxygen away and lowers the duration and time you got left till you run out of oxygen.The gravity in the game is also very realistic. If you are in an edit mode and go on the moon, you'd always want to jump around and see how high you can get in the air. Though, if you're in space, such as in the International Space Station or a little rocket ship, and you jump out, you probably won't be able to control where you are going due to gravity. This means that you're probably going to float away. You can avoid it by exiting your station/vehicle in space, but stay very, very close to it. For extra security, I hold down ""E"" to grab it. Then if you want, you can learn how to use a thruster pack thingy to thrust yourself back.There's a variety of space suits and vehicles to choose from, in which is a BIG bonus to the developers. Example, heavy space suits have more oxygen due to longer EVA sessions.In the editor mode, you may feel bored.. but then you just need to try things, such as placing a manned landing rocket thingy in the air, and watch as it falls and land on Mars, then step out and do whatever you want. I usually make up my story as I go in the editor mode.. that is what is fun about it.Then there are also robotic stuff, like landers and rovers that you can actually be in the campaign/edit mode. It's fun to mess around with that. Anyways, there are some bugs in the game. If you come across one, don't just quit and refund the game. Enjoy that it is a really cool game and in early access. Some bugs are fun to mess with! That's something to do if you're bored. Just.. don't get too crazy with them.Overall, great realistic sandbox space game! So far, the best space game I've ever played yet. I hope to see this game thrive and release in the future.==========================================Don't get overwhelmed by the bad reviews. I read all the bad reviews, bought the game, and totally had a blast! And I am still having a blast. :POverall rating: 10/10Good job devs!			"

								Great game, if you ever wanted to send rovers and probes to Mars (and Deimos), do scientific experiments and exploration there.Graphics are immersive, physics realistic and parts of your rovers/probes may get damaged ... not only if you mishandle them, but also due to the sometimes violent martian weather.Likewise, the experiments featured are all experiments that also are part of the real Mars rovers (like Curiosity).They just took some deviations from reality with regards to the voyage to Mars (which is immediately ... no long space travel required) and with regards to research times 8which is measured in hours instead of years).Also, you are able to steer the rover in real time ... with no delay between sender and receiver (as it would be in reality) ... the latter one is taken care of however, as they are currently developing a game mode, where you have to give your rover a batch of commands (like, turn around 30 degs, move forward, use RAD-Sensor and so on) which the rover / probe then executes ... even if it may result in its damaging or destruction.Definitely a game I would recommend ... it is good now and it is getting even better   "

Early Access Review
								TL;DR I've had this game for a good long while now, and every now and then I start it up again to see what's changed, but this last time had me really disappointed as I finally realized that in four years they've only made the game less fun.Let's start with the normal, singleplayer campaign. The beginning is going to be about 15 missions of dropping an unmanned, unguided probe and watching it land for about five minutes, then returning to the menu. Over and over. This could've VERY easily been skipped and the game would have lost absolutely no value. But I did it anyway. And then I started dropping actual probes, and even a couple rovers. I eventually had a decent amount of money which I spent on one really nice rover that I planned to drop in one location and then once it was finished drive it all the way to another, because it would save money which the game does not give generously. Let me clarify, the game gives money generously, but I found out why that's a bad thing when that special rover with all my money on board's automated landing system that you cannot control crashed into the surface and destroyed it. This is ""realistic,"" however this is not fun, nor a consequence of my actions. It should not be in the game. It only detracts from it, and it cost me roughly six hours of gameplay. I have not played this game mode since.Now let's go to the ""special"" singleplayer mode, the manned missions. Back when the martian was first hitting the shelves the first iteration of the gamemode came to players, and although the two were unrelated it was a somewhat similar scenario (not a bad thing). It's entire gameplay was about 5 minutes of a scavenger hunt in the wreckage of your ship followed by a Coming soonTM style screen, though. So I left it. I came back to it today and found the following. The mode now starts with a short video in which the audio and video desync rapidly, to the point that they call liftoff on the rocket about 40 seconds before the video shows liftoff, which is sad as not only do you miss the joy of a rocket leaving earth, the video cuts out over a minute early from where it should, so a good portion of the intro is never seen. You dock with ISS (though I only know this through the audio cues) and gameplay starts. And by gameplay, I mean a micro-scavenger hunt through the station to find a console, and then a repeat of that exact task, and then a flash forward. Do the same thing as before where you commit to a scavenger hunt on your downed ship on mars, but now with the worst voice acting I've seen in a long time. After it ends with literally no content added, you get a flash back to the moon, because apparently your character was on the moon in the past. To clarify, the actual stranded on mars part has not changed in about 2 or so years. The moon mission is a scavenger hunt of the worst kind, as there are no HUD cues and the objective is to find three supply drops that nearly blend into the ground, are far apart, and take a while to get to. After about 30 minutes of driving the moon buggy and finding two I stopped and wondered why I just wasted all this time doing literally nothing that I want from a game like this. So far the ENTIRE manned portion of the game is just various prescripted scavenger hunts accompanied by horrible acting and poor design.Now let's move onto the multiplayer. There is none. To clarify, there is multiplayer, but there are no players. I logged today and say exactly four people across four servers. It's dead. The reason being that it takes literal hours to build even the smallest of outposts with the game's mechanics and griefing is exceptionally easy as even the smallest bump can kill you.Overall, given the ample amount of development time and the substantial lack of progress that is good or promising in any way, I have to say this game is absolutely not worth $22. Go buy astroneer instead, the only thing this game has on it is the BI label that implies realism, but in reality the airlocks don't vent or pressurize and oxygen is handled very poorly indoors in general, and the whole game just feels like a strange pipe dream that wanted to go many directions and never picked one.3/10, without the awful random chance of losing everything the singeplayer would not be bad, but due to how slow and simplistic it is, I cannot say it's worth the buy on its own. Buy it on sale and avoid the manned stuff like the plague.			"

												This is a great game and I find it a lot of fun, but I do think they released it too early.  They even still have a few placeholder features in the game, it is still unfinished.  I'm going to review the manned and unmanned parts seperately here because they are basicly two different games.Unmanned:It is very fun and relaxing to explore Mars with a rover if you are the kind of person who is OK with not having much action.  I usually turn on an audio book or something while playing because it's a great way to unwind.  The driving model is incredibly well done, and they keep it as true to real science as possible.  There are enough challenges to keep it engaging, but it's still more relaxing then anything.  Definitely not something that every gamer would enjoy.  I bought the game back when this was all that it had and just for that I consider it worth the money.Manned:This was not an intended feature of the game until it was well into it's development and it was kinda' patched in there after the fact, so it isn't as well done.  Don't get me wrong, it's fun and all but they could really have done better.  It is still the best and most realistic simulator of it's kind in my game library, but they could have done so much better.  Simelar to the unmanned portion it it's more relaxing and not really action packed.  In it's current state there are some 3D printer recepies that require unimplemented materials and the power level indicator on the space suit HUD is still place holder, this should still be considered an unfinished game.  Multiplayer is there, but it's really best if anyone you play it with lives really close to you and has fast internet because it's terible and handling any latency at all.			"

								It's been in ""Early Access"" for 3 years and there is literally no one playing multiplayer. The single player is intensly boring and slow. It's very technical, which the development team is fantastic at, but there is no playable worth to the game. The only exception would be someone who is considered a tried-n-true enthusiast of robotics and/or uneventful planetary exploration. Message to Bohemia: I've been playing your games for years. As a company who chooses to focus on a very specific niche gamer, consider me to be as big of a supporter as anyone else you could meet. Thousands of hours devoted to your titles, so I don't say this lightly. You have two core game styles that emerge from Multiplayer, which is what honestly drives the popularity of your titles, not the campaign. Your fantastic military gameplay style, which would only need to be polished more responsive for future titles, whether it be ArmA or not, it's very very good being as intricate as it is. The other, Role Play servers. You inadvertantly created something that allowed the players to create the most perfect role play game on this planet. The only issue is that those people are inefficient, lacking development knowledge and core access. You have such a monumental level of potential with what's been made. If you were to make a non-military related civilian role play game, albeit equally weaponized with practical firearms, you would create a polished and perfected base for a very intricate and realistic roleplay experience. Just with ArmA 3 RP Life servers now, you are given the ability to do things that no other game allows you to live out. You need only spend a month in a Life server to see that the game is used in a manner that would overwhelm the gaming world if done in a fully developed way. With the advancements in VR, a Bohemia Realism Role Play game with a VR headset would be unstoppable.Food for thought. I apologize for the negative review, it is purely based on the playability of this game, for me.			"

								I bought this game on a whim as an aerospace buff and ended up playing it when my internet went out. This game is so solid it's not even funny. Even in Early Access, they have a great core game. Missions, objectives, semi-customizable crafts, and a fluid resource system makes me excited for future updates. 10/10 for an Early Access game.

								--EARLY ACCESS REVIEW--This is one of the more user friendly Bohemia interactive titles that I have found on the market. I was going to buy this when it first came out but i listened to that inner voice saying to wait for a while and see what happens. I am glad I waited until after the Manned Exploration was added. There is so much potential with this game, imagine your first task is get air to breath....oh crap I only have 1 hour and 15 mins of oxygen. It takes a few hours to get used to which parts go with each other but satisfaction is a guarantee when you have built your very first air lock so that you can recharge your air. I am now experimenting with the survival aspect of Take On Mars using the hydroponics lab to grow potatoes in my really odd freestanding base. This game even had me dreaming I was on the Moon and Mars jumping around building a base and lots of exploring. Get this game 4/5 stars			"

												I don't think there's a better alternative for a ""Mars simulator"" out there. If you're into the trend of Mars-related sci-fi with more sci than fi, this is the game for you.Not really the finished product, although I haven't played since the game left E.A. At any rate, stay away if you really hate bugs and glitches, and unfinished packages in general; but it already has great content, imo.They keep updating every now and then, which is both necessary and welcome. I think it's totally worth the price of admission already, but I really hope they keep working on it and, over time, the current price could very well be considered a steal.			"

								This is a mars exploration game (duh) where you are the guy in charge of reseaching probes,rovers and other vehicles within a budget and then sending it to mars to gather information about the place and at the same time teach you,the player real life facts and events about mars itself.Its quite an interesting game if you're an avid space guy and wanna learn something new about mars and its moon.But i would like to say that this is a game that needs patience and tolerence,especially later on in the campaign because thats when the bigger,more complex machines like large rover are unlocked through research and i tell you the missions for those are long and ardous,especially since every part of the rover is so slow .So for me,it isnt uncommon to spend close to an hour to complete a mission and its major and minor ones.And maybe its just me but i cant find a fast forward button but even if there is one,i probably wont even be able to use it,the vehicles are fragile,so very fragile so constant attention has to be given so that  the rover dosnt veer off into some ditch like mine did.many times Its not fun to come back finding out its wheels came out just because it hit a little rock and yes its that fragile.So all in all,its a good game,it trains your nerves and patience,it teaches you stuff,the graphics are  pretty nice although it looks rough in some areas and its well made.One word of advice though, the drone of the rovers are very irritating in the long run so I recommend playing the game on mute.And get a weight to put on the keys if you're using a keyboard to play,theres no cruise control for the rover  as far as i know and theres no auto-pilot and dont even think about auto navigation, you know , like press a point and kaboom ,you get teleported there ,nope ,this is a simulation so my advice is to get a nice,good weight for the forward key at least.Oh and there are still some game-breaking bugs and glitchs in it so im going to wait for the full release before i touch it again.I suggest you do too to if you want enjoy the game without its stackoverflows and fatal errors.

								This simulation is outstanding. Unmanned (land + space) and manned sim, all in one.I'm outraged at some negative reviews written by people with 3 hours of game on record. Early access means opportunity to improve the game before final release, so use it, instead of ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it. Intellectual dishonesty is despicable, as is insulting the obvious hard work behind this project. And no, I-m not paid by anyone.The scientifc depth, the attention to realism, the gameplay, the graphics, everything testifies of the skills of the developing team, and their commitment to an ambitious and fascinating project. Kudos to them, also for their responsiveness to the community.I am about to finish the space program, therefore haven't nearly explored the whole scope of the game, not even tried the manned or survival part of it. But I can already confidently say that even only with what I have seen now, this is well worth the money. The BETA is stable. And it has the potential to be, simply, a masterpiece. If a number of recommendations and ideas as presented by the community will be integrated in the final development the game, it can IMHO attain a level of unprecedented excellence.Of course, this is not for adrenaline junkies. I process my mails, watch the news, and even manage some substantive discussion with my wife, while playing this (...). But if you are into realistic space exploration, astrophysics, astronautics, (space) engineering, then do yourself a favor and support this project. Devs, don't give up. I know people want space zombies and stuff, but I-m not the only one enjoying and appreciating the scientific (and fun) dimension of your project.Building my first large rover, landing it, navigating it through Martian terrain, and proceeding with a successful series of scientific tasks... that was freaking good.The Zero-gravity probe is great fun too. Here too, the experience is very immersive, the wannabe astronaut in me has a hard-on when navigating the asteroid belt and getting, after a careful approach (prepare to see your vehicle shattered by debris, or crashed by your recklessness), to scoop dirt and more, while zooming out in the big black space.  Highly, highly recommended.Current games: Silent Hunter 5 (heavily modded...), Verdun, and now ... Take on Mars.			"

								After several failed attempts at docking with International Space Station (ISS), decided to just relax and let my ship auto dock. I sip my coffee, and watch the ports line up on my display. I raise an eyebrow. ""Seems rather quick for an auto- JESUS CHRIST!"" I swat at the manual override button, but it's useless. A loud bang and explosion of gas as my hull depressurizes. The cockpit canopy above me shears away, revealing a dizzying spectacle of swirling stars. On instinct alone, and in what could have only been a second or two, I release my harness and dive out through the gaping hole. A section of the craft snags my suit, tearing one of the legs. Still spinning. I see the solar panels of the station. Stars. Panels. Stars. I'm getting closer. I might just- Miss it completely. I close my eyes. I ponder how far I'll drift in 45 minutes before my oxygen runs out. Do I even have that long? I only know one thing... I'm dead. Twirling amidst the vacuum. Glancing at the blue sphere I occasionally catch from the corner of my eye. The ISS growing further away... did it mean anything? Any of it? No. Not now. Not for me. F--- it. I sigh as I begin disconnecting my helmet and fade further into the black.			"

								Take on Mars could easily become one of my favorite games if Bohemia takes it in the right direction. Currently, the singleplayer guidence is severly lacking. It teaches you about the different rooms within the faciliy, goes over the map, and finally gives you the option of using game time or real time. Thats it. I didn't get too far into the singleplayer experience but I would assume that theres no lessons on what to do once you land someone on the surface.(I do get that this is still being made)Multiplayer and scenarios (?) are super fun when they go well, but terrible when they dont. Singleplayer scenarios never crash (unlike their multiplayer counterparts) but lack the entertainment that another person brings. Multiplayer crashes often but can be so so so much fun. The physics engine seems a little wonk, so exploiting it in the mobile lab or on top of the flying lander is just plain goofy. Base building may need an update, right now you have to put every single panel in place by your self. There are no templates unless you are editing a world. Overall, this game is worth the money if:a) you have someone to play withb) you are willing to be patient and wait for the bugs to be hammered out			"

Early Access Review
Take On Mars (TKOM), another entry in the ""Take On"" series by Bohemia Interactive, is one of the only games of its kind. It is a fairly realistic Mars mission simulator. It sports two modes: Space Program and regular singleplayer. Space Program is exactly as it sounds. You take control of a space agency of some sort, and you are tasked with completing missions involving exploration of the Martian surface, or even analysis with a small rover or lander. Your early endeavours will involve a lot of picture-taking and roaming the surface in search of more picturesque views to photograph and send back to the Earth. Regular singleplayer allows you to fast-forward a few years and actually walk on the red planet, which is essentially treated like a survival game, allowing you to build a base and grow food on the desolate surface of the planet Mars.Take On Mars is one of my personal favorite games. It looks great, plays well, and the experience is always different. All of the modes are really fun to play, and you have a lot of freedom in either scenario. You 3D-print pieces to make and personalize your base in human mode, and you can choose what equipment gets loaded onto your landers or rovers, like extra batteries, higher-powered antennae, or even nicer cameras. The game is still in development, with the release just on the Horizon (is that a Mars rover joke? I don't know. I don't keep up with that ♥♥♥♥).While I do love this game, I have to talk about performance. I said it ""looks great."" That's sort of a half-truth. I run a modest GTX 660 in combination with a Core2Quad that's always on its period and is more irritable than you would believe. Due to my budget-level setup, I get okay performance on okay settings. Luckily for me, the engine the game is built in has the most ridiculous graphic settings menu I've ever seen. On top of being able to change regular settings like anti-aliasing or SSAO, you can set the actual render resolution, which basically just renders everything at a level proportional (or equal, if you choose) to your screen resolution. I play in 1080p, but if I need to, I render at .9 times the resolution, or 1728x972, to get those extra frames. The most recent update added adaptive physics, because those can really kill your performance, especially when you build a big-♥♥♥ base for no reason. Hey, I can't blame you.ProsRealisticGood visualsGreat gameplayConsNo space travel, just ground or orbit scenariosSpotty performance on some machinesReally, really, really derpy player character modelFinal Thoughts:TKOM, even in its current state, is very playable and highly enjoyable for space-y types. It has a vibe similar to that of The Martian (starring Matt Damon, fantastic film, watch it if you haven't already) and plays however you want it to. If you like KSP, you might like the space program management gamemode, except you may be disappointed in the fact that you don't hand-craft your ships, hand-pick your crew, and personally control the flight. Otherwise, TKOM is a fantastic game well-worth the price, and it comes from a reputable dev that knows how to deliver a damn good game.Rating: 9/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												There is a good judgement to tell if your going to like this game or not. Ever watch one of the NASA livesteams of them doing an EVA working on the ISS? If you thought it was exciting, then you are going to love this game. if you got board and wonder where all the space pew pew pew was, You are going to do the same in this game.  Couple that with a game engine that is not optimized for this sort of game. While it might say no need to wait till the 1930's to take on mars. You might need to wait so you have a decent enough computer to play it.  Listed system requirments are garbage, Even the recomended is garbage.  I would put the 680 is a min and the 980 os recomended. And even with a 1080TI, your going to hit performance isssues with some settings and building.  "

												This game is awful in so many ways - and yet, I highly recommend it!The basic premise is to run a space program, explore Mars and other parts of our solar system, and if you play the campaign from start to finish, you start with Rovers and progress to manned missions. As the player you can very much scale the challenge to what you want to do - some missions require you to just move a camera, others need you to pilot a spacecraft in zero-g - and that is both as boring and as challenging as it sounds.The game tries to give you that Space Program feel, and there begins the problems. The interface is clunky, it's not explained at all, and there are any number of cutscens that just bore the crap out of you. Some of the challenges require a mindnumbing rover-drive for 1 km across mars - that gets really boring too, and feels like you're investing offline time for in-game progress. The game is just as unforgiving and buggy as all of Bohemia's products are. I've had two crafts fall through the ground on insertion, and since you're always kind of strapped for cash, that can cripple your program and force you to do some of those long drives or reload. The game - for some inexplicably bad design reason - doesn't autosave when you start a mission, so reloads can cost you if you forgot to constantly save.And yet, it is so much fun! The feeling of building a space program is very real and the challenges with bugs and the penalties for failure make you feel exposed to the elements like in a survival game. I've played a ton of Kerbal and I love the heck out of this experience, bugs aside.So really: give it a go if you love space exploration and strategy games.			"

Early Access Review
								I can't understand, why people are so angry about a Early Access Game with some bugs and glitches. Yes, they are in the Game and maybe a long time, but I repeat: It's Early Access!!! The other thing is the way you play the Game. Myself, I had the patience to drive around a Rover for HOURS and I MEAN HOURS!!! You can adjust the speed to ""realistic"" but that is too slow, even for my kind of patience. For a ""realistic"" player, i must mention, that you can also give orders in form of timed console inputs, instead of driving a rover (or other craft) with the keys. I am bit over 40 Years old and can remember the steps of Mars Exploration from my Childhood until now, so for me, a dream came true, when I saw the Game in the Sale and decided to buy it now, even in EA-State, because I watched the Game for a long Time.I still enjoy it very, very much! I have a 4 year old PC and a 2 Year old Graphic Card, not the best, not the worst. The only lag i had was, when physics and graphics, for example in a sandstorm, came together. Then i noticed, the game becoming ""clunky"". Simple Trick: Save the Game, back to Game and it vanished and you can play another hour without disturbance. And I'm playing on max Graphic settings, so can't understand the problems of the other people here, having massive lags and graphic problems.As you watch my gametime, be advised, I'm still in the Robot-Exploration Phase, because I want to play the Campaign ""My way"" with discovering ALL Missions and earn lots of money. You may play the Game another way and that's also, what pleased me much: Do what you want, when you want, where you want and follow the path of Exploration, but: LOOK FOR HAZARDS!!! The sandstorms can kill your Rovers in short time, so seek shelter behind rocks or dunes, before the lenses of your cameras are so scratched, that you only can drive in 3rd person Mode. I love this realism! I love the way my Rover makes a ""Salto"" when i underestimated a small cliff. I love it, when Energy runs out, because i forgot, that the polar region is MUCH colder than the deserts and driving AND heating the Instruments need too much energy together.That leads me to another point: You always can save and load, WHEN you decided right at start, where the Game asks you, if you want to play realistic (no fast forward in Mission Control) or not. A crash? Ok, loading Game, once again. What  are the people expecting, when they play the ""realistic"" way??? Donuts and Coffee? Self steering, magic, landers, avoding obstacles and rocks for themselves? Red Carpet for your machines and a flat road leading to your exploration targets on the surface? Man, THIS IS A SIMULATION!!! Maybe realistic, maybe not, that depends of the player, but you have to LEARN, that Mars Exploration is a series of failures and crashes. Mr. Google can help you find out, what REAL Exploration is like. I am German and watched with great interest the actual Mars Probe of the ESA. What happened? Another unsuccessful Mission and a bit of very expensive hardware rotting in a Mars Desert! That's LIfe!Hey, i bought this Game, i can exploring the Mars myself and don't have to wait until ESA has success!			"

								As a 13 year old space geek I can definitly say that this is the game a lot of people like me can love.Yes the game is glichy, and yes its not complete, but the thing that makes this game what is it is, is the concept. See I love KSP, but I'm really into mars rovers and manned missions to Mars. I got this game when it first came out on my dads's laptop but had to delete it later. However, I got it agin before Beta release. The thing about the game in the space program is that I can get a look at what real rover operaters do. Now I know that the rovers part is really unrealistic, but it sparked my ""Curiosity"" and made me want to become an rover operator at NASA.The manned part of the game is, well its just awsome! I once wanted to be the first human on Mars, but after finding out that its not a return trip, I gave up on that dream(I stillwant to work at NASA or be an astronaut). But Take on Mars Is like a taste of what the real missions might look like. I love just plying around with the manned section and the editor, but what really gets me is the experiance this game gives me. Another thing is that games like this are not common and so they are really awsome when someone does make them. Also, Devs, you are amazing. this game is amazing, the community is amazing!			"

								This game is absolutely a must have.Comments are for the manned missionThe initial game play is intriguing albeit it takes time to get comfortable with the controls (the controls are superior in the long run).The Expedition One campaign is a fun experience... but if you are left wanting more (or perhpas better) their are volumes of community content at hand which is steadily expanding.Build habitats and greenhouses, extract and manage resources, provide for long term survival. The remarkable thing about the game is the immersion into a simulation and that it was purpose built for modification.My Personal Note: This game requires significant processor, GPU, and memory resources. Standard laptops and old or lower performance desktops will not likely offer a satisfying experience. Additionally, reliable broadband is required for MP.Post Release updates are forecasted			"

								At first, I was a bit bored. The beginning probe/lander gameplay is a bit tedious and the game doesn't go out of its way to explain anything.Then, I moved onto the rover stage and launched a hail-mary pass with a medium rover to explore a little area with a bunch of objectives right next to one of my old landers.Next thing I know, it's five hours later, and I'm having a surprising amount of fun exploring Mars, doing my own interpretative dance in the form of The Fast and the Furious: Mars Drift, and drawing ♥♥♥♥♥ in the dirt all over the planet. I finally found my old lander, then spent a while trying to slowly dismantle it with my rover's robotic arm. Now I'm wondering if I could manually navigate a small lander to land atop a large rover, having a criminal amount of fun, and I haven't even touched the new colonization and zero-g probe features yet.This game isn't for everyone, but I give it a hearty recommend to anyone interested in space exploration.

								It's a planet exploration simulator. You research different parts/systems for your ""moon vehicles"", construct them in your garage with budget in mind, and launch to mars. A lot of available parts, gadgets, systems, bits and pieces for mars exploration on your vehicle. Complete different missions, be it simple temperature or radiation reading or difficult soil and rock scanning for water or presence of life. Good visuals, though landscape is pretty plain and boring, good vehicle physics and animation.			"

Early Access Review
								--For those wanting to just get to a hands on review skip to the secondary section.--I have been watching and following, and in the past had time to help with hunting bugs and harassing the devs with copy pasted reports since it first came out on early access. Over time I have gotten to see this game grow more and more, thus expanding it's own potential. Take On Mars not only is a simulator, but an educational platform (Hence the wiki data you unlock in the Robotics portion.). With games like this, and Kerbal Space Program, I see a lot of potential for games to bring new challenges and focus to many forms of education in simulation that can even be utilized in classrooms to get kids interested in space exploration, physics, astrobiology, and aeronautics through adaptive and hands on learning.I know it's been a long time, and yes the due date has been pushed back, and yes there are still bugs that need to be smashed. But in the end, Take On Mars will be a perfect platform for both simulation lovers, and Mars Enthusiasts as the work put into this makes it one of the most unique games currently in beta. Long strides have been made in gaming technology that opens up more intuitive and complex forms of learning and adapting to in game demands through user comprehension and skill. This game needs as much notice and support as possible.------------------------------------------------Section Two--------------------------------------Take On Mars is a game based on the research of Mars in understanding what is to be expected for human crews to work with. In the first portion you are able to utilize probes, lander, rovers, and advanced equipment to study the martian surface and gather real world intel based on scientific findings. In chapter two you will take the role of a surviving astronaut who has to survive on the surface through building and maintaining equipment (Chapter2 is still in development.) Also there are singleplayer and multiplayer scenarios, along with an editor so that you can build your own scenario and upload it to the workshop. Along with this is the ability to easily mod the game files via the developer toolset if you're into that. This gives grounds so a lot of malleability to the game and what players can do with it. Overall, despite it being unfinished I have to give it a 8/10 for both the improvements, the dev team, and the uniqueness of the game. There are others sure, like Mars: Challenger, which is fun but not one I can honestly recommend. All in all, Take On Mars is a gem, and to those wondering if it is worth buying I will say this:If you don't mind putting in the effort to submit bug reports, push the game mechanics, and test different aspects of the game then yes, buy it and help the developers expand and debug more of it.If you want something polished off the bat and are not patient or willing to aid in development, then no, and nor should you buy any game on Early Access because that is what it is for.

												I was actually issues a Steam Credit refund with 4 hours on record.I really love games like this. The whole ""Super realism"" thing always gets me, and it is in space which is also super cool.But, when playing it I just felt like it had been through 0 play testing, and no one had tried to push the limits at all...For instance, durring the manned mission campaign you need an Oxygen Tank to pressurize your little tent in order to complete the mission. But I did not know this because it was my first play through. So, I tried to use the tank on my suit to get more Oxygen for my suit.However, it didn't work it just emptied it into the atmosphere. Then when the part where I needed to fill my tent up, I could no longer do it, it wouldn't even snap in place anymore.So, I thought it was the wrong item or something and spent the remaining 14minutes of oxygen I had looking for something else, but never did.Then once I figured out why it didn't work, I beat the mission and went to the lunar mission where it told me I needed to go south of the base to find supply drops, and that was all it told me.So, I started driving the buggy south (Which refueling the buggy was insanely difficult, it doesn't tell you how or what to do, left is empty, right one is fuel up spent maybe 10-15minutes messing around with it.)So, Im driving on the moon with my buggy when all the sudden I fall through the floor of the moon, and I am just now falling forever under the mission.I restart and walk up to my buggy and i get flung into space, the movement and physics engine is horrible. You can prop surf on accident very easily.As far as the robotics campaign goes, I am not sure, whenever I tried to do a mission and went back to the Mission Control room the screen was entirely black and I would have to restart  the game to fix it.It really just should not be out of Early Access, it feels like a game that shouldnt even be out of Pre-early access. There should still be lots of inhouse testing.i would not recommend in its current state.However, i feel if by some miracle they fix bugs, I feel like online multiplayer with some good mods might make for a really fun space survival game. IF IF, one can dream.			"

								This game at it's stage has a very great potential, and right now the game is going really decent.Graphics - Slightly buggy at times, but good at max (recommend strong computers)Scenarios - The maps are amazing, especially how precise they are.Player - The HUD inside and outside the player are detailed, but could use some improvements.Space Program - The robotics mission is alright and the manned mission is still in progress so not all of it is released.Stability of the Game - At times, there will be memory issues but it depends on your computer so I'd suggest saving every few 15 minutes.Rating: 9/10 - Would recommend this game to people who are interested into Mars and adventure (sort of).

								I'm a fan of the survival genre. I'm a fan of the science-fiction genre. Put those two together and you get Take on Mars.While not completely finished, as denotes it's Beta Build, it is on it's way to becoming a remarkably accurate simulator (with obvious gameplay exceptions) of survival on Mars.That being said... it does suffer similar problems to most Open World Sandbox games of the same ilk at the moment. Notably the 'nothing to do but survive' problem. At least in most scenarios. Take On Mars, however, seems to address this problem with the Scenario / Scenario Editor... you can utilise triggers, events, etc. to create a story arc style of play. From landing, base building, to extraction should you want it, and thus solve the major issues of the survive to survive most survival genre titles have.What strikes me most about this game in either the Single or Multiplayer, is the emptiness. Some put it down as a Con, I put it down as a Pro... Mars is empty. There is very little to do there in reality, and this is refelcted somewhat by gameplay. However, the inclusion of science experiments, sampling, and more would add greatly to the overall experience. You can 'fake' science with the previously mentioned Scenario Triggers, but this pales in comparison to what the developers could possibly do in terms of story arc.Single Player - The Single Player Gameplay starts with what could be considered a 'modern space age' where you send probes, landers and rovers to Mars, Deimos, and even the Asteroid Belt. After 'completing' this portion of the campaign gathering all the outlined data under objectives, you are ready to launch your manned mission.I don't want to spoil the storyline of this mission arc, but Mark Watney move over, there's a new King of Mars. And it is story driven, though limited in scope. Starting in one area, and moving to another. With no option to alter which starting area, nor where you head to.If you're looking for a completely free-roam Open World Sandbox game, this one is not for you. If you're looking for a game that throws enough realism in your face to be accounted a 'true' survival game then this is the one for you.The team seems dedicated to keeping updates flowing, and they do address problems with the product as they can.The game has been in Early Access for a while, but this doesn't phase me in the slightest. Years in development is basically any title that has something unique about it, or needs to be built in a different way from previous titles. Comparing development times of a game like this to games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty wastes time, and mental energy. Building onto previously formulae (Battlefield, Call of Duty, <insert other franchise here>) will always be faster, easier, and more efficient than creating something new, and I prefer the effectiveness of Take On Mars to the fast development that would see it be a reskin of another title.In conclusion, the game does have bugs, and some of its elements lack polish, but if the development team continues the way they are going it may well show a new way to experience survival that actually throws whatever it can at you to make you fail, without big green aliens, zombies, or other post apocalyptic horrors.

												Bohemia has just stated the game is complete. They will continue to support for bugs but no new content will be added. Currently there are 2 campagin modes. You can go unmanned in which you have a budget and need to research items to unlock lnaders rovers and other more advanced items. If you do not unlock the correct items in the the correct order. You could run out of money and not be able to launch anything to gather more. At 1st all you can do is launch a probe with a camera. As you upgrade and complete more missions. You can build rovers landers. Take soil air rock samples tempatures and everything like real space agencies. Huge con:The 2nd campaign is manned mission. Which is the down side. It feels more like a demo vesion. You have crash landed and must get back to earth. There are objectives to complete. When you complete those (Don't mess around. You have limited air food and water.) You go into a cutscene to the next scenareo. There are 8 (I think 8) scenarios that you can play. They are sort of mini missions that will take you about 20 minutes to 1 hour to complete each 1. Will help you get used to the game.The manned mission willl last you about 2-5 days of playing. Depending on how fast you find the items and how much you play. SAVE OFTENPRO:Mods but also a con. You have to install a mod to get empty land to build your own base as big as you want. Multiplayer. Build a base with your friends however there are a few bugs here and there ""Bohemia is aware there are bugs in the multiplayer""WAIT TILL UNDER $15 It gets boring fairly quick.			"

								I wanted to love this game/simulation so very much, but unfortunatelly, this has been stuck in endless Early Access for far too long. Initially, the development team seems to have been taking their sweet time doing tiny updates to this title. After a year or so wasted, the development did pick up. However, lately, it's back into constant-postpone mode. The release date is actually no longer even specified and just says ""at some point in 2015"", even though not that long ago it was set to ""june 2015"". The game itself is quite fun and relaxing, you explore the surface of Mars, using vaguely realistic and progresively more modern technology. Over the course of development, other bodies were added and a manned program is now also available as a ""cherry on top"". However, bugs are a plenty, and the neverending development hell is what makes this not recomended to anyone, but the biggest fan. Once it's released and fixed up, it'll be an excellent title, worth the recomendation, however, in it's current state, such release is no longer even guaranteed.			"

								For an Early access game, I've spent a lot of time playing it. If you're a fast paced, unlock everything right away sort of gamer, this game isn't for you. This game is very well made and fun to drive and manage your Mars program. The game works in a way where you have to research technology in order to unlock different vehicles. Only one con about this game thus far: It does get a tad repetitive at the beginning.

								There's just something so calm and satisfying about driving on the surface of Mars for hours. You do some science stuff in the space program, building custom landers and rovers and researching new technologies to unlock new parts for your vehicles. There are plenty of locations available that are fairly big, so you won't run out of Mars surface to drive on anytime soon. There are also several scenarios in the game, some which enable you to play as an astronaut on Mars (and even on the Moon and in orbit!) and built bases and drive around in big cool rovers. I only played 6 hours as of this review, but I can already see that there's plenty more fun to be had here! So if you like things that have something to with space exploration, this is a must have game for you, in my opinion. Also, if you read The Martian by Andy Weir and liked it, you'll probably love this game too.			"

								I don't even have the words to describe how much I like this game...Or, you know, ""game"". Not sure if the word applies, but I'm going to use it anyway.Here's what you do: Send stuff to mars. On mars, you control stuff like the wheels on rovers, various cameras and scientific equipment etc. Everything is very slow-paced. You have specific missions that tell you to photograph certain features, test the atmosphere at a specific locations, etc. There are no enemies. There is very little challenge... Except it reuires a very specific type of mind to enjoy spending half an hour driving a tiny rover a few hundre meters of more or less featureless desert to take a few photographs, maybe a soil sample, then move on.Lately, more challenges have been added, which I really like. The tech tree wasn't there when I first began playing, and I enjoy trying to figure out what to research next in order to unlock the next batch of missions. It also feels like money is a bit tighter, which means a bit of budgeting and making sure you don't overextend. The vehicles run out of juice earlier as well, which means there's some challenge in trying to get as much use from each rover as possible, completing several missions before it gives up.Another kind of challenging thing is how easily things break. I've completed several missions with rovers that are missing two or more wheels (using well-known workarounds such as driving backwards)...The graphics are top notch aside from a few quirks (sometimes rocks still hover slightly above the landscape...)All in all an incredibly rewarding experience to the patient-minded who want a break from pvp and rts and fps...

								I was not going to write a review on Take on Mars until it came out of Early Access but i feel i should. This game is a bit of a mixed bag for me and while i love the concept of this game i feel it could contain a lot more content. Take Multiplayer for instance, Once you have built your habitat? Nothing. There is simply nothing to do. Even collecting samples and analyzing them is too simple and gives you nothing for it. There are still a few bugs for me which hopefully should be gone by the time it goes full release. Singleplayer is another story though (forgive the pun). To me this was awesome, hands down just awesome, especially the recently introduced manned space program. Its like being in the movie martian. i would recommend buying this game just for the story. The other selling point for me personally is ""who wouldn't want to go to mars?"". So final verdict i give this 7 out of 10 for A originality and B just to take a concept like this and turn it into a full standalone game is worthy of praise.

								I remember reading on the bohemia interactive forum that Marek and Ondrej Spanel originally didn't want to make a war game like OFP or Arma. I wondered what they wanted to do then. Maybe Take on Mars is the answer?I played OFP/Arma/ArmaII/ArmaIII with all the mods and addons from 2001 on. I really liked the series but I withdrew from it, because of the war theme.But after a break I'm with BIS again! Because of TKOM! I really appreciate BIS is making a game that concentrates on exploration/surviving/managing rather than killing and destroying.I'm really impressed by the quality of the game and by the climate. BIS is really a great game producing company! I will buy any DLC that will come out after TKOM is final!Your faithful customer for 15 years now!			"

								This Sim has everything you would expect of a triple a game. it has survival, building, and great asthetics. i give it a 4/5. would give it a 5 out of 5 if it had a way to set up a dedicated multiplayer server that could run 24/7.			"

												First off let me state that I'm not the type of person to say ""I told you so"".But during this game's time in EA I kept stressing the fact that Bohemia Interactive missed several deadlines that they themselves assigned; even making a few posts on the Discussions board and leaving a few comments to warn people about what to expect. The responses I'd receive were in the field of, ""It's Alpha just wait it'll be great!""Well now after several delays we're here and out of EA and while this game is an interesting concept it handles like hot garbage. Bugs bugs and more bugs. The controls are awful and getting anything built of worth is a slog through sticky muck.I enjoyed the concept of the single player campaign/story they added (ignoring that it mirrored the Martian almost completely, cause original story design is hard), but my enjoyment was hard fought after dying when I tried to lay down in the Poptent my first night, dying when I sat down in the Cargo Truck, dying when a canister I dropped into a cargo box ricocheted and slammed into my head (that was pretty funny despite the auto save being almost an hour old), and the worst of them all, me eating one of the ration packs erasing the progress I had on a previously completed objective making it impossible for me to actually finish the story. (Why the objectives don’t lock upon completion is anyone’s guess)On the subject of Multiplayer, why in the world does this game lack the ability to host Dedicated Servers? The Peer-2-Peer that they have in place now is god awful. I guess I can hope that eventually they’ll address this issue and release dedicated server files, but I’m not expecting much. So to wrap this up after all the delays and all the “It’ll be great” fan service what we’re left with is a game that feels unfinished and an overall sense that BI didn’t have the time to sit down and actually test their game from a playability standpoint. I’d say avoid at all costs unless it’s on sale for $5 and you really enjoy the concept of space games, even if this one explicitly does a bad job at most everything.			"

												Well I was honestly hoping for them to fix the multitude of existing bugs before even considering a full release . Boy was I wrong , they went straight from bug ridden alpha to full release. That leads me to assume they gonna stop any and all development and move on. Sad as they game had potentiall but needed  the bugs fixed. Simple things like no rocket sounds on desent in landing in mp, tripping on a rock and flying 100 metre to your death, these have been around for far far too long and still not addressed. So many small bugs it hard to list them on the list goes on and on. Sad that they decided to push it to full release in its current state does not bode well for this game.Best part is does not matter what mp you choose coop or competive the landing craft nasa sends you down in is not radiation proteced. As if NASA would really be that stupid to send an astronaunt to mars and not shield his landing vehicle . Why even send us there to let us die before even leaving or landing craft makes really good sense way to go NASA.Hard to believe but it gets worse , major solar events every few minutes making it impossible to survive due to the total lack of any kind of radiation shielding provided . like really NASA would send ppl to mars knowing full well they would die of radtion exposure on day one HMMMMM something up with that. Not to mantion your astronaut is a total clumsey fool. falling and tripping over the slighest obstacle or even when brushing walls, would NASA really send a person to mars that uncoordinated, Thier a danger to themselves and everyone around. I get the feeling that somehow the research that went in the game was misguided or deliberately corrupted. In all honesty the game played better 6 months ago than it does now.Lets get real , true astronauts which  Nasa wold send to mars would be the best of the best , physically , mentally etc. They not gonna run out of breathe or have extreme heart rates after a few sec of exertion lol , they certainly not goona be majorly clumsy either  the current ingame representation is the exact opposite of who would be sent to mars. Unless of course you wanted a guarenteed failure of the mission.As an interesting side note appears certian member of the community have taken to using thier acess to Dram as a tool to attempt to silence the ppl they disaggree withOriginally posted by Caribcanuk:Reality is niether space x or nasa would ever send a person to mars knowing full well the instant they land they gonna recieve a lethal dose orf radition before even leaving the capsule. Who would send ppl to mars knowing full well the instant they land they dead in hours from radiation poisioning. The capsule has nothing that is in anyway effective , the coop capsule has shielding but the competive , thats a death sentance fisrt storm your radiated to the read level not the orange the RED , You stand outside or in the capsule you get the exact same dose , A buddy and myself tested it i , makes no difference inside or outside same dose . So IF it is shielded then its clearly broken. Oh and BTW Dram basically accused him of pirating as well wjich i find quite appalling for any developer to do completely unproffessional, considering that the op may of bought then refunded, clearly you two are presuming thier guilty with no proof.I've REPORTED *OH NO!!!!* your concern about the shielding being too low to Dram.Apperntly broken or non existant shielding  on lanfding capsules in competitive is not an issue for Dram and not important. Guess game breaking bugs are too low on his list.			"

								I'm really enjoying this simulation. I agree with other post though, wish the analysis was a little faster. And sometimes the tumbling probes can't go on a little too long. I do like that you can double click when going to the Lab to avoid the cleanroom but it would be even nicer if it took you directly there instead to another screen where you have to double-click again to get to it. That's probably being picky though.I have no idea what the triangles mean on screen when landing but to be fair I haven't read a lot about the game so far. Thanks to all that have posted guides. I had to restart the game because I researched everything and lost all my money.They are very helpful figuring stuff out.

Early Access Review
								Played this game on a friends computer and had to buy it for myself, so that's why my time played is low.  Summary:While this game does have it's bugs, and the physics system can be downright frustrating, this game is addictive and should be looked at by all survival game enthusiasts.  So far I'm loving it and with the modding and multiplayer features, especially the custom scenarios, it has alot of replayability potential.Long version:The campaign mode is broken up into two parts. The first half involves you sending unmanned probes and rovers to the mars surface to complete missions for money.  That money gets spent on purchasing new equipment to carry out those missions as well as the research required to build new devices.  You can customize the equipment you send to mars as well, and its possible to use the rovers to complete multiple missions if it is equipped properly.  To be honest, this part of the game bored me, and I didn't get past the first hour of dropping probes to map out different parts of mars. The second half of the campain mode is the manned storyline.  It includes voice acting (well done imho) and a cohesive storyline that parallels Andy Weir's ""The Martian.""  This part was fun and well paced.  It centered around a manned expedition to mars that goes completely wrong and you are left stranded.  You complete goals and gather supplies to survive and attempt to make it back home.  The final mission even gives you a 3d printer that you use to craft things with to complete some goals, and in my opinion, this is where the game was the most fun.  I encountered a few issues with the storyline getting stuck (cutscene transitions mostly), or goal completion not registering properly, but not often and nothing game breaking, and I'm sure those will get resolved by release.However, this game doesn't come without it's problems, as any game does.  The biggest problem is with the physics engine's collision detection.  Object seperation due to collision does not always resolve gracefully, and many times results in a violent seperation.  Too many times you will die from an object (or you) spazzing out trying to resolve a collision detection event resulting in your death, or objects will be sent flying off at great speeds.  Because of this, SAVE OFTEN as this game has no autosave function, and you could potentially lose hours worth of work to a buggy physics death.  As a developer, I realize that physics are important for realism, but sometimes there is a need to disable physics or fuse objects together for the sake of game stability.  For instance, grabbed items (in your hand) should not clip with the avatar, creating a ""surfing"" effect causing you to fly off into space.  Some of this might be fixable before release, but I imagine some of it might require some extensive changes to the core physics engine, thus we might be stuck with it.  Movement is slow which makes accomplishing tasks take longer than in most games, but that's part of the realism and completely intended, so I don't have a problem with it.  The modding system seems pretty powerful and already there are some interesting mods in the steam workshop, including scenarios for you to play that have unique environments, goals, and starting supplies.  Fun survival vs environment mechanics that is a refreshing change from the constant stream of zombie survivals.  Multiplayer:I've only played locally by myself on a LAN, so I can't really tell you much about net play.  From what I've read, it's buggy, but the devs are working on making it more stable.  It has two game modes, competitive and co-op, so that part is nice.Survival aspects:Resource gathering is done via powered machines that gather generic resources from the martian environment such as rock, dirt, and atmosphere.  These are then put into a refinery to be broken down into chemical compounds, as well as raw elements.  These resources are then used for crafting, vehicle fuel, and personal survival (oxygen and water).Crafting in this game uses a unique modular 3d printer system.  The 3d printer is capable of building most game objects, but larger objects need larger printers.  Upgrade to bigger printers by building the parts from the previous one and assembling the new one.  Habitats can be custom built through a modular part snapping system.  Crafting and resource gathering is fun, but after a while you might get sick of hauling tons of resource barrels around from place to place.  That's where mods help out (resource cables/digitized resource transport)Can't think of anything else, so if I missed something, feel free to comment.			"

								Take On Mars is a great game, but with any game there are many problems with it. The idea and way the devs have done Take On Mars is great but has lacked unlike the main game of bohemia interactivewhich is ARMA 3, doesnt have many Issue like take on mars. here are some of my issue:-Cant play on a server for more than 2 minuets with out it crashing (i have tryed changeing all my settings but nothing happens)-Cant delet missions or saves without going thought the game files-Some mods are a death sentence for take on mars-The interaction with objects, players, ect (in some cases) dosent work at all.-No 64 Bit version of the game only 32Bit-If I move to fast the game will crash for no reasion (vsync issues maybe??)Here are the positives with Take On Mars:-Great for simulating what life would be like on Mars-Great mini Story/Missions with the rover Gameplay-Great information on mars that has been supported by many different space programs-With out the Bugs the game would be great and how cheap it is unlike ARMA3 it is great even in the AUS dolla (which is ♥♥♥♥ thanks to tony abbot <^_^>)otherwise the game is great worth a buy if you want it in is current statePS: i would wait till the end of this year of next year to get Take On Mars, Because it has a long way to go before it will close to a finish game			"

								Do you like Kerbal Space Program? OF COURSE YOU DO, WHO DOSEN'T LIKE KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM!Basicly I will say that Take On Mars is almost like Kerbal Space Program, only that the game focuses on Landings and explorations of the surface on Mars. As a real nerd on space stuff I really enjoyed this game.You can re-live the Curosity landing, find an old russian probe, experience malfunction on probes and rovers.But since it's a early access game it got some limitations and because of that I'll give it a Early Rating on 6/10! Still a good and fun game to mess around in.			"

Early Access Review
								> Had the game on wishlist for almost a year> Bought in sale> Was training for the Mars, got hot and heard strange breath> Saw my Avatar the first time, had to ignore> Travelled to Mars> Found myself stranded in an incomplete campaign> Played a scenario from workshop> Deeply impressed by the immersion on Mars> Just enjoying the atmosphere> After 20 min recognizing that seems to be all> ""Mars sightseeing sim, have ur travel booked today!""> Tried creating a good scenario on my own> Failed in the Editor due to missing options and functions> Kinda frustrated and sad> Writing a good review cause hoping the game is beeing finished!Its great. Dont get me wrong. The game lacks a huge amount of content and thats kinda frustrating. But if u wanna experience the great immersion beeing on Mars on your own...go! Only thing to remember, thats nearly all. Its like ""go and have a look, how it feels there"". There are some user scenarios which add additional experience. But they are all very simple. No long term motivation.I bought the game for beeing on Mars on my own and try to survive in these conditions. And i had 1-2 hours fun in the ""campaign"" (which suddenly ended after 20 minutes, BÄM, incomplete) and then tried some scenarios from the workshop. Nothing really motivating.Hope to find some energy to deal with the ""Editor"" and creating a nice ""Martian"" experience some day.			"

												I like this game, specifically the manned portion of it. You really get to experience what it would be like on Mars.But I can't really recommend it.1. The manned portion is short, and rather disappointing. Storywise it was ok, but not great. Most of the manned portion mechanics are completely unused. You can build bases, but it's not at all needed. You can mine, but it's also not needed. It almost feels like they ran out of ideas or got sick of developing it..2. The game is buggy. Really buggy. You can accidently kill yourself at times by jumping and somehow getting launched into the air. You can stand on items and pick them up to find yourself surfing through the air. The atmosphere in your base can suddenly vanish, for no apparent reason, leaving you to asphyxiate because your suit ran out of air.3. It's poorly documented, making it very difficult to know how to do some things, ie pressurizing a base.4. The UI is not great. It's very easy to accidentally use the wrong refinery recipe. It's sometimes hard to see the displays on machines because you just view them as in game scenery rather than getting a display interface. It's sometimes hard to connect barrels to slots and the key needed changes depending on scenarios.The robotic portion of the game is ok, but it again is hard to work out what to do at times, and can be hard to meet objectives because it's either unclear how or buggy, though it's not clear which.If you are only interested in the manned portion, then you most likely will need to be playing multiplayer, because the campaign is brief.If you can tolerate all these issues, and the idea interests you, then you'll probably love the game, as I do, but as it is, it should not have left early access.

												I would like to begin with that I got this game in EA and have given this game alot of time to become something beautiful.......I love space games and thought this would scratch a itch I have had for a while but it just made me feel really really sad.EA and Game Mechanics:There has been alot of frustrating bugs since EA that are still there in full release- you can stand on something and pick it up so it makes you into the silver surfer- you can run to close to a wall and trip over- you can run over a little rock and trick over- you can run up a slight hill and guess what.......... you trip over- sometimes when you trip over you can fly 100's of feet away and also so can the object your holdingUnmmaned Mission:- the game gives you no idea what the mission symbol's mean.- you can go bankrupt so easy because you have no idea what you are meant to be researching because at no time did the game ever explain.- You can programe a rover a course to follow but will not follow it because it slides and goes way off course (I first thought it was because wind but it slides into the wind) because of this rover missions feel so boring as you have to sit there for maybe 30-40 mins at snail pace.Manned Missions:- The story is just plain ripped off a film and even then its awful- very short and can complete it in 1-2 days- filled with alot of tedious stuffI thought the unmanned missions was going to finally lead to you actually leaving earth and making your way to mars but you will never use earth apart from the tutorial and you will never use the space station apart from 10-15 section.... such a shameMultiplayer:Sadly to say that multiplayer in this game is just pointless- once you build a base there is nothing to do, research or any reason to use your base.Conclusion:The price they are asking for this complete mess is crazy and would only MAYBE think of buying it at a heavily discounted price because this company has never really cared about this game or worked towards fixing long outstanding bugs			"

Early Access Review
								This Game is very fun to play. This style of game is simular to a Survival/ Exploration/ Science type game. Although its still in development, that does not hinder its already fun content. Play the campaign, play a single map, or maybe try to create your own adventure with the editor. With some luck you may even attempt to create your own map in the workbench tool from TKOM's Launcher.EDIT: For those who do not like this style of gameplay or the game in general, i must note that you are not obligated to by this game before it is finished. Early Access Games are ment to have the community help in the development of the game, not to give you a polished game from the get go.I have come to realize that some might not like my point of view on this game, and that is your right but to challenge someone based on your own opinion is not what is needed. Post your own review if you want to give potential buyers your POV.As for the Modability of this game, yes its modable but so are most games now adays. It allows the developers and industry to showcase those hidden talents of those who may not be able to develop their own game.This game is primarily a space agency simulator that has mars, the moon and a few astroids as it's goals atm. It also has a manned mission section to it, this is where most of the multiplayer aspect comes from.This game has good things and bad things about it. But most games also have this and they have been top award winning games. If you want to know the good and the bad of a game, seek a review that gives you the pros and cons. I like this game and as such the cons are minor to me if ive even encountered them at all.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I played early access, and had really high hopes for release. Reinstalled when I found out it was taken out of EA and released...Completed the introductory part where you have crashed on Mars. Managed to get into my tent and sleep. Next part, you're another character on the moon. I spent 20 fuggin' minutes trying to get the 2nd Methane tank connected to the Rover. No matter what direction or angle I came from, it absolutely would not give me the option to connect, only drop. This game is an absolute buggy piece of sh*t. Don't bother.			"

Early Access Review
								THIS IS A REVISED REVIEW - Where I have changed my rating from a Must Avoid to now ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND - Must Buy & Try.  Bohemia has made great progress with all the updates, and I'm playing it again after almost a year away.I liked the concept of this game from the moment that I came across it in Early Access and bought it.  It's the kind of game that I wanted to like so much, and have played for enough hours to give it an honest chance.  As others have said, It is NOT intuitive.  So, you have to find your own way through it most of the time - but I don't fault it for that, and in fact kinda like figuring stuff out.  I'm a 'don't help me - let me figure it out on my own' guy anyway.  So now, the rest of the story...  I break TKOM down into two categories:1) Multi-Player - Let's be fair: Pass!  I didn't buy it for the multiplayer, and haven't ever launched that part once, so I'd refer you to other reviews for pros and cons on this part. Moving on...2) Solo Play is divided into two sections: - First, the ""Space Program"", where I was immediately bored silly by launching an endless string of probes around the various craters on Mars, and completing photo recon, atmosphere & soil testing, etc.  I'm not knocking it!  It just didn't do it for me, y'know?!  That said, I never had any issues with it, and it was stable - so, the ""Space Program"" just wasn't my kind of game, but you may like it fine.  Snore.....zzzzzzzzzzzz XD- Second, the ""Scenarios"" option.  This is the place where I spend my time.  In this mode you are on the surface and can harvest resources, build a base, and have free rein, and I now find this part absolutely fantastic.  The modding community is active with all sorts of new add-ons and new scenarios to try.  When it comes to base building, you have the original Outpost style that is fairly user friendly to build and looks really good.  But now, you also have a different style base option called Modular, and it opens up the ability to have more complex, multi-level bases.  With the original Outpost style, when you build a wall, floor, window, ceiling, whatever, it just requires lining up the one, single block and your DONE.  But, with the Modular base, OMG, for a single section of wall, you have three layers to build, exterior, interior, and a final finished skin for the interior.  Two things - a) personally I like the simplicity of the Outpost style, and much prefer the looks; b) The Modular can take hours to build a single room, even with the 3D printer right next to you and running non-stop.  It might be worth it to me if it looked better, but I thought it looked like a building from some Gulag prison colony on Mars xD.  That said, I'm sure it would go together in a snap in multi-player with a team working on it.  It's really just a matter of taste.(BTW - My earlier review detailed the frequency of crashes every 30 minutes during gameplay, and happily, that is a thing of the past - I now find the game quite stable.  Another annoying quirk of earlier version was that when your character exited a bunk, chair, anything, after resting, he would seem to bounce around the cabin as if Zero G, until he died of his injuries LOL - This issue has resolved in newer versions).  Also, in my initial (negative) review I DID SAY  that TKOM had phenomenal potential... and it has completely lived up to that, with all the great updates.  Good work Bohemia.  I would still like to see an auto-save feature built into the game, but manual saves work fine for now.I hope some of you found this helpful. Cheers.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a revised review, after many patches.The good:- Many diverse game modes. And I do mean very diverse. - Decent modding support and capabilities.- One of the few games that does give you that old ""hard-SF"" space vibe. Its a nerdy game abotu space, which feels very refreshign after 100s of ""flashy"" fiction games on the topiuc of space exploration.- A decent survival game with resource extracting and base building etc, somewhat minecraft-style, but more rigid and more serious.The bad:- The game's physics engine is rough around the edges. When it works its great (does  aphenomenal job of simulating very low gravity on the moon for example). But at times you find yourself tripping over a cable in earth or mars gravity and the physics engine glitches and sends you flying 10 meters into the sky. These sort of physics glitches are annoying.- Its a ""take it slow"" game, not everyone's cup of tea. This might appeal more to pleople who play simulator games than to those who prefer action games. Both the manned and unmanned parts of the game - Shady and inconsistent OS support, something I really need to complain about. When I purchased the game, the Bohemia Interactive site listed ""Windows XP / Windows 7 / Vista"" in the Reccomended settings.  Now on steam its just Windows 7 and Vista. XP support seems to have been silently dropped and I feel somewhat cheated, as I was not able to play the game for a long time until I upgraded my PC and got a new Windows.- Some of the textures look a bit dated, though it has to be said that nice lighting and post-processing does a great job at covering this up.

								As early in the piece as it is, I have to say this game has lots of potential. I say game, as much as Farm Simulator is a game as well. They pretty much share the same mantle of sandbox exploration and techincal process to achieve simple goals. No shooting anything but rocks, and expansive, visually sutunning landscapes to drink in.  If you're a fanboi of space exploration (the real kind, without the frickin' laser beams -  strike that. It DOES have laser beams) then this is pobably what you've been missing in your life. And BIS do some good games. The Arma series is still very popular, due to their encouragment of the modding community. And ToM is no exception. It's early access, so you can still have some input, and it's cheap. If you like Kerbal Space Program and looking to release your inner Planetary Scientist, then I recommend you pick up this title.

												Just like other Bohemia Interactive products - the game is extremely buggy. Mostly in movement mechanics. That usually causes strange behavior and death of a character :(Other gameplay things are very cool and challenging but Multiplayer sandbox lacks any goals (like scientific exploration research). So once players establish a prosperous base there is nothing to. That makes further gameplay boring - both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes.Furthermore - the game has critical bugs in multiplayer mode that would stop you from further progress.			"

								heres a game that keeps your mind in the space age. wearing space suits, breathing air from tanks, eating food from bags, and drinking water from a bag. the days of regular eating and drinking has changed. your normal activitys are not the same. all life depends on your work and experance in making sure your every breath is taken in the future. if you do not work for the future of your exsestance it will end in agony. starting off with nothing but a few supplys, that will last a week or less. the enveroment is terrable. sand storms, dust collecting on your solar panels. equipment that works but needs a lot of power, where their is little of but from the sun. wind power would be nice. multi-play is ok but their is littel to do and with small amount of supplies. no monsters to fight and no other colonist to fight. game is slow at min to min but can be crazy fast with min to hour mode.can be better and i am sure it will be with new update coming soon.look out mars humans are coming			"

								It's a simulation. Look up that definition and you will know weather or not this is for you. I don''t understand what is taking so long in the dev process but it is still worth a buy. Also, the controls are... Well if you have played Arma then you know how these devs create controls...			"

								Take on Mars: The Real Mars Simulator...Yes the first thing that comes to mind when I play Take on Mars is Gran Turismo. The game is very realistic and beautifully presented. However just like Gran Turismo it does get a little repetitive after a while.The game is very well made. It is highly informative and gives you a good sense of experience in controlling a unmanned mission to Mars.When I played it for the first time I found it difficult to understand. But after couple of hours of clicking to find the right screens I began to understand the idea of the game. This does make the main game difficult to play. There is a tutorial which you will need to read. Also researching technology in the game is not clear and difficult to understand. I hope in time that they will fix this. In the mean time you will need to explore the game itself as well as the planet Mars to understand how it works. If you do lose patients with the main game there are many single missions which will keep you occupied. They are all great fun and very informative. If you enjoy exploring then this is the game for you. You will visit actual locations on Mars, using actual scientific equipment to unlock the knowledge and mysteries of the big red planet.Depending on your graphics card the detail is amazing. When exploring Mars you do feel very alone on this vast world. The highly detailed graphics and sound effects create a atmosphere which leaves you very isolated in the game.The controls are awkward but I believe that was on purpose to add to the realism of controlling a remote control vehicle across space.I do recommend this game but you will need to be a little patient at times on how to play it. The game is still in it early stages and the potential for this game is vast. I am personally hoping they add sci-fi missions like a manned mission to Mars or first contact with martians. At time of this review being submitted the developers are currently very active in listening to the players and improving the game.			"

								This is a very good game. Sometimes the glitchiness gets in the way of gameplay, but you have to expect that for an early access game. Gameplay is nice. Graphics should have an even lower setting for people who don't have a powerfull enough computer. Sound is absolutely amazing. Theres a weird glitch that when you get out of bed, a vehicle, or chair, sometimes you glitch through the wall and die of compression/damage. I hope this is fixed in at a later date. I would rate it a 8 out of 10. Good starting point for a game.			"

								I have always been a fan of Bohemia Interactive, This game has a lot going for it.  If the devlopers put as much effort into this game as the developers of Arma 3 do then we would have possibly the best and most accurate space sim game ever.  I have so many things in my mind that i would love to see in this game, if only the developers were willing (or maybe even some good modders) please continue expanding this game and adding more content to it, id even pay good money for DLC's if they included planets and moons further out in our solar system if in good detail, heck even those gas planets would make for interesting game play...

								Planetary exploration sim for egg heads. For as long as I can remember I have had a fascination with earths red neighbour. Since a child I have watched and read all about the various probes and landers sent to Mars.  Heard all the stories, myths and theories surrounding that place. It won't be long now when we will see a real possibility of a human stepping onto mars for the first time even if it will be a one way trip.  Take on Mars has really surprised me. I was expecting some kind of open world Mars exploration game but oh it is so much, much more than that. So far I haven't even set foot on the place. I am playing the campaign which means I start my journey right at the beginning with simple probes and black / white pictures.In this mode you literally live through the history of exploration on Mars. Each successful mission earns you money which you can then plough into research to create more advanced exploration vehicles. As you advance it opens up ever more complex missions for your landers to complete. The lander camera view and the rugged Martian landscape really make you feel like you are in mission control.  There are a ton of other things you can do in Take on Mars including scenarios and multiplayer. For less than £10 this early release is a real diamond in the rough. Its fairly stable and very playable. The sounds and visuals that accompany you on your adventure add to the atmosphere.Take on Mars is not going to be for everybody. Its certainly not fast paced and the only action will come in the form of technical disasters or your astronaut suit running out of oxygen. For me though it gives me a chance to do something I will never experience. Its a wonderful journey about what has been, what is now and what is coming in the near future.I hope the developers keep putting their love into this title because if they do it will be a superb finished product.

Roving around Mars may sound fun for the first 30 minutes or so but the additional details they add to the game like building a field base or collecting data from areas of interest or visiting Deimos and the asteroid add a lot to the experience, 232 hour's worth in my case. I especially liked the space program and I think it has a lot of potential to be even better once Beta is finished. Even the scientifically accurate reports when completing tasks was fun to collect.Good game keep at it BI.			"

In terms of gameplay it is quite fun, and realistic, but also very slow. I know that real missions are quite long and arduous, but the game shouldn't be (in my opinion). Other than that, if you like space and have a pretty good computer you should check this out.			"

								edit:  I understand that this game is in early access/beta and the timetable provided by Bohemia is an estimate but given that these 2 months were supposed to be about fixing and tweaking features, im kinda assuming that all the known bugs posted on the forums will be dealt with.EDIT 2: Clearing most negative comments i made - when it was purely a settings fault, a dev helped me and now everything is running as it should. I'd like to add for this game that its not only the Space Program that will be the main thing you do, the scenarios offer a nice variety of settings (and story in some/objectives) that are really enjoyable. this game will beat many in terms of innovation and features, gonna jump back into the Lyot scenario, where you start with oxygen for 2min at a crashsite ! enjoy if you're buying it :)			"

								Can't fault this game in any way really.It does exactly what it says on the tin and more besides.With the manned mission coming, it shows nothing but bigger and better things on the horizon.And the best thing of all is that I can honestly say this has been the best experience of early access development I have encountered ever.Mostly it's just an occasional update. Sometimes it's a game released as a tech demo and then the devs vanish with your cash. Other times they release a couple of tiny updates that do nothing much, then call the game finished.These guys have been incredible, with a huge amount of updates, constant feedback on the forums, both here and the bohemia forums.I have even had them add me as a friend, ask for my input personally, and seen my suggestions added within a day.I have had them reply to a problem I was having, email my save file to one of them (Dram, he is just the best, seriously, great developer for early access, he is into helping the community all the time), and had a patch released that fixes a problem that only I was having. He did that within 2 hours of me posting the topic on the steam forum.As for the game. If you have any interest in this kind of thing, then this is for you. It does exactly what you would expect, and it does it in such a way as to make you feel like you work for NASA, without having to learn all about rocket science and such to do so.This alongside kerbal space program show exactly how this kind of game is great for early access, when they have the right developer.I can't fault this game at all.The only thing is that I am itching for release now, to see how the finished product turns out. But with all the new things they keep announcing, it looks likely to be in early access for a while.But seeing as the early access experience here has been almost as enjoyable as the game itself, I don't see that as a terrible thing. I have been made to feel important, an integral part of the evolution of the game, right from the start. And their enthusiasm hasn't waned at all.Buy it, buy it now, even if just to support early access done right.			"

								This game has been through a lot over the past few years but now i can say with my hand on my mouse :P its worth every pennie 9/10. But be warned this game is more than a challenge its a ♥♥♥♥ing mission and after and hour or so you are going to be begging for Matt Damon to save you.			"

								This game is a few months from its final release and yet it still feels like it's in early alpha. There are a ton of bugs and the game doesn't seem to run smoothly at all. Everything is tedious to do, even exiting the initial lander vehicle is difficult and you will most likely get stuck in the elevator or float in the air the first 3 or 4 times you try to leave.This game has a lot of potential, but it seems to be very far from fulfilling that potential. Instead it feels like a very primitive sandbox in which you can only move with the speed of a crippled 80 year old man who lost his crutches.I wouldn't recommend this game, at least not for the next 12 months.

								This makes you feel like you are a rover on mars. It has very good filters to emulate the experience, and nice environment effects. This isn’t for the type of person that wants to play COD, however if you like to just chill for some time it is a good game.			"

								Watched the movie Martian?  This is as close as you will get to living that experience, and so much more. Can you survive?This game is shaping up to be an amazing simulation of visiting far off planets in our solar system as a pioneer into the limits of human survivability. It is a hostile place filled with dangerous solar radiation, no air to breath, no food, no water, and nowhere to live. You are tasked with overcoming these challenges using the most current technologies available to mankind.Mars... your journey begins here... "

												Right title for this game is: ""Making mars work""When I first bought this, it was going to be a mars rover sim. And it did a good job at that.But then the wishing genie met all-around excited engineers, and a paper castle was build.Great thing about this game is it's mods do awesome things to the high level side of the game.If we take on mars, shouldn't this be here... Someone builds it, game get so much better.Example: Disposing of directional energy grid (wtf devs, fysics)  material pipelines, ...Worst thing, commercial engine, we can't fix what breaks*network play will kill you *crashes will happen *performance, this is a fat simulatorHow to fix this game:- Make extending straight forward- Rely on scientist & engineers that play this game to do the high level stuff- Pack these approved Items into the game- Fix your engine, spend your time on fixing "

												so played this game for a few hours, i really enjoyed it at start then getting through the game i started noticing all the bugs, first mst annoying your character falls over everything and 8/10 times i have died from this it is such a bad desig and ruins it so i recommend saving all the time. and do not overwirte or delete saves this will course the game to crash. while changing location on map i struggled to get over 20 fps but at start i was getting easy 60 will setting on high, as i have looked on forums this is a common problem a long with having to play in window mode (alt enter) on start as the game just shows blank screen.  if you do intend buying game which is a good game just needs ALOT of work to fix the bugs i wouldnt advise jumping at all unless need to as i have been slingshot across the map numerous of times. i only recommend this game for the design as it really good idea and really fun. the bugs let the game down so much and as looking at review there are no attempts to fix these so far... so at this time being if the bugs dont get fixed i wouldnt buy this game			"

												First off, yes this game has a few bugs but nothing game breaking, just frustrating at times. If you're looking for a serious astronaut simulator, this is your game. It brings to life the slow tediousness of working in a space suit ridiculously far from home. After completing the main storyline, I am happy with the time I spent and will be playing through the extra scenarios included and hopefully finding some extra content in the workshop.Some tips if you are jumping in:- Save often, particularly if you're about to go through the cargo truck airlock. In one instance I had removed my suit and was suddenly pushed through the ceilinig of the airlock where I suffocated quickly. Just save often.- If the 3D printer you build says it has incorrect/missing parts but you are absolutely sure it has everything; take it apart and rebuild it with the same parts. Also make sure you have 4 resource inputs, the picture in the datapad only shows 2.			"

												It's all good until you get up to the last manned mission at which point you get hit by massive fps drops regardless of your system specs - something I'm sure will get patched sooner than later.The rover missions are fun when you're not driving for 15 minutes from point A to B and the manned missions are tons of fun as well.

								This game... or work... is actually fun! I've downloaded a mod that gave me the opertunity to start at Victoria crater almost with no supplies at all. Only enough to start making the basic 3d printer and resource gatheres. Also got the truck but it is almost useless untill now. It's 1:1 and I've played through the night. It is dawn and my basic base is set up, with a hydrophonics and water station - a toilet. Enough for me to grow the first batch of potatoes in time before my two beef meals ran out.Fun!As my basic base is in place, some of the resources has been depleted where I am. So for the first time I loaded the truck with my drill and lots of powerstations... and moved it couple of 100 meters. My base now need to expand as I need more room for beds and resources.I actualy feel that I have saved that stranded guy :)			"

								I really can't get enough of this game.  Dram and BI are doing an excellent job crushing bugs and getting some amazing open-world feeling with tons of technically corrrect modules and research and exploration options.  I can't wait to plan a mission from Earth to Mars, and then launch from mars to some other destination.  Really amazing graphics and I love the terrain 9x9km blocks taken from HiRISE data.  Despite some crashes initially, it seems to run well enough now, and the homicidal elevator (elevator?!?) in the massive 4 story capsule being the only thing relegating the game to science fiction status.  The flying vehicle and helo need to be mods since there's no way those would ever be on the surface.  Everything else is pretty much science fact = Recommended!			"

								Take On Mars is easily one of my favorite Space Simulation games. The game is still in Early Access which excuses some of the texture or model glitches I've encountered so far but what really breaks immersion for me are the very frequent crashes, though that may just be a problem with my system. If Bohemia properly takes care and developes this game I can see myself investing countless hours into Take On Mars, even more so than I already have.			"

								I Really like the game which on it's own really does not tell all that much. But the way it feels and even more what it can become is just great. But there it is... What it CAN become. Right now for my taste the building part has not been developed enough to be statisfying.What you can build is awesome but then it would be nice if it actually worked well... for example I spend the last four hours mapping out and building a base only too tear it all down again because it snapped wrong in place and it could not be finished since it was not airtight... which when you have your entire HUD filled with ""LEAK"" is something easilly missed.What also is a downsite for me is the fact that i have been killed more often by my building then by mars itself, try to take a step up the ladder and be stuck. use shift to run you suddenly become the flash and slam so hard in the wall your entire suit is torn too pieces. Building items that suddenly decide you are the badguy and shoot towards you like being fired from a catapult are also not that uncommen for me.And yet... I Reccomend this game and this is why:It is a challenge but one in one of the most beautifull and stunning enviroments I have ever seen with this amount of freedom. You can do as you like (within certain boundries) but it remains realistic. It is slow moving but it has a beauty to that as well... and no matter how frustrating it sometimes might be it is one hell of a feeling to be racing a scout buggy across the desserts of mars with your home made base sitting there amongst nothing.... a beautifull and creepy thing to behold and see.If you want a simple survival game you should pass... but for a game that is in my opinion unique and visually stunning however with still a way to go and you are up for a challange.... You will not regret it.			"

								So.. I played this game for about ten hours now... and I would say it has tremendous potential... but that is as far as I will go. Potential. While the robotics programme starts fo kinda slow, the manned programme throws into the deep end and does so in a very immersive way. You are actually afraid of running out of oxygen...Soo.. now for the other side of the medal. Bugs... everywhere... and the occasional probelm with the UI or generally how the  player interacts with the surroundings. Ramps are aparently a massive problem! You can not simply walk up a ramp. You'll get stuck and have to jump (and jumping is dangerous.. more on that later). Once I parked my vehicle on a slope so it was tipped slightly to one side. My character, always facing exactly 90 degrees from the ground would simply not fit through the now slanted (reliative to him) doorframe anymore.Another thing is buttons... you can't reliably press them... and in an enviroment with a LOT of buttons a characters button pressing skills should be considered essential.On the other hand when you are working with equipment that has a touchdisplay, simply stand in front of it and click on the screen... and that is really cool. So... I stopped playing after about 9 hours... because some of the bugs just made it too frustrating... I was trying to get into a vehicle over a ramp... got stuck... tried to jump.. aand I asume i clipped into something, was propelled towards the vehicle and upon the impact tore my suit and died... it had been a while since I last saved.... (no autosaves and no quicksaves make it really hard to keep on top of that).As for the robotics... I built my first rover launched it to a site somewhat close to the edge of the map... It missed its drop zone... by enough to entirely miss the map... and it just kept falling the distance numbers next to the site markes started growing bigger again after a while... and it just kept falling... and since I had spend my last few coins on that rover I was stuck...So in its current state I cannot really recommend the game... but If the devs iron out the most annoying of these bugs and glitches I think it can be a very interesting game. Let's hope for the official release!			"

								This game looks great, then you actually buy it and it is absolute trash. Great ideas that have never been put into action. In scenarios you don't have to eat or drink for some reason, and there is only one manned mission for the campaign. Pros:Looks goodCons:Not many campaign missions for the manned missionsThere is no eating or drinking mechanic: (you can do it, but there is no reason to.)Everything else in the game is trashy except the ideas and the ways building works.

												Right title for this game is: ""Making mars work""When I first bought this, it was going to be a mars rover sim. And it did a good job at that.But then the wishing genie met all-around excited engineers, and a paper castle was build.Great thing about this game is it's mods do awesome things to the high level side of the game.If we take on mars, shouldn't this be here... Someone builds it, game get so much better.Example: Disposing of directional energy grid (wtf devs, fysics)  material pipelines, ...Worst thing, commercial engine, we can't fix what breaks*network play will kill you *crashes will happen *performance, this is a fat simulatorHow to fix this game:- Make extending straight forward- Rely on scientist & engineers that play this game to do the high level stuff- Pack these approved Items into the game- Fix your engine, spend your time on fixing "

												It's all good until you get up to the last manned mission at which point you get hit by massive fps drops regardless of your system specs - something I'm sure will get patched sooner than later.The rover missions are fun when you're not driving for 15 minutes from point A to B and the manned missions are tons of fun as well. If you're a fan of space sims, this is definitely something to pick up.			"

								This game looks great, then you actually buy it and it is absolute trash. Great ideas that have never been put into action. In scenarios you don't have to eat or drink for some reason, and there is only one manned mission for the campaign. Pros:Looks goodCons:Not many campaign missions for the manned missionsThere is no eating or drinking mechanic: (you can do it, but there is no reason to.)Everything else in the game is trashy except the ideas and the ways building works.

Plus when using the 3D printer at least allow you to be able to print the other parts for the Vehicles. Because when you print a vehicle, only the body comes out. Plus u should add something to the printer to make a holder for the spool of tubing, so the spool don't go everywhere when you unraval it.			"

												Take on Mars has evolved massively since I first bought it in 2013. Driving my rover in the Victoria Crater for the first time was jaw-dropping and I still get that same sensation whenever I return to the red planet.The game is a detailed simulation, focusing on the science, technology and management of a Mars space program. It is generally a slow-paced, thoughtful affair. Admittedly, I left the game alone for some time as I didn't want to spoil everything before the full release, so I've only dabbled slightly in the co-op / manned missions, but despite the feature-creep of survival elements, the game's focus still appears to be managing the budget and tech for scientific.Most negative reviews seem focused on bugs and stability, which I've never had much of an issue with (even in Early Access), but Bohemia interactive have a great reputation for supporting and updating their games for a long time, so I have faith that any issues will be solved soon.If you're a space buff and want to try your hand at believable missions at a fictional space agency in the vein of NASA / ESA / ROSCOSMOS / etc., this is exactly the game you've been looking for. However, if you're more interested in an extraterrestrial co-op survival experience, you should probably look elsewhere (Empyrion / Space Engineers are more likely better options).			"

And just think of the mod's that will come with it, And for the people out their getting upset because the game has been on early access for 3 year's, i have not seen a company make a game that could keep me interested if it was done in a year or so, i mean i hardly will touch call of duty, and i loved black ops and Call of duty mw, but they suck and well, Arma 3 was the only shooting game i needed, but 10/10 but if they could fix multiplayer i would like too launch my friend into space >:D			"

								First off, I want to point out that the last line of this review explains how I feel the game should be turning out, in case developers ever read these things.Let me begin by saying what has left me most amazed. The simulation of the equipment is impressive. The way the camera views work is great.Next up, the tech tree is impressive, but the implimentation of time restraints isn't so impressive.Let's get into the bad things now. Time warp..... It's a little animation that has your desk bounce, flash, and heeeeey it's been a day! You don't get this feature if you choose to set up time to follow real life, but with how quickly you can burn through all the missions you'll probably play for a very short time, like I have.Right now, it's not so good. Lack of polish is to be expected from an early access game, but the lack of gameplay is where I get my (lack of) recommendation from.You launch a probe, you mess with it for two minutes, you destroy the probe because now it's useless. I'm certain Expedition One will improve on this. We don't need a game simulating rapid-fire deployment of mars probes and rovers, I believe we need a game where you're actually pioneering Mars habitation.			"

								Take on Mars is a game where you try to be the pioneer of colonize Mars; but first you need to pass trough a Space Program Campaign. If you want to have a lot of fun hours you should buy this game: Campaign, survival, build, online multiplayer and so. I have played 18.4 hours this game the last month and I going to keep playing for a long while.Take on Mars es un increible juego donde el objetivo principal es ser el pionero en colonizar Marte; para esto tendras que iniciar conociendo el planeta con sondas, satelites e incluso podras utilizar el Curiosity !Geniial!: todo esto en Campaña de Programa Espacial o podras probar las diferentes caracteristicas del juego en modo ecenario, al final el juego resulta muy entretenido.Se trata de explorar, construir y sobrevivir, muy recomendado.

								Great game, a little bit tedius but still good fun and relaxing. The tediuness is because is in early access and all the bugs, problems and item are not be fixed or implemented completely yet! But still is a very good game.The Primary Campain (Exploration) is complete but is a bit tedius for some players... Nearly everyone I spoke is waiting for the Manned Campain, and that means living on the Moon, Asteroids, in Orbit and Mars! The Tutorial is just ok, but is not fully clear how to do things, so for some players it may be a steap curve learning,I will raccomend this game for 2 reasons: First the beauty of living in space, orbit or planets, the second is the stunning effect you can see and ability to construct nearly everything you want!I will not raccomend this game for everyone, because it has no real continuous action, unless it is an scripted event. Let me explain in ditails: You can do almost everything, but the are moments where you cannot do nothing until the resources or event finish or trigger, like if you have set up your base and started the resources, sometimes the only thing you can do is do something that you really not need for the next mission or the one you are doing, like looking for more drops, that you cannot use at the end of a scenario to the next (Unless the devs change that in the final release).Still is great to see Bohemia Interactive have great ideas for games and have the guts to takle a game like this brilliantly!

								Short version - Take On Mars is a AAA game being made by an indi publisher. As such it's still in Beta and probably will be for some time - if that's an issue for you, favorite it and be patient. It is however being crafted with more realism and simulation and depth than any other space game you've played since KSP. You're going to kick yourself if you're a fan of real space sim stuff and don't play this game. Longer version - It started focused on sending probes to Mars and the inherent complications and experiences you'd find in that. That's already a very rich, very complex experience and worth the money. There's a tech tree you need to unlock, upgrades, scaling missions and tech and challenges that are a fun game already. Pick a location (created from actual surface scan data from Mars. No ♥♥♥♥, it legit mapped from photos and heightmap data of the surface of Mars) and start figuring out what missions you can do with a single probe. Much like current space exploration you have to gauge the money and tools available to you to maximize your productivity on the surface. You'll find challenges of opportunity that provide additional income and so you need to plan for the unexpected while keeping in a manageable budget and resources. It's challenging in similar ways to Kerbal Space Program only focused on a far more realisitic experience rather than a somewhat fantastical one. The probe missions and content is a fun and challenging game and, again, worth the money. However the devs have recognized the demand for something more personal and have started laying the groundwork for manned missions to Mars. It's still simple and in a development state and has a long way to go. However the devs have shown with the content already created that they're dedicated and focused on making a deep, complex and challenging environment. That's going to take time and as the scope of the game has changed so has the development timeline. If you like what you see so far, pick it up. If you're concerned, then wishlist it and wait. If you're reading this review though then you're probably the sort of person intrigued by a realistic, challenging view of what exploring and even visiting Mars would be like, using actual mapping and images of the Martian surface and science we theoretically have today. If that's the case you're going to want this game sooner rather than later. If that's something you want then why settle for later rather than sooner? Game In Beta Note:Some people are concerned with the development pace of the game. Always a concern with indie titles and it's a legit concern. You don't want a game that's been abandoned. That's not this game though. Devs have been working steadily so far, it's just a lot to make for an indie studio and there's no way you can look at the content that's already in the game and not realize that when it is released it's going to be the best, most realistic sim you could really hope for. It is a sim by the way - simulation is the name of the game. From different weights, uses and limitations to different sorts of suits to limited uses in the tests you can run on your probes to deadly radiation bursts from the Sun that Mars' whisper thin atmosphere and lack of magnetic field don't protect you from. You want a quick and dirty survival shooter they're already out. You want a realistic sim that tracks your oxygen usage based on your physical exertion, you need to have some patience.....and if you want to survive on the Red Planet you're going to need to be patient.

Nothing is too easy and the game forces you to think things thru a bit or you Fail and Die, “Love It”. The land scape is beautiful, And I got to drive on the moon too, the ( Moon Dream ) portion was perfect timing in the beginning as hands on training for Mars, and really helped with story telling. Running around mars taking selfies with my PDA is just a blast that adds more to the game.. “ Look Mom here is my camp “ .Whether you are aware or not you just set the standard for games about landing on mars, which will be an icon game when we do. Thank you very much for making Take On Mars, You guys did a fantastic Job.Ps.. I haven’t even finished the game and ill gladly pay more if you polish the game up for Pc’s with higher end graphics cards Ill gladly purchase the Graphics Pack DLC for $8.99..

												What little of the game I've played, I've enjoyed. I've played a little bit of the unmanned chapter and nearly gotten up to unlocking landers. However, I have not been able to play any further than that because I cannot play the game any more. And not in the ""I hate this game, it's literally unplayable!"" (And you mean metaphorically there, not literallly.) sense, but in the ""game will not run properly or at all"" sense (the proper use of the word 'literal'). Since some time in the fall of last year, whenever I try to boot it up I get some sort of ""illegal read"" error. At the time, this didn't bother me too much. I did contact customer support, who promptly told me to try uninstalling and reinstalling, the thing that I had done at least six times previously of my own accord. Of course, this did not work. Then, the game was in beta so I assumed it was just a beta glitch and would get fixed eventually. After the full release, the game still will not run. That's a pretty serious bug to leave in a full release. I've also read elsewhere about the difficult physics, something I (un)fortunately have no personal experience with but is still significant. As much as I like the concept of the game and want to recommend it, right now I'd have to recommend against it.			"

Early Access Review
								I have read lots of reviews with people wondering why this game is getting a poor review and excusing it by saying that it is an early release...come on ! Yes it WAS an early release back in 2013 and YES myself and many others purchased it with the understanding that it would be a work in progress, but there is a limit to the term ""early access"" I have seen little in the way of progress in YEARS !!! The game is so far from being enjoyable that it leaves me feeling cheated out of $20. This will be my last title from Bohemia Interactive as this is ridiculous...perhaps early access for $5 would be reasonable, but this game isn't worth much more. If you are thinking of purchasing this game....DON'T....at least not until BI shows SOME amount of effort towards fulfilling their obligation to those who graciously supported them in the hopes of seeing the game take proper form.

It has so much potential, but as of right now, they need to focus on development and take it off the market, because its currently unplayable.			"

								I'm not sure if they will be finishing this game; however, from the amount of gameplay available in only the beta mode, it is the best space, mars exploration, free to do what you please RPG in it's own category. There is no game alike that can possibly compete. There was an update a few days ago. There are still very many bugs and things that need to be worked out, such as the basic probes launched in the first chapter, the cameras need to be fixed. The last 3 training mission need voice audio because the subtitle diminish too quickly for anyone to read. It has so much potential and is very advanced for it's state of development. Although, I am concerned for the fact it was released in 2013 and is still in it's beta mode. It has so much potential and needs to be finished, they should dedicate more money and time into completing this product. it would bring them a huge revenue, but also give gamers, and people fascinated with space exploration, an opportunity to enter the field and understand the reality of space and another planet. What adds to the excitement is that NASA will be sending humans to Mars hopefully by 2030. This is an excellent game with so much to do and I stand to support it. Do not judge it too quickly, buy it and play it.			"

								Love the game... Or rather the promise of what the game can be... I bought this game in December 2015 with promises of a 1.0 non-beta version coming out in Feb 2016. Dissapointment after dissapointment has all I have recieved. Constant updates and little as far as information as to what had been worked on is available unless you spend an hour looking through the forums. Forums are great but when you are pushing a new update would it kill to put some info in the news stream? The last headline was from an article that originally led me to the game in the first place and its not much of a help as to the game play. There are tons of ""coming soon"" points in the in game gui that make using vehicles and such a pain in the bottom. PLEASE tell me whats going on and why I paid a big game dev company money for a product they dont seem to care about finishing. I know the team creating the game is working hard but they need to recieve the support they deserve. I'd gladly switch to yes as far as recomending this game if the dev team got some help and were more communicitive in a easily public way.			"

								So after all these years I decided to give this game one last chance and play Manned mission.I was playing RC2 which will be most likely the final version, neverheless no more major bugs will be eradicated by the time this releases.I simply cannot recommend it because of large amount of gamebreaking bugs and performance issues.From my last playthrough:On the moon it is rather easy to trip your buggy. When you do so, there is like 80 percent chance you wil die when trying to exit the buggy, because you fall trhough the moon. When this happened to me after 1 hour of playing and being in 2nd mission, then I painfully realized, there is no checkpoint or autosave function. My last save was from one month ago. OK. I had to restart whole manned  campaign.Then I had to follow transmiters to find second one. It is stated that transmiter is situated south from the base and I should follow that path. Very first transmiter is situated north of base however. I did not realize that and followed direction of the transmitter, going north instead of south. And after like 1 minute of driving I fell off a map... Moon just ended and I fell to the void and kept falling until I loaded saved game.After like 25 deaths I managed to enter 3rd mission. That was where I rage guitted.I had to load 25 units of water to the truck. UI is very clunky so it was a pain really.But I lowered stairs to the truck and planned to grab water packs from crates and bring them to the truck, put them on the foor of the truck and so on.Then I found out you cannot simply climb the stairs by walking. You get stuck.So I started jumping on those stairs... I flopped almost everytime, but I manegd to get there like 12 packs of water. Then I jumped, flopped and bashed my head and cracked helmet, died, and last save is stil on the moon! I forgot to save when starting 3rd mission.When the stairs are not walkable, how do I load or enter the truck while only possible options almost everytime kills you?This game is so broken, that I cannot recommend it to anyone, and I am afraid it is bound to the game engine, since these are the same bugs as were 2 years ago.

								Have you ever wanted to be a truck driver? Or maybe a crane operator? Or a building engineer (janitor)?Then this is the game for you.Rather than strictly a survival game, this is a harsh environment (survival) in which you are the driver and manual labor needed to assemble a Martian base of operations.Many bugs.Holes to be filled. And they have been at this for more than 2 years.Bohemia is doing the work with patches being released fairly regularly. There should be no fear of a game that has been in development for a long time. It is a sign of discipline that they do not rush a buggy POS out the door. More as if they have invited us along for the developmental ride.I look forward to all that I can play with 40 to 400 million miles from home.(Can you imagine how the data/telemetry transmission delays changing span would just drive you nuts? Half the year Houston is 20 minutes away and the rest of the time more than an hour)Worst negative thought I have about the game is the price. I see this as a $20 ticket. The extra $2 seems a dig.

								This is a really good martian rover simulator with a very flexible playstyle. You can drive your rover in 3rd person with the WASD keys, or you can play through a pixelated camera mounted on the rover while issuing move commands through a command-line text interface. It's just like real life martian exploration! (but without the 8 minute lag)BUTHalfway through development the developers decided to add humans and base building to the game. This feature was not promised or hinted at when the game was announced and released. Now they will never fix all the rover bugs because they are too busy creating new human play features that i didn't ask for in my little $20 rover game.This game is only for robotics and space enthusiasts who have interest in real world JPL and NASA space exploration.do not pay more than $15 for this game.

								this game is Great! 8 out 10.WARNING - do not play this game if you like action. There generlly is none unless you make a mistake in which case it can cost you plenty.When you fire up the single player mode you are given the option of robotics or manned campain.the robotics campaign is then further broken down into Quick Time or Real Time opions.for the robitics campain you are tasked with launching probes and exploring Mars. An extensive tech tree alows you to use funds raised by completing objectives to research improved systems and rovers, that allow you to perform more complicated research. Larger missions can raise more cash but it's easy to get into the situatuion where alll your money is riding on one mission, only for a random system failer to cause it to smash into the ground. especially with new tech. Driving around taking photo's and air samples makes up most of the early robotics game play with surface sampling and other tests entering  mid to late campain.Driving a rover is good fun but it is easy to underestimate the weather and/or terrain effects and end up trailing bits all over the place. When bad weather stikes you can hide behind a rock and just hope that the thing survives. Unlike real operatiors you have the option to swich to other probes at any time.The Manned campain is still under construction but is a planed to be a series of liked sinariospro's -  Very pretty even at low settings.  Realistic locations and effects  Punishing single player campaigns (robotic - and maned)con's -  Very SLOW paced.   low gravity enviroments punish rushed actions.  Robotics campain consists of doing the same thing over and over to raise funds.  realistic affects can lead to R.U.D. of your probes and rovers. (Rapid Unplaned Disasembaly).			"

								The idea is a great one but it only lasted in my collection briefly. Why?Main reason was no matter what settings I used it induced horrendous nausea. No idea why as this isn't something I've had an issue with in the past.But on to the game itself. Considering just how long this has been out and the developer behind it, it's a buggy mess. Random teleportation, inability to interact, missions competing without you actually doing them in the tutorial...I'm surprised at how positive the reviews are for this given how many read. Maybe people are more forgiving but I actually want to play my game not feel like I'm just along for the ride.			"

												First of all, I would like to say that this game is fun and had entertained me for hours.  I don't believe that this game was ready for release, however.  There are numerous things that need to be addressed in the current state, especially in multiplayer.  The story mode for manned took no time at all to beat, however, you can choose to stay on Mars and build your base and gather supplies until you wish to leave, but there wasn't a lot of challenge to the manned story.  I would recommend this game if it were still in the early stages of beta, but I don't think that I would be able to recommend the game in it's current state based on what I believe a final product should be.  If you want to fight through some bugs and do some online playing or just do the single player scenarios to occupy your time, I would recommend it.Again, I do enjoy the base building and playing the rover storyline, but I think they tried to rush the final product in the manned story mode and mulitplayer seems to still have a number of bugs that need squashed.  3.5 out of 5			"

								Looks very interesting and probably good played with friends but ultimately is too slow paced and dull.Good:+ Looks great+ Really feel alone in space and mars / moon.+ Will appeal to people who like slow pace simulations like Farming Simulator, Trainz, etc.Not good:- Player character perfectly simulates an 80 year old with Alzheimer's. (walks so slow you forget what you're doing.)- Damn near has a heart attack if jogging more than 50m in the training area- Stops dead still for 2 seconds after each jump, can't hop around on the moon like the Apollo Astronauts.- Vehicles so slow they could be out run by a small child on a tricycle. Would be great fun if the vehicles were faster. Drifting on Mars anyone?- Crafting needs instructions.- Lack of ""enemies"" or NPCs make you feel like ""what do I do now? what's the point?"" after you build your base. "

It is not finish (it might never be), but personally I just can't get enough of traveling with my small robot over endless, red deserts, shooting photos and measuring temperature. It is awesome.

								Again, Bohemia makes a game that is 90% of the way to being fun.  Much like Arma 2, the game is beyond awesome when it works. It has so much to offer, but is plauged by poor QA. For a game that is not released yet, it is on par, but due to my experience with their other titles, most of the bugs and glitches will not be fixed when it releases (prove me wrong please!).Things like no auto saves, coupled with irregular crashes causes some pretty frustrating ""screw it, I just wasted 2 hours of my night, just to have the game crash as I completed building my 3D printer"" moments. I sincerely hope that the bugs and the storyline issues (not having enough guidance on how to complete the objectives that have only one way of being completed) get addressed. Pros:Very detailed space sim with just about anything you can think of having on a mission to Mars.Very fun storyline.Cons:Tons of bugs. Like watching that Mars movie where there are actually millions of bugs that eat peoples' bodies, only they aren't supposed to be there and they aren't living creatues.No auto save! I get how it can add to the challange of some games, but not when there are so many random crashes.GUI performance issues such as screen flickering when there are tips being displayed.Lack of guidance for mission objectives. Example: The instructions to build a 3D printer are a 2D picture of a printer. You have to figure out how it goes together.			"

												I am going to write my first steam review.  If you are into shooters or fast paced games, do not bother with this game.If you love the idea of our civilization going back to space, this will allow you to simulate what is reachable.I know it has it's issues, but it has come a long way from what it was at the beginning.  I find it so good that I am looking into using it as a simulation in my space exploration class.			"

								I know this is ""Early Access"" but I played the Space Program, and just barely figured out how to get together all the things I am supposed to be getting and then the promise, ""coming soon in early 2016"". Well, it is now MID-2016 and there has been nothing further added?I know that some people might want the multiplayer aspect - but I don't, and would like to have a sandbox type play where I can build my own base -- the senarios do not seem to be so set up. I thought that was what this Space Program Manned was supposed to be about... but...Seriously I hope you guys are really working on this 2016 release as this real real really seems to be a game worth playing and at $22 there should be much more than a teaser at this point since you said it was coming...Right now, I would NOT recommend this game even though I marked yes -- that is because it is unfinished and other reviews suggest that there is no movement on this... I took a chance and hope that it will be rewarded with some kind of real update soon.			"

								I'm not sure why this game has mixed reviews.  It's still in beta, people.  Does it crash?  Yes, but you can STILL progress and have a meaningful experience if you're patient and save often.  I can't speak for multiplayer at this point, but in the last week I've built a fully functional base by myself (I'm a fan of the manned missions) and was into full-fledged methane production (a very time-consuming compound to make in the game).It's worth your time if you're a space/science buff and are looking for an immersive space exploration experience.  With the way that development is going now, it seems like when the kinks are worked out of this game it could be a real-life simulation of survival on the red planet...if NASA ever develops space suits that can be put on/removed by one person. That's how immersive it is.  It doesn't just stop at Mars, either.  You can send rovers or conduct manned missions to asteroids, the moon of earth and the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos).  The devs have thought of everything and the attention to detail is fantastic.  I'm eager to see what will come in future updates and the anticipated v. 1.0 release. I highly recommend this game as long as the devs keep up the good work.			"

								This game has some promise, but right now it is just very shallow. There is not much here and it doesn't fell like more is on the way. This is how kerbal space program could have gone horribly wrong. There is a lot of unimportant stuff here that could be expanded upon, but not a lot of expanding upon the good ideas. The last update was in 2015, 2015! That is completely unnacceptable. Especially since there are multiplle different places in-game which say ""New features in early 2016!"" Well, it's june. We are half wat through 2016 and the devs didn't even bother to remove or update those messages. My last complaint is a technical one. I was using a radio thermal electric generator. It reduced to 3/4 it's original output after a very short period of time. Are you INSANE!? It even says plutonium-238 in-game an element with a half life of 88 years, not less than a day. My camera also seemed to break for no reason? Granted these may be in-game features due to weather conditions. But if they are it merely highlights another flaw in the game. It explains almost nothing to you. The only tutorial is for manned missions, which currently make up almost none of the game. This left me stranded trying to figure out how to ploay this game from the second I hit the launch button. The construction system is a well implemented idea, but again! There are almost no missions or playable parts of the game which utilize this feature. PLEASE! Devs, get it together and flesh out this game. Take a hint from KSP and improve your updates. If you are thinking of buying this game, don't, I can barely refer to this as a game. Wait until the features have been fleshed out and the game is a game. The developers should be ashamed for charging anyone to ""play"" this husk. I don't know if they will finish the game, but there is potential. This demo has all of the requirements to make an amazing game, they just need to try. Yes, this is really more of a demo. A paid demo promising updates, no doubt riding on the back of ksp's success. Steer clear until this demo becomes a game, if ever.			"

								Early Access Review (first impressions)Okay played very little the game is a kinda timeline experience of what it takes to get from launching early technology style probes that have little more than a camera attached to them, right the way across to sending man to mars.This review is based on very little experience but so far its inrtriguing rather than compelling, i have opted to use real time gameplay and my first batch of research takes between 2-10hrs meaning for the next two hours i have nothing to do beyond looking at the screen. literally !!the other time options allow you to fast forward the game, and...you can skip this stage and jump right into the manned missions, or play some preset kind of campaigns if you so wish, then come back to the campaign, you can also log of the game for the whole 10hrs (depending on time mode selected) and research will continue without your presence.so in the first few hours im bored, but interested to see whats in store !!i also ran through the training campaigns, and so i have witnessed a little of the crafting style aspects of the game which dont exactly win awards, its most certainly about the mars experience, than being a game of survival in my view at this point. for example most things can be made on a printer without the need of resources, which is just dull to be honest. im going to recommend at this stage because honeslty whilst not jumping around with excitment just yet, im really interested where this will head as development goes on and so forth. If your a complete space nutjob, im convinced you will love this like a nerd likes highgrades, adrenaline junkies not so much			"

								Before I purchased this game (before it became early access) there had been talk of VR support (Oculus).  Now we're at the end of the 2nd Oculus dev kit and consumer Oculus is only a few months away. The Take on mars developer has no interest in supporting VR and one of the devs has blamed Oculusvr for this: ""Originally posted by Dram:Hey guys, I am unsure at this point about Vive, but the Oculus will certainly not be supported. Since the newest 0.6 drivers they removed DirectX 9 support. TKOM runs on DX9, which means we're out of luck.Just to clarify, they needed to make the move to better support direct to Rift mode, so I perfectly understand their move as being unavoidable. Pity though :)""  << The question is why a game still in development is using the outdated DX9 engine? DX11 has been around for a long time and we now have DX12.  I would say the problem isn't that oculus implemented direct-mode only but that Bohemia are developing their games on the outdated DX9 API.VR aside... the game as it stands is pretty dull.			"

New features, bug fixes, support, etc...  things like that would help us gain a better appreciation for a sim we already know and enjoy.  Personally, I would like to know when the radiation is being addressed.  Will there be additional shielding we can construct to protect from radiation?  Will there be radiation sickness pills we can find or manufacture?  I'm sure there are many questions that fans of this sim have and are anxiously awaiting feedback from the devs.  I think the Devs are doing a great job, but a little blurb now and then to the community would be nice.

								The game status does not justified the price. Partial failures in game play disappointing the game feeling. (My opinion, while BETA Status of game) In my opinion some of the updates had presented a negative effect on game play instead of a announced fixing.However it presents a nice and accurate designed Mars surface. The Designer are planing a lot of possibilities to interact with Mars and as well with other celestic bodies, but it appears not consequently enough to fulfill all the planed features. The performance is sometimes smooth on older computer systems and then worser. My be it depends on my computer.It like be recommended after a final release.			"

								The developers say this will be released in February, and I have no idea how they think that will be possible. The unmanned portion seems mostly complete, but the manned portion needs at least another year. It's full of bugs and glitches, there is absolutely no tutorial, explanation, or guide anywhere, and it's lacking a lot of immersion. The bugs range from being unable to attach a power cable properly to being flung across the Martian desert because you stood on said cable the wrong way. With no explanation in-game, on the walkthroughs through Steam, or on any forum for the game, every feature is hidden until you stumble across it and major components of the game are difficult to work out. It took me three hours to figure out how to assemble a structure, and I still have no clue what any of the various utilities do. The immersion problem is one they definitely won't fix, though, because they seem pretty happy with what they have: you can hear your astronaut's breath and heartbeat. All the time. Very loudly. Right in your ear. He also can't move any faster than a slow stroll, even on Earth, and can only run ten or twenty meters before getting winded. On the Moon, you would expect to do some cool Moon-style walking like in the NASA videos, but he just casually strolls from one place to another. I got to night-time on Mars (difficult because it's 1:1 timescale and there's no way to advance time, like sleeping or waiting) and expected some sort of awe inspiring view, but it was totally unimpressive. I was more impressed the first time I got a craft into orbit in Kerbal Space Program. I have the graphics all maxed out on a mobile GPU and I get 60 FPS - that means you're not trying hard enough.From my previous experiences with this developer, I know what to expect: a game with countless flaws that showed promise and is occasionally, for very short periods, brilliant. Arma was like that, Take On Helicopters was like that, and DayZ is like that. They're very ambitious, and that's admirable, but they have no tenacity, patience, or follow-through.If you get it on sale, like I did, you'll have a fun ten hours or so before deciding to just wait for the full release. But seeing as how they say that'll be in February, I'd say you should wait until the patch/update schedule has slowed a bit, because there should be a lot of them.			"

								So, I got this game from the Steam Summer Sale, despite the mixed reviews.  I LOVED the concept, and hey, if it takes a little while to finish, that's fine.  I mean, I bought Kerbal Space Program back in it's beta when it had PLENTY of room to improve.  It turned out to be an amazing investment, and I'm counting on this one being the same as well.  NOW, my problem is that I cannot start the game.  It crashes every time, and I have tried reinstalling it.  I have a fairly modern computer, so it isn't an issue of graphics or anything.  At this moment therefore, I cannot recommend it.  If the devs update the game and it works, I look forward to changing my review!			"

								Lots of potential but I can't recommend it yet. I know its early access, but I'll change this review as soon as it advances enough for me to recommend it.It's clunky, and its boring. I love realistic space games (KSP, Orbiter) and I understand slow-paced methodical gameplay, but this is different - its boredom without any real satisfaction or feeling of reward. The system for managing resources is INCREDIBLY tedious, and topped off with controls that can best be described as ""butterfingers"". Also the design for the lander and some of the vehicles are very unergonomic and kill the 'realistic mars mission' vibe for me. However, the design of the 'truck' rover and the scout rover are excellent. The 'campaign' if you will is more polished, but the waypoint system is very confusing and it is still for the most part unrewarding and just not fun. The game is very atmoshperic though - especially the dust storms. The camera effects are a nice touch, it feels very real and is remarkably well done.So overall, a lot of potential, but don't buy it yet. Its too clunky and boring, but hopefully that will change before its final release.			"

								I really wanted to like this game, but found the game was lacking, even for early access. The career mode has lots of missions, but so many of them are recycled. I would recommend the game if there would actually be a point in building. PROS: - Good potential - Physics worked much better than expected - It is fun, for a limited time.CONS: - Structure building is a pain. Even after getting used to the awkward rotation, constantly running back and forth from the ""3D Printer"" to the place where the part had to be was annoying. The parts are also very VERY specific in how they have to be placed together.  - Carrer mode is a horrible grind, so many of the missions are recyled, and many of them simply involve watching a static drone. And by that, I mean literally watching the drone's camera feed as it crashes to Mars. Mission complete. Now do that 15 times. - Many of the Scenarios are fun, and have interesting objectives. The issue is that there is no reward of any kind for completion, nothing at all. It just feels pointless.- For trying to be serious about Mars exploration, some of the features are ridiculous (weird vehicles). The game goes from trying to be really serious about realism, to being more fantasy.- There's just no point yet. I understand that it's early access, but there is no goal of the game.			"

								It really pains me to write a negative review of this game. The visuals are stunning, and it has the potiential to be a great game. Unfortunately, at this point in time, its not. Its full of annoying bugs.I've just spent the last hour playing the single player story line, started researching more advanced probes....then the game crashes, and its corrupted the entire save...gone. Won't be starting it again.The ""base building"" is so difficult to control in the scenario mode that I gave up and didn't bother any further. Its such a convoluted control system, and the parts are very hard to get aligned at just the right angle for them to snap together. This issue pretty much extends to the entirely of the control interaction within the game.In the early access version, over 75% of the tutorial videos are not accessable. This leaves the player to flounder around,and try to figure out what to do, and how. Surely, this is a rooky error?? Tutorial videos are there for a reason, so not having them is very counter productive.If all the issues were sorted out, it would be a very good game, but at this point, I think its £15 I would have rather spent on something else.

I had a bit of fun, when creating my own server with friends?? nope, crashes, bugs etc..   A real shame since this game can be a lot of fun I reckon.Multiplayer:Crammed with bugs that makes this game unplayable for me.-multiple errors on joining games, loading and saving games. (happens everytime, not just once in a while.-multiple crashes that seem to be directed to the games texture files, fix?  'play the game on low textures' effectively making this game look worse than KSP.-movement bugs, in confined spaces you sometimes 'bump' into 'stuff' immediately killing or cripling you.-jump bug, you can get stuck in a the jump animation, making you get stuck in the air, not movable for about 10 seconds. this happens quite frequently.

								Early Access Review.I've currently got 24hrs+ on record of having played this. I haven't touched multiplayer and I probably won't either. The trailer looks really cool and it was that, that drew me to the game. Unfortunately after 24 hours of play I have yet to walk on mars. I am sat behind a desk sending probes, landers and rovers on missions. I'm going to be honest it's becoming dull. I thought the rover would add a little something extra, it does boredom. It moves so slow and you tend to have to travel hundreds of meters to your first point. Why? I don't know. the landing process is fairly surgical, so if it knows where I need to be stop putting the cross hundreds of meters away or put the missions on the landing map so I can choose where to land. i'm presuming more is yet to come but I repeat I have been playing this game for 24 hours. Please don't get me wrong. This game/simulator is very detailed and I appreciate the content. Unfortunately it's also becoming really boring. The best way I can sum up my thoughts on ""Take on Mars"" is... there's a note to say saved games may not be compatible with future updates. If I started it up and my saved game was incompatible. I would delete it and never play it again. I'm currently persevering through to hopefully get to the parts of the trailer that looked fun. If I had to play through 24 hours of mind numbing trundling across Mars. I would have to delete it.			"

								Mars. A barren Planet with red sand and rocks. Sounds boring. But this fellow manages to get us wondering about life there and we want to know more about it's past and if intelligent life might have existed or even still exists on Mars. This game feeds your curiosity and let's you explore well known places of the planet like Victoria or Kaiser Crater. The simulation is of course not 100% realistic - otherwise you would need to wait 20 minutes after each command. But the graphics are awesome and you face the dangers and beauty of Mars. And it has mods. If you like KSP, you might like this one too. The developers are very dedicated and the game gets updates very often. Oh and it has a real time mode. With correct conversion of Earth to Mars time.			"

								Its a good game, it has a good future ahead, but :- It tanks your FPS, you basically need a high-tech PC- The physics are similair to farmin simulator 2013...- It's glitchy as hell,if i had a penny for every time i got killed from building, i'd be rich asf- The online community is one of the worst, in every single game i joined, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would attack me with a drill or run me over...if you're planning on getting this game, wait for a few updates. Let the devs optimise it a bit more, fix a few bugs, and you'll be golden			"

Very rewarding feeling if you really like science and exploration. This has so much to it already and i haven't  even built a large rover yet ( In the robotics chapter  still) . Amazing game!			"

The manned program is fun, and tutorials are coming soon. It should be easy to get into the game with the upcoming tutorials. See you on mars!			"

								NOTE: This review does not apply to the multiplayer aspect of the game.This game sounds very attractive on paper, Sadly right now it's little more than a thematic tech demo. From a technical standpoint it's a great piece of software, but it's simply not engaging.Usually games, even though they might be hardcore (Orbiter, Dwarf Fortress, even KSP) make you feel rewarded when you achieve your goals. Even when those goals are self-imposed, you have a sense of achievement.Imagine setting out to land on Eve and take off in KSP, or gather enough diamonds in Minecraft to make yourself a full set of armor. The game knows nothing about your objectives, but it has built-in impedements that make you feel you are working for something, and the game is balanced in such a way that, the more crazy your objective, the more difficulties you will encounter. And besides that, you have different tools at your disposal, in a way that you feel you have the freedom to attack the problem from different angles.Take on Mars feels like you are just following a fixed list of steps (missions are exactly that actually) in order to put a checkbox in your to-do list and move to the next item. You have very little room to improvise or be clever about how you approach the missions, and the hardships you encounter are just not interesting nor really challenging.As someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing the hardcore space flight sim Orbiter I would never have imagined a game like this would bore me. But sadly it does.The research tree is very rich, and the mechanics of building and deploying vehicles are rock solid. Perhaps the problem is the game is too linear for a sandbox.I'd wait until the developers fulfilled their vision for the game completely before buying it. Wait and see mode.			"

								I wanted to like this game so much.  But I am already fed up with it after about an hour of just doing the training tutorials.I can't get past the basic game movement controls, inventory, etc.  Walking is hideously slow, sprinting makes you exhausted, and you get caught on items/objects/people/etc.  In your inventory, you have to ""examine"" items to see details about them.  (For example, I can quickly double-click to add water packs to my inventory, but to see whether they are full or empty? Right click on the individual ones, click ""examine,"" and THEN it tells you if it's full.  Uh... no.)  I had to do the first part of the tutorial 3 times because it had so many bugs.  The first time, I interacted with a tutorial ""quest marker"" before I had actually put a tool in my inventory.  The only way to exit that section of the tutorial was to put the tool in my hand... but I had no tool yet... so there was no way to exit the screen.  Had to restart.  Then, the next time, I was putting water packs in my inventory.  I accidentally dumped one water pack on the ground.  But, again, in order to exit that specific part of the tutorial, I had to put THAT water pack from THAT slot in my inventory into a water machine.  Couldn't exit my inventory to pick up the water pack.  Had to restart again.Then, it took me 5 full minutes to get into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ helicopter.  The tutorial said to use spacebar to jump in at a specific point (highlighted by a tutorial ""quest marker"").  Well, no manner of jumping, running and jumping, jumping while close, jumping while far away, etc. would get me in the damn helicopter.  The only way I could get in was to go around to the other side and enter in a different entrance, and even then I think it was a miracle, since I hovered in the air unexplicably for several seconds while trying to get in that doorway.  Then, in the next part of the tutorial, half of my time was spent trying to make sure my cursor was within the 5 pixels necessary to open the airlock button on multiple sets of doors (but not the ""cycle airlock"" button, which was right next to it).  Then, I was supposed to switch out fuel cells in a buggy, but taking them out and putting the new ones in apparently requires some kind of god-like precision using the rotate button... or something....Not to mention that, when you move your mouse to look around, your view moves hella-fast, but when you move your mouse in an inventory screen, the cursor lags slowly behind your movements.  There were no settings to change your mouse sensitivity, so you're stuck with it.Honestly, maybe this game is awesome.  But I have played a lot of 1st person games, and the mechanics of this one are so ponderous that it isn't even worth it to me to learn more and keep trying.  Maybe if I could get through the creeping walk, getting stuck on corners/container lids/etc., having to spend forever centering your cursor on little buttons, or spending minutes rotating fuel cells so that I can get them at the right angle to switch them out (so that I have enough fuel to take another 90 second jaunt in a buggy), I could get to the good stuff.  But it's too maddening, so I'm gonna go play something else.			"

But then comes a looooooong booooring phase where you drive miles and miles with your veeeeery slow rovers on the surface of the mars, doing all the same tasks over and over again: Drive to point a, extend roboarm, scan, retract arm. Drive again. If you don't mind spending 3-4 hours watching a rover drive in slowmotion over a waste planet because you are a sim-fan, than this is for you. After that, it becomes interesting again when you finished the robo-phase of the game.			"

								I would not recommend this game yet, it has a long way to go. I am a big fan of open world creative games and this looked amazing but after playing it, it really gets frustrating. The big thing that takes away the fun is the building, I mean thats sort of a big part of open world creative games right? Building in this game is slow and I dont mean minivan slow we are talking rascle scooter up hill with a 500 pound person slow. you want to build a base, cool, go ahead, but it will take you years, you build it 1 block at a time and you can create 1 block at a time on your 3D printer, yes you can make several 3D printers to speed things up, but each makes 1 block at a time and it takes from 30 seconds to 5 minutes each create the blocks. Now lets say the base you want to make has a simple 1000 blocks, after some math you will realize you are better off building your own mars mission in your back yard with sticks. Once you have the block you want then the ""fun"" part of trying to get it to line up where you want it. People that say its not that bad, true there are worse games, but if you think its not that bad, walk across the room in thbe starter mission without sufficating, go ahead, I'll wait. THats a bug thats still there how long after early access relese?			"

								I can't get any mode of this product to run (even the tutorial)... bugs everywhere... totally dissapointed... you can see where this would be a great game, but it's incredibly frustrating interface followed by bugs makes it 100% unplayable. It's a lot like a lego game where you build your stuff in first person, except 99% of the time, the building blocks don't recognize what you're doing... this leads to a 10 minute exercise in moving a single building block around... you need to build a ton of stuff... pieces should lock together easier. I could go on and on... heck... my avatar couldn't even make it up stairs... not just in one scenario or two... any time I ran into stairs, I ran into trouble. Anyway... if you like aspirin, go for it... otherwise, I can't say that this sci-fi loving, ""The Martian"" reading/watching, worked with NASA in the military, guy can hang with this.

Primary device, btw., is the joystick, not the pedals.Of cause, this cannot be deactivated!No mouse cursor visible, except I press one pedal fully and keep it.Such a gamepad deactivation routine within options is work of less than two days, so why don't add this?I guess, their target are game consoles, and PC is not their intended primary plattform and they don't want to invest even this two days. Either this, or they don't know what they are doing. They are neither checking the controller type, nor they take the primary controller, so incompetence is not out of scope!If you like flight simulations, play on PC and have the appropriate equipment: Hands off, this game would just make problems.If someone of that company reads this review: You had over a year and did not fix it. If you need details, contact me.Except from this: You don't have to support anything except mouse and keyboard for PC, but make the rest deactivatable at least!			"

								probably the most broken game I have ever played (if you can call it playing). I understand it is early access (multiplayer) but the state it is in it should not be released at all. The campaign works fine, however God help you if try to play multiplayer because it will crash because ""out of memory"" when I have allocated 2gb of ram to take on mars alone, and have 20gb in all. If that doesnt happen then it will crash for some other reason. If you are lucky enough that it doesnt crash then you will end up getting killed doing anything from getting out of the seat in the capsule, getting out of vehicles, using the elevator in the capsule, or from using the beds (which ironically is how you heal your character). It seems they are more concerned with putting  content in the game than fixing old problems. Honostly I want it to be a good game but it doesnt work. The campaign works but it isnt finished. The analysis always says the same thing and the objective is always either: search the area for something scientifically interesting, take sample, or take a picture. Fantastic concept for a game and I love the realistic behavior. I just hope opon release it will be worth my money.			"

								I would have waited until I could get it working, but I emailed them three months ago and nothing has been done to fix it. None of the keybindings work, controller or no. I've tried every setting, spent an hour trying to just get out of the freaking chair in the opening scene. ""Press 'E' to get up"" -- nope. That is clearly not true, even if you reset keybindings. The game flat-out doesn't work and was a complete waste of money. It was my most anticipated Christmas present and most regretted. Brand-new custom built PC, plays Fallout 4 on highest settings, so that is not the problem. I hope this game works someday.			"

								Nice concept. however here is a list of problems the game has that I would like seen fixed.-THE GAME CRASHES A LOT. About every 10 minutes. fix this please.-Add a auto-save feature. Right now you need to save manualy and with the constant crashing problem this is an issue.-Make it easier to manage objects you are holding. Right now it's very tedious and slow.-Sometimes I can jump through cellings.Right now I can't give this game a positive review but if you fix these problems then will change it.			"

Its easy to ♥♥♥♥ up by running out of funds, if you run out of funds then thats it, you got to restart your game.And the main menu makes me dizzy and motion sick :(Pro: The devs recently added the manned missions.

								I am a big space nerd, particularly love Kerbal, and just couldnt get into this game.Being a person on Mars seems like it is end game.I played up the the point where you have to drive unmanned rovers around on the surface and I just couldnt take it - they are SO SLOW, and if you miss a point you were supposed to sample or photograph having to drive back pretty much doubles the torture.To be clear, the game looks great, acts great and would be great for a more patient person.If this changes with an update, someone please let me know!

								This is a game that's in desperate need of some kind of tutorial. You start the game and you're plunged straight in at the deep end with no clue about what does what, or what you're meant to do?? I bought this game in the early access stage and i've given up and come back to it several times, hoping for an update that might give me some clue how to play it, but i'm still none the wiser. It would also be much easier if there was gamepad support, sure it's in the options menu, and I selected it and xbox controller prompts appeared on the screen, but then you start playing the game and the controller does nothing!

								When I first bought this game a long time ago, everything seemed to work fine. All the maps work both Mulitplayer and Single Player. I never had any bugs or trouble with the game on my part then. But within the past year after all these updates both major and minor, little to nothing works anymore. I cannot play any of the scenarios. Even career mode no longer works for me. The maps will not load other than the ground templates. Any and all objects that are supposed to be on the maps WILL NOT spawn. I have tried everything from starting new saves, to removing workshop addons. I've even uninstalled the whole game and reinstalled it a few times now. Nothing has fixed the issues I'm having. Not sure if it was an update or something in my PC, but I cannot recommend this game when it doesn't even work anymore.			"

								While the basic idea of this game is terrific, the execution is lacking in major ways. I really hope the developers continue to shape the main aspects of this game, as the concept does have a lot of potential.The big issue in my point of view, and why I'd not recommend it at this time:Very linear gameplay, for an exploration game it lacks the ""open world"" feeling. This is immediately evident when you execute your first mission, you can see a rectangular plane of mars, your mission area, floating in the void of space, in the early descent phase.The career part is mission based, so instead of conducting free-form exploration, the player launches a vehicle to perform a very specific set of tasks.The first ten missions you will launch for example consist of nothing more than selecting a point on the map, launch the vehicle, look at the descent phase, wait for the ""exploration accomplished"" info to pop up, and immediately disconnect from the vehicle as the mission is done even before you touch down.The next couple of missions involve you actually waiting until touchdown, activate one instrument, and disconnect.The vehicle design suffers from similar issues, it is just way too linear. You basically select a chassis, stick some instruments in predefined slots, without any real freedom in design.I really want to like this game, and in fact I do not regret investing the 15 bucks as it might get somewhere someday, but at this time there simply does not come up any real fun playing this.

								Just another of Bohemia's playground with 3rd-party engine, paid from customer's pockets. Development activity looks mostly like defibrillator's discharges on dead body. If you want to know how active development looks like - look at Space Engineers, or Kerbal Space Program. This will be abandoned half-way without declared dead, as they did with Take on Helicopters, Carrier Command and Arma Tactics. And when Arma 4 is out, they charge you for space combat DLC or something.			"

Would you like something like space engineers or kerbal without the.. well you know ability to build things, do things you want that arent prescribed.. or you know.. do anything but click on point a youre supposed to click on then b then c? This is the game for you. I'm disappointed in myself for falling for hype. I thought at LEAST you would be able to really explore our solar system based on actual data or at least the creators take on those place. Nope. Well you can land probes at predestined spot and see pictures of red sand or  whatever. yay. DO not buy this game . Dont feed ripoff artists.			"

Got back to the objective, then the scripts failed and reset my progress even though I was at around the 10th checkpoint. Now uninstalling, thanks for waisting 30 minutes of my life trying to get back into this game.No new content has been added since the electricity update - that was more than a year ago - I want to know what they've been doing for the past year and a half...probably jerkin da gerkin :/4/10.Nice idea, one of the first space / manned exploration games with survival.Buggy mess, overpriced, learning curve.

								OK This is a cool game and has potential but has bugs which for the most part makes it unplayable.The biggestes problem with this game is saved game data. The game becomes corrupted shortly after saving and and you get a message stating saved data may not work, upon trying to load a saved game to continue game play is either won't load and you get an error message or It loads but when you enter the control room none of the features and interface is gone and you can't continue, you to have to start a new game and lose all your progress just to save and again and not have it load again. So the save game and load doesn't work and there is no sense in buying the game if you can't load asaved game.So I would highy suggest not purchasing this game. I had high hopes for this game.			"

								Ill be honest. This game has some serious potential, good developers, good concept, BUT, it is nearly impossible to get into. Sure, if you spent all day and looked at dozens of guides and tutorials, practiced, and dedicated your entire day to learning it, maybe it would make more sense. But for a dumby like me who just wants to chill and play a game in my spare time, its difficult to really play this game for more than 10 minutes without getting a headache. It might be a good game, but reviews are about whether or not I would reccomend it, and I would not. If you want a mars game similar to this, I would reccomend Sol 0.

								This game has been in the development stage for years now. Much content is still incomplete. Game crashes often once you get to the point where the game becomes interesting. Then you can't load save games either. Developers must be working on this part time. Has great potential but fails miserably. I won't buy another of their games. Great graphics though. So sad!			"

								Now of course, this game is in early access, Which, I do understand. Things will be a bit buggy, but this game was full of bugs I encountered, as well as actually getting the hang of the game, which I still didn't after 2 hours. Sure, I played with some people but when I played with them, I felt absolutely useless because it was impossible to understand how to actually play, Now for the bugs. OK so, this game was a waste of money, in my opinion. For bugs: When I was joining a server, I clipped out of the lobby thing somehow(WTF?) and then when I actually got to the map, I was trying to help, and the game got so laggy. And then, while I was printing something I got stuck so that I couldn't move. After wasting 30 minutes, I just decided to leave. Of course, in some peoples eyes, this game will be fun, but not in my eyes. I will gladly change my review later on if the game gets better. But yes, I understand that this is in early access, but early access will not change my point of view on the game. They decided early access, I decided thumbs down. Thank you, have a nice day devs.			"

								This game is GOOD! So far all I have done is played the begining of the campain and do a few rounds of multiplayer. The game has good mechanics such as (COOL) airlocks, setting up a base, the construction in general is very cool (using a 3D Printer to make a larger 3D printer to get larger suits, supplies, ect.), and the interactive side of the game is to intercative. (I dont think thats bad XD) Take on Mars is an amazing game and its worth 22$. 11/10 would let proper australian mate die again.			"

Um.... ♥♥♥♥ you? Way to tell half the gaming demographic they're a low priority. Heck, I'd volunteer to do the voice acting if that would help, but then they'd lose an excuse.

								Do not buy. Plays like a $5 pre-alpha to advert a kickstarter, nowhere close to a $22 ""release candidate.""These remarks apply to ""Robotics"" career.I bought this yesterday and binge played it for over 12 hours. I started with a Robotics career, I haven't touched the manned career that Manley showcased in his video that inspired me to purchase Take On Mars. - It's very easy to go down a path that leaves you with no more viable missions, and not enough money to progress down the tech tree to a point where the game spawns more missions.- the surface is littered with side missions, but you cannot just send a vehicle down to do them. You have to be seeing a big main mission to launch a vehicle at. - If you want a scarred forehead from slamming it into the keyboard, this is definitely the game for you.- I build my first rover after the third restart of a career (tech tree, and mentioned mission issue). Upon launch, the vehicle flipped radically and parts broke off as the chute deployed. (the player does not control maneuvering, it is scripted at this point). The rover free falls to the surface, crashing. This repeated six times with various builds to see if it was my fault. - Expect to spend six hours of play in your first career figuring out what not to do.- Expect to spend twelve hours of play in your second career, getting a little bit further, but hitting a similar block further on.- Expect to spend... no forget it. In summary, this game does not play like a ""release candidate."" I get the sense that Take On Mars is a money farming mission for the developer company to generate a new engine for their Armed Assault line, which desperately needs multi-core CPU and GPU support. Take On Mars could have been a fun title, but it's not a $22 experience. It is a frustrating series of dead ends, messed up careers, and buggy robot deployments. Avoid this title until is matures (it hasn't done so in three years). This title suffers from an obvious lack of QA work in terms of bug stomping and play ""fun factor,"" something this company is notorious for. Even with their policy of de-centralizing testing, in other words, letting the community test it, this title has essentially been in community testing for over two years, and this resultant game is COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY.

								Would not suggest until improved.The Game jumps you into a scenario with no guidence or tutorial, you only control the motion-sickness-inducing camera and a rover you have no knowledge of and have no feedback of its existance unless you manage to get lucky and guess the key for an external view. After that it contiunes assuming you know the entire game inside out and lets you try to figure out the cryptic controls and buttons, having to wait though really long cutscenes with GPU-Melting graphics while the camera does its best to convey the feeling of being in a small dingy during a typhoon.Even on minimal settings you'll get less than 30fps unless you have a pair of Titans, the menus are terrible and extremely hard to navigate due to combined mouse-lag and mouse accelation.At the end of the day; wouldn't buy yet. Could be great with some proper menus though.			"

Spend your money on hooker's and drugs, like the rest of us. Oh I'm sorry, I'm reviewing a game, not writing a column for Hustler.  Well, where to begin- I certainly know where to end, unlike the development of this game. A long time ago in a galaxy not really that far away, there was a team of people tasked with making a Mars survival game. They had ambition, they had passion, and they had Mtn. Dew. Somewhere down the bumpy as ♥♥♥♥ road they got so lost they couldn't find thier own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  If I had a dime for each time they missed a deadline (oh ♥♥♥♥ that rhymes) I'd have a lot of ♥♥♥♥ING DIMES! Almost enough to develop and finish this game myself.  I've said it before in the forums and I'll say it again. They will probably never finish this game. If they do, it will probably never be optimized, fixed, and polished. I was looking forward to this game for ages. I played it just enough to get a good feel for everything, and I have to say, it was really good. However, the constant failures cast a large impending shadow of doubt that this title was brushed under the rug like The Stomping Ground. Drippy ♥♥♥♥, soggy ♥♥♥♥, arid ♥♥♥♥, and biblical ♥♥♥♥.

Early Access Review
								Hello Gentlemen, Just got Take On Mars by Bohemia Interactive, the early access is available for download on steam. Downloaded it, installed it and double clicked on play. Straight to the options menu and run in windowed mode and then changed my mind and put it back to full screen mode. The first screen that greets you is the Take On Mars menu with the usual game options and a spinning depiction of planet Mars. You can hold down the LMB and spin the planet around and see cool sounding names like - Syrtis Major and Elysium Planitia. A few clicks and the initial tutorial loads up.  Clicked on Real World Time and eventually I make my way to the Lab and Construction Building. Found myself pressing the 'Test Vehicle' panel & see the lander. I see different views and instruments, You see (not manipulate) the outside world. My first test ship wobbled like crazy and the wide angle and telephoto view quality, looked like they had purchased the same cameras used in the Blair Witch project. Maybe it's an early alpha thing? I think Bohemia are simulating the quality of video/pictures sent from Mars back to Earth -- lossy and crap. Like any man on the planet who has never read an instruction manual since making 1/32 Airfix models, I end up pressing every single key to see what screens pop up. Oooh... aaarghhh... what does that do... oohhh.... Esc key goes to Main Menu.  Yawn and fast forwarded to the Launch vehicle 13mins 39secs. Look around the crater for about six or seven minutes and then stumble on the list of tasks required to be completed in this particular mission.After pressing every key again, q,w,e,r,t,y,,,,,. I find myself at the Capture Gas stage. oooh... aarghhhh.... Click on Capture Gas. Yay! DO NOT MOVE INSTRUMENT in flashing red text. First you capture the gas, then you analyse gas. (Insert Fart Joke) This is one of the Major Tasks completed at the initial first assignment Victoria Crater. Your initial foray in the Victoria Crater teaches you Mars atmospheric pressure differences compared to Earth and also the composition percentages of CO2, N & Ar (I knew learning the first twenty elements of the periodic table would be useful in my lifetime.. thanks to my grade 10 science teacher Mr Clewett). Once you complete a mission, you also get access to New Tech Levels and various vehicle and instruments at tech level 2 become available.  And I got a steam achievement unlocked ""It's All About the Science"" I then read the rest of the Mission task and see there is another minor task, a photo opportunity requirement.The light bulb dims and I figure out that mission tasks are comprised of Major task and Minor tasks. Each successful completion of Major & Minor tasks during a mission will allow you access to higher level tech and more cash to spend on stuff. In the Early Access version, I can see some instruments have power levels and charge / drain rates and I guess that there would be that certain tasks that require balancing energy usage from your chemical batteries before they are depleted in the later missions. Don't know yet if there are ways to recharge. It's interesting but not for everyone. Interesting enough I had the game freeze on me twice and waited and waited and waited.... before the three finger salute Ctrl+Alt+Del restarted the game.My initial thoughts coming from a Flight Sim enthusiast...... Well just like there are people that are vegetarians and there are people who like a medium rare wagyu rump with a side of hand cut fries, mushrooms swimming in a red wine jus. Take On Mars just doesn't have enough meat to satisfy me. Do your own due diligence and make an informed decision. Read the reviews, watch other videos and then make a purchase or not decision. I 'm not satisfied. If I want a space sim, Kerbal Space Program has that creativity streak that Take On Mars doesn't. Would I play Take On Mars often? Only if my Warthog HOTAS was stolen, and every other computer game I owned was destroyed and it was raining outside and it was a Saturday in June. Aside from that, sure I will play it.Another thing, what is early access, an alpha, beta or in-between? Call it what it is - an Alpha....Thanks go to my grade 10 Science teacher Mr Clewett -- You were right, I would use the knowledge of the first twenty elements in the periodic table in my life time. :)Score: 2/10			"

								Today's Review: Take on Mars.I just can't reccomend this game until it is out of early access. I know, I know, it's early access blah blah blah, but no game has a right to be this bad ever. I could not do the campaign because I coud'nt sit up, so this game has been a waste of time and money.			"

								Very unintuitive controls. researched items not appearing for use in construction. Hardly any player direction. I don't need games to hold my hand, but I would like to know whats going on. All starting probe missions complete and then it would not let me proceed as it said I needed new tech, even though it was already researched. Also the physics are jank. I really wanted to like this game but it is determined to push new players away.			"

								Literally every rover that this game has landed on Mars has had one broken wheel. One.I was doing good with my space program too, having lots of spacebux and whatnot, until I flipped a rover due to one of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing instruments needing to be in contact with a space rock, but really can't decide if it is REALLY touching said rock or not.The next rover was on decent when the landing stage literally flipped over for 0 reason and cratered into the ground. The airbags didn't do ♥♥♥♥.Wait, who made this? Bohemia Interactive?! hahaahahah that explains everythingPlay KSP instead.			"

												If you're interested in playing multiplayer as I was then you best think again about purchasing this, the multiplayer it's the most UNOPTIMIZED GARBAGE I've ever had the misfortune of attempting to play, unless you're playing over LAN or you have a very fast connection speed (upload speed in particular) you will get crazy amounts of lag that make it unplayable.I'd understand this if it was still in early access but to release it like this completely unacceptable, they might as well remove the multiplayer it's so bad, they've been promising to fix it for over a year, yet not a single thing has been done to improve it, they're either incompetent or just plain lazy.If you have any interest in MP do not buy this game.

The bugs can be fixed just be return to lobby and back again.. same goes for the desync.. p.s save every 5 minute... you will thank me later.  ;)			"

												first  is too restrictive.   we cant build vehicles from parts  we must use nasa methods   which extreemly limits the play diversity  while the environment is very mars like   exploring or gathering science is also  scripted and repetitive.  mission ""press the button""  player  ""presses the button""     so the devs are micromanaging the players right now    so the game/simulation needs more freedom and diversity      if the player is interested in a specific rock formation  they can go look at it but game wise its pointless. they need to add mini rovers,    orbiters,   drones,   balloons   ground penetrating landers   and as many different experiments as they can think up       how about experiment that works in cooperation with other landers like 3D imagery  or  seismic experiment  where several craft place seismometers on the ground,, then another lander launches out  explosive probes  that land on the surface and detonate  and the landers collect the results?  how about telescopes?   how about weather guages that actually work and tell us how fast the wind is moving how about some ways for players to interact with systems  on board their craft possibly even improve or repair them  or  bypass damage  or adjust power levels how about some experiments that can serve additional science    such as radio signals  being used to determine atmosphere depth or planet width simply by  the signal strength or drop out.

								I really wanted to like this one, and it's coming along in leaps and bounds, but as it stands at the moment, there's not a great deal there.The base game involves launching probes at map locations and watching them land. You'll do a lot of that until you can build up enough money to start doing more interesting things with rovers and landers.The recent addition of the multi-player component adds a massive amount more to the game, giving you the ability to build your own little mars base and keep yourself alive... but it's definitely in its infancy.Graphically it's lovely.  Gameplay... early stages.If you like the idea of exploring Mars, and quite fancy the thought of building your own base there, then DEFINITELY keep this one bookmarked. However, I'd recommend waiting until there's a bit more development before getting too excited.It has a lot of potential, and I'll recommend it on the strength of that alone.			"

								[earliest reviews]Dont waste your time or money the game claims to be in early access but it's not a game. its no where close to being finished no uppdates ever, every damn time I send a probe or something on to mars it just gliches through the map ohhh woops there goes anoother 77k dollars for the already poor space program. Also this game does a horrible simulation of everything you can only drive around and shoot lasers at rocks and analyze gases. the damn stats menu doesnt even work its been out for over half a year and there is such a lack in content and support i think that they actually forgot they had the game and where supposed to be making it. and if you plan on making a cool entry system to get through the atmosphere and then land soft forget abouutttttttttttttt it cause you cant control or build the entry units and landers  they are pre-built and auto guided. they called this a simulation blow it out your ♥♥♥ bohemia.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There making progress aand the roadmap looks much better.

								This was a positive review, but I no longer feel that way. Ammended review:It's been in Early Access for (literally) years now. At some point it becomes an excuse for developers to never finish something, or always be able to promise ""more features in the future"" - which is what's happened here. I was severely disappointed several months ago when I realized they no longer cared about science results and testing of Mars and started focusing on the multiplayer aspect, but I know teenagers/gamers are the target audience on Steam, so I wasn't completely surprised by the shift. However, that was nearly a year ago. In that time, nothing has changed in the single-player ""science"" campaign at all. It's been the same thing since I bought the game years ago. I really, really wanted to like this game, but it's just not meant to be. I mean, how long can you call something ""beta"", yet make money from it, and get away with it?If Bohemia can own up to the failures and shortcomings and put some TLC (ie. patching, time, development, and customer concern awareness) back into this, I might switch back to a positive review. But that is very doubtful at this point. They've run out of time for me.			"

												UPDATE:Now that the game is offically launched I can say the bugs are still there if not multiplied.  After the 2nd update since release none of my save work from the previous patch.  I enter my saves with all my structures blasting apart into pieces.  If I try to launch one of the built-in campaigns I am instantly dead.  I am going to have to give this game a ""DO NOT BUY"" until it is somewhat stable.ORIGINAL POST:First it should be said that this is NOT a released game and is still being developed.  The negative reviewers here cite issues like performance, audio sync issues, etc.  Fine tuning and optimization is one of the LAST steps in game development so you should expect performance and audio issues.  To walk into this game and expect every aspect that is in the game to be fully polished is an expectation that will not be achieved.The idea of Early access is to help the developers make a better game, not to submit negative reviews for items you should be alerting them about instead.  Be constuctive not destructive.  If you are not willing to accept bugs, performance problems, missing content or compatibility problems, then do not play an ""Early Access"" game.So far what i have seen of the Manned mission, it is a Mars survival game. You crashed, you need to get air, and a temporary shelter.  Then you go off and try to find better resources and build better ways to survive, all the while trying to find or build that piece of equipment that will save you and get you home.  If that is not your cup of tea, leave now, this is not for you.  If you are looking for big green aliens to shoot, look elswhere.  If you are looking for cutting edge graphics or horizons of breathtaking vistas, this is Mars, its rocky, red and dusty.This is about one man fighting to survive on Mars.			"

Early Access Review
								Take on Mars is good for what the unmanned part offers, but the manned part is still in heavy development right now. It does look promising as the game is still under development by the devs. The development may be slow but it is still there. They give out information about what they are currently doing and they even have a trello page so you can check out what they are developing and what is to come.			"

												////\\\\ DON'T BUY IT !! ////\\\\////\\\\ N'achetez pas ce jeu !! ////\\\\This game was, and  is still full of bugs ! You're just gonna waste your money ! I lost a lot saves because of crashes, and it's still the case. The ""release"" didn't change anything.During the bêta this game was dead and buggy and today it's the same,they are just abandoning it.. Don't buy it, save your money, and may the force be with you.			"
