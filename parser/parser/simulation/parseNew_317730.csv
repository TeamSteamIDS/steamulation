Early Access Review
								TL;DR : DO NOT BUY, BAD GAME AND BAD DEVELOPER BEHAVIOR.This game... oh this game... It looks bad, during the docking sequence there is no weight, you can crash without damage, it runs poorly on my somewhat aged PC but it should be able to handle it no problem. It takes multiple attempts to launch the game, I can run it once before the .exe goes missing again.and the dev... the dev censors people in his forum, which he wiped multiple times. He banned my friend for mentioning War Thunder once which he claimed was advertising. He banned me too ( hello dev!  try censoring this! ) almost all the threads are locked, or they get removed.Here's the best part : Task manager tells me this is the DEMO. thats right. This developer has had numerous delays in releasing, valve gave him an ultimatum so he REUPLOADED THE PUBLIC DEMO, which some people have had their antivirus warn them IS A TROJAN.You can ban me and my friend, silence critics and censor negativity, but who will have the last laugh? That would be Jim F**king Sterling, Son.			"

								Not even worth $5. One update, and it does nothing. ""Added level Drift"" NOPE Added a frozen screen after you turn a valve. I guess that was the update. They added an additional objective. The fuel pump freezes and 35% and asks you to stabilize pressure or something. So you leave the fuel pump thing and turn a valve. Then it shows a short cut scene and then a splash screen. The objectives states ""escape the station"", but you can't do anything. I know, I played through it 4 extra times to make sure I didn't mess up or something. Do not buy this game.Update: They released a countdown to full game release. I come back about a month or so later to check how much time is left on the countdown, and instead of a countdown, I see ""Development Suspended"". This game is officially done.			"

Early Access Review
								Although REVERSE SIDE looks superb and it has a great, spooky atmosphere, unfortunately it looks like there's only about 5 minutes worth of actual gameplay.After spending a couple of minutes with flying around in an abandoned space station, the protagonist is tasked to refuel a spacecraft. Something goes wrong in the process and there's an explosion, and the protagonist can only escape by jumping into a lunar module spaceraft. After this the camera follows this spacecraft's (which looks like the Eagle of the Apollo 11 mission) flight -- or rather fall -- over a lunar landscape, but it doesn't seem to be controllable at all other than some tiny bursts of the RCS (maneuvering thrusters), but even these bursts don't affect the course. After a few seconds the spacecraft crashes into a rock, and the next moment you're back in the main menu, without any explanation or indication as to what happened, or if there's anything else you could try.The game doesn't even have the tutorial which the demo had, so even though it looks very pretty, as there seems to be no content to it, I asked for a refund because sadly this is a vaporware. :(			"

								Has three available languages but only plays in one.  Kills your character after you turn a valve in the second area, meaning that the game can be played in 10 minutes.  Don't buy until the devs make a real working game.			"

								Well.... this is a tricky one.  The game is beautiful... controls decent.  Good audio and excelent models.However... it seems that you can't get past the first 10 minutes of the game.  (Fuel explosion)There is talk from other players that this is just an old demo, and it feels like it.All voice audio is in Russian (I think)... so you'll rely on the subtitles system unless your Russian is up to par.The price for 10 minutes of play is WAY WRONG.Until something changes... I can't recommend it.			"

								Game crashes after fuel explosion. Docking sequence really needs to have the friction turned off so that you need to counter burn thrusters in order to dock without crashing.Game looks amazing so far, but some of the comments make me worry the dev doesn't plan to finish this...Hopefully I'm wrong but in the current state as the game crashes a LOT, I cannot reccommend this.

Early Access Review
								Do not buy this game.It contains two, very short levels, one of which is interactive cutscene. Level 1 has you inside a very small space station, where you float around and look for things to interact with. The majority of your time will be spent wondering what you are supposed to be doing.In total, if you take out all the wandering around looking for a computer to interact with, this 'game' has about 15 minutes of gameplay. Most of which seems to be deliberately slowed down, to inflate even that number.While the game itself looks pretty good (Unreal 4), there's just no substance here. At all. And it hasn't been updated since October of 2015.I picked this game up on 50%, and it should be worth nothing that this is the first game I ever returned from Steam. For $7.Stay away.			"

								As of now I cannot recomend this game. I will change it when i see fit but as of now there are only 3 levels, about an hour od gameplay. When the dev's add actual content to this great concep and visually appealing game that has so much potential, i will be 100% for it. Try the demo however, it is really fun and thats all you really get from purchasing... It feels like a demo.			"

No Work in Progress - DO NOT BUY!###############################?/10 EarlyAccess Review""Very promising - but atm just a very² short tech demo!""This is my first ""?""-rating, ever. Unfortunately I can't really recommend you guys this game, yet. It's the shortest demo/alpha I ever played, but nevertheless I also definitely can't give this game a thumbs down! There' is so much promising realistic space sci-fi survival adventure atmosphere in this game and I really enjoyed the 37mins. But 14 bucks for 37mins is a tough call...and from what I've read on the forums, this state of the game is like that for almost a year now. That's why I can't recommend this game yet - on the other hand because of the beautiful preview I just played I also wouldn't think of thumbing it down. I really hope & wish that this game gets finished!!!Pros:+ very promising atmosphere*+ promising gameplay*+ promising story*+ very good graphics+ good audio+ good controls (keyboard&mouse)Cons:- *really f###ing short => 36mins- hope it's not a fraud (...visit the forums)- it's more like an interactive tech demo, atm- no controller support, yet- no invert mouse, yet- no key remapping, yet- no english spoken audio (if you really mind, but the astronaut is a Russian guy!)Only buy if you like to support the dev OR if you don't have any expectations AND/OR believe that the game will get finished.

								AS OF JAN 11 2016, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. AS THE REST OF THE CONTENT IS ADDED I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW. YOU SHOULD TRY OUT THE DEMO!Docking with ISS Zeus: 


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



The game is not complete at this time. There are three missions. You dock with the ISS,♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real, and you head to the lunar surface. No other content available as of Jan 11th.The atmosphere is amazing. This game is perfect for a VR headset and I'd imagine it'd really get your heart pounding. The fear and isolation of being involved in a space disaster really does come across to you (well it did you me anyways.)While there is plenty of room for improvement, I think this game could be great.Pros:- Atmosphere- Graphics- Controls (simple)- Story (what exists)Cons:- Interactive moments are lacking to the point where they are almost pointless- English subtitles are HORRIBLE and need to be re-written- Needs english voice-over (reading the bad subtitles is distracting from the action)- Better outline of a players game progress (where you are, where you're going)- Better define what content is available and what is yet to comeP.S. If you purchase the game TODAY you will feel as if it is a bit buggy. The game also cuts short after the 3rd chapter / section leading you to think it is glitched. The content is not available yet.

								I really like what I've played so far but the seed of doubt has been planted.  Buying early access and being greeted by the demo is pretty appauling.  I think this is about to be my first Steam refund based solely on the fact that there is little proof of life as is.  I will not hesitate to purchase again if things improve.  I'll give it another week.PROS:- Great atmosphere and score.- Nice visuals (dependent on hardware).- Engaging story , setting and tone.- Controls decently enough during the very brief 'demo'.- Survival in space.- Personally I kinda like that everything is in Russian.  I can handle subtitles.  I'd happily play the entire finished game like that.  Even better if all conversation and objective dialogues were recorded and logged for reference.CONS:- Very brief demo.  Even for an early access title.- Consistent delays.  And the official early access build is still just the demo.  WTF?- Forum wipes due to alledged censorship by developer.- Very little communication/ language barrier.-  Excitement levels depleting.-  Cautionary systems engaged.- Airlock locked.- Waiting...Recommended, but with caution.

								 Hi yes the game plays Ok for me interesting subject for what I have played and seen so far seems well thought out crafted and works well on my laptop on high settings I don't know yet how much content there is the  game. In the add it states 38gb space required but I down loaded only 994 meg so there is hopefully more to come in the future because my lap top is medium to high spec so to get the best FPS for me I need to go lower res than 900 X 1600 but iI don't see any way to lower the res beyond 900 X 1600 in the options menu.So all in all lets see what happens in the future, I will recommend it if there is much more content and polish in the future,but if not I will be the first to say no  but you can only make your own mind up.  Mike. "

								It's a really stylish sci fi outing that when fully fleshed out and finished might well be a stunning game.  It is after all Early Access so You have to overlook some rough edges here and there.  But it has a ton of potential!  I wish the best of luck to the developers and godspeed so We can see the real thing.			"
