												I can't think of any game that has done sneaking better.  HUGE levels, superb use of audio and light.   It is so much fun I quickly forgot about the 10-year-old graphics (and I believe there are mods for correcting that now).This game isn't linear or easy.   Loot quotas force you to explore your surroundings and it rewards the observant with many a secret stash or alternatve point of entry.    There is some slog in the middle as the thief universe has always had a mystical bent that I could do without and the last level can get very frustrating but that didn't stop me playing it through twice in a row.What really sells me in the end is I *feel* like a proper thief when I play this.  I can't recommend it enough.			"

												My eyes are unclouded by nostalgia. I was born too late to have experienced the theif series in it's prime. But even to me, a series newcomer, this game has more than stood the test of time. Pros:+ Garret is a great protagonist. + Amazing stealth gameplay+ With an HD texture pack installed, the game is still atmospheric 15 years after it's release.+ Great steampunk setting+ Father Karras is a great antagonist+ Humanized enemy guards with their own worries, lives and dreams, a rarity today. Makes you feel awful about killing them more than any forced karma system ever could. + Encourages acutally going through a level without anyone noticing you, rather than the modern approach of (pick off guards one by one do it do it do it) + Huge expansive levels with tons of little details and secrets. + Combat is incredibly difficult when directly confronting guards. and thats a good thing.  + the material the floor is made of, and how loud your footsteps would be on it, is a huge gameplay mechanic.+ Voice acting is pretty great considering how old the game is. Cons: - while dated voice acting is to be expected, some of the voices are pretty awful even by early 2000s standards. Mostly the female ones. - Inventory wheels can be intensely frustrating when you have to switch items quickly.			"

												wow !this is probably the best stealth game ever created, the atmospheare in this game is amazing.if you want to expirence a well made game you should get this and the first thief game (thief gold) as well.each level in this game is very well designed with huge space and many secret stuff,documents to read and alot of loot :)comparing to the first game this game improves in the way that you don't have to deal with ghosts and monsters anymore instead you will deal with gaurds and automatic machines :)also you get to use new equpiment such as gas mine,flash mine,invisibility and slowfall potion,you also get a camera like eye ball that you can throw and see behind corners,flares to see at night etc...i wish game makers would learn from this game and invest more time to create a better gameplay and game machanics instead of fancy graphics.anyway just click buy and enjoy  one of the best games ever :)			"

												Nostalgia really is a funny thing.I've been a Looking Glass Studios fan since the 90's with System Shock 2, and a Thief fan for a long time. Thief II: The Metal Age (the sequel to the critically-praised Thief: The Dark Project) brings players back into the world of master thief Garrett, this time with a bunch of new missions and antagonist in the form of Karras, the leader of the Mechanists.The one thing I loved most about this game was that the scale just felt bigger in (almost every way). While I still have an issue with the fact that roughly half the levels are strictly linear, the missions that open up to you (like ""Stonemarket First Bank"", ""Life of the Party"" and ""Masks"") offer a wide array of alternate routes and secret passages to accomplish your goals, as well as give a far grander sense of the City and the threat Karras poses to its inhabitants.Likewise, the variety of weapons and items you can acquire is great and allows for lots of experimentation, although (since I'm a purist) I still stuck to water arrows for the majority of the game.Admittedly, I found much more joy in the levels where I could pick off guards at will with hit-and-run tactics. I think it's fair to say that the AI in this game alternates between hypersensitive and woefully inept. When the guards aren't aggro-ing on you from far distances, they're complete morons in combat. It is exceptionally easy to take advantage of the combat system. When a sword-wielding guard runs at you, walk backwards and swing like mad, or circle-strafe and hit his back. Bow-wielders are an automatic win - just mash the attack button if you get one cornered. The only real challenge came from the Mechanist robots and groups of enemies, which sometimes stacked up in doors and got stuck or ran around the mansion in the ""Masks"" mission chasing me (all that was missing was the Benny Hill music).Likewise, the voice acting is either really good (in the case of Garrett's voice actor and some of the minor antagonists) or near-laughable (the nobles, who sound like they're reading from a script). I couldn't take Karras seriously as a villain because of his nasally voice, which made me laugh more than get freaked out whenever I heard his voice.I vaguely remembered a lot of buzz and praise for ""Life of the Party"", which sees Garrett take to the rooftops to rob every building in sight and infiltrate Karras' tower, Angelwatch - and that mission did not disappoint. Easily the best in the game, it had everything I consider to be so great about the genre - lots of expansive areas and alternate routes to take, lots of secrets and hidden goodies to find, great level design, the works. I wish more of the missions had those kinds of additional areas or features to make them worth replaying, because I didn't feel much compulsion to go back and do much besides replay the missions that were either ""loot everything"" or ""steal and/or kill everything"".All in all, though, Thief II is still a standout in the stealth genre. I haven't played Deadly Shadows yet (as of this writing), but the improvement in scope in this game makes me excited to see what's next.			"

												So, I finished Thief: The Metal Age and I must say everything that lacked in Thief Gold was built upon in the sequel. I spent many, many hours looking for hidden loot and secrets while trying to kill nobody. This game highly rewards the non-confrontational type of players and stealthy manuevers gives an immense amount of satisfaction for doing so. There are many new toys for Garrett to play with in these huge mission areas and also some of the encounters are hilarious. The story was amazing; I will not dive in but it has great morals and a few familiar faces will be present. Once again the sound is spot on whether Garret is going down a steep hill or a long climb everything syncs pretty greatly, not to mention the music is very fitting and adds to the overall atmosphere.      On a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running on par with some games today!!!Personal score: 9.8play Thief Gold before Thief Metal Age			"

												This is the gold standard by which stealth games are measured, and my personal favorite game of all time. There is an interesting and mysterious world that you will learn about as you play your way through, sneaking through the shadows. The graphics are a little dated, but there are mods that can bump them up a bit, and the dark environments and wonderful sound design preserve the atmosphere.In my opinion, this is the best game in the series, though some disagree and prefer the first one, and you may wish to play that one first for the story. The game still has an active community, with fan made missions released regularly.A new game is coming to the franchise in the beginning of 2014. I'm looking forward to playing it on release to see how it holds up.NOTE: I own non-steam versions of this game, so my hours played are inaccurate.UPDATE: I am sad that the new 2014 game does not hold up to the originals.

												My My, this is one of the best games ever created and by far the best sequel to a game yet (That is if you don't count any games from the Persona and Mother series) Nearly every problem in the previous game was fixed and every strength amplified. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monster missions ruining your fun? No problem! Here's a bank for you to rob! No, seriously, you rob a ♥♥♥♥ing bank and that's not even the best mission! Did I mention this game is amazing?The story is more direct than it was in the first game, making it easier to follow, more engaging, and giving you more of those oh so ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful cutscenes to look at. Though because of the more direct approach it isn't as dark as the first game. The first game's story was a lot like the main character, Garrett; It remains in the shadows, rarely ever leaving them. Everything is just so much more threatening when you can't directly see it. So what is the story of this game? Not going to tell you. I don't want to spoil anything; not even the most minute detail. The only thing I will tell you is that as good as the story is, the ending is a bit abruptNow onto the gameplay. It's the best stealth game ever made. It plops you into large, explorable maps allowing you to complete the missions any way you want to and how complete you want them to be. It's as addictive and as hilariously satisfying as ever to rob rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s blind right under their noses. The mechanics have been refined since the last game (not that there was much room for improvement) Bunny hopping no longer turns you into Garret the Master Hedgehog and mounting has been improved to where it works 75% of the time. The sound design is still awesome and the stealth is still just as awesome as it was in the first game.. only without the abysmal monster missions.I'm not the first ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to praise this game and I shouldn't be, because this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.10/10 "

												Let me just say up front that I am incredibly impatient. I cannot sit still in one place for very long if there isn't something going on to entertain me, and I get really antsy waiting for even a short amount of time. I'm also very bad at sneaking around. I would often try and sneak up on family members just for fun to startle them, but they'd always notice me, and often they'd beat me to the punch. With that said, Thief II is my favorite game of all time. Yes. A game as slow-paced and patience-testing as this one, which relies on you being very good at stealthing around to pass the levels even on normal difficulty, is my favorite game of all time, and also the only one I began again immediately after finishing for the first time. That should say everything you need to know about how perfectly designed this game is. I could talk about the absolutely gargantuan levels that reward exploration, or the deep gameplay with a huge variety of tools and ways of approaching any situation, or the amazing story, featuring excellent, writing, voice acting, and one of gaming's best protagonists and most underrated antagonists, but really, what else do you need to know? Thief II had the misfortune of coming out the same year as Deus Ex, and was thereby overshadowed (no pun intended). While it still sold well in it's day, it's fallen under a lot of people's radars over the years. Fix that. Get this game. Be it Steam, GOG, or physical CD, there is no excuse for any gamer not to have this in their collection. Go. NOW.Edit: I forgot to mention this game also has fantasic sound design. The importance of sound is often neglected in games, and this game more than makes up for it's dated visuals in this aspect.Score: 10/10			"

												One of the best games ever made. As a standalone game, Thief - The Metal Age, is a wonderful stealth based game, with a protaganist that will always be remembered. The story sneaks up on you. It starts out small, with you simply trying to get some money to live by, and suddenly you're in an epic, fighting for your, and everyone elses, life. Combined with the first, and the third game (ignore the fourth), this game not only gives you a lovely story for each one, but the games complete eachother completely. You go full circle.These games deal with what happens when extremes get the upper hand. What you think is evil, might not be, and what you think is good, is not certain to be. When neither exists, that might prove to be even worse. Everything needs a balance.That is what the thief games, as a whole (ignore the fourth), deals with. That is what they put you in the middle of. Seriously... This game... no, not only this one. The first 3, are my favorite games of ALL TIME. I've played alot of games. I've put countless of hours into games of all forms. This serie is my top choice.Do you like a good story? How about sneaking? Stealing stuff? Need a challange? Thief provides you with all of these things and more.Buy this game. Buy all of them.			"

												Unlike the first game, this one is much more steampunk-oriented. Much more so than even Deadly Shadows. This was a very deliberate choice as the main antagonist created a morphed Hammerite order obsessed with techonology, steam-powered engines and such.  There are no more supernatural, mysterious creatures around the world. This is the triumph of technology, so a good part of the game is spent with human AI's if you enjoyed that. About half of the game is spent ""rubbing shoulders"" with the rich, going to various mansions of flexible level design, especially by the end when Looking Glass was close to bankruptcy. It's just that same, immersive game as always. I did find it to be a little disappointing to see fewer horror sequences, but it's all the same great. The story picks up right after Thief 1. Without saying too much I think everyone owes it to themselves to try the game for themselves, simply because this is as much of a breakthrough in the stealth genre as Half Life for shooters.You can find the free demo of the game here: http://www.thief-thecircle.com/media/demos/ "

												Thief II: The Metal Age sets the high water mark for stealth gaming.  Bar none.  No game before or since can compare to the immersiveness of this game and it's fine-tuned mechanics.  It manages to mix the fantasy, strategy and adventure aspects of the first with a more prescient storyline than the first Thief game.  The first game was an excellent stealth game that occasionally drifted too far into Tomb Raider territory with it's platformy style missions, devious traps and creature threats.  The fact that Eidos was the publisher of both Thief and Tomb Raider, and that one of the missions had you raiding an underground tomb frought with booby traps and monsters, ought to tell you something.  Thief 2 , thankfully, focuses on the strengths of the stealth system and makes that the core of the game and not just an aspect of it.  That's not to say you won't be jumping across ravines and encountering creatures, but the heist-pulling, pick-pocketing and blackjacking really comes into thier own in Thief 2.  I've read that the developers created the missions of the first game to suit the plot, while the missions of the second were produced first with the plot retrofitted.  In any case, the levels are larger and more complex than the first.The graphics had gotten a slight bump from the first game with higher poly models, better texturing and weather effects.  They even added dithering to the hardware renderer, which was a nice addition.  It did have the effect of dampening the deep shadows that were such a part of the first game, but it generally made the game more pleasing to the eye. The sound design is, again, excellent.  Sound propagation is one of the core facets of gameplay.  Listening to footsteps draw near or fade into the distance allow you to judge from your hiding place in the shadows whether or not you can risk stepping into lit areas.  Leaning against doors to listen to conversations or the presence of sounds in the next room allow you to determine if opening a door is wise or not.  Sound is fundamental to this game.  You will not be able to play this game successfully while blasting Megadeth or Slayer.  Just not happening.  And that's one of the things that makes this game so damn immersive.  You are literally concerned with the environment both visually and aurally at all times.  It sucks you in.  There are some new gadgets in this game.  Garrett lost an eye in the first game, and that has been replaced by a mechanical eye that can zoom in and out like a telescope.  A new object called the Scouting Orb allows you to take a peak over walls or around corners without exposing yourself.  There are also new potions and a new arrow:  the vine arrow.  Similar to the rope arrow, but it can ""stick"" to things rope arrows can't, like metal gratings.The design went from a predominantly dark age style steampunk in Thief 1 to a predominantly Victorian era style steampunk in Thief 2, in much of it's architecture.  Actually, art deco also makes an appearance as part of the design of buildings operated by a faction that's new to Thief 2, the Mechanists.   The European old world oozes in these games.  In fact, many of the textures from Thief 1 and Thief 2 were from photos of architecture taken by the developers while vacationing in Europe.   The overall design is pretty immaculate.  The first two Thief games share a cult status, along with System Shock2 (uses the same game engine and made by some of the same people), as games of remarkable vision and quality.  They are all lauded as excellent games by the gaming press and continue to make the top # lists.  The gameplay transcends gaming.  To play this game is to embark on an existential and  metaphysical experience.  This game seems to attract a higher-brow gaming audience.  There is a community forum that has been the stomping grounds of its players since the games were released.  They have created hundreds of fan missions to play; you can find it here:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/forum.phpHere you can get a community made patch that updates the rendering of the game and allows for some nice effects, like bloom, while also fixing a number of leftover bugs:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131106Here you can get a high resolution patch that updates some models, textures and also adds a numbder of new effects to the game:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=144312Here you can read about and find fan missions to play:  http://www.ttlg.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=100 "

												One of the best games ever made for PC. Amazing ambient soundtrack by Eric Brosius compared great soundscape, challenging gameplay and perfect voice acting by Stephen Russel makes Thief 1 and 2 one of the most atmospheric games of all time. Thieves are also one of the only first person stealth games made properly. Probably nothing can come close to the atmospehere and experience what Thief 1 and 2 are. Graphics are what they were in late-1990-2000 and especially the textures in caves might not look so good. Otherwise this is a masterpiece.			"

Thief II is a first-person stealth game realeased back in March of 2000. It's set in a city, aptly named The City, with a steampunk aesthetic. You play as Garrett, a thief with a wide assortment of tools, weapons, and gadgets to assist him. The minute you get in the first thing you'll probably do is change the controls. The default controls in this game are set up fairly differently than the average first-person game, but you'll have little-to-no trouble after setting them up. The graphics are pretty dated, even as far as 2000 is concerned.The stealth mechanics of Thief are much more interesting than the average stealth system, based more around light and sound as opposed to the cone of vision that other stealth games tend to employ. Garrett decides to wear his clogs on every mission, so stepping on stone makes you much more obvious than stepping on something like a rug, while stepping on tile is a death sentence. The light gem at the bottom of the screen lights up to tell you if you're being lit up by the light around you, or is dark to show that you're completely in the shadows. Very rarely do games use lighting and sound as effectively as Thief does here.The missions in the second Thief, as opposed to the original Thief, focus more around simple thievery instead of supernatural missions involving zombies and cultists. This is pretty subjective as to whether or not it's a pro or con, but I prefer the thievery. The original Thief is more of the same, but with more of the aforementioned zombies and cultists.ProsLighting and sound are both fantastic, easily some of the best, even today.Interesting stealth system, only game to use anything comparable is Mark of the Ninja.The atmosphere is so thick it could give you lung cancer.More focus on thieveryConsGraphics are pretty bad, even going back to 2000.Less than friendly to newer players, but not impossible to get intoLess focus on supernatural elements Final Thoughts:It's easily one of the best stealth games to date. The original is preferable if you want more of the zombies and similar stuff, and Deadly Shadows is a little more forgiving. Overall, I'd reccomend it to anyone looking for an extremely fun and unique stealth system that's rarely contested, even to this day.Rating: 9.5/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												In 2016, it’s hard to say something about Thief II that hasn’t already been said. While Looking Glass Studios may have invented the modern stealth genre with Thief: The Dark Project, they perfected it with The Metal Age. This game’s innovative use of sound, sprawling level design, and impressive amount of player agency, create an experience that still immerses me to this day. Metal Age’s missions consist of sprawling sandboxes that allow the player to pursue objectives in whatever way they see fit. Along with the wide variety of tools spread throughout these missions (arrows, mines, bombs, etc.), there are practically infinite ways to traverse any given level. The levels themselves are set in a wide range of pseudo-medieval locations. As master thief Garrett, you’ll be robbing banks, breaking into manors, trailing people through city streets, and so much more. What's really incredible about The Metal Age is that in all of its vastness and player choice, it always manages to feel organic. During my time with Thief II, I never felt like a guy in his computer chair, I really felt like a master thief. This feeling of total immersion is greatly aided by Looking Glass‘ creative and dynamic use of sound. Your footsteps make different noises at different volumes depending on what surface you walk on. You can lean against doors to hear a muffled conversation between two guards. Every coin, key, chest, door, and ladder, makes appropriate jingles, creaks, and thumps. Eric Brosius’ composition work deserves special mention here. While not traditionally musical, Thief II‘s soundtrack expertly creates a nocturnal and ominous ambiance that never really comes to the forefront, but is always present.While it should be clear by this point that I consider Thief II to be a classic, I don’t believe it’s a perfect game. The Metal Age‘s most glaring flaw is in its visual fidelity. As a 3D game that's over a decade-and-a-half old, the graphics have aged somewhat unfavorably. Models are low-poly, with rigid animations and less than great texture work. While the dated graphics didn’t break my own personal immersion while playing, if you’re the kind of player who finds low-poly graphics to be distractingly jarring, this game may not pull you in as much as it has others. While not as much of a sticking point as the visuals, Thief II has one more notable flaw. The two missions prior to the final mission are practically identical, down to reusing the same map and having dangerously similar objectives. Neither mission is particularly bad, but the needless redundancy so close to the game’s conclusion may be frustrating for some players.That being said, these two flaws are relatively minor tarnishes on what I consider to be a nearly perfect game in terms of player choice, level design, and use of audio. Some classic games are recognized for their influence on the medium of games as a whole, whether it be a innovative mechanic, or even inventing an entire genre. However, we often return to these games and find them to be dated or unentertaining. Thief II: The Metal Age serves as a welcome exception to this trend, and has stood the test of time to become one of the greatest stealth games ever made.            Overall Score: 9/10+ Huge Levels+ Multiple Paths / Choices Through Missions+ Great Setting Variety+ Good use of Sound+ Highly Immersive- Dated Graphics- One Redundant Mission			"

												Thief II: The Metal Age is a 2000 stealth game, developed by the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, the successor of the widely acclaimed yet underrated Thief The Dark Project (1998), considered by many as the pioneer of modern stealth game, released along other amazing stealth titles such as Tenchu and Metal Gear Solid.  Being the least known of those 3 (at least from my point of view), Thief, for me,  is the most advanced on how a sneaking game should be, and that’s coming from someone who don’t have nostalgia glasses attached at all.Dawn of The Metal Age You take the role of Garrett, the cynical, sarcastic, and somewhat selfish master thief, with his only goal is to steal enough goods to pay his rent. A pretty interesting hero (or antihero) in the get go isn’t he? That very attitude, skill, and notoriety is the source of the problem on both games. You start off by having a couple of disconnected missions, before the real problem takes off. Thief Gold (I’ll just call the first one Thief Gold from now on)  has a pacing issues in the first couple of missions, because they’re kind of a long ”introductory” missions. Setting up the Thief universe, Garrett as a character, and it’s gameplay mechanics, and then it becomes a bizarre and intense supernatural horror story. With all the universe building stuffs is done by the first one, and all the supernatural mumbo-jumbo gone (not completely, but it put in bare minimum). Thief II doesn’t have to suffer with all of these, it has a better pacing, more focused, more intricate dystopian-thriller story, set in an even more well realized steampunk setting. From a “modest” manor to a high security, 6 story towers, from stealing lowly goods to ancient mask, Thief has a unique storytelling, we all are as clueless as Garrett is,  all the story elements dropped in the perfect time and place. Take example for Karass, the antagonist, the common people only know him as “The guy who leads The Mechanists Order”, and so does Garrett, and us, the player view him, and he becomes a more threatening figure, and that’s through texts and overall environmental storytelling only. Stealth At It’s Purest Form While Thief Gold is a thieving game turned-supernatural stealth-semi-platformer halfway, The Metal Age is a “thieving simulator” all the way to  the end. Thief II is simply a much more refined version of Thief I, minus the annoying zombies, and maze-like location, my biggest gripe with Thief I. Improved graphic, making a more beautiful contrast between light and dark, and improved sound design. All thanks to  the amazing “Dark Engine”, an engine designed for Thief, and Thief alone, and yes, I know System Shock 2 use this engine too, but Dark Engine truly shows it’s technical prowess here. It has a unique aesthetic and probably the best “built-in” directional sound design ever. Even until now, I can’t think of any game that has a directional sound so spot on even without the help of a software and hardware  Thief is a stealth game at  it’s purest, most immersive form. Your ear, eyes, patience, and common sense is your greatest strength. Thief is a slow, I mean, really slow stealth game, especially on expert where you can’t kill any humans. Stay in the shadow, lean on every corner, creep your way around, and be patient and spatially aware, because once you’re caught, well, you're one dead thief, especially if you play on expertThe interface is minimalistic, there’s your health, your light gem, and inventory. No mini map and quest markers.  That help a lot with the immersion, you are lead to appreciate and respect the surrounding area, the unique art style and layout in each level, heightened your spatial awareness.There's one flaw in this game and that's the AI, they are... inconsistent. Ranging from nearly blind/deaf (or both), to superhuman sense. You might think the AI gets smarter every time you advance to the next level, well.. to an extent yes, but for the most part, it's ""unpredictable"". The Art of Level Verticality Two defining characteristic of Thief, that Thief II managed to improved, as I said earlier are the sound design and level design. I won’t delve deeper into sound design, because there’s not much to write about. It’s simply amazing, spot on, and overall has a defining ""exaggerated"" sound design. Let’s focus on level design for now. It’s FANTASTIC, it’s huge, titanic huge, believable, follows architectural logic, and has an ""oppressive"" atmosphere throughout that fit with the theme very well. Unlike the second half of Thief Gold, when the level goes total mind♥♥♥♥, in a good way, mostly. In term of level scenery, Thief Gold has more variation, from tomb, prison, cathedral, ruins, and mansions. Thief II levels are all worldly architecture. Only one level that goes to Thief Gold territory and that happens to be my least favorite level. As I said, it’s huge, more complex, but logical complex, that what makes Thief II a more fun experience than Gold. It’s harder to get lost, even if I do it’s easy to get back on track, making the exploration much more enjoyable. The level verticality is simply astounding, so many paths, some is more obvious than others, some require keen eyes and careful exploration, some requires you to hear conversations and reading notes. It’s so rewarding every time you enter a room, and realize there are 3 or more ways to get in / across. There is a vent that connects that room to the basement, the celling that connects to the attic, there’s always the so obvious ground hallway, or you can move through the interconnected rooms and picking up loots and notes, and oh! There’s a secret passage if you put out that fire, saves my time from creeping out this place!  Every route is fun to take on, making every level looks larger than it is. Besides there’s no better feeling when stumble across some loots on the way.  Less Is More One major flaw in the gaming industry trend nowadays is the fact that a lot of today’s games forget the phrase “Less is more”, the removal of an element hold the same importance, or even greater importance nowadays, as adding one. They take a shotgun approach, throwing everything that looks cool hoping it will sticks. It’s not necessarily bad, but with that design philosophy in mind, a game will become a “Jack of all trades, master of none” and directionless. That’s a plague that need to put in moderation.Thief in the other hand, is already set out to be a hardcore stealth game from the very start. It’s simple and humble in presentation, and that’s what makes it works in perfect harmony.  With a “realistic stealth/thieving game” in mind, Looking Glass can focus on what’s important on  a stealth game. The combat is terrible, the gadgets are mostly stealth oriented, you are “forced” to do the stealthy way, but it’s fine, it’s a stealth game after all. It’s not about playstyles in Thief, it’s about the route you take and they deliver. Through The Looking Glass If I have to pick what’s the most underrated game developer for me, it’ll be a tie between Looking Glass and Black Isle. Though I might choose Looking Glass, because Thief, System Shock, and Ultima Underworld are less known than Black Isle’s Fallout series alone. Without them, there’ll be no Ion Storm (Deus Ex), Irrational (BioShock), and Arkane (Dishonored), it’s no coincidence that all of them are such  a hit. So short lived yet so influential, A timeless stealth game Thief II Is. A more than worthy successor of an already near-flawless game, and a perfect game to end an era.This game definitely deserve the ""Test of Time"" award			"

												Thief 2: The Metal Age, developped by (the long since defunct) Looking Glass Studios, is the direct sequel to 1998's Thief:The Dark Project. To summarize, you play as master thief Garret (voiced by the great Stephen Russel) who is trying to unravel The City's new religious order, The Mechanists (the replacement of the first game's Hammerites, who believed in the Creator and that industrial construction was the way to keep evil influences, such as the Trickster (a Pan-esque God who worships chaos and nature) at bay. If you don't understand you should check out the first game, it's great!) and their leader, Father Karras, the likes of which are inventing new mechanical innovations in security and industry (robot guards, cameras,etc). The core stealth gameplay is still here from Thief 1, with the ability to deal with guards either lethally or nonlethally (avoiding or blackjacking them) and either playstyles are sufficiently suitable for every mission. This is primarily because the level design in Thief 2 (like its predecessor) contains many hidden paths and secrets to find and explore to deal with mission objectives and secure the most amount of loot possible. Also with new items such as invisibility potions and old ones such as noisemaker arrows (used to distract guards and clear paths), as previously stated, both playstyles are equally supported in the game. The stealth mechanics are still as great as the first game, with the ""light gem"" still in effect( flashing white if you are visible; dark if you are not), the ability to lean around corners to see guards/ cameras/etc. and the aforementioned items to facilitate being stealthy. One improvement I loved from Thief 2 is the change of setting for the missions, from looting ancient crypts and supernatural dimensions( still awesome but not very thief-like) to looting actual mansions and houses (especially the amount of loot in every level, with multiple areas to scour and explore). And whilst these houses and mansions may not look too good, i feel the art style has a certain charm to it.  Another reason why i enjoy this game? Its story and atmosphere, Garret's tale and The City's backstory is thoroughly established in the pre mission cutscenes and books and texts found throughout levels. And the game's soundtrack is simply amazing, with chilling sweeping synths and general dark tones, the game's soundtrack gives the player a sense of always being watched, of potentially being hunted down, which gives the game's world such a distinctive feeling of ambience and general eerieness. But these are just my thoughts so feel free to check this amazing game out if you'd like, but I'd recommend checking out the first game beforehand, then diving into The Metal Age's world.			"

												Certainly the greatest stealth game of all time......Sequels usually are worse or hit the same beats as the original, only maybe changing the criticisms directed at the original. Thief II is pretty much a revamped Thief 1, feeling more like a mappack than a sequel.It is, however, a much better thought-out game and feels much, much more secure in its concept and execution than The Dark Project. For starters, the levels are 100% dedictated to stealth and they feel a lot more fun to explore for it. Gone are the clunky combat sections and in place of that is fantastic level design that seems a lot more interested in attempting to replicate the experience of stealing from a rich guy's mansion or from a bank than the mystical weirdness from the many levels from the original. Levels also feel a lot bigger, with many sections and many, many different ways to explore them.In terms of artstyle, this is Thief 1 with the occasional higher quality textures and the occasional better looking models, but neither Thief is really easy on the eyes, so a lot of that extra goes unnoticed.Thief II's plot manages to be even better than the original, the focus still on Nature vs Science, but this time with Science being the main opponent and having an interesting (with an extremely annoying voice) antagonist that keeps you on your toes at every single opportunity he gets.For it's more focused effort, the game feels a lot more repetitive than the original as the many city scenarios don't feel as alien as the organic-based levels, the contrast not as strong.It is, in my opinion, for the best and Thief 2 is one of those sequels, that doesn't add or change much, but it doesn't need to, because for what it does, it does better than any other game out there.

												Thief II is a classic stealth game from a time when games were meant to actually challenge the player, force him to think, and punish him should he act hastily. This game will not hold your hand at all; there are no objective markers, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t x-ray vision that pervades modern stealth games, and no option to play like it's a generic shooter. The game is very non-linear, with multiple pathways and options for stealth, and even some secret passages for one with a clever mind and sharp eye. The ultimate goal, however, always remains the same: steal some priceless artifact and escape, leaving no trace. The few downsides I can think of with this game just stem from it's age: the graphics are very dated, and the AI isn't very advanced, but the latter can be negated by thinking that the game's main challenge comes from the environment, not the guards. In addition, the Dark Engine that this game runs on is a little buggy, especially when it comes to dismounting from a ladder and climbing up objects, but it shouldn't impede your enjoyment too much. If you enjoyed Dishonored (which was inspired by the Thief franchise) or the real Splinter Cell games (the series up until Double Agent), you can't go wrong with this game.			"

												BEATEN!  34 hours A pretty great VERY open stealth game that emphasises being quiet, being concealed in the dark, and stealing valuables.  Pros: - HUGE levels with VERY open environments. A emphasis on multiple ways to get to the same place.  - Long! A third of the way through at 10 hours.- Different difficulties EXPAND mission objectives, not just making something harder, like less health.Cons: - Because the levels are so open the game is old enough, the maps for the levels dont tell you where you (exactly) are. You have to orient yourself. This can make navigation harder than expected and for those used to hand-holding, it might be frustrating.Neutral:- There is minimal emphasis on combat. You can certainly run away, but fighting more than one person is borderline impossible.  You need to evade people and take them out without being seen.  Would certainly recommend.			"

												The game never disappointed me since the first one. It has really good maps, and stealthy as usual. Though it doesnt seem to be as horrifying than the first. Lost its bit of touch with horror. Regardless, there are some levels that are rather challenging, especially on highest difficulty. I just love the challenge in this game.One thing that bugs me however...... No fan missions in workshop. Would RECOMMEND having THAT in steam. Would definitely try whatever maps that throws in steam workshop. I know its in a website, but i feel it would be nice if it was in steam workshop, dont we agree?Anyways, this game i recommend anyone. I dont recommend to people that never played the first though. :P			"

												By far the best stealth game there is. Unlike most games where pickups and guards are very evenly distributed, stuff in Thief is actually where it would be in real life. No gold in the kitchen or the guard quarters because why would there be? Also, if there's an area that's very hard to reach, that doesn't mean there's good pickups there. For example if the kitchen is very well lit, and there are a lot of guards around there picking up a late night snack. Your AAA-poisoned brain thinks ""Ooh, high security, must be some nice loot over there.""To which the game would reply, after you've finally made it there ""No, of course there isn't any gold here, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing kitchen"".No ♥♥♥♥ing minimap or objective markers. Not just sleepwalking towards the glowing arrow like in Thief '14, but actually organically exploring the area with a map Garrett drew himself.And last but certainly not least NO MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING CUTSCENES! No stupid fades to black every 20 seconds to pull you out off the game and shatter your immersion. The story is picked up through conversations between NPC and letters you find in people's desks throughout the level. The best stealth game ever and one of the most immersive games there is.10/10			"

												I didn't play this game until I was 26 years old, so I like to think that my opinion on it is unbiased by nostalgia. That said, this game is absolutely fantastic. Easily one of my favorite stealth games of all time. The levels are large and incredibly organic, with several hidden passages and ways to traverse them. The difficulty is challenging but not tedious. The graphics are dated, but more than makes up for it in incredible sound design and ambient music, wonderfully composed by Eric Brosius. Not only that, but the game is filled with character. The atmosphere is dark and the fantasy world presented here is creative and interesting, but the game also has a very dry sense of humor that keeps things from getting too grimdark. Fantastic voice work from Stephen Russell, who voices the memoriable recurring guard Benny, the very eccentric, Truman Capote-esque villian Karras, and the delightful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a protagonist Garrett.Absolutely fantastic game. Demands to be played several times, to learn the levels, to perfect them, and bask in the atmosphere and world created here. Do not let it's age turn you away.			"

												Thief II: The Metal Age was the second first person stealth game I ever played after Thief: The Dark Project and the series really introduced me to genre as a whole, I've been obsessed with it ever since. The game mechanics just work and there is a dark, unique humour and fine attention detail in every aspect of the game making it a perfect example of a time when developers were more concerned with making an enjoyable game for the player over one that would appeal to the masses and therefore sell well. This point is further shown by the fact that the original developer, Looking Glass Studios, went bankrupt after releasing this game, yet this game and it's predecessor are still considered beloved classics while the future games in this series, created individually by Eidos and Square Enix, are widely recognised as terrible and failures and I must say I totally agree. While this game does create a level of nostalgia for me personally, I would still recommend it to anyone even if this weren't the case. A fine of example of a game done well.			"

												Thief II: The Metal Age is everything you could want in a sequel, taking what its predecessor had and making it better. It remains one of the finest games in the Stealth genre, rewarding exploration and weaving a tale in a unique and entertaining setting of steampunk and sorcery. Forget the 2014 Thief, it only existed to milk a few dollars of the curious and nostalgic alike, and failed to satisfy either. Thief II is cheap to buy and fun to play, and in an age of mediocre ""modern"" games selling for the same price, you'll be glad you picked up this classic. Yes I will marry it now that you mention it SHUT UP AND PLAY IT.			"

Posted: June 8, 2016
												Thief 2, The Metal Age was a game that I very much enjoyed playing, and although it’s quite old, I still think it holds up very well. In Thief 2, you play as Garrett, a master thief who must overcome recent trouble involving a corrupt Sheriff who has cracked down on crime, and who seems to have a personal grudge against Garrett. Throughout the game, you must sneak around in various missions and locations, all while uncovering a potentially much larger problem that goes beyond Garrett himself. In terms of gameplay, it plays similar to the first Thief game. You sneak around, completing various objectives, all while trying to remain unnoticed. While combat is an option, Garrett is rather unequipped when it comes to fighting enemies, and stands little chance against more than one foe at a time. Stealth is by far the best option, and Thief 2 still holds up as one of the best stealth games i’ve played. Guards have long, unpredictable patrols they take, meaning they don’t simply walk from one end of the room to the other making them easy targets, which keeps the game tense and forces the player to always be on their toes in case a guard shows up unexpectedly. Guards are always alert, and will investigate a noise they hear. If they catch a glimpse of you, they may decide to look around, forcing the player to keep moving so that they aren’t found. Garrett’s main means of hiding is darkness. By hiding in the shadows, guards won’t be able to spot the player, allowing them to sneak around unnoticed. The mechanic of hiding in darkness and being exposed in the light works excellently in the game, and it was quite revolutionary for its time. Another interesting mechanic is how not all floors produce the same amount of noise when stepped on. Things like carpet and grass will produce little noise, while marble floors will produce more noise, potentially bringing guards over as well. As you progress through the game and begin stealing from richer people, more marble flooring will be found and more electric lights will be used, meaning it will get harder to keep quiet and stay in the dark. The level design is some of the best i’ve seen, even an improvement on the excellent design of the first game. Levels are non-linear, large, and open, and can have many different sections, each with their own ways to sneak around undetected. The levels are also very varied. Some you may find yourself in a huge mansion, some in the streets of the city, and in many other locations as well. Garrett will have a large array of tools at his disposal to help him through the levels, including many different types of arrows such as water and vine arrows that will help in certain scenarios. Thief 2 also wisely gets rid of the more paranormal settings and enemies that were common in the first game and replaces them with more stealth focused ones. In the first Thief, many of the levels revolved around ruins and caves filled with enemies such as zombies. These levels didn’t offer much in terms of stealth, and for the most part involved simply running right by the enemies while avoiding their attacks. Enemies such as zombies are rarely seen in Thief 2, and luckily don’t break the flow of the stealth gameplay. Thief 2 does use new enemies in the form of robots, but luckily they can be snuck around, making them similar to guards. They also offer a good challenge, because they cannot be knocked out, and throughout playing the game I never once destroyed one. I don’t even know if it was possible to destroy one in the game at all.The game and the people in it also have a lot of charm. Garrett isn’t some lifeless protagonist; he’s a man who can take a moment seriously, but isn’t afraid to make a few cynical remarks about the people he’s stealing from. He isn’t some special hero who people shower with praise, he’s just a guy trying to make enough money from stealing to pay his rent. The guards in the game also have excellent, sometimes quite funny dialogue, and the drunken tone of their voice is a great way to get across their character. The story itself is also very good, and is often told in a non-direct fashion, meaning the player will learn more about the story and world by reading notes left on people's desks, listening to guards talking to each other, as well as other ways. This also gives players more of a reason to look around and explore the environments. While the story itself may seem simple at first, it slowly builds up and becomes something more. It’s rarely a flashy story, but it’s subtle, as well as intriguing and interesting at the same time.I can only really think of two complaints about the game, and they're both pretty minor. First, climbing in the game can be a bit difficult, and if you miss the ledge your trying to grab, the character may jump by accident and alert guards to your location. Second, it seems a bit unfair that taking one step on a marble floor brings every guard in the nearby area to your location, especially when guards are already walking over marble floors without anyone caring. Still, these are only small complaints and they didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the game.Overall, Thief 2 offers a great improvement over an already great game. It’s one of the best stealth games around, and it has gameplay that still holds up today. The graphics will seem quite dated by today's standards, but if you’re able to get around that, it shouldn’t hinder your enjoyment. One of my favorite games.			"

												One of the best stealth games of all time, you break into mansions, banks, houses and steal stuff. Levels of thief 2 remind me of old hitman games - they give you a lot of freedom and you can experiment with different strategies. There is almost no horror elements like in the first game which some people don't like, for me it's a change for good.			"

												When it comes to the pinnacle of stealth gaming, some say Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, some say Hitman: Blood Money, and some even have the audacity to say Assassin's Creed. While they're all worthy contenders, Thief 2 stands fully erect as the throbbing crown jewel of an underappreciated genre. They just don't make many games like this anymore. There are 15 glorious levels--each of which can take anywhere between 30 minutes to three hours depending on your level of Kleptomania. Even in 2014, I am still amazed at how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ huge the levels are, and the sheer amount stuff hidden in every nook and cranny. Sure, on a graphical level the game hasn't aged well at all, but from a gameplay standpoint, this game was (and still is) WAY ahead of it's time. Dishonored pointed its pinky in the right direction, but still wasn't able to capture the sheer size and replayability of this game. There are levels within levels within levels. It blows my mind. Anyway, I'm surprised you made it this far in my review and haven't purchased this game yet. You're getting easily 20+ hours from this badboy...and that's undercutting it by a lot. This is the template for how to make a perfect stealth game. Period.			"

												Thief II is the gold standard upon which all stealth games/games with stealth mechanics are to be evaluated. The original Thief was treading into unknown territory and hedged its bets with more action/horror/Tomb Raiderish levels against mostly nonverbal inhuman foes. Thief II is straight up robbing human establishments against foes that you can always understand just how alerted to your presence they are. Light & shadow are integral to going undetected, but it's sound that you'll be relying upon more than sight.You'll spend lots of time just standing still, just listening and watching, waiting to move. You're constantly under-supplied, and there's no point in hoarding inventory since it doesn't carry over between levels. Fighting won't end well. On Hard you're not even PERMITTED to kill. Escaping once detected isn't easy. Your maps are vague & incomplete. All that is what makes your victories that much more satisfying.Modern AAA gaming will never permit this experience ever again.

												Thief II: The Metal Age, the sequel to Thief Gold, doesn't fix anything that ain't broke. The levels are a little bigger and more urban, and the story is just as engaging as the first Thief. The degree of polish throughout the game is very impressive, making it the best Thief game to date. If you liked Thief Gold or are attracted to the stealth genre, you shouldn't pass this one up.(Rating: 9/10 ""Great"")			"

I'd even say this is better than Thief Gold, thanks to the tomb raiderish maps being dropped in favor of focusing entirely on human enemies in city environments. Level design is also improved, with bigger more open-ended levels than those of the first.Make sure to get TafferPatcher before playing			"

												Thief 2 (along with its predecessor) will shine on as timeless gems in the PC goldmine that is the turn of the millenium - apart from its chilling sound base, Thief 2 carves its own niche in the art of level design. This is one of the only 1st person games with a truly realistic environment - entire wings of a building may contain no leads, no loot, no nothing. Or it might just hold a secret. As a gamer, you are left guessing, until you take the time to explore it. Forget polygon counts, forget sloped terrain - Thief 2's calibur of level design, in and of itself, makes it a winner.			"

												What can I say, It's the best stealth game to have been crafted up to this day. Although I myself prefer Thief: The Dark Project (for nostalgia reasons) I can't deny the fact, that Thief: The Metal Age is significantly better in every single way possible. Looking Glass have really outdone themselves this time.The textures may be low res, npc models may look ugly. But how can that possibly matter, when Thief has some of the most beautiful lighting and sound design I have ever had the pleasure to experience. Even after nearly 18 years since the first Thief was released, both Thief games still look and SOUND gorgeus!			"

												When Thief II released, I had probably already spent over 300 hours (re)playing Thief: The Dark Project and Thief: Gold. Shortly after its release, I rebuilt my PC and dove in. The graphics were much improved from the first games, and the story was even better. The missions were even more expansive this time, and replaying the game always led to finding something new. What made this game even more brilliant, was the opening of the Dark Engine to the users who wanted to mod/level build. Looking Glass Studios closed shortly after the release of Thief II and the sequel wasn't produced until 2004. In that period of downtime, hundreds of new, fan-made, missions were created and distributed in online communities like the Circle of Stone and Shadow. Some were better than others. And just a few may have been better than the game itself. In fact, one of the fan missions was so good, the developer was hired by Eidos to work on Thief III. Moreover, some fan mission developers ended up joining forces to release their own, unofficial sequel named Thief2x. The game itself had its own replay value, but the fans who made these missions and mods increased the value tenfold. Thief II is a must play. I'd definitely recommend playing Thief: The Dark Project or Thief: Gold first. When you're done, it's worth doing the investigation to find these fan-made missions and play them too.			"

												I've been a Thief fan since The Dark Project came out, first introducing ""first-person sneakers"". I just deided to play Thief 2 again after buying it on Steam. WOW is it different than ""THIEF"" (the newest one, not part of the original trilogy). It's in a league of its own. Strategy, timing, and pure stealth are key in the Thief trilogy. The graphics are very much outdated, but it is still a ridiculously immersive game, partly because the creators put a LOT of time into sounds. This was also true in the first one, Thief: The Dark Project. When you're getting your bearings and trying to find a safe time to move (which is a constant throughout the game), listening is key. If you have a busy or otherwise noisy household, you're gonna have a hard time playing this game. It is absolutely reliant upon being able to listen closely to the movements of nearby NPCs, and sometimes the spoken hints as you're listening to their conversations.To make Thief 2 even better, it not only has zombies sometimes like Thief 1, but it also has ""metal beasts"" -- creations of the Mechanists (a splinter of the Hammerite cult), which are creepy in their own way, but also very hard to kill if you find yourself in that position.I miss games back in the day. In the bank level, the first time I played it, it took me just over 4 hours to beat. That's just one of many levels. What made so many older games awesome was that some games had absolutely gargantuan levels, and in the Thief trilogy they had a dozen ways of being completed, increasing replayability, whereas games today tend to be so linear, with the exception of a rare few.Enjoy it!

												Perhaps *the* quintessential stealth game. A word of warning: the graphics definitely show their age; but still, give it a chance. If you love stealth gameplay then I think it will nevertheless win you over in time. Thief 2 has many great open levels to explore and skulk around in, not the least of which is the infamous bank level. The music - which is more like ambient sounds and effects - is great as well, lending to the fantastic atmosphere found in the series. If you like first person sneakers, this should be a no-brainer.			"

												Of all the stealth based games I've played, ""Thief II: The Metal Age"" is by far the best. It's stealth mechanics make use of both light and sound which is pretty amazing for a game that came out in 2000. It also features a great story with possibly the coolest main character of any videogame series out there, Garrett.  Voiced by an awesome dude called Stephen Russell, Garrett is a sarcastic thief whose commentary you hear throughout the entire game and it is a joy to listen to. You might know Stephen Russell from the game ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" where he voices a large number of characters including the leader of the Thieves Guild, Mercer Frey, which is a nice nod to the Thief series.Unlike it's predecessor, ""Thief: The Dark Project"" (AKA ""Thief Gold""), Thief 2  knows what it wants to be, a stealth game, and ditched all the combat focused, ""Tomb Raider-esque"" missions that were so prevalent in it's predecessor, making it the superior title. Large open levels, even more tools than the first one, amazing atmosphere, a great stealth system, and awesome sound design make ""Thief II: The Metal Age"" the holy grail of stealth games.			"

It has a brilliant storyline with mystery and technology I never knew could be thought up! Imagine a medieval world in which people knew about electricity and used robotic machines yet still prefered to live in squallor! You must Use cunning, skill and creativity to out smart your opponents; some not as unwitting as others. I love using swords and bows, hiding in shadows to sometimes never need to draw my knife at all. You can play this game however you want to and are awarded or punished respectively for the choices you make. This game will grow on you if you give it the chance; patience pays off and timing is everything. You need this in your library ! ! !			"

												Thief 2: The Metal Age is a direct sequel to the Thief: The Dark Project, this one released in 2000 and made by Looking Glass. At the core it uses same mechanics and even same techonology of engine as the original, so some might think of it as expansion pack. Yet it's upper level of design is different, being designed like a proper stealth game and having more steampunk setting.Also, yea, you probably heard that this version doesn't have credits music. It's not a false statement, but it's not suppose to have one to begin with. It's just that localizator of German version decided to add some song from some German band. Doesn't sound Thief-like at all.Technically, it's released as-is and thus has some problems. Like, it doesn't support widescreen resolution or anything more than 800x600.I think that just like with Thief 1 on Steam, to see cutscenes you have to run .exe file with admin rights. But I think it already does it?I also noticed that the gamma slider doesn't work either. And in this one I felt that the game is way too dark by default. Or maybe Thief 1 is the one which is too bright. Not sure.Also, yea, enable fogging in options, it's art-improving graphic option, not ""hide things if far away"".Then again, you probably should use one of a community patches. Not sure how much do they change, I was there for Vanilla experience, but people love those, so.Plot once again follows our cynical thief by the name of Garrett in the mysterious City. In the first game he had to destroy the Trickster, god of Pagans house of nature, who wished to destroy everything man-build. This heroic deed shifted the balance of powers toward the path of progress, to a dawn of the twisted Metal Age. Pure fantasy elements and monsters are almost not seen, The City is being cleaned by the City Watch and a new Mechanists sect emerges out of Hammerite house to lead the age.And yea, the story continues, as everything here shifts to steampunk and Victorian setting. And Thief is focusing more on just being a thief, rather than adventurer. No more adventure, you now have big houses and mansion to rob and even your maps are always accurate and provide good description to let you. It even feels less linear due to this, albeit actual levels are less dragged due to less maze-like qualities and less of fetching and puzzles. But hey, this is what people expect Thief to be.And it futher embraces the fact that it's more focused on stealth. You got new tools of trade, like Invinsibility potions, slow-fall one. There is a scouting orb that you can throw anytime and see from it's point of view, which I always forget to use even though AI never notices this so there is no good reason not to. Remember kids - don't be like me, that's not smart choice.You can now lean into door to eaversdrop. Guards pretty much always mumble something to themselves, futher giving you audio hints. Some rare guards even wear special helmets that you can't blackjack them. Althrough they are so rare that I don't remember any such encounter. There are even occasional patrol that have more than one person.And it's a Metal Age that we are talking about, with Mechanists bringing new toys to watch out. There are surveliance camera, security systems and robots, which can be divided into huge dangerous robot that can't hear and small robot that can only warn others, but only after first hearing you, activating their vision and seeing you. All mixed with humans, giving more stealth-focused variety instead of monsters. All while you are cracking the bank level with it's ceramic tiles and three floors of complexity.Albeit, it does mean that it lost some of the charm. There isn't much of wonderful immersive mystery that made me fall in love for Thief. That, and I am not fan of this theme, it's just feels too Victorian. It mostly has to do that it actually lost some gameplay variety. There is only so much mansion that you can crack at before it gets a bit old. Which isn't to say that there is no rare mission which goes out of this style. And it also varies the stealth objective that you have, even having this single awesome police station mission where you actually supposed to ghost due to knockouts limit. And it has this awesome mission where you travel on rooftops of a city.But I still can't help but to feel monotomy setting after the half of a game. After all, it still ends up too much with you blackjacking everybody you come across. Or maybe it's because of the plot. It starts nicely, with some conspiracy going on, but soon it's all same grey Mechanics, Mechanics, Mechanics, who lack some charm. Even though their leader is kinda awesome and robot carry it along, but the environment gets you after a while.That, and I am still dissapoint that the plot didn't explore relationship between Hammerites and Mechanics. At least I never seen any actual conflict. Kinda hoped to see the clash of ideals ever since I overheard one of the very rare Hammerites complained in the second level. But oh well.That, and in the last one third of a game it simply farts out. I don't know, it feels like the quality and excitement suddenly drops. Then again, Looking Glass studios was in deep financial trouble and was rushing out, I bet this is the impact to it. The Kidnap level is both boring looking and boring to play, in a cave with more mechanists, where you run all over the place to find the needed NPC. Not to mentioning that I had sudden framedrop because of some trouble with AI pathfinding, until I found the guard who was hogging game up.Then you have two levels in a row that take place in same mansion, in both cased you enter it and exit in. The thing is that the first level of it feels like an earlier development version of the level, while the second time around it doesn't differenate enough to hold interest. Like plot-wise you sneak in to find a secret stairway toward the third floor so you knew where it is to snack masks on next day. After that you are supposed to leave yet you can venture futher into the third floor where you find many glitchy things, with flying decorations, misaligned models and you can even steal the already-present masks, but no one will care. As if you aren't supposed to be there.Final level isn't bad though, at least on second try when I learned how to exploit big robots into blowing up themselves. And when I knew to take it slowly. Kinda like a little nightmare of steel, albeit I can see how some may decide that it goes too long, as well as being a challenge course. It's actually is quite awesome. But then the ending feels dissapointnig. It leaves you with no satisfication of victory and doesn't hype you up for next title. Just ends immeditly, with no music. Unlike the perfect Thief 1 ending.But hey, I don't think that the main point of the games lies in ending. I would say that the Thief 2 is more than worth beating, even if it leaves you a bit sour. It's a Thief game, the one with complex levels, no hand-holding and more focus on stealth. And even though stealth core gameplay is still a bit on simple side, knocking everybody out, despite having excellent audio design that futhers gameplay, it's still a greatly enjoyable game.			"

												A lovingly crafted first-person stealth game. You are put in the shoes of Garret, a misanthropic snarky master thief who, unlike many cliche game protagonists, looks out only for himself and other people's coffers. This game is the second in a series of three titles and is considered to be the best of the three. Obviously low graphics, so can work on laptops. Patience and thought is key in playing these titles, and Thief 2 does not exclude.			"

												Perhaps one of the most defining stealth games ever created, Thief II is a masterful display of story, character, and gameplay. While it may take some work to get it to run properly on newer machines (the Dark Engine has not aged as well as could be hoped), Thief II is highly recommended to fans of stealth-focused and non-linear gameplay.

												Pros: Stealth all the way. Patience, planning and exploration rewarded. Great tools for stealth, like Invisibility Potion, Remote Camera, Rope Arrow, etc. Vast, complex, non-linear levels for you to complete at your own pace. Steampunk atmosphere, with chilling realizations and a few disgusting, nightmarish sights and sounds. Tense and gripping gameplay of hiding in shadows, and being careful not to make noise by walking on stone or mable. Creepy and dangerous robots, cameras and sentry guns to sneak past. Great story and exploration of themes.Cons: Does expect you to have played the first one, albeit it isn't required. Graphics were dated when it came out.My recommendation: Love stealth? Play this immediately. It's one of the best.			"

												NOTE: Currently I only have around one hour on steam for this game. That's because I just recently got it to work with steam on a 16:9 resolution and I already beat it several times over way back in the day on windows 98. This gameplay time is currently subject to change whenever I can get the time to beat this game again.Thief 2 is a good sequel to a stealth masterpiece. The map design is much more focused and much more clearly defined than in Thief Gold, which makes for some mildly streamlined but much more sensible map design than in the first; This also introduces entirely new gameplay mechanics (Literally) such as security cam operated sentry guns and robots which lore wise are explained rather well. Developers of the world, this is how you do difficulty modes right.Each difficulty can add new objectives and higher difficulties make the sword a detriment to your inventory as you will often auto-fail a mission for killing someone; You must instead use a blackjack that only works when an enemy is unaware of your presence, which admittedly is sort of broken when you learn how to lean in and blackjack effectively from the shadows. Personally I think it adds to the game to be able to lean in and blackjack, it's a fun abuse of gameplay mechanics, like Bunnyhopping. The sound design is masterfully crafted and unrivalled (for the most part) even today; you're going to want to get a good sound card and some plugins to emulate EAX to really get the proper effect of it.

Both Thief Steam releases come with an outdated version of ddfix which allows a few graphical enhancements such as modern resolutions and bloom injection but since the version that comes with the steam release is outdated your game will likely crash immediately upon using a 16:9 resolution in cam.cfg. It's moderately difficult to find the latest version so I'm going to save you the trouble and directly link it. http://rapidlibrary.biz/source.php?file=ulzq8ez8qri89on&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjermi.dyndns.org%2F~jermi%2Fddfix%2Fddfix_1.5.12.zip&sec=893b4f3af5fae4c1Just drop this into your Thief directory where your .exe is and using notepad++ to modify that to whatever graphical improvements you desire, though personally I think bloom looks terrible in any game, let alone injected into one. So i'd just leave it alone and modify cam.cfg so that game_screen_size is 1920 1080 if you're using a 1080p monitor. Hope this helped. "

												This game is arguably the best stealth game of all time. I only say arguably because Chaos Theory exists. Everything is so perfect. Huge open levels with deep atmosphere, secrets, banter between people and many more things. This is not a linear game. There are multiple routes in missions and the game is so good you just want to explore every one. Superior to Dark Project or Deadly Shadows. If you are a stealth gamer this is essential. No, scratch that. If you are any type of gamer and haven't played this game I don't know why you continue to call yourself one.			"

												Thief 2 is a masterpiece, a symphony of perfect level design that has not been surpassed to this day. Intelligent design that takes its players seriously. Unlike its predecessor, the focus on stealth is much higher making this the ultimate thief experience. In addition, Karras is one creepy villain. That voice is haunting!It does not have the horror elements of Thief 1 & 3, but I still believe that this is the absolute highlight of the series. ""Life of the Party"" may very well be the best level I have ever played in any game.			"

												Without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time. The most immersive stealth game I've ever played. The atmosphere and mood make sneaking in this game better that anything else I've tried.I've played countless hours outside of steam, spending one summer just playing fan-made missions for this game. Besides multiple slow and immersive playthroughs, I've also speedrun the game quite a bit. There's just so much replay value that's not just there for nostalgia's sake. Why? One acronym: FMs (or Fan Missions).I recommend you get the steam version and then download the NewDark patch to get the most out of the game. I also recommend to check out ttlg.com forums for fan missions that are some of the best custom content for any game period. Here's a few FM recommendations of the top of my head: Rocksbourg SeriesSeven Shades of MercuryCoSaS Mission XThe Last Lighthouse KeeperThe Seventh CrystalKing's StoryEnjoy!			"

												I never had any nostalgia for Theif, I saw maybe a few screenshots as a kid but never really played it. Years later I got my hands on the first one, and good god was it a breath of fresh air. So I was pretty excited to try out its sequal, and good god. ....I can't even put it into words. This is the definition of what a sequal should be. It should build on what the original made great, but in addition add its own touch.While age has withered its looks, from the cold stone streets of The City, to the dark ominous metal corridors of the Mechanist's lair's, Theif 2's sprawling open ended levels still feel fresh and terrifying to explore. To anyone who loves a good stealth game, or someone whose just looking for a lesson on good atmosphere, PICK UP THEIF GOLD AND THEIF 2 THE METAL AGE! I guarantee you will not regret it.			"

												Fantastic stealth gameplay and a well crafted story to boot. The controls are highly customizable allowing you to full freedom over how you move in the game. The large, expansive levels reward exploration and risk taking and the game doesn't lock you into a single difficulty level through the whole game. Difficulties can be channged at the start of each mission.The graphics are a bit dated this is true but if you can accept that and still be immersed in the game you'll find it deeply rewarding and fun to play. well worth your time and money, I can't reccomend this game highlyy enough.

												In Thief II we see the return of Garrett as he faces a new threat that has arisen because the equilibrium was disturbed after his previous venture. The new foe will seem unbeatable from our hero perspective, who, as usual, just wants to be on his own and make a living by what he does best, thieving, a thing that won't go far for him because a new faction that rises to power in The City will interrupt his schemes. The situation calls again for the master thief as he gradually involves himself in the unfolding of the master plan behind this new faction and its leader.Again, like in the previous game, Thief I, I chose to install a mod for some minor fixes I've read that this game needs, although from my experience, at least, with these two games I have never encountered a single crash or any major inconvenience (excepting here the fact that Garrett is totally lacking basic ladder climbing skills). I chose a simple and light mod, without graphical enchantments called New Dark (Unofficial patch), which, as the name suggests, is a patch, namely a community patch. Regarding the game itself, as a whole, I can say that it is largely similar with its predecessor, with a few improvements, of course. The difference is seen when we look at the story, the first game focusing more on the old ways, nature and the world beyond while this game centers its story inside The City and its altering under the Mechanists.Altogether this game didn't disappoint, as expected, and it is, for me at least, as good as the first game. Give it a go if you have finished Thief I.			"

												I didn't play the Thief games upon their initial release and so am not reviewing this through the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. But I can safely say that these games honestly do still hold up today.Pros:- Light/Dark system is a great mechanic and leads to the player paying more attention to their environment.- Static map, some areas are missing and without an all encompassing minimap you are forced to be more cautious, unsure of what lies around each corner and this adds to the game's  tense atmosphere. - Your footsteps become louder when walking on harder floors such as marble, adds depth and makes you more observant of your surroundings.- No zombies or supernatural elements (preference).- Excellent level design, navigating is not a problem despite not having a full map or quest markers. This is because the levels are designed logically (as though they were not designed just for a game but to serve the purpose of the building e.g a mansion)  and loot is distibuted accordingly, e.g you can safely assume that there will be little to no loot in the servants quarters, but there will more than certainly be something valuable in the nobles quarters.- Tells the story through level design and gameplay instead of directly through a cutscene or text.- You can't choose to go in all guns blazing, you die quickly (2 sword hits) and thus feel more vunerable and this creates tension. You aren't invincible, their is no second option to just fight your way in. Only through the patience and intelligence of the player can Garrett succeed, as you play you become a better thief- not through ""levelling up""- you are never given any notification of your progress by the game (this is a good thing), Garrett stays his same vunerable self throughout the whole game, but you the player learn how to handle yourself: which areas are low/high risk, when to blackjack guards, where to hide etc ... This is extremely rewarding as by the end of the game you (the player) have gone from an amateur burglar to a masterthief, this progression of the player instead of the character is extremely rewarding and makes you feel like you are truly getting more skillful- this progression is expressed not through a number or a level and Garrett doesn't become more powerful as you play, your growth is shown in the way you play the game.- Amazing soundtrack.Cons:- May be too dark and hard too see for some.- Not the greatest voice acting.- Graphics whilst not awful do not compare with those of newer titles.You owe it to yourself to experience this masterpiece.

												I think Thief 2 is the best game in the franchise. The controls are much more refined and still feel smooth to this day as well as Garrett’s movement and animations. I feel like the biggest improvement was the level design, the levels end up being much easier to navigate and find your way but they also somehow manage to be even more elaborate, intricate, creative, well thought out and designed compared to the original. Also just the mission objectives and how you go about to accomplish them is very creative. It also has a much bigger focus on actual thieving compared to the original. There are still some frustrating missions in the game that are nowhere near as good as the others which greatly ruins the games pacing but other than that, this is still a good classic stealth game.  7/10 (Good)			"

												If the first game was thrilling, this game is sublime. A genuinely intriguing story moves things along between missions and whether by experience or design I feel every bit as challenged while feeling like a more capable thief. A much improved map is still reasonably vague while giving you a much better idea of your location so it doesn't feel so daunting to navigate levels. I find myself playing with the guards, looting rooms far out of the way or after every objective is cleared for the thrill of the theft. Clever games reward clever and curious players, and there are secrets abound if you keep your eyes open in the dark. Don't let the graphics put you off - the Thief games are classics for a reason. If they're stewing in your backlog, play them, and if you don't have them yet, get them.			"

The best of the best. A perfect sequel to the already perfect stealth game: Thief: The Dark Project.This game has more to offer then it's predecessor. More enemies, more open levels, better envoirments and slightly improved gameplay. It also has more gadgets like invisibility potion, which can come handy sometimes.I've didin't expected this game to be what it is, it's a perfect sequal with changes, but not tragic ones which would ruin it. The envoirments are amazing and you even get to walk into woods in one level. Furthermore, the  gameplay and visuals are pretty much the same, it looks good for it's age, when i was playing this in 2000 then it would be the game with the best graphics ever, but nowadays if people play this they are to blind to see how old this game actually is and that that is the reason why it looks so ''bad'', while it in fact looks amazing. So, the theme is really cool, with metal robots and stuff. I've had a good nearly 8 hours in this game, i've could finish it more quickly because i learned a lot from Thief Gold if it comes to actually playing this game the right way. The ending of this game was exciting:  all the deaths.. 'all...as it was written'An all-time classic perfect game. A must buy. It's a steal for the price it's on Steam right now.. so, go ahead..

												This is probably the best stealh FPS that has ever been made, and it's over a decade old.  It improves upon everything that was good in Thief 1, without making any of the mistakes prevalent in Thief 3.   I don't think there's really much more I can say about this one.			"

												If the first game was thrilling, this game is sublime. A genuinely intriguing story moves things along between missions and whether by experience or design I feel every bit as challenged while feeling like a more capable thief. A much improved map is still reasonably vague while giving you a much better idea of your location so it doesn't feel so daunting to navigate levels. I find myself playing with the guards, looting rooms far out of the way or after every objective is cleared for the thrill of the theft. Clever games reward clever and curious players, and there are secrets abound if you keep your eyes open in the dark. Don't let the graphics put you off - the Thief games are classics for a reason. If they're stewing in your backlog, play them, and if you don't have them yet, get them.			"

												Not sure what happened to the review I wrote for this game on Steam a few years ago - ah well.Thief II still stands for me as the best stealth game ever made.  I have bought so many copies of it over the years and played through the disc version many times before it ever appeared on Steam.Ignore the dated graphics and enjoy;A comprehensive stealth system where you are a thief not an assassin with many routes you can take to complete each level giving the game immense replay value.Lots of lovely loot to collect and so many secrets to discover.The wonderful ascerbic wit of Garret's narration and the many humorous npc dialogues that you can eavesdrop upon as you play through the game.An intriguing and thrilling plot that makes sense.The beautiful drawn story panels before each level.Rope arrows.A ridiculously large number of mods both for graphics and new levels for the game - see here for instructions on how to mod the game on Steam -

												My new favorite Stealth game. It has anything you'd want in one, different difficulties, all giving you different tasks to complete each mission, multiple ways to get the job done, and (mostly) clever AI. I wish I would've found this game sooner, it's one of the most explicitly stealth oriented games I've ever played. It also removed the annoying dungeon-crawling levels from the first game, replacing them with no-violence stealth missions. Unlike most modern stealth games, this one doesn't let you get away with getting spotted by killing whoever has seen you, you'd better have some flash bombs or a good escape route, or else the only way you're leaving is in a bodybag.

												Next in line in the Thief series, here I am. I have never played any of the games of Thief, though I have always wanted to. I just finished the first game and wrote a review for it, and now have finished the second. The very first Thief disappointed me very much, but that was all due to the level design, which ruined the whole experience for me. However, I was still greatly interested in the world's atmosphere and story, so I was hopeful with this game and came in with a neutral outlook.Thief II greatly increased my expectations through the first two-thirds of the game, but quickly disappointed me again with the last 5 missions and the ending. Firstly, just to brush through everything else, as I don't need to say much more here than I did with the first Thief:+ The story and the atmosphere given by it is just as engaging.+ The graphics were better than the first game's, and the world mostly looked like it was put together better in each level. The cinematics were pretty much the same in style, however.+ Garrett is still just as likable of a character!+ The sound effects are mostly similar, and the voice acting is still well done, except for Karras, which I will go into more detail later.+ The gameplay mechanics are mostly the same as well, not too much new, though I enjoyed things like the robotic cameras you can throw.In the end, most of the above is rather the same, though slightly improved in one way or another. Nothing too drastically new in those areas... but the level design, now that was so much better! Based on the first two-thirds of the game, I have to say that the levels were (mostly) great, so much better than 90% of the levels in the first game.The first level was an interesting start, especially neat for clearing a path for an NPC. The second, however, was pretty bad and generic again, scaring me that the game would be the same. The storage area was nothing special, and the design of having to repeatedly go to the office, punch in a code, and go back out so many times was just bad.But afterwards, the game picked back up very well. I liked every mission up to and including Life of the Party, though the Eavesdropping/Bank missions were nothing too special. Ambush was actually a very good mission for me. I enjoyed running throughout the city, trying to weave my own path back to my place, creeping around. Life of the Party was my other favorite mission, sneaking around on the rooftops being my favorite part. Before that, Trail of Blood was interesting as well, mostly in the environment and the ghosts you kept encountering.None of those levels were really that confusing as in the first game either. They were no longer wide open, empty areas. Instead, you could get a better grasp on where you were for the most part, and I could always keep track of what I was doing, never getting bored.Then came the last third of the game, back to terrible. From the first Cavador mission forward, I didn't enjoy the environments anymore, nor did the levels keep me entertained. Even worse, the Casing the Joint mission was a generic build for the most part. I mean, I was interested with the secret paths throughout the place at first, but to be honest, they wore out pretty quickly, as the mission was such a pain of trial-and-error, more so than any other mission. Then the immediately next mission throws you back into the same exact mansion with basically no difference! What a pain, and what a terrible design decision.And for the finale, Soulforge wasn't linear like in the original game, but it wasn't interesting either. The first room you start in looked cool, then everything else was just generic looking and full of robots. I understand that it fits the story (the Metal Age!) but it didn't make me want to keep going. And that ending cinematic, wow! The ending of the first game wasn't the greatest, but still much better than this one. It seems that Looking Glass really didn't know how to end games, between System Shock 2 and these two Thief games.As a side note, mentioned above, Karras had the worst voice of the game. So terrible. He sounded like he just had this nasal jelly mass stuck in his throat. There is some weird, annoying cartoon character that it reminded me of, but I can't remember for the life of me, at the moment. I know that Stephen Russell did the voice and he also does many others, included Garrett's! But Karras is so different, and literally I had to mute my sound any time his voice was prominent throughout the game. I can't really say there have been many voices that have caused me to do that, and it was only slightly worse that all of the robots spout his voice too.In the end, I was really impressed with about half of the game, neutral for a little piece, and then very disappointed with the last third. Do I recommend that people play the game? Sure. I enjoyed it for a good while, much more than I did the first game. I will never play the first game again, whereas I might play some of the missions here again.Now, I am onto the third game, Deadly Shadows. Let's see how it goes!			"

												This and Thief: The Dark Project a.k.a. Thief Gold are my two favorite games of all time. I have played and replayed these games so many times it's in the triple digits, easy. Everything about 'em is just great. For anyone playing these old games on anything Windows 7 and newer, you'll want to get your hands on some of the fan-made patches to really get this baby going. You won't regret it.EDIT: Upon my original attempt to post this review I was denied and a notification popped up saying that I needed to have used this product for at least 5 minutes before posting a review. I'll address that here. In order to get to modding and patching this game I strongly advise you to move the executable out of protected folders such as Program Files. I did so and that's why all my playtime from the Steam copy hasn't registered in my Library. Do not be fooled by the 5 minutes of playtime I'll have logged on my profile. Triple digits and counting, man.			"

												Great maps, with plenty of cool little diversions. A setting, oozing with quarts of viscous atmosphere. Stephen Russell's syrupy vocal talents. Incredibly tight gameplay. Somehow still the best sneaking game out there.Like, really though. Other developers. How hard is it to program floor types that make different amounts of footfall noise? That's like half of the stealth mechanic right there!If nothing else, The Metal Age shows that a sequel doesn't need to superficially outdo the prievious game in scope. All you really need is an incrimental improvment and a couple of neat new ideas, presented without pretension.  Though, it seems like Looking Glass forgot to tell the rest of the industry how to do that before they folded.Dang. "

												This game is a classic. It’s outdated by today’s standards, but seeing that it was released in 2000 its aged pretty darn well. This game defined the genre of stealth for me. There is nothing like reallocating wealth while moronic guards struggle to find you. In order to assist the focus on stealth, Thief II has large levels, which are strategically populated by enemies, items, and objectives. There’s even a multiplayer mod that can be found on the internet that works with the steam copy of the game. If you’re a die-hard stealth fan, I would highly recommend this classic.			"

												This is my second review for the second game in this eponymous stealth series, enjoy B's.Pro's: This game, just like its predecessor before it, really makes you feel like a Thief. When all the cylinders in your brain are firing off at perfect formation you will honestly feel like no one can stop you from ""borrowing"" their precious goods. The game is a direct follow up to The Dark Project (Thief Gold) and continues pretty much right after the first game, give or take a month or two. One thing they really improved upon in this game is the level design. I didn't think they could make it any better but it's even more logical now rather than Maze-like. Thief Gold also had logical level design but some of the levels were more like Mazes than a real tangible place that you could believe existed. In this game it feels more grounded than the first and more tangible, you rob a Bank, Frame a City Watch guard, Tail an informant, Crash a party and rob the denizens of the City, and help a friend rescue his unrequited love. All of those things add up to an experience that permeates into something so immutably real that I almost forgot I was playing a damn game.Another thing that really helps you get immersed is Garrett himself, he now talks and comments on things way more frequently and has more character depth overall. Which in turn makes him even more likeable than he already was. Without spoiling anything there is one part where you break into some ladies home and Garrett just calmly says ""Don't mind me ladies, just passing through"" it really makes you feel like he is more than just a cypher for the player. Another real huge improvement is the inclusion of proper secrets in every mission. Most missions can have up to 8 or more secrets for you to find and they can be as simple as a short-cut or something really nice like some loot for you to plunder.  Con's: Once again there is not very many faults with this game but if there is one thing I didn't like as much as the first game it is the villain. He has a voice that sounds like a mixture of Cartman and Meatwad. Hard to feel intimidated by someone like that when I have that image in my head. He isn't a terribly written character and I really dig his motives and behaviour I just think a better voice could have gone a long way to make him seem badass. Maybe another complaint I can say is the final 3 missions are kind of ""Meh"" overall and the ending as a whole isn't as awesome as the first game.  Overall Feelings & Score: I feel like this game is not only just a worthy sequel to the first game but it is also a damn fine game in its own right. I give the game a $ out of *...make up your own mind and decide for yourself if you can enter...The Metal Age. Mind your P's and Q's because your balls, are, about to drop sirs and madams, peace the F out!			"

												What probably could have been an expansion pack serves as the second game in this franchise. The improvments are minor but helpful (invisibility and free fall potions and more dynamic mapping come to mind). Additionally some of the missions were more interesting this time around especially the kidnapping mission with it's moving objective (even though it was in a re-used map.) Alas the game seems to fall apart on the last few scenarios with a two-part misison that's unnecessairly redundant followed by a fairly unforgiving final level. Overall not bad but not a huge improvement over the first game either.			"

												Basically the same game with just a few improvements. First off, everything looks the EXACT same. Graphics have made no new improvements. The environments and textures are all the same. The health, detection system, even the weapons you use are the exact same with the same models for them. They did add some fun new items. Ai is better and doesn't always automatically know where you are. Sometimes the floor textures still make you automatically heard, but less often. The darkness works more like it should in this one and they don't automatically find you. The levels are better and aren't dumb supernatural like the first one. Same with the enemies. You don't sneak around zombies and devils which made no sense and somewhat ruined the last game. The developers did a good job in that regard listening to complaints. The levels are still basically the same. You get no help as where to go or what to do. From seeing walkthroughs I had to do things that are never explained and the game and I never would have thought to do. In one level you must find these random rubies laying on the ground and place them in these spaces to go through a portal to get further, only none of that was even mentioned. If I would have gotten to the place to put them without already having them I would have been screwed. You must find them hidden around a forest. It is poorly done. Also the levels are huge and have tons of ways to go and secrets but most of the space is meaningless and doesn't help the mission and seems only to increase playtime by having people wander around. The steam overlay still doesn't work but at least the cutscenes do. The story is convoluted and somewhat boring; overall ho-hum. I give it a 7/10 for nice additions but still somewhat amateur.			"

												After finishing System Shock 2 in 1999, The geniuses at Looking Glass Studios would set out to create a sequel to their most successful franchise. It would sadly be their last ever game as financial problems would see the studio close 2 months later.Thief 2 is everything you could possibly ask for in a sequel; tighter and much larger level design, deeper exploration of the characters, a tighter and a more coherent atmosphere and an enthralling story of an unlikely alliance solving a twisting and evolving mystery that threatens to destroy The City and beyond.Once again, Garrett is the unlikely hero of the tale. Stealing to survive and slinking through the shadows are a daily fact of life for him; Getting to the truth, whilst stopping to line his pockets along the way.You'll be exploring nobleman's estates, police stations, banks, cathedrals and even The Thieves' Highway. All the while, the atmosphere and storytelling will keep you on your toes and keep your mind sharp. The environments in Thief 2 are much bigger and much more detailed than the first game and gone are the vast majority of undead, haunted crypts and tombs the first game contained. You'll also have some new gear to play with in Thief 2; Slow-fall potions, expensive and rare invisibility potions, flash mines and 'The Eye', which I won't go into much detail about, as well as others.Thief 2 is also more challenging than the first game. Higher difficulty levels will, in some cases, require you to leave very little or, in one case, zero trace of your presence behind in one or two levels. This will require you to think ahead even more about what to expect; a tense but rewarding experience.This game the peak of the Thief series so far, the graphics are much improved over the first game and the story, whilst having a satisfying conclusion, left the door wide open for a Thief 3 that would never arrive from the studio that started it all.So Adiós Looking Glass. You created amazing experiences, stories and gameplay long before it was the norm in gaming as we know it today and even now, studios are still playing catchup to you.The game is very mod friendly. You can find texture packs and graphical upgrades out there. If you need help setting up the game, you can read this guide here:

												A stealth game that really likes to let you know you screwed up when you're caught snooping and sneaking. There's no teleport power to help you escape. There's no tranquilizer darts to stop the guy. No, when you're caught, you run. And the game relishes in the fact you screwed yourself over. And then you save scum so you won't be caught ever again.Dated by today's standards, Thief II really builds what Thief Gold built upon. The missions are more intelligently designed, you got more tools to play with now that Garret got a robot eye.It is everything a good sequel is supposed to be, that is, to build what the previous game provided.Also, I don't have to see Garret's hands everytime I grab coins, or pick locks, or open chests.

												One of the games that defined the Stealth Genre. Dear lord, this game was fantastic! It has suffered a little bit of wear and tear in the last few years, but stealth affecionados will love the gameplay and game mechanics. The difficulty ramps up rather abruptly near the end and the game DOES have it's fair share of bugs, but if you're resourceful you can download a patch or two. I'd probably recommend Deadly Shadows over this, but if you're a Thief fan, don't hesitate!			"

												Thief II is a steampunk stealth game.It's a Singleplayer only game. Release date: 21.03.2000Graphics:    6/10The graphics are ok for its release date. In comparison to the prequel it's only a slight improvement, but I think they could've made it a little bit better than they actually did. Like the prequel they managed to create an awesome atmosphere with the ""poor"" graphics and effects. One reason I just gave 6/10 is that most of the game looks 1:1 exactly the same likeThief Gold.Sound:     6/10The sounds are quite good and the voice actors are doing a great job. Some sounds are really annoying (robots for example). Like in Thief Gold there is nearly no music. I know it's not necessary, but I still miss it.Level design:     7/10The level design is just as good as in the prequel. You can search for secrets and have more than one way to reach your goal. The atmosphere is fitting and the levels are well structured.Except for one level, namely the last one. The last level is so frustrating. If you want to sneak the whole way through then you get detected the slow way. If you want to rush through you get detected fast. That is the only difference and the reason why I skipped the last level. And this last level degrades the Level design by 2 points: 9/10 => 7/10.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     8/10The good points: Like in the prequel you have a really nice arsenal for a thief. Plenty of arrowtypes, the flashbomb for your escape and so on. You still must get used to the controls but when you know how to play it you will like it. The playstyle remains pretty much like it was in the prequel. You sneak around, steal stuff, knock out enemies, etc..The bad point: No improvements at all.Enemies/AI:     6/10Well the guards search for you if you are too loud and act really authentic. But robots act totally random and I don't get the point why they made them so annoying. Sure it's no problem to disable them but still I don't like the idea of them. They didn't improve the AI from Thief Gold to Thief 2 so I just give 6/10.Story:     4/10Maybe it's just me but I don't like the story. It's boring and I miss the ""magical"" part of it. The target is a guy who wants to kill people with poison and created robots to protect himself. I don't even know how to make it sound better.Critic summary:     6,2/10Personal fun rating:     7/10     [good game]All in all a good game, but the developers didn't make real improvements. I recommend the game if you played Thief Gold, otherwise I don't. Since the game isn't very expensive: Give it a try.			"

												I'm biased because I played this game when it originally came out, long ago. The graphics are dated, the character models probably have less geometry than your cell phone icons, and there isn't any experience or upgrades to customize your character.However, the sound is absolutely fantastic. The levels are large and varied, where you can truly choose your own way. Do you sneak through the kitchen, knocking out the help before you explore upstairs, or use a rope arrow to bypass that area entirely, with the possibility a servant may come upstairs and spot you?You cannot Rambo your way through; this is stealth done right, and if you don't believe me lookup the history of the game, and how fans created patches and numerous missions, and how many still play today.If you can get past the dated graphics, you just might love this gem of a title. Three and four look better, but without the freedom (you can have some choice in paths,  but it's limited to context-sensitive spots and far too linear).			"

												If you can get past the very aged visuals and bad voice acting, Thief 2 is a very immersive stealth game, and honestly the best 3D stealth game out there. Huge open environments make for incredibly organic gameplay with hundreds of possible routes and strategies, and the AI works well with the good level design (which also makes the maps look and feel like places real people live in, rather than a world designed for a video game).9/10, one of my favorites.

												How does one rave about one of their all time favorite games without sounding like a raving lunatic?Look, there are 4 (sorta) Thief games.  If each of them gets 10 points (so a total of 40) and you break it up here's the ranking:Theif II: The Metal Age 50/10Thief: The Dark Project (Gold) 10/10Thief: Deadly Shadows 5/10Thief -25/10But that includes 3 stories for another time.I do have to mention Dark Project/Gold briefly since Thief II would not exist without it.  It really is a fine game in its own right, the best Stealth Game up to that point.  However, it still relies too much on combat (and those damnable undead). The story, however, is worth it.  Which leads to Thief II -- apparently Looking Glass Studios realized that the combat was the least favorite aspect of the game and made it so you can avoid it entirely in Thief II (if you choose).  You may get seen and want to fight your way out (or have to I suppose) and you are not entirely without resources.  However, you CAN get through it without ever swinging your blade.  That, in conjunction with the story, propelled Theif II to the top of the stealth charts for me.Do not look for visuals that have withstood the test of time.  They are dated, but they are sufficient if you aren't a snob, and the aesthetic works perfectly.  Do not look for this if you want to run and gun through levels putting arrows into the eye sockets of every guard you see while simultaneously slicing and dicing others who happen to get to close.DO look for an amazing stealth game with a solid story that builds from at first trying to scratch out a living to getting embroiled in events beyond your control.  DO look for secret rooms, safes, stashed of loot.  DO be patient and learn the guard's patterns.  But mostly -- DO PICK UP Thief II: The Metal Age (especially during this stealth game sale!).One last thing -- DO NOT pick up Thief (the reboot) as it has in common with the true Thief games only the title and the name of the protagonist.  They are as different as having a fire and being on fire.			"

												Not as fantastic as it's prequel - they say Thief 1 had it's plot laid out first and the levels built around them and vice versa here. Sadly it shows, while the levels are for the most part more complex and more rewarding with repeated play-throughs the tale of Garret the Thief doesn't hold as much weight here. Often levels feel tacked on in a way they didn't in the original and while it's still an excellent game it fails only at topping the heights of it's predecessor.			"

												This game is legendary, and for a good reason. I missed it when it originally came out and played it first 6 or 7 years ago. Despite numerous efforts to bring stealth back into games they just can't get it right. This game has it all and some more, and it's really one of a kind. This game is extremely immersive, unique and something you'll remember if you played it once. Much like many classics from the same age you just keep coming back to play it again. I bought this on Steam despite having the original CD because it's easier to play it this way, and with the new updated texture packs and patches it actually looks pretty nice too.			"

												Of the Thief games this is my favorite.  I will always love thief 1 yet 2 has several improvements.  The main story while not as stronge as Thief 1 it deffinitly expands the Thief universe greatly.  Characters feel more real.  The player thinks more in broad sence about ""The City"" and those that inhabit it.  Aditionaly the community makes way more Fan Missions for Thief 2 then Thief 1.  This is due to the many improvements made to the engine as stated before.  So I a player finishes the game and wants more they can have it.			"

												The graphics for this game may not be as spectacular compared to other stealth games like Metal Gear Solid but the gameplay more than makes up for that.Taking place in a Victorian steam punk era with limited amounts of magic, you have to rely on quick wit and your arsenal to advance in the game.  Two guards block a doorway you need to enter through.  You could carefully sneak through the dark and bypass them, you could use an arrow to make a sound, drawing them away, or find a hidden passage in the wall to sneak behind them.  This is what makes the game so great, you have options you can use and not keep things so linear.The difficulty also makes the game great.  There is no indicater of any kind to tell you there is a guard on the other side of the wall.  You have to use your ears to listen to footsteps, occasionally whistling, and eyes to see if that guard is carrying a key to unlock a door with.One of the cons I can say about the game is the controls at times can be a little frustrating to deal with.  Sometimes you want to climb up a short wall, quietly, only to have Garrett not only miss grabbing the wall, he may make some noise too, alerting the guards.  I had a similar problem with ladders, with him not dismounting from the well.The cut scenes are kept short and in between each mission.  Most of the story is told from reading parchments, books, and listening to game characters talk amongst themselves.If you're looking for a stealth game that IS superior to most other stealth games, like Metal Gear, I would highly recommend this game ot			"

												A more difficult game than the first one, mainly due to the story-based shift in how setting is approached and the less linear levels. Supernatural enemies are traded out for mechanical ones which have easier to understand AI. Though the shift to a more industrialized setting gives the impression that there'd be more repetition in visual design don't be fooled. Maps are more detailed than in the first game. New items are introduced, filling a variety of roles that provide for more freedom of gameplay. Also female guards! You wouldn't think it but this adds a surprising amount to guard interactions and I really can't think of any negative outcomes of it.You absolutely owe it to yourself to play this and Thief Gold, if you've played one without the other you're missing out of the the definitive Thief experience.

												Don't let the slightly dated and clunky graphics fool you, Theif 2 The Metal Age is a cracking adventure.

There are new variations to missions and different challanges that make a more well rounded experience. New Enemies to circumnavigate and incapacitate. The World feels bigger and more imersive, and the story with a well developed villian interesting twists and suprising character reveals is pure geniusThere are some little flaws with the game, but that might be down to my skill as a player or the age of the game. The Watchers and Children of Karras do feel a lot like the undead from Theif 1 and the Bank mission does frustrate due to the material of the floor.But these are little details, Thief 2 is a must buy for any stealth game fan and a reminder as to why the Thief series are the best in the genre.

												This is the original of deep stealth games with the most immersive world and badass protagonist. You use light, sound and skill to reach your objectives in any number of ways, none of that ""mash button to hide on this linear path"" simplification here. You can choose your method of completion...whether it be hack everything with your sword (good luck with that) or by becoming the ultimate shadow master (i.e. you can set your difficulty to hard if you want to be punished for knocking anyone out).This game has been my favorite since its release, replaying it almost yearly because it is that good and there's just no satisfying that stealth itch quite the same way in other games (except perhaps in Dishonored, though that involves more magic). Truly though, this game is what helped me discover my love for games and the stealth genre. Despite old school graphics, the game holds up extremely well. The mechanics are strong, the level and sound design are gorgeous, and the story is good too.Just buy it, Taffer! I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Thief 2: TMA is everything a sequel should be, and more! Though  it doesn't have the same 'horror' element that the first game had, it's still very atmospheric with an incredible ambience that will suck you in to its dark, treacherous world and it won't let go until Karras closes the doors to Soulforge, forever sealing his fate! (yeah, more on Soulforge later).All of the original Thief gameplay mechanics are still in place w/ added features: the stealth is in full effect with deeply complex missions and large maps that allow for multiple routes to completing objectives, all the sexy arrow types you loved from the first game are back (now with vine arrows), all of your original gadgets are back (now with scouting orbs, and in rare cases explosive devices), there are new enemy types (most notably female soldiers) and of course a new antagonist (alas, Constantine is no more, but Karras is easily just as much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as he was, so it's cool, and there's even a ghost pirate at one point if you can find him and his glorious pirate booty....um....let me rephrase that, I mean his treasure).  Oh, and I almost forgot one of the coolest upgrades, the cinematics between missions (some play out like storyboard drawings but others are actual cinematics and there's sorta one when you die too, but obviously that's not as cool as the others).Now back to the final mission, Sabotage at Soulforge, Karras' stronhold, his HQ, the locus of his nefarious activities, yeah you get the point.  Being a final mission you'd expect some level of challenge and complexity and Soulforge certainly doesn't disappoint. But seriously, this mission for me was so vast and complex that I spent nearly a quarter of my total game time wandering its darkened corridors with like negative 5 hitpoints at some points, all while trying to figure out where I should go next and how not to get killed by Karras' mechanoid creations. After finally beating this mission, I almost felt like I couldn't recall an earlier point in the game but Soulforge.  It was as though the entire game took place in this one hub-like area.  Mentally, I was nearly defeated by this final quest but I persevered in the end and so Karras can suck it!If you like Thief you'll love this one just as much, if not more so.  Get it on sale when you can but as far as classics go, it's a must own even if you have to pay the full price and there is so much depth and challenge that you'll be glad you made the purchase in the end.

												I left it feeling ... blasé? I would still recommend several of the missions. Shipping and Recieving, Framed, Trace the Courier, and Trail of Blood I remember fondly. Life of the Party, Masks, and Running Interference were good as well, but I remember my frustration first and their positive traits second. When I think of Thief:TMA, I think of being aggravated that I can't move around. This was something that happened in Thief:TDP, but in that game, it wasn't a problem. Not only were there breathers were I could sprint across open grass, or swim in relative safety, but also I was immersed and excited by the locations and the many many hidden secrets and background I was constantly happening across.     ""I wandered around lost and unsure a lot, but there was nothing that was unenjoyable about doing that. The game encourages you to do so, and there is a lot to discover (and steal) while you unlock the greater picture of the mission. I played slowly and patiently, but I missed a lot of content and could easily play it again for a new experience."" I don't feel the same way about TMA. There are a lot of reasons for that.I don't like metal floors constantly placing me in danger of being heard. I don't like more guards and cameras everywhere. I don't like metal and concrete factories as settings to explore. I don't like the notes and conversations by normal goons about normal grounded things. I don't like having no ""free range"" areas. I don't remember enjoying the stories or notes and background. I don't remember finding many hidden objects or spots I didn't expect to be able to access. It all feels a lot more empty and a lot more tedious. But compared against other games? Well, it's old, ugly, clunky and slow paced. The controls are broken and awkward. I remember being frustrated more than anything else. Stilllll.....In the end, I would recommend it. For one, I might have simply been tired of this type gameplay by the time I finished it. I know the thrilling feeling of mastery from T:TDP would come from this game's mechanics as well. It is a well balanced game with a story and setting that is unique and palpable. There are many routes, tactics, and styles of facing obstacles. And, in the end, there are few things better than being Garrett in a dark corner of a huge complex; rifling through every corner, filling my pockets full of gold, and my head full of knowledge that is very much not supposed to belong to me.

												Can't say really whether the game is good or not. The brightness in game is so dark that it's literally unplayable. There's a ""gamma"" option in the config but it's non-functional. I know there's a patch to fix this, but I installed it and the game wouldn't run after that, so I'm giving up.			"

												The game contains the same thrills and challenges of the first volume, it is not a bad game by any means. This is a negative review because all the technology showcased whithin the game world felt too anachronistic to me. Expect to find turrets, robots and surveillance cameras! I loved the first game in the series because of its medieval setting; you had to rob manors, tombs, churches, graveyards and prisons with a few zombies thrown in the mix. Now this second game is trying to be Deus Ex! I understand all the tech is supposed to be steampunk, but it just doesn't do it for me, it´s like Deus Ex retextured as a steampunkish world.			"

												Had serious potential to be a fun game, but unfortunetly, this game is way too dark. Like, really, really dark. In the first mission (first mission!), the game forces you to play pin the tail on the ♥♥♥♥ing donkey in the very first hallway you ever encounter, and many, MANY hallways after that. This is extremely tedious and completly uncessessary. There's not even a brightness option! There's a gamma option, but that changes absolutely nothing. I was going to look past this and just continue to play with a blindfold on, but then I got word of a ""patch"". Well, I downloaded this so called ""patch"", but it didn't do much of anything except allow much better resolution options and slightly better audio. GG. All of this could've been avoided if the developers spent five minutes adding a brightness option, or hell, giving the player a lighter or something. There are glowsticks, but they last a grand total of ten seconds. Pathetic.On top of that, very little has changed from the first game (Thief: Gold). The AI are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the voice acting is just as awful, the combat is still like fighting a wall that screams ""Agh!"" when you hit it... this game is white hot garbage.			"

												I don't often write reviews, only under the circumstance whether the game was incredibly enjoyable, or so terrible you'd rather pull your own teeth. This game had me pulling all the newly found gray hairs out of my head, and I was so disappointed. I wish I had the same experience as the other players who write, ""this was one of the best games I've ever played"", but I didn't and I can't fake that I did. It had some shining moments, but were vastly overshadowed (literally) by certain other gameplay characteristics. I feel like I could gripe forever about it but I'll keep it short (I'll try). I did play Thief Gold and enjoyed it a lot. While there were some things I wasn't a fan of, I was able to get over them and still really enjoy the game. Hoping for the same experience in Thief II, I was let down. My biggest gripe of the game, which sounds silly until you play it, is the game is SO. MOTHER. EFFING. DARK. This alone, ruined the game for me. There are 3 or 4 missions I know off the top of my head that I played for 4-5 hours EACH and still couldn't complete the level, only to consult a guide, and only to find out there is a door or ladder or key or something that would advance me in the level. And what held me back from finding it was that it was hidden in the darkest, most pitch black area of a random room. I can't harp on it enough, no matter how much I adjusted the gamma option, or my brightness on my monitor, it never improved. Again sounds silly, but I was physically incapable of finding these things because of it being so dark. The first game was dark too, but not to the extent to where you actually can't see what's ahead of you. There are flares added to the game, but they really don't offer much help. It brightens things up about 1 foot around you, and then disappears after 10 seconds or so.There are other things that bother me about this game, but that is the main one. I almost feel like that if that one thing didn't affect me so much, I'd be able to look past the other things like I did in the first game. I was so determined to beat this game and just completely remove it from my computer. To be stuck in a level for 4-5 hours only to find out that you need to walk through a door in a room you've been in several times already, is something I never want in a game again. Missions like Kidnapped, Casing the Joint, and the final Sabotage at Soulforge, are the bane of my existence in this game. If you buy it, I just hope you have a better experience than I did.			"

												The master thief of the first Thief game is back and with somewhat improved graphics and new tools to play with. The story picks up some time after the first game and is packed with a new story and cast of enemies and allies, with familiar faces from the first game making a come-back. The game possesses significantly less ""adventure fantasy"" elements than the first game although they are not entirely gone. This was actually the first game of the series I played and though its story is more or less able to stand alone, it is even better when you have played the first beforehand. Included in a relatively cheap bundle with the first game this game is a gem at a bargain of a price.			"

												Almost certainly the best entry in the Stealth genre to date (despite it being 13 years now), Thief II: The Metal Age is incredibly in depth with it's sneaking mechanics, has a great story, and is very fun if you're the sort of person who enjoys sneakan' around and♥♥♥♥♥♥The gameplay is amazing, the stealth mechanics actually work really well (unlike most ""stealth"" games recently), objectives are both fun and challengine, there are tons of secrets on every level, your character isn't a complete jerkoff,  and even the graphics aren't bad considering it was made in ♥♥♥♥ing 2000.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys stealth games, as it is most certainly  the best representation of the stealth experience.

												In 1998 Thief 2 stole a position of my personal list of best games ever. And never gave it back! Looking Glass took the revolutionary concept of the the first installation and brought it to perfection. Thief 2 gives you a lot of options, big levels and lets the player freely find his own way to the goal. The game is more about problem solving then it is combat. Who things power fantasy has to be about killing and murdering, never tried to get around one guard without getting seen or even noticed. Be smart, be observant, be quiet and become a master thief.The game of course suffers of its old age. All the objects consist of only a few polygons, there aren't complex lighting and shading systems at work (which is a shame for a game about shadows) and the environment can look empty or sterile at times. But it isn't unplayable either. If you get use to the graphics, Thief 2 shines with a very interesting world of little stories, fantastic level-design and impressive sound-design. Thief 2 is still the stealth-game in gaming-history. "

												A good sequel to a great game. Larger areas are introduced and the steampunk setting is more emphasized this time due to the story. A faction of fanatics who worship machines as gods are the main antogonists and it shows. Mechanical enemies are added in the enemy roster. You still break in places and rob people to achieve your goals like in the first game while fullfilling prophecies.After you finished playing the first game and loving it, you have got to play this one right afterwards.

												One of the better stealth games I've played recently, and look at what they achieved at the time it was developed. I had a difficult time trying to follow along with the story in this game, I suppose the ""world"" it's set in doesn't make much sense to me. Not to say that it's bad, the story and dialogue is actually one of the strong points. The weak points were in the controls and I suppose some of the stealth mechanics. Jumping was far more difficult than it should have been, as well as climbing. I'll give stealth mechanics a bit of slack though since even top developers today still can't get it right. It does make for some hilarious bugs at times though!Note: I never played any of the Thief series as a kid. I recall getting one of them with a video card I bought way back when though I had no interest in the game at the time. So I suppose you could say this review isn't biased by nostalgia. I would highly recommend installing the TafferPatcher mod for this game as it completely overhauls the textures and some of the rendering engine.			"

												The first Thief game was a really good game. It was fun and everything. Though, at some parts, it did get a bit repetative and unfair. But Thief 2: The Metal Age, is FANTASTIC! In this entry in Thief series, you actually feel like a real thief. Also, it seems that the developers of the game focused more on the stealth, than the enemies because in the first Thief, there were some parts that were just too damn hard. But basically all tey did with this entry, is focus on the stealth, and it's AMAZING! I would recommend this game to any fan of Dishonered and the new 2014 game Thief (Though I must say that the new Thief game is a little different than the first three entries in the series).			"

												Levels are complex enough, there are many details like papyrus texts, nice dialogues and brilliant gameplay features. I couldn't get into its story and atmosphere because of steampunk elements but you might like that. Graphics are outdated but no matter.The game has really dark places. You should make a gamma adjustment because after a while your eyes getting tired.There is also some silly things like sounds. You can't turn off music. The proper solution: You should carefully edit a file named ""snd.crf""... Basic solution: Turn off ambient sounds totally from options menu (that also removes sounds of birds, insects, wind and something like that). The other thing is some sounds are really disturbing and repetitive.Don't hesitate and buy if you love stealth. But steampunk atmosphere would ruin your gaming desire if you seek medieval times.			"

												One of my favourite ever games. You play a master thief called 'Garret'. A sardonic and witty character whos stealthy prowess is legend. I love this game and another Warren Spector game called Deus Ex. Both are marellous but in different ways. This game makes sure your always outnumbered and outgunned so combat almost always leads to your doom which makes the game far more intense. Each footfall could alert a guard and shadows become your friend. I recommend this as one of the best stealth games ever made. ""praise be to karas, blessed are thine welded""			"

												If you thought Thief Gold was pretty good, then you'll think Thief II is incredible.The Metal Age is stealth game perfection. Even though a lot of the stealth mechanics don't make much sense, such as a guard not being able to see you should you be standing inches away from them if you're in a dark spot of a brightly lit room, everything about this game is FUN. You'll spend about 40-60 minutes in each level, and that's if you're ignoring picking up all of the loot that's scattered around.The story, in comparison to the original Thief, is very well written and intriguing. The plot in the original had you fighting zombies and tomb raiding, while in this game, the focus is on the transition from a dark ages fantasy game to ""The Metal Age"". You don't feel so much like a spelunking knight with a sword and bow and arrow, but an actual thief, taking on bank heists and even sneaking through a medieval police station and stealing from the evidence vault. The screenshots displayed on the Store Page really don't do the game justice. For a game from 2000 the graphics have aged tremendously, and the lighting and texture work look fantastic to this day. My favorite level is the bank, just because of how spectacular the green tiled floors, wooden walkways, and red carpeted offices look. Not only do the levels look incredible, but they have some pretty great layouts and the level design is ingenious, inventive and sprawling. After replaying the bank mission so many times I've found six different ways to enter the building, and there are so many different routes you can take to get to the vault without being spotted it's insane. From crawling through a vent and dropping down into the offices adjacent to the vault room, shutting down the mechanical faces (which act as cameras hanging from the ceiling and spinning around trying to spot you) by flipping a switch on the third floor and going through the teller gates, or going through the lions den and using a rope arrow attached to the ceiling to cross the Guard's Room and into the backdoor of the vault room. I also love that each section of the immensely huge levels has a little nugget of dialogue to be heard that are entertaining to listen to and informative. The voice acting isn't great, but I always ended up quicksaving each time I heard a guard speaking with another guard so I could hear the full thing and then quickload so I didn't lose any time. What is really well done however is Garret talking to himself, usually stating the obvious but it helps players stay on track when he explains something to himself the player might not already realize. His little quips and things he says never get old, even after you've played the same level three or four times.In conclusion, this is an outstanding gem of a game that you would be doing yourself a disservice not to play.

The stealth genre is the only thing where this doesn\'t seem to be the case. Not to say that there aren\'t good modern day stealth games, of course there are. However, as of right now, none of them have seemed to surpass Thief 2, just offer and equally good experience, despite Thief\'s age. I won\'t go crazy on this review, but here is an example. Hitman is a stealth game of sorts, and as most games do, it discourages you from killing bad guys. The less bodies the better. How does it do this? With points, a negative effect on your over all proformance review, just some numbers on the screen. And thats all fine and dandy. But what about Thief. Thief is entirely organic, as it encourages you to be as stealthy as possible in a totally realistic way, that is much more planned out, while avoiding the whole issue of pulling you out of the experience, reminding you that \""this is just a game\"".   If you encounter a guard, you could try to sneak around him. One small mistake could get you killed though, so why not knock him out? You could, but then you have to worry about the body, which if not well hiden enough, could ruin everything. Meanwhile, killing him would be even worse, since that would not only make a body, but also a blood stain, which would require a water arrow to clean. This natural progressing of actions and consequences encourages you to play with as little encounters as possible, instead guiding you to learn to sneak past guards without ever interacting with them in the first place, being the ultimate ninja. But this doesn\'t feel gamey, and doesn\'t feel arbitrary or tedious. This is just one of the many reasons why Thief 2 still stands up as a great stealth game. Buy it, then download tafferpatcher, a program which helps the game run on modern computers. Don\'t worry, it is stupid easy, just download the file, and launch the executable, it takes all of 30 seconds. Plus, there are thousands of fan made levels which the community has made, providing hours of gameplay beyond the base game, so have fun!			"

												For Thief II, you could mostly just take my Thief Gold review, and then copy/paste all of the pros overtop of all of the cons. Thief II plays mostly the same as Thief Gold. Same graphics, same controls, same first-person view. What they did change, however, makes all the difference.Thief Gold had a number of really fun missions featuring Garrett prowling around a house or opera hall or what-have-you, knocking out guards and discovering secret passages, and those were great. But it spent just as much time knee deep in zombies, apemen, giant bugs, bugmen, ghosts, confusing labyrinths, caves, and situations where you almost HAVE to fight your way out if you're not super-great at the game.For Thief II, the devs looked at what players did and did not enjoy, and they made a game that is better in almost all respects. Save for a single Thief Gold-esque level with some apemen (which is rather forgiving compared to TG, and a fascinating level overall), there are only maybe a couple of any particular monster, and most of them are avoidable. The only new monster type I can recall gave me the biggest (and most enjoyable) fright of anything in either game. The majority of levels take place in sane man-made structures; homes, a bank, a surprisingly modern police station, and a few missions taking place across entire sections of The City. Thus the game now flows better, being less of a half-forced monster combat game, and more about sneaking around, bludgeoning unsuspecting jerks, and looting every last inch of each level.As a result of the titular Metal Age, Thief II also now includes cameras, robots, turrets,  and a selection of new tools at your disposal, such as mines and flares - the latter of which you will absolutely need, as some parts of the game can be far too dark to move around in. It's possible this is an issue on my end, or it may just be part of the game. If it's the game itself, it is one of the very few problems introduced with this installment.Also introduced, however, is a map. Though not always very helpful, it is often an invaluable tool, showing varied degrees of detail depending on the level and keeping track of where you've been and where you currently are.While the final level is complicated and confusing, most of the rest of the game is a blast. One particular element of note is the interesting play on the penultimate levels of Thief Gold. Where in TG, the three levels leading up to the final one were repeat visits to locations you had already been in previous levels, in T2 the fourth-to-last level is ALSO a repeat visit to a location you had already been in Thief Gold, now taken over by the Mechanists. The next-to-last mission is, in fact, the same location as the third-to-last mission, which somehow manages to stay fresh and fun through both levels.In the end, I heavily recommend Thief II if you enjoy stealth games. If you played Thief Gold but only sometimes liked it, I ask that you give Thief II a try instead, as it has ironed out most of the kinks. The only other thing I would like to note is that, like TFix for TG, Thief II is at its best when Tafferpatcher (a fan-made patch which improves resolution, textures, compatibility, etc.) has been applied.Now get thieving, you dirty taffer.

												Thief 2 is one of the best games you can buy on Steam.Very atmospheric, it was way ahead of it's time.Make sure to get DarkLoader. This will enable you to easily download and install thousands of fan missions, some of which are better than the original . Thief 2 realesed in 2000 by Looking Glass Studios originally based in Lexington Massachusetts, in 1994 the company moved to Cambridge. A significant number of Looking Glass personnel were MIT graduates. After the company folded, people from Looking Glass went on to work at Ion Storm, Irrational Games, Harmonix, Mad Doc Software, Arkane Studios, Westwood Studios, Valve, and to found Floodgate Entertainment and Digital Eel, amongst other later studios.

												The crowning jewel of Looking Glass that set the standards to which all games should achieve to be.Thief 2 does everything a sequel should do, it continues the story, expands the characters and does interfere with the controls and mechanics which made the Dark Project work so well. I would personally say that this game comes close to being near perfect with no major flaws when it comes to the story or design of the game. The only criticism I can find at all is that the despite having come out two years after the original THIEF; Looking Glass chose to make little to no improvements in the graphics of the game itself, while it is true that graphics alone do not make the game alone, myself and possibly others share this lack of improvement as being one of the games only minor faults. The addition of smaller items such as the free fall potion and spy orbs also feels out of place and ultimately fails to enhance the gameplay beyond being a minor novelty.			"

												After having survived his encounter with an ancient Pagan god, the Master Thief Garrett is pulled into events that threaten to undo civilisation itself.  A new order is on the march, their footsteps suffused by the clicks and whirring of mechanical horrors, and a corrupt Sheriff spreads fear throughout the City.  The Metal Age is upon us...Possibly one of the most brilliant games to have graced the PC, Thief II: The Metal Age contains everything that was great about Thief Gold, while removing the stuff that wasn't so great.Missions are more focused, as is the story, and the enemies will make you want to scurry into the nearest shadows.  The high point of the original Thief trilogy, Thief II: The Metal Age is to be counted as essential gaming for any PC users.			"

												Similar to it's prequel except most of the atmosphere is gone in replace of tighter level design. These levels allow for more interaction as each level gameplay-wise plays differently. However, most of the settings feel mundane and are forgettable. Brilliant story telling. Not much more to say.  I like it, it's a nice addition to the Thief series if you want more levels after the first.			"

Also, it seems that the developers of the game focused more on the stealth, than the enemies because in the first Thief, there were some parts that were just too damn hard. But basically all tey did with this entry, is focus on the stealth, and it's AMAZING! I would recommend this game to any fan of Dishonered and the new 2014 game Thief (Though I must say that the new Thief game is a little different than the first three entries in the series).			"

												Honestly, this is the best stealth game to ever exist. I waited for this game to come out in 2000 and never played a stealth game that compared. Thief 3 and THIEF (the newest one) just don't really compare in the sense of being in-depth and realistic. With the Steam downloadable version, I was able to play it for the first time in about 10 years. I was so surprised that the graphics were pretty damn good. I love this game because it's a phenomenally made puzzle. Calculating the movements of many different guards and creating long-range stealth plans throughout these amazing and realistically dark levels. Some of the other reviewers may cry about how dark the game is, but they just are too dumb to play the game. It gives you all you need to get around the dark and you just need to figure it out: (SPOILER): you have a compass and you have a map that is very vague but gives you the layout of the rooms most of the time...you can use both the compass and the map during the times in which you cannot see to navigate rooms. This game gets a 10/10 easily from me. It has been on my ""Top 3"" list for 15 years now. I'm a pretty big dork and have put a ton of time into that top 3. (BTW it's 1. Arma 2/3 2. Thief 2 3. FF7)			"

												Thief 2 is a beautifully organic, absorbing game. The stealth gameplay is challenging without being frustrating (since it is possible to fight your way out of an encounter with an alerted guard) and the levels are wonderfully big, encouraging exploration and rewarding it. The story is dark without being stereotypically gritty and is therefore engaging. Best of all though, is the dialogue writing. Witty quips from the cynical, money centric loner master thief Garrett go hand in hand with the hilarious dialogue of the dullard rent a cops that must be overcome. There is no greater pleasure in this game then sitting in the shadows half a nose hair away from two thicko guards talking about those mekk- mekka- mekkan- mekkanical  eyes wot the sheriff introduced. So then. If that all sounds appealing to you, then scurry off and buy it you camel mannered tunic wearing molly cuddles! If ya don't, an arrow in the throat ought to shut you up!			"

I had heard the praise and my choices were limited so I installed it.  Two days later I considered this to be one of the finest and most influential  games ever made. A cool story, outstanding game play and some of the best level design you'll come across. The levels aren't just well designed but they are HUGE. Yes, this game is ugly.  The textures and models may take some players out of it. (there is a nice texture mod possibly coming out this year)  But give it a shot and play the first couple of levels and see if you don't enjoy stepping in the shoes of Garrett for a minute. And if you enjoyed this I highly recommend finding the T2X Shadows of the Metal Age total conversion mod. Outstanding in it's own right.  RIP Looking Glass Studios.			"

Then you discover the brilliant fan-made missions and mods, the game takes on a life (lives) of its own.			"

												This game is a pure classic. Graphics are bad even for the time and you will need a third party program to run in HD mode as it only supports 4:3. also no xbox controller so you will need a third part program such as Xpadder to run but if you can get past that it is worth the effort. The story is great the level design is immersive and well thought out. Finnaly do not play this game if you don't like old style 3d graphics.			"

												Almost certainly the best entry in the Stealth genre to date (despite it being 13 years now), Thief II: The Metal Age is incredibly in depth with it's sneaking mechanics, has a great story, and is very fun if you're the sort of person who enjoys sneakan' around and♥♥♥♥♥♥The gameplay is amazing, the stealth mechanics actually work really well (unlike most ""stealth"" games recently), objectives are both fun and challengine, there are tons of secrets on every level, your character isn't a complete jerkoff,  and even the graphics aren't bad considering it was made in ♥♥♥♥ing 2000.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys stealth games, as it is most certainly  the best representation of the stealth experience.

												One of the better stealth games I've played recently, and look at what they achieved at the time it was developed. I had a difficult time trying to follow along with the story in this game, I suppose the ""world"" it's set in doesn't make much sense to me. Not to say that it's bad, the story and dialogue is actually one of the strong points. The weak points were in the controls and I suppose some of the stealth mechanics. Jumping was far more difficult than it should have been, as well as climbing. I'll give stealth mechanics a bit of slack though since even top developers today still can't get it right. It does make for some hilarious bugs at times though!Note: I never played any of the Thief series as a kid. I recall getting one of them with a video card I bought way back when though I had no interest in the game at the time. So I suppose you could say this review isn't biased by nostalgia. I would highly recommend installing the TafferPatcher mod for this game as it completely overhauls the textures and some of the rendering engine.			"

												Outstanding. A must-play.All modern stealth games trace their heritage to Thief, and for good reason. This game shines through its dated graphics. The gameplay is still gripping. The world the game is set in is captivating - totally unexpected, un-necessary, and delightful. Thief 2 vastly improves on its predecessor's poor level design which, I think, is really the only thing that holds Thief 1 back.I've already bought this game in a bargain bin and finished it, but bought it again on here. It's worth it.Highly recommended, particularly if you're a fan of stealth games.			"

												One day my video card blew up so I had to resort to my backup which could barely play anything.  It could, however, play Thief 2.  I had heard the praise and my choices were limited so I installed it.  Two days later I considered this to be one of the finest and most influential  games ever made. A cool story, outstanding game play and some of the best level design you'll come across. The levels aren't just well designed but they are HUGE. Yes, this game is ugly.  The textures and models may take some players out of it. (there is a nice texture mod possibly coming out this year)  But give it a shot and play the first couple of levels and see if you don't enjoy stepping in the shoes of Garrett for a minute. And if you enjoyed this I highly recommend finding the T2X Shadows of the Metal Age total conversion mod. Outstanding in it's own right.  RIP Looking Glass Studios.			"

												Thief 2: The Metal Age stands as a perfect example of taking a concept that already exists and improving upon ever facet of it's overall structure and execution.This sequel to the rather popular Thief: The Dark Project takes what made the first game so great,removed all the cave/ruin spelunking,took the idea of being a thief with a task in which there are multiple ways to deal with that task and moved it to the next level in terms of game design.Garret returns for the sequel being the titular thief of the series.Much like the first game's plot,it starts out slow,with Garret carrying out tasks for various people and trying to keep his landlord from banging down his door,all with the use of his variety of ''skills'',this allows for what made the first game great,breaking into places you shouldn't be and taking things you shouldn't own,however,the plot quickly gets to the main agenda and you will begin to carry out jobs that carry more weight than a purse of gold,with implications for the rest of the world and it's fate.Speaking of breaking into places,the level design in this game is among the best I have ever had the joy of experiencing,the now defunct Looking Glass Studios create vast and richly detailed environments for you to explore and plunder,ranging from a large warehouse complex to a collosal tower owned by the fanatical Mechanists,each of these levels were clearly designed with a painstaking amount of effort and it shows with every secret to find and location to explore,never has a game provided the same thrill of being a thief than this game.Despite it's admittedly noticable age,this game still manages to provide a experience that few other games have been able to parallel and it remains a contender for my favourite video game of all time.If you are in anyway a fan of stealth games,you owe it to yourself to experience this masterpiece,be wary though,as you may find your heart has been stolen within the first few levels of loot-filled glory.

												My Thief Gold review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/recommended/211600Thief II: The Metal Age is Thief Gold with minor gameplay diferences, as instead of monsters you now have cameras and bots. The rest is still there, and it's still great, though the last 4 missions decline a bit in quality, and the last mission is way too big and feels like filler right before the end, even though it was a considerable challenge. Still, before that there are some great missions, some on the level of Gold's best, making this overall only slightly inferior to Gold/The Dark Project. Amazing game.			"

												The greatest stealth game ever, and one of the best games of all time. Unique and dark setting, mature story, fantastic gameplay mechanics, dry and witty humour, the best player character ever, social commentary on religon and technological advancement, disturbing subplots of brainwashed robot beggars, and so much more. Graphics aren't amazing technically, but the mix of gothic, steampunk, art deco, and medieval styles and architecture more than make up for it visually. If you're so obssesed with resolutions and the rest, download a 1080p patcher to fix this. Besides, the technical stuff is simply a speck on a brilliant masterpiece of a game. Also, after you've finished the main game, be sure to play the unofficial expansion, Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age, as well as over 600 different fan missions to further immerse yourself in this incredible world, made by a still dedicated community (check ttlg forums or the thief wiki for them).

This will enable you to easily download and install thousands of fan missions, some of which are better than the original . Thief 2 realesed in 2000 by Looking Glass Studios originally based in Lexington Massachusetts, in 1994 the company moved to Cambridge. A significant number of Looking Glass personnel were MIT graduates. After the company folded, people from Looking Glass went on to work at Ion Storm, Irrational Games, Harmonix, Mad Doc Software, Arkane Studios, Westwood Studios, Valve, and to found Floodgate Entertainment and Digital Eel, amongst other later studios.

A faction of fanatics who worship machines as gods are the main antogonists and it shows. Mechanical enemies are added in the enemy roster. You still break in places and rob people to achieve your goals like in the first game while fullfilling prophecies.After you finished playing the first game and loving it, you have got to play this one right afterwards.

												One of my favourite ever games. You play a master thief called 'Garret'. A sardonic and witty character whos stealthy prowess is legend. I love this game and another Warren Spector game called Deus Ex. Both are marellous but in different ways. This game makes sure your always outnumbered and outgunned so combat almost always leads to your doom which makes the game far more intense. Each footfall could alert a guard and shadows become your friend. I recommend this as one of the best stealth games ever made. ""praise be to karas, blessed are thine welded""			"

												Honestly guys, this is the best stealth game I have ever played.  It is very difficult, regardless of which difficulty you pick.  This is a game where finding yourself in a combat situation is a great way to get killed fast, even if only against one enemy.  Harder difficulties will see that you minimize casualties, some of which will require you not to kill or knock out anybody.  There is a reason that virtually every game with stealth elements since the Thief games has picked up a thing or two from it.  Not to mention the quality of the story and writing.  This is definitely a must-play for FPS fans, and especially stealth fans.			"

												This game is near perfection from a time long past. The world is unique, the characters are interesting, and this game has a lot to offer. I enjoy nearly all genres of games, but stealth games are especially close to my heart. The Thief series is one of the crowning achievements from that genre.The game doesn't pester you with petty morality or some insane story arc, Garrett (You) is not some chosen savior or defender of the world. Garrett is a thief, who's only worry is the coin in his pocket. This doesn't mean that Garrett is a bad man. He has saved people, been called a hero, and tasted some of the glory that came from it. However, after that glory has faded, it's time to pay the rent. A new mansion to hit, a new rumor spreading, and new allies and enemies to face. Garrett is a simple man who finds himself in odd and dangerous situations.This time, the world has changed from what anyone knew before. With the invention of technology and crude robotics, being a thief just got much more difficult. Cameras, Special Locks, and Soldiers of Clockwork roam the high-end homes of the upper class. What these people think protect them may just be their downfall, this new technology does not discriminate, with your new tools, patience, and skill, you can show them who no door holds back, you can show them that you, are a master thief.(Side Note: I recommend the TafferPatcher and the HD Mod for this game, TP will improve your performance, and fix practically all the bugs, while the HD Mod does what the name implies, makes the game gorgeous.)  Thank you for Reading my review.	 "

												This is quite possibly the best stealth experience I have ever had. Thief 2: The Metal Age improves upon Thief: The Dark Project (or in our case, Thief: Gold) in every way imaginable. With a greater focus on grand medieval heists and a more focused story along with more polished gameplay this game is by far the best entry in the series.Thief 2 begins some time after the events of Thief: TDP. What makes Thief great in terms of story telling is how fluid and well-paced it is. Starting the game by helping out a friend, then stealing enough loot just to pay your rent until eventually Garrett stumbles on a great threat and then an even greater threat pulling the strings from higher up.Each mission can take you an hour or more to complete. The level design is superb: many rooms boast different types of surfaces which make varying amounts of noise with carpet and grass being the most quiet and tile and metal being the loudest. This game takes advantage of verticality with rope arrows and eventually vine arrows. You can really feel like a Thief when you set up a rope arrows on the roof of a building and lower yourself down to steal a highly valued item and them shimmy back up just before a guard shows up. Levels range from a bank, to a police station to a huge 6 story mansion to an underground base that houses a submarine. There's a lot of variety to be had when it comes to level setting in this game which is greatly appreciated.Gameplay has largely stayed the same but with the addition of a few new gadgets and enemy types. After the events of Thief: TDP Garrett now has a mechanical eye he can make use of, he can use scanning orbs to make sure places are safe before continuing which is a welcome addition. The game also boasts many new enemies such a robots, security cameras and even more varied guard types. For example there are guards wearing thick helmets who cannot be knocked out with the black jack. The best you can do is stun them and when you hit them their helmet will make a loud noise and draw the attention of other guards, luckily these helmet-toting guards are easy to identify. If you disturb guards enough they will be on 24/7 alert. If guards see a pool of blood from you murdering someone they will search the area thoroughly and continue to do so until you are either caught or if you knock them out or kill them. The AI can vary to being absolutely brain-dead (hiding in the shadows and one gets close enough to smell Garrett's breath but doesn't notice him) to being way too sensitive (one step into a dimly lit room and they're already chasing you).Luckily this doesn't happen too often for it to be a serious problem but it does happen.Lastly the sound design is superb. You can hear foot steps of enemies just as well as they can hear yours, you can hear them whistling and talking in a realistic manner. The ambient sounds bring atmosphere to the missions. Whether it be the whistling of the wind, the moans of undead, music at a party or people writing while doing paper work. Thief 2 has amazing sound direction.This game is old and the graphics are dated with a few problems here and there. But the gameplay and atmosphere outshine all of that. I have never had a stealth experience that comes anywhere close to this game or its predecessor. The game does benefit from having a fan-made patch (brings modern widescreen resolutions to the setting, allows modding and playing of fan missions and fixes a few bugs) which can be found if you go to the guides section of the community page. It goes on sale often for less than 2 dollars, this game is worth every penny. Absolutely stunning, a must have.			"

												It was rare that I obsessed over any specific game vs just being able to play games, period (the only ""system"" in my household until I was 15 was some type of Macintosh -- didn't own a PC til I was 17), but Thief TDP Gold and this game were two of my absolute obsessions. First played TTDPG at a friend's house pretty soon after it'd come out and for the next 5 years I felt like I just used him for his computer. That and I bought both games, not even having a PC, just so I could install them on random computers: my friends', the school's, a one-week boy scout camp's...So, needless to say: There's nothing I can say against this game -- I just hope they come out with a ""Special Edition"" (a la Skyrim) with updated/overhauled graphics and controller support as well as easy plug-n-play mod support. That'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Thief 2 is one of the best games you can buy on Steam.Very atmospheric, it was way ahead of it's time.Make sure to get DarkLoader. This will enable you to easily download and install thousands of fan missions, some of which are better than the original . Thief 2 realesed in 2000 by Looking Glass Studios originally based in Lexington Massachusetts, in 1994 the company moved to Cambridge. A significant number of Looking Glass personnel were MIT graduates. After the company folded, people from Looking Glass went on to work at Ion Storm, Irrational Games, Harmonix, Mad Doc Software, Arkane Studios, Westwood Studios, Valve, and to found Floodgate Entertainment and Digital Eel, amongst other later studios.

												It's a game where you steal stuff in a medieval steampunk setting.I recommend that you look up the plot summary of the first game before playing this game; there are a few plot points that you will miss if you don't. You can very well skip the first game and just play this one. You will miss out on the first game, but this game is the superior one, and I don't think that you'll lose too much if you play this game before the first one, save for the lockpicks not being in the first game until much later in the game.Thief 2 is a pretty old game. You'll have to re-bind controls right away (F is crouch, for example), movement is less smooth than today's games, and combat kind of sucks. Luckily, the movement is easy to get used to, and you're never supposed to engage in combat anyway.There is a bit at the end where the same map is used for 2 levels, and I'm not a fan of the final level, but the rest of the game is so excellent that it outweighs all the negatives in my eyes. Seriously, this has to be the greatest stealth game in existence. Stealth is based on line-of-sight, whether you're in a shadow or not, how much noise you're making, and even if you have something reflective in your hands. There are also a metric buttload of different entryways and routes that you can take. You could play this game over and over for years and never know about a certain ledge that you can jump on if you jump just right that gives you an entirely new perspective on a level. There are also a ton of secrets in the vein of Doom and Doom 2. The great thing about these secrets is that they're never hidden in a way that makes no sense. If there's a wall that slides away, then there's a button, or a movable torch-holder, or a bookshelf with a pullable book, or something else similar that's somewhere closeby.This is all I have to say about the gameIf you don't own it, start owning it.If you've never played it, start playing it.Unless, of course, you don't want to give money to Eidos & SqueenixThe orignal developers aren't going to see your money if you buy this, and the Thief reboot already crashed and burned, so buying this game doesn't really do anything other than give a big publisher money. That being the case, there are- other- ways to get this game.			"

												With most things, you expect, as time goes on, that they will improve. Newer cars are better than old, that sort of thing. The stealth genre is the only thing where this doesn\'t seem to be the case. Not to say that there aren\'t good modern day stealth games, of course there are. However, as of right now, none of them have seemed to surpass Thief 2, just offer and equally good experience, despite Thief\'s age. I won\'t go crazy on this review, but here is an example. Hitman is a stealth game of sorts, and as most games do, it discourages you from killing bad guys. The less bodies the better. How does it do this? With points, a negative effect on your over all proformance review, just some numbers on the screen. And thats all fine and dandy. But what about Thief. Thief is entirely organic, as it encourages you to be as stealthy as possible in a totally realistic way, that is much more planned out, while avoiding the whole issue of pulling you out of the experience, reminding you that \""this is just a game\"".   If you encounter a guard, you could try to sneak around him. One small mistake could get you killed though, so why not knock him out? You could, but then you have to worry about the body, which if not well hiden enough, could ruin everything. Meanwhile, killing him would be even worse, since that would not only make a body, but also a blood stain, which would require a water arrow to clean. This natural progressing of actions and consequences encourages you to play with as little encounters as possible, instead guiding you to learn to sneak past guards without ever interacting with them in the first place, being the ultimate ninja. But this doesn\'t feel gamey, and doesn\'t feel arbitrary or tedious. This is just one of the many reasons why Thief 2 still stands up as a great stealth game. Buy it, then download tafferpatcher, a program which helps the game run on modern computers. Don\'t worry, it is stupid easy, just download the file, and launch the executable, it takes all of 30 seconds. Plus, there are thousands of fan made levels which the community has made, providing hours of gameplay beyond the base game, so have fun!			"

												If you thought Thief Gold was pretty good, then you'll think Thief II is incredible.The Metal Age is stealth game perfection. Even though a lot of the stealth mechanics don't make much sense, such as a guard not being able to see you should you be standing inches away from them if you're in a dark spot of a brightly lit room, everything about this game is FUN. You'll spend about 40-60 minutes in each level, and that's if you're ignoring picking up all of the loot that's scattered around.The story, in comparison to the original Thief, is very well written and intriguing. The plot in the original had you fighting zombies and tomb raiding, while in this game, the focus is on the transition from a dark ages fantasy game to ""The Metal Age"". You don't feel so much like a spelunking knight with a sword and bow and arrow, but an actual thief, taking on bank heists and even sneaking through a medieval police station and stealing from the evidence vault. The screenshots displayed on the Store Page really don't do the game justice. For a game from 2000 the graphics have aged tremendously, and the lighting and texture work look fantastic to this day. My favorite level is the bank, just because of how spectacular the green tiled floors, wooden walkways, and red carpeted offices look. Not only do the levels look incredible, but they have some pretty great layouts and the level design is ingenious, inventive and sprawling. After replaying the bank mission so many times I've found six different ways to enter the building, and there are so many different routes you can take to get to the vault without being spotted it's insane. From crawling through a vent and dropping down into the offices adjacent to the vault room, shutting down the mechanical faces (which act as cameras hanging from the ceiling and spinning around trying to spot you) by flipping a switch on the third floor and going through the teller gates, or going through the lions den and using a rope arrow attached to the ceiling to cross the Guard's Room and into the backdoor of the vault room. I also love that each section of the immensely huge levels has a little nugget of dialogue to be heard that are entertaining to listen to and informative. The voice acting isn't great, but I always ended up quicksaving each time I heard a guard speaking with another guard so I could hear the full thing and then quickload so I didn't lose any time. What is really well done however is Garret talking to himself, usually stating the obvious but it helps players stay on track when he explains something to himself the player might not already realize. His little quips and things he says never get old, even after you've played the same level three or four times.In conclusion, this is an outstanding gem of a game that you would be doing yourself a disservice not to play.

												The master thief of the first Thief game is back and with somewhat improved graphics and new tools to play with. The story picks up some time after the first game and is packed with a new story and cast of enemies and allies, with familiar faces from the first game making a come-back. The game possesses significantly less ""adventure fantasy"" elements than the first game although they are not entirely gone. This was actually the first game of the series I played and though its story is more or less able to stand alone, it is even better when you have played the first beforehand. Included in a relatively cheap bundle with the first game this game is a gem at a bargain of a price.			"

												After having survived his encounter with an ancient Pagan god, the Master Thief Garrett is pulled into events that threaten to undo civilisation itself.  A new order is on the march, their footsteps suffused by the clicks and whirring of mechanical horrors, and a corrupt Sheriff spreads fear throughout the City.  The Metal Age is upon us...Possibly one of the most brilliant games to have graced the PC, Thief II: The Metal Age contains everything that was great about Thief Gold, while removing the stuff that wasn't so great.Missions are more focused, as is the story, and the enemies will make you want to scurry into the nearest shadows.  The high point of the original Thief trilogy, Thief II: The Metal Age is to be counted as essential gaming for any PC users.			"

People will spot you and try to kill you. If you fight back, they'll run away and call in more people to kick your butt. If you want a challenging game that you just can't run through like a freakin' level of Sonic, then buy this game.			"

												For Thief II, you could mostly just take my Thief Gold review, and then copy/paste all of the pros overtop of all of the cons. Thief II plays mostly the same as Thief Gold. Same graphics, same controls, same first-person view. What they did change, however, makes all the difference.Thief Gold had a number of really fun missions featuring Garrett prowling around a house or opera hall or what-have-you, knocking out guards and discovering secret passages, and those were great. But it spent just as much time knee deep in zombies, apemen, giant bugs, bugmen, ghosts, confusing labyrinths, caves, and situations where you almost HAVE to fight your way out if you're not super-great at the game.For Thief II, the devs looked at what players did and did not enjoy, and they made a game that is better in almost all respects. Save for a single Thief Gold-esque level with some apemen (which is rather forgiving compared to TG, and a fascinating level overall), there are only maybe a couple of any particular monster, and most of them are avoidable. The only new monster type I can recall gave me the biggest (and most enjoyable) fright of anything in either game. The majority of levels take place in sane man-made structures; homes, a bank, a surprisingly modern police station, and a few missions taking place across entire sections of The City. Thus the game now flows better, being less of a half-forced monster combat game, and more about sneaking around, bludgeoning unsuspecting jerks, and looting every last inch of each level.As a result of the titular Metal Age, Thief II also now includes cameras, robots, turrets,  and a selection of new tools at your disposal, such as mines and flares - the latter of which you will absolutely need, as some parts of the game can be far too dark to move around in. It's possible this is an issue on my end, or it may just be part of the game. If it's the game itself, it is one of the very few problems introduced with this installment.Also introduced, however, is a map. Though not always very helpful, it is often an invaluable tool, showing varied degrees of detail depending on the level and keeping track of where you've been and where you currently are.While the final level is complicated and confusing, most of the rest of the game is a blast. One particular element of note is the interesting play on the penultimate levels of Thief Gold. Where in TG, the three levels leading up to the final one were repeat visits to locations you had already been in previous levels, in T2 the fourth-to-last level is ALSO a repeat visit to a location you had already been in Thief Gold, now taken over by the Mechanists. The next-to-last mission is, in fact, the same location as the third-to-last mission, which somehow manages to stay fresh and fun through both levels.In the end, I heavily recommend Thief II if you enjoy stealth games. If you played Thief Gold but only sometimes liked it, I ask that you give Thief II a try instead, as it has ironed out most of the kinks. The only other thing I would like to note is that, like TFix for TG, Thief II is at its best when Tafferpatcher (a fan-made patch which improves resolution, textures, compatibility, etc.) has been applied.Now get thieving, you dirty taffer.

												One of my favourite games. Definitely my favourite stealth game. Thief 1 laid the foundation of the stealth genre and is therefore probably the most critically acclaimed of the series. But I decided to review the second installment as it is my personal favourite. It is immersive, tense but always fun and entertaining. The game's storytelling is superb as is its writing (ahh those guard quotes are just top notch), level design is brilliant, the graphics are just so beautiful; in my opinion more appealing than graphics of some of the modern games. The music and sounds are also very pleasing (don't forget those footsteps and torches burning etc... so satisfying).Anyway, it is already sixteen years after Thief 2's release but I come back to it regularly because of its powerful charm. And for this reason, I nominated it for The ""Test Of Time"" Award.			"
