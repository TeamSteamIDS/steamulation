												The game is brilliant satire and a funny little distraction but it seems better suited to Newgrounds and the like than $7 on steam. It costs too much for the value you get from it.			"

												I was looking forward to this, but it is repetitive and hard to discern how points work. I wish it was a system where you could pick a reply and based on how that reply is weighted, your attack would resolve or you would lose points. But it just lets you pick the same options that are not clear what they do. There's very little substance to this game. It should be free if the only point it wants to make is, ""see you fight people on the internet like it's a supremely crappy RPG or something!"". I doubt I'll play it again and I think I was ripped off.			"

												EDIT: I see that updates were made to the game that added achievements and more dialogue I still do not care to play this game because of the gameplay. Like I said in the review, I threw money at something and expected a good game, so I just wanted to restate that I am reviewing based on what the game is, not how dissapointed I was.TL;DR:Repetitive and boring, was hoping for a free roam where you venture the internet in a midevil themed world. Sadly, I just threw money at the screen when I saw it was about the internet and you got to fight trolls. Would be positive if it was free, because it seems like a F2P.For the $6 I paid for it, and I was stupid enough to see that it had something to do with the internet and then proceeded to throw my money at the computer without doing research. I had some fun at first. I loved the concept of battling trolls without actually battling them so you wouldn't lose real sanity.I was dissapointed to find out that trolls are the only things you fight. On top of that the dialogue is very repetitive. I was hoping to fight other things on the internet like feminazis, bronies, furries, but all depending on what fandom your character is in if he is even in one in the first place. For example, if you say that your character is a brony, then you would most likely only fight trolls. If your an anti brony, you would focus on bronies, while fighting others. I was also hoping for a free roam element where you could go to amazon which would be the merchants where you could buy items to fix up your sanity levels or your PC. It could also have quest too.Sadly, this game is just battling a few type of trolls, from the popular trolls to the rabid trolls. It gets boring real fast and doesn't really have much replay value. Character customization is really bland, and you only get to choose from a paladin, mage, rouge, and an archer. They all have their own perks, but it doesn't really matter what class you choose because the games pretty easy. You can use parry to regenerate sanity and almost never fail the action.On top of all of this, according to the disscussions, the developer is calling people who dislike the game, ""trolls"". I hate trolls, but I guess that i'm one of them in the eyes of the developer.I suppose it's my fault for not doing research on the game and throwing my money at it. Although since I did purchase it, I thought that I might as well tell people and my friends my opinions on it. Overall I give it a 2/10.Heres how I did my point system thingamigig for the few that care.~ Points start at 5~ +4 for concept~ -4 for gameplay~ -2 for developer being a♥♥♥♥♥♥br>~ -1 for graphics (I really ♥♥♥♥ing hate pixels, but they dont effect gameplay much for me.)NOTE FOR DEVELOPER: I do not hate you or your game, because hate is a strong word. I dislike your game and do not personally know you so I cannot judge you. I am unaware if developers can delete reviews, but if you do then that would cause me to dislike you for being one of those developers who cannot take critisism.			"

												I wish I could give a thumb sideways. I think the idea is great. As a proof of concept for a starting point to work on a more fleshed out game this could work very well. As it is though, I feel that fails both as a game and as satire.It's very short. I'm talking a few minutes here. There's too much reliance on a random number generator and after a few tries I just got to the point of not caring what I picked because it all seemed just random anyway. There's also really not a lot to it. It's just Defender picks one of 4 responses to troll, hit enter, roll the RNG, rinse, repeat. That's pretty much it. The same responses tend to show up too so it won't take very long to start seeing repeats of what you already saw.I'm willing to make allowances for games to be shorter, cruder and have less meat to them if their main point is satire, DLC Quest being a great example of this, but in this case it's just too short and too rudimentary. I really wish there were more to it but there's not.On the satire end it seems to fall flat too. I think the combination of the satiring the White Knight complex of the so called 'Social Justice Warriors' being too subtle (a quick glance at the forums shows that many people didn't get that they were being satired and not celebrated) along with the opposing side always being portrayed as trolls for the sake of trolling just makes the whole thing not work.As far as I am concerned, both sides take this subject matter and their role in it way too seriously and could well do with a mirror being held up. While true trolls exist, most people who get involved in these internet crusades do believe they are in the 'right' so not having the ability to choose both sides as a hero (in their own mind) seems to have the effect of making the whole thing come off as a SJW propaganda piece to many. Which it's not; having to 'retreat to a place where everyone agrees with you' is not exactly a quality to be celebrated but it seems many people don't get that far and just write the game off.If you have to explain your satire then it really hasn't done its job.Mostly though I just wanted more game. More to do. More from the opposition's perspective. Maybe planning and strategizing outside of the forum 'combat'. Something to make the game play last more than 5 minutes and be less random. Just more. The seed is there but it needs much more than this.I'd love it if we could get updates or this could get much more fleshed out but as it stands I really hesitate to recommend it at any price. There are 99 cent mobile games that give much more game play than this and if you want Gamergate satire you're probably better off searching Google for an opinion piece article. It would take you longer to read than the time you would spend playing this game anyhow.			"

												You would hope for it to be a you vs extreme SJW and Trolls.But this game definitelly picks a side in this neverending fight.Also, it gets dull as ♥♥♥♥ after battling 9 trolls + it feels like everything is 90% random 10% your own choice. You level up but there are to skill points or anything. Some old-school RPG statistics would have been nice. It would have been even better if you could incarnate a troll too. I was expecting something similar to papers please. I met something qualifyable as ""tumblr bias: the flash game""Not to be bought unless an update shows the other side of the coin so you can experience the internet conflict in all it's extension.

												First I want to say I played this for about 4 hours on the client before the steam launchI really wanted to love this game but the problem is it is repetitive and quite random (in a bad way).Well lets start off with the positives Quite an interesting concept Really doesn't take a side on SJW or Trolls The champions designs are quite nice The pixel art is quite nice The player and the Trolls look the same, probably a message on that The game changes when you become a champion which is quite intrestingNow the cons Like said above repetitive from the build I played (v2-2) only has about 5-10 messages for the trolls, this could also have some meaning to it but doesn't really make for a fun experience  Lacks alot of stuff a old school rpg would have and is really random companions come in at similar points and don't stay around.Sidenotes: This game would of worked best as a mobile title since a run can be completed in about 5-10 minutes. This game has alot potential but sadly at the current update it is quite an empty game with repetitive gameplay, I hope this game is updated and adds in more content but at the current time not worth the purchase			"

												Not a very good game, especially at the going rate of (currently) Six dollars USD. More thought could have been put to it. Challenging enough as it is, but I would have like to have seen different variations of specific conversations, and more choices of how to react (also specifics of how to react) instead of just a cut and paste 4-6 of the same choices for each level ""Troll"" in the game, and 4-6 choices for each class specifically played. Also the lack of difference in skins between the player and the ""Trolls"" was a shame. Not sure if funding ran out or what, but a colored shirt and pants on the player could have made it seem less bland between character skins. The SJW classes had different outfits, why not the player/trolls?In the end, this is, unfortunately, a Game I couldn't recommend. I had some hopes for it, too.			"

Not to mention the RIDICULOUS amount of Tumblr-bias. It's PAINFULLY clear that they tried desperately to paint the SJW's as the hero, despite the fact that Some of the things the ""troll"" says come closer to reality than your character does.I would honestly rather play Air Control.

Review composed for http://www.apochs.net.In recent years, debating on-line in the name of ""justice"" has not only become a norm throughout the internet, but also the center of hot button topics in pop culture and news organizations. Of course, it was only a matter of time before someone tackled the concept of keyboard warriors and turned it into a game. Enter: Social Justice Warriors. Nonadecimal Creative present this casual independent RPG/Simulation title that pits one of these social justice individuals against hordes of trolls looking to wreak havoc in r/. You are the voice of sanity in this offering, but if is as positive a message about society today, or does it just paint itself to be nobler than thou in the most insulting of ways possible?As stated, you take on the role of your every day social justice bringer behind a computer screen. You take on various trolls, largely ignorant or rabbid ones, utilizing health and mana in the form of sanity and reputation. Each are affected by your opponents choice of words, or even by your own actions like a direct ""lunge"" at someone's character. The more you assert how right you are over your opponent, the more the Social Justice Knights, mythical beings that represent sanity and reason in the game's internet world, smile upon you. The better they look upon you, the more they alter the battle at hand, positively or negatively. But, once one of your bars are depleted, the game is lost, and your name enters the Hall of Justice for all to see, leaving you to start anew through standard Rogue-Like rules.While Social Justice Warriors stands as a great idea in theory, the execution greatly misses its own point. First, you need to understand the goal of this game. The following is a quote taken directly from the title's Steam store page under the ""About"" section:Social Justice Warriors expresses frustration with how people use divisive labels – like “SJW” and “troll” – to discredit and silence each other. No matter what social values you have, attacking and ridiculing other people not only fails to achieve progress but has an additional effect of escalating the conflict while exhausting your patience and eroding your reputation.In the actual game itself, you play the role of someone who is meant to support the greater good, taking on all trolls in your path to do so. Your foe, who looks exactly like you, says something one might consider stupid, which, from my time with this game, was mostly about women or women's rights, to which you have to point out why the troll is wrong. However, this is largely an opinion-based system, and not all the things the trolls say are entirely inaccurate. The same goes for your characters legitimacy as far as statements go. This goes on until the arguments change for a brief amount of time, such as tackling racism, before just shooting right back into inequality with the ladies once more for no reason other than probably running out of talking points on said topic. The game is also played through the use of four different attacks, which the type of move is named differently upon the choice of your standard stock Final Fantasy characters (and just as similar sound track) ranging from Rogue, Mage, Paladin, and Cleric. Each one also offers different incentives with additional random knights appearing to do things like give you a riddle, attack the opponent, or bestow some sanity or reputation to keep you alive. There is a necromancer, but he's basically worthless outside of giving you one last shot you won't really benefit much from other than one more shot at the troll who's opinion differs from yours. There's also a level system, though it seems absolutely pointless as you stand as much of a chance taking on and defeating an enemy a few levels higher than you compared to one a level or two lower than you. This leads to another issue, which ends up being balancing, and an ineffective combat system all together. In the games I played trying to figure out what attack best worked with what comment, I would lose after four, maybe five trolls, the latter if I was lucky. However, while taking a break in this review, I went ahead and played as the Rogue and, for the sake of curiosity, just kept spamming the enter key over and over. By doing so, not only did my character take down a foe six levels higher with four hits, but this was the longest battle waged, having reached the tenth troll. This means nine enemies, four of which sub-bosses, were decimated by spamming one single button, and the only reason the character was defeated was because the Troll Warlord boss knocked down nearly all of the three-fourths filled sanity bar in one shot, leaving very little chance for my warrior to survive.As far as the gameplay itself goes, you basically just choose a text prompt until you win or loose. While this aspect does stick with the traditional J-RPG template, but, the game is literally just that. You can take the high road with facts, block, share your foe's statement to your followers, or just attack by degrading yourself to insults, repeat until you defeat the enemy, immediately fight the next. Having a choice of topics to fight for so players can choose something they may be passionate about, or perhaps choosing their own text instead of just an attack name with the next scripted set of lines coming up, would have allowed a little more variety outside of staring at the eight-bit zombie-looking slacker you don't care anything about. Maybe if you could customize him (her?) beyond the name input would help build the slightest bond to your character.But the final nail on the coffin for Social Justice Warriors is the inability to play as the troll. You are committed to just being the good guy in a game about opinions, meaning you should be allowed to play devil's advocate as well. This would further push the theory that we're all just spinning our wheels in the mud by bickering about these topics to assert who's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(literal or metaphorical) is bigger, all the while landing attacks that basically counter the point of your character. If anything, this title airs more on the side of preachy by focusing only on the positive, helpful, or beneficial aspects of the arguments that your character alone makes, and tearing down any the opponent might have that actually may be factual or far more grounded in reality than our faceless main character. Even the most spiteful on-line arguments can sometimes have a middle ground, one specific thing people can agree on to end things amicably, which isn't any sort of option in this game either. Instead, we are left with a ""I'm right and that's that"" debate anyone stuck in a religious discussion will immediately find themselves wanting nothing more to do with this title.Social Justice Warriors offers very little to the player overall. The gameplay is weak and as basic as it can possibly get, there's no real variety whatsoever except the same animations on a loop (though the troll slamming the monitor onto the desk is humorous the first few times you win a fight), and, what's more, it kind of misses it's own point. You could argue that Nonadecimal Creative is trying to show even the most well intentioned keyboard warrior is, in fact, an internet troll or bully him/herself. After seeing the depths some of these people go to pick a fight in the name of ""justice"", even when there's no need for it, they have a point. However, the game isn't presented this way. Instead it's a boring, depressing to look at game or incredibly basic RPG fundamentals, some of which are pointless, and generic topical battles you more than likely won't give a damn about at all. A few plays in and you'll start to wonder what exactly the developer was trying to achieve with this title that is so minimalistic that it actually loses it's gimmicky replay value after your first few deaths.

Posted: July 9, 2015
												Social Justice Warriors is a bit of a clunky game, not always clear to new players, and at times, blatantly unfair. So as a playable version of internet arguments, 10/10, extremely realistic. But there's a whole lot more to this game than you can tell from screenshots and comments.For starters, despite playing as an SJW and battling a variety of trolls, the game doesn't pick a side as much as you'd think. Yes, the narration describes you as a valiant force of good against internet ne'er-do-wells, but it's so over the top at times that it's clearly not expecting to be taken completely seriously.The actual depiction of the trolls does a lot to help the balance. While they're helpfully labelled 'Rabid Troll' or 'Popular Troll', they actually look just like you, an ambiguously-sprited person tapping away at a keyboard. And your actions in, erm, 'battle', can sometimes mirror their's, since you have the option to always try to maintain the moral high ground, or lose your patience (and reputation) and start mudslinging.There's a lot of variety in the game. You can choose four different classes, each with unique play-styles that coincide with different areas on the internet. The Paladin uses Twitter, the Cleric uses Reddit, and so on and so forth. And each has a multitude of choices in conflicts. Try to logically defeat the troll, or wreck their reputation until nobody takes them seriously, or take a second to regain your composure. Each of these choices has their own impact on your own Sanity and Reputation, which act as dual-health bars.That's not to say the game plays fair, at all. My biggest complaint is the amount of sheer randomness you can encounter if things don't go your way. If your sanity or reputation ever get too high, any troll can instantly use a powerful attack and wreck them. A rumour or exposed phone number, and you're back to square one. If left alone, they'll call upon the dark forces of the web, and even though they'll occasionally get a reassuring answer of 'NOT YOUR PERSONAL ARMY', you stand the risk of total online annihilation. And every once in a while they just completely disregard any move you make. It's not a very consistent game to play.But the game puts a message above the gameplay, and the message is good. If you somehow managed to get high sanity/reputation, you transform into the Social Justice Champion (yes, I cringed a little writing that,) and how does this mighty warrior fight their battles? Well, all your combat options are replaced with things like 'Listen to their concerns', 'Defend opponent from attackers' and 'Propose a compromise', and the goal changes from 'Try to ruin the troll' to 'Acknowledge their point of view and try to raise their sanity/reputation until they no longer feel the need to argue with you. I don't see how anyone who isn't a genuine troll can't see this as a pretty good message to portray in what I expected to be a silly game about internet fights.In short, it's not an incredible game, but as a representation of arguments on the internet, it's accurate in a way that's comedic but not shallow. Plus, if you took one glance at the game, decided it was 'pro-SJW propaganda' and immediately started frothing at the mouth, thank you for confirming on a slightly meta level just how accurate the game can be.

												This game has mildly amusing writing and delivers a solid if somewhat preachy message. Unfortunately, the game has so little actual content or gameplay that the gimmick wears thin after about ten minutes and then you're left with the gameplay which is nothing but dice-rolling. There's a very limited amount of actual decision-making to be made, about the only thing that will make or break games early on is not understanding how the obtuse riddle stuff works but once you've got that down it's basically all RNG from there which results in a really boring game. It commits the terrible sin of sacrificing the actual gameplay to push its message more.this is a bad, shallow game bandwagoning on a hot button issue to sell copies.

I recommend the duels in monkey island if you want to see fun arguments instead.On the other hand it is kind of a good parody of some of the recent social justice warriors making a profit out of peoples gullibility (if only I hadn't fallen for what sounded like a fun title).This game is repetitive, not funny and overpricedDon't buy it			"

												Social commentary conveyed via turn-based combat where player fights a losing battle against internet trolls. Each character ""class"" has 4 abilities that you use over and over every fight, with little strategy in what will work and what will not. Random chance determine whether you progress or fail, but that's not unlike its real-world equivalent. + It will feel very much like true interactions with internet trolls, and so does a good job of capturing the experience and conveying it to others who haven't endured it+ There's really no real ""winning"" in this game, just how long you can endure before it's not worth it anymore (see first point in pros above), and so...+ ... it should serve as a warning for those who may one day have fallen into the troll trap+ ... with any luck, real trolls who don't know they're trolling might be led to that realization+ If not, at least the game does do a decent job of identifying fallacies (more info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies)In either case, as in life, it gets very repetitive and boring after about 15 minutes so it's worth a short laugh before you move on. I'm not recommending this game as there are better ways to learn of fallacies (see link above), and if you really do want to experience it for yourself you can do it for free in virtually any online space. Some places to quickly experience this are youtube comments, reddit, twitter, and pretty much any social networking service.Note: I got this game while it was on sale for about $3, and I don't think it was of good value to me. If you really want to experience the game, I'd suggest $2 or less.			"

												Very cheap but not worth even that low price. It's a one-note joke, with barely any animation and even less interactivity. I've played a lot better free flash games, I don't know what I was thinking when I forked out £3 for this. It's a series of JRPG style battles where you have 4 options; each results in some comments. If these were more varied or funny then it may justify the 'game' not being free. However, there are very few comments and they're all basic statement of opinion, nothing witty or unusual.			"

												Feels like a prototipe or a jam game.Every character has 4 choices which seldom change. No inventory. Your choices either hit or miss, no inbetweens (despite what the text says).UI is not very polished and every enemy looks the same.was fun for about 2 minutes. disappointed. There's just no depth at all.			"

												Social Justice Warriors is a game worth the time. It throws you straight into the action, which some players dislike that I love it. Its a game that is probably going to make you rage, between getting an OP enemy or accidentally using the wrong attack and draining the rest of your reputation or sanity.This game is downright amazing. sorry about the crappy review this was my first serious one.EDIT: Nevermind this game is awful.

I also can't help but love it because of the satire and memes. This game to me is just wonderful and simple, so I love it! This game also is definetly for casual play, because I doubt pro players will really get into this. If you enjoy RPG's or even memes, I would reccomend this game to you. Of course though, there are the people who don't like this style of game, and I say to them, don't even try to bother with this game.

												Social Justice Warriors is when you take the whole progressive keyboard warrior scene to its over-the-top and quirky conclusion. Hilariously enough, several of the dialogues between the warriors and the trolls are nostalgic to me, reminding me of the heated discussions and shitflings I've been present at. This is essentially internet arguments the video game, and just like its real-life counterpart it's only a real joy in small doses. If you're a general leftist, feminist or SJW, this game will likely be in your alley. It's not big, expansive or thought-provoking, but it's a fun yet quirky achievement-hunting game that puts YOU in the role of heroes fighting against the dastardly trolls.That said, the game doesn't seem to explain or give tips how you can maintain your ""sanity"" and ""reputation"" in the best ways possible, but I suppose that's something we as the players ought to learn as we hone our skills with the keyboard.

I wish there were more dialogue and attack choices however, and that it would be a little more clear on how the points work. It would also be cool if the player and the troll were dressed differently at their computers. But overall, a great, fun game, and I really enjoy it a lot.			"

												The thing about this game is that they picked a very hot topic in the gaming community and had a humorous premise to go with. Social justice warriors, the infamous scourge of the internet gaming community, who have recently done their part to ruin everything as we used to know it. Except, the problem is that in this game, the trolls exemplify one of the logical fallacies in the standard school of ""logic"",  which itself is used ad nauseam in the game, referred to as ""No middle ground""  It's very clear that there is heavy bias painting the SJW as the hero, when the reality is (despite the disjointed and non-existent arguments presented by the trolls [caused by  the game deciding the ""troll's"" next moved based solely on a random number roll associated with a set of statements]) BOTH sides in the game are trolls, and some of the statements that were used for the troll side's dialogue are actually reasonable, if not the outright truth. Even so, they don't make any sense because they are random, so it's not as if you are battling a ""troll"" that's actually presenting a real argument.This was probably done on purpose, but for a game it doesn't work. When you argue with a real retard on the internet and they say something non sequitur, that's the end of it. Unfortunately the game doesn't end.Once you get past the humor of ""lol, I earned the favor of the necromancer and he used me to achieve his goal of becoming a lich"", this game plays no differently from any of a dozen flash games - hentai or not - where you just have to use a list of pre-determined moves to try and reduce the enemies health gauges while keeping your own at manageable levels. But you don't even get to see♥♥♥♥♥♥afterwards.As someone else said in their review, I wish I could give it a thumb sideways. Regardless of your opinion about SJWs, the game is shallow, inconsistent, and boring.			"

												Very clever and funny, with lots of fun references.  The idea of using the repetitive nature of random JRPG battles as an analogy for arguments with internet trolls is genius and is pulled of incredibly well.  I love how the game isn't afraid to deal with the dangers of internet bullying and address issues from a rational, defensible point of view.There really should be more to it for the price though, to be honest.  Games don't last long and although having four character classes gives some variety, a wider range of enemies would be a great improvement.  If it's on sale or in a bundle, it is well worth a play and could even be educational!  I hope someday there is an expansion or a sequel that can take these ideas to another level.  Perhaps a sequel could involve exploring dungeons based on different websites ranging from the easy, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, to the hellish, ♥♥♥♥♥, 9Gag... could be a lot of fun!			"

												If you've ever spent time involved in discussion on forums, then you will likely have seen a number of architypes of behaviour from those that are popular, friendly and discuss any topic to those that literally hide behind a dosen aliases with their only intention being to cause mischief and misery (if of course they can target the right people that are emotionally volatile enough to bite)This game is a simulation of those occurances online and places them into a turn based ""quid pro quo ad nasuem"".Funnily enough some of the ""canned troll"" comments used within the game you do actually see alot on real forums.   While it might be costly in price for it's simplistic and shortlived escapade, hopefully the developers will perhaps consider a more indepth version in the furture.I'd only recommend to those that collect such oddities for the reason's of obscurity as opposed to being a Triple ""A"" game.

												I'm honestly offended by this game, and I don't want to be. I get the message the developer was going for, but that message is hollow in the reality of post August 2014. People have had their lives ruined, pushed into suicide, and even nearly murdered by cop via misinformation. You can't keep going down that both these ""sides"" are somehow equal in their personal failures, and while I do agree with the meessage of meditating on one's actions (something I had to learn the hard way), that's not what the game ends up saying to many.The way its structured, it says that the ""trolls"" always win. Their victory is inevitable, and thus they are right for it. Inserting dialog about actual issues that have resulted in death and♥♥♥♥♥♥threats simply for being brought up just lets them insert themselves more into this, and they see the game's message as satire ONLY aimed at ""SJWs."" They live in a culture where their hatred and ignorance is not isolated, it is shared and supported, almost coming off as cult like. They don't get the message.More egotistical people also won't, more likely to get angry by the portray of their beliefs, while others will just feel like they were talked down to by someone who doesn't understand their personal experiences at all. They don't know the pain or suffering they had to go through. They don't understand why they've had to fight for so long just to start a dialog about their suffering.As satire, this game is ann absolute failure. It's too focused on a particular idea and culture to have the more universial message to have impact, and that message is tainted and lost by the context it creates. That really disappointed me.			"

												It is not surprising that this game stirs up attention. Its a social commentary, a satire. And it hits where it hurts.For all those who engaged in internet arguments before, it is a mirror that they have to look into, and what they see is that there is no winner in these bitter arguments on twitter, reddit or wherever they happen. It makes people reflect and they don't like what they see.From a perspective of someone who doesn't take part in such arguments, its a humoristic experience, that shows the absurdity of the human behavior on the perceived anonymity of the internet. The Social Justice Warriors and the Trolls they fight are one and the same, just with different coloring. In the end there is no winner.The Gameplay is solid, 4 classes with different abilities, high score table, lots of references, funny and sad at the same time. It's good to be played for short bursts but gets repetitive relatively fast. No bugs encountered.The asking price is probably too high for the length of the entertainment that might be provided.Still it is a worthwhile experience, and it's probably the game people deserve.

												This has all the elements that a you need for a one more run type of game. You will go in to a turn based war on trolls were you will crush your foes and in turn get crushed later on but you will get back up and try again.  The Classes include Paladin Cleric Mage and Rogue.  The gameplay is using your attacks and heals to keep your rep and sanity up, while also making the trolls rep and sanity drop.  Also there are questions that you get asked that can buff you injure you or do the same to your foe.  NOW WARRIORS LET US SLAY THE TROLL HORDE			"

												I have played far longer than my ""Steam-time"" as I played before the release on Steam.The message behind this game is a thought-provoking one - Are Trolls and SJW really so dissimiliar when viewed from another side of the argument ? This strong message combined with  mechanics that are both simple and solid, makes this a game excellent for short bursts of play.You begin by choosing a 'class' (Your 'platform', be it Twitter, a Sub-Reddit, a Blog, etc) out of four. You then begin to 'battle' trolls. Both you and your enemies are visually similiar and have a 'Sanity' bar and a 'Reputation' bar. Attacks will decrease one, or both of the bars, depending on choice of attack. Some attacks also have a 'cost'.Reaching zero on either bar results in defeat.Your attacks are context sensitive. Choosing to Rebroadcast to your followers ican be more effective against a troll that  just presented a horrific statement than choosing to Reply with a counterexample - depending on the specific statement.You will encounter SJ Rangers which can 'snipe' enemies, and others who will help you on your quest.The qoal is to see how many trolls you can defeat before you are defeated. Different enemy types - An Ignorant Troll is has different stats, chooses different attacks, and is sensitive to different attacks than a Populer Troll "

												It's a funny game because it represents all the hateful, racist, sexist, and bigoted comments you see online. It's also funny to see so many MRAs, Redditors, ♥♥♥♥♥ners, etc, hate on it because it shows them for what they really are: Hateful and angry people.They demand ""Both sides"" on the forums. Both sides of hatred, I suppose. But anyway, back to the game. You pick four choices based on what type of troll the person is, and I swear these arguments are copy and pasted from those sites above (sans death threats of women of course), which means I hope the developer adds more with updates, since... all you have to do is go to the comment section of any news article of Facebook and tada, new content.The developer is kind of a Liberal, which is good for some, but not for someone like me who is on the more radical Left (Communist) who believes in real Social Justice, but the answers given by your character are pretty good.Overall it's a good time waster and it's funny to see comments you see in real life in the game made by people from those aforementioned sites, who are going to vote this review down because they need an outlet for their anger.One minor issue though that annoyed me, but had nothing to do with the game: The developer banned me temporarily from the forums because I was making those hateful people upset, which they deserve to be. They deserve to be shunned. They deserve to suffer the stress of anger. Why? Because all they do is hate.The developer from Hotline Miami 2 deleted my thread wherein I asked if they took out the♥♥♥♥♥♥scene or not. No trolling, just a simple question. Before he deleted it, I was told to kill myself multiple times and the posts could have been ripped from that thread into this game.It's kind of terrible when you think about it. It's 2015 and caring about Social Justice is a bad thing in this world. The reception to this game and the fact that this game exists proves it.Edit: Gamergate isn't and wasn't about Ethics in Game Journalism. It's about redditor,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 9 gag or whatever being awful children whining about other people than them (straight white males) having a say in video games and playing them.Also if you want a demo of this game, read the comments and drink Bigot Tears. They are delicious. Nom nom nom			"

												I like the combat system a whole lot, it reminds me of ""Monkey Island""s fighting mechanics wherein you need to come up with witty retorts for insults aimed at you in order to win at sword fights. I’ve always loved that “Battle of Wits” fighting system. I don’t see that done often enough in games.			"

												The game is hilarious and poignant, the cherry on top is reading the reviews complaining that they don't get to be a racist. Red Pillers, MRAs and people who think Gamergate is about ""ethics in video game journalism"" (lol) should probably stay away from this game. And society.			"

												It is incredible. Take on the role of Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr or ♥♥♥♥♥ to fight against the trolls of the internet.			"
