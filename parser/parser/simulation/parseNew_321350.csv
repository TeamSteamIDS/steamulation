Early Access Review
								As it stands this game has a lot of things working against it.Small dev team, slow progress and set backs, empty mmo world with no playerbase, confusing interfase, confusing HUD, poor sound quality, super simplistic and unfun space combat, and no shred of anything ressembling what is in the ""features"" list.For instance.""Twitch combat""No, there is no twitch combat.The space combat is slow and plodding, it is literally just lining up your mouse with an enemy and shooting till it dies.The enemies have slow and wide movement paths, and your own ships movement feels extremely unrealistic.There is no sense of feel of thrust, or speed in anything you do.You fly up to an enemy as fast as you can, and stand still as you shoot at it, hoping it doesnt fly out of range making you need to chase it down once again only to stop and keep shooting.""Why early access?""According to the post the dev claims this game needs to be tested with a REAL population.When I bought this game on march, there is no one on it, and there really hasn't been many people on it since.The dev will NEVER be able to test ANY real numbers on this game going as it is.""How long till the game releaes?""The dev claims this game was scheduled to release by christmas last year, but said because of setbacks it would take longer.According to the post ""I hope these take no more than 6 months""Well assuming that psot was made in december it's still been 8 months since then and there has been no update on the release date.""What is the current state of the game?""According to the dev, all of the ""core features"" are done in this game, but no actual comprehensive list of what features the ""core"" ones are is given.According to the features list on this page, this game has piracy, mining, bounty hunting, over 800 ships with millions of combinations of gear, and loads of quests to improve your reputation with the many planets and races.I can't say for a fact I was in the game long enough to notice if there were really 800 ships and millions of different gear combinations.But what I did see was about 5 available ships to purchase, and something like 20-30 different pieces of equipment.Either way the description of what is actualy in the game is vague.""How are you planning to involve the community in the development of this game?""The quote given ""“I hope future development will be community driven.”""This is not an answer.Like everything else it's vague or outdated.A real answer would be ""I'll be taking suggestions/polls from the community to determine possible future additions to the game"".The developer seems inexperienced, undermanner, and possibly underqualified to see the development of this game through properly.If you have a serious interest in indie titles or space sim games, this game is unfinished and has no active player base.I myself got a refund for this title and till it turns around I will not be purchasing it.There are a lot of things to be said for not judging a book by it's cover and giving things more of a chance, so it'll be easy to write my review off because of my short time playing the game, but many of the top rated positive reviews of this game have less than an hour or two played in game as well.I would suggest waiting till this game releases and see what comes of it.My suggestion to the development team of this game would be to advertise a free weekend of some sort for this title, inviting a lot of new players into the game.This would properly test the integrity of the servers with lots of players, and might possibly get more players to buy the game after testing it.I do hope the games goals come to pass, but right now as it is, I cannot recommend this title.

								I hate doing this kind of thing because I have been both a game developer and reviewer, so I know how hard it is to do an amazing game. The idea is sound enough, and the trailer is tempting, but the execution is lacking soul and substance.So what works? You can dogfight both AI and human controlled fighters. The AI fighters are a lot easier, but still rewarding. You also have to discover the universe, it's not justg handed to you on a plate. This encourages exploration. The controls are ok.What doesn't work? The sound is weak (which is easily fixed guys!). The waypoint system is a nightmare. Scratch that, the nav system is a nightmare. It needs simplifying. If a civilisation can create a spacefaring culture, then the navigation system would be paramount, and easy to use. You can fly a space station. Sounds cool right? Wrong. Space stations are for deploying and making money from while you are away doing someting else, not blasting level 1 pirates!This game is not as terrible as some reviews would suggest, and even though there seem to be periodic updates, there is no info on the steam channel about what those updates are doing.Overall this is playable, and a definite distraction, but the price is too high for what you get and there are stronger games out there for about the same cost that bring far more to the table.

								SHORT VERSION:Huge universe, twitch flight/combat, fly fighter ships, merchant ships and capital ships.....yes, maybe it's not as pretty as some of the new AAA games but awesome gameplay.LONGER VERSION:I've played Fairspace for awhile now (since way before it came on steam) and love it each time I log in.  I've seen many improvements/updates made to it, and each time the dev has listened to the players, made changes they wanted or needed.  The community is a big deal in this game, and luckily it's a good community.The combat/flight side of the game is smooth and well executed and it's a breath of fresh air to play a space mmo that gives you direct control of your ship.Trade and exploration is a big aspect of the game.  Your map starts out fairly empty and planets, stars, nebula etc only appear as you find them.  So if you want to make the money by finding the really good trade routes you will have to head out into the unknown.The game could benefit from some updated sounds and graphics, but even as it stands, it is a solidly playable game.

								I highly recommend this game if you like space sims, or even trucking sims. I like the variety of shipments you can carry from planet to planet. The graphics are great, and run smoothly on a low-end computer. For the price I couldn't turn it down. I like space fighter games, but the ""trucking"" aspect of it keeps me coming back to this, playing for hours. It like a combination of Moon Breakers and Euro Truck Simulator. I would like to see a little more personality thrown in, like better space station stops. Perhaps a more ""Truck Stop"" feel to it, or some humor here and there.  Or just throw on the ""Convoy"" soundtrack on Winamp and your good.Excellent game at the price. Easy to get in to, Lots to explore,   and you don't feel ripped off.			"

								Great space sandbox game! a lot of work  and what make me to buy this game is what this kid said : ""make it so as the very best stuff is earnt thru hard work and persistance (plaing for a REALLY long time) my dad plays star trek online and hes got alot of really pro stuff and not spent a penny, stuff which CANT be bought, many things can be, but they can also be earnt rather than bought, make it so as the micro transaction thing works for ppl who are impatiant, and make it so as those HUGE battle cruisers need to be earnt through lots of hard work, in other words arnt bought with real money OR in game money""			"

								The game itself is kinda well made. However, I played about 1.5 hrs without logoff and I suddenly got forced to close the game.After I restarted the game, everything that I have done is gone.you can buy it if you want (its not that bad) However, if I were you, I would buy this after they stablize the server or whatever---------Adding-----------------Very saticefied with the fast respond from the developerSince it is the early acess, totally agree with that it is ""developing""Because the developer shows their works, I strongly expect that the game gets better and better.--------For the develpoer----------------it happened when I was setting the view as ""first view""(without seeing my frigate) with warping and it was destroyed with hitting a meteorite. The game was completely stopped so that I had to force to close the game.Thank you for your hard working			"

								Awhile ago I think this game was on sale for like 2 dollars and I never played because I forgot about. One day I was bored and decided to give it a try and I liked it. sure it doesnt have the best graphics like elite dangerous but with the easy flying and active devs this game sure is a fun one. The only real problems is that the server is barely populated and some things are a little overpriced (1 map with 3 locations is 3 mil) also some other small ui stuff. Its still fun to accidently get too close to a sun burn up and loose all 1000 of your diamonds or buying a ship in a level 50 territory and flying it all the way back to your level. id give this a thumbs up because I got my monies worth buy for 9 dollers I wouldent buy it maybe for at its current sate id give it a 5$ price mark. Well that is my 2 cents.sorry about spelling errors			"

												Yes, I can recommend this game.Why:It's a space game and better than many. Lots of enemies, lots of different ships, exploration, trading and ship controlling is good enough. Price tag is cheap for what you get, and if you buy this on sale, it's a real bargain.Why not:If you want best graphics, this is not for youNobody plays this and one reason is nobody knows about this game. I personally had never heard of this until I saw this in my queue after couple of thousand other titles. "

												Hey guys,i dont know why this game is getting negative reviews,it is a really good game,the graphics are acceptable,and the game play is above average,for the price every one should buy this game and not listen to the reviewers who think that a game selling for less than $10.00 game should be exceptional,this game is really fun to play.

								A very nice early access old school space sim with space combat and commerce. Sound and graphs need polishing but gameplay is already very good for an early access. Add to that, the creator of the game is friendly and listens to suggestions and tries to solve any problems that may arise too. Moreover the price is quite low and worths for helping such a project with lots potential			"

												EDIT: The game has since left early access on October, and as far as I'm aware, little to no progress has been made on the game. Not to mention that the game's still a ghost town in regards to population.Just keep your money.ORIGINAL REVIEW: You know, after being promised that the game would be finished in Christmas 2014, and then that being pushed back 6 months, and after that promise not being fulfilled...I'm starting to think this won't be finished.If there's one thing I can praise, it's that the dev really focuses a lot on customer service, and he fixed some bugs in the game when I brought it to his attention back when this released.Had some hopes for this nice little game, but I guess those hopes have been crushed.

								This game reminds me a lot of Freelancer. That game was great. I thought the trailer looked half decent, and I glossed over the fact that the graphics were pretty gross. I started the game, created an account, laughed at all the misspelled words. I started to explore the GUI. This was when I barfed a little. Jesus! Okay, okay, okay. Maybe. Just maybe the game plays decent. I saw I had a skill point. I put it into something that said I would get +5% more XP. Cool. I also saw my ship had some weapons already. Alright. I don't want to shop too much before getting into my first battle. I set out. Wow. This looks nasty. I start to mess with the controls. Hmm. How do I shoot? LOL! DID MY GUN REALLY JUST MAKE THAT SOUND? It's a pea shooter. What the ****? Okay. That's pretty awful. Let's go do that mission I picked up back in base. What was I supposed to do again? I can't find it. Let me just go to the waypoint it set up. It took me a bit to find out how to not travel at a snails pace, but that was okay. I encountered some hostiles while en route to the waypoint. One shot of my pea shooter and they made a little dumb blowing up sound. It didn't feel satisfying whatsoever. Eh. My time here is almost done. Lets get to the objective. I get there. Sitting on the waypoint thinking. What. The. ****. Nothing is happening. I look for 2 minutes around the GUI for information. Nothing. I quit. Do you recommend this game? Lol, no.Graphics 1/10Audio 1/10Controls 2/10GUI 1/10Gameplay ?/10 (I couldn't get past the first 4 things to try the game enough, but probably 2/10)			"

								If you like clunky controls, unoriginal models and sound (yes I used the fighter ship, that you are assigned when you start, and some of the sounds in a college project back in 2003), and early 2000's graphics, then this game is for you.  To me it is complete crap.			"
