												Having played guitar for nearly seven years now in rock, metal, blues, and jazz, I was really needing something that put interest back into playing, like a new piece of gear. I found that in Rocksmith, and played it nearly 35 hours in my first five days of owning it. I love having the callouses back. That being said, the game is not perfect. I'll make a simple rundown of pros and cons for simplicity.Pros:- Definitely inspires you to play and learn songs. Whether you find your own style of playing before or after you learn a steaming pile of songs, it's always good to learn said steaming pile of songs. Rocksmith will definitely help you do this in a fun, relaxed, pseudo-Guitar Hero environment.- Has a nearly flawless session mode where you can construct your own band that has a wide variety of styles, sounds, progressions, and can play in all the basic modes and scales with all 12 roots. It also has a very helpful and changable neck layout to show you exactly what scale they recommend you use. This is like a loop station +4, people!- Songs have a fluid difficulty. If the game sees you rock, it'll make the next bit a little bit harder. If it sees you're having a lot of trouble, it'll dial it down. This spans from pretty much root notes only to having every note be invisible. This game has an infuriating way of making you learn songs ;).- Has a sometimes helpful section repeater for every song.- Has a MASSIVE amp emulator where you can try out digital versions of generic and some name brand gear to see what you want for a new song or purchase. These are all dependant on the quality of your computer speakers of course, but it's still nice to have a reference.- You can change your tone in the middle of a song if you despise song's preset tone.- An interesting pro, this program's DLC and price per song is generally roughly the same if not cheaper than sheet music, and you get a lot more. You get to hear the song, see a visual representation of how it's played, get alternate lead, rhythm, and bass parts, and a preview of how the guitarist got their tone with the amp emulator. Plus you get to beat the snot out of it over and over and score points.- There are several other little pros scattered throughout, but these are the big ones.Cons:- My worst complaint with the game: Some of the ways this game has you play songs are ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS (yes, I mean to shout), and there's no way to change what frets it wants you to play from what I can tell. Fortunately, the game is just based on tone recognition, so if you can play it on a different string and it's easier for you, do it that way. Problem is, you have to ditch the way the game wants you to play at that point, so there's no on screen reference. For example, Are You Mine by the Arctic Monkies has you sliding all around the neck. I have learned to play it to where I hardly have to move from the second fret. Ultimately, this is kind of beneficial, as you should be learning the way you want to play, and hopefully that's without having to watch the Rocksmith screen. On a similar note, some of the rookie ways of playing songs can actually be harder than the advanced way because you don't know all of what's being played. This is a problem for me as an advanced guitarist because it's easier for me to play by chord names rather than some stepwise building of chords throughout the song.- The other pretty unfortunate bit of this game is that it has a serious case of death-by-interface when you're first starting out. Everything the guitarist played on the song has to come down this alley at you and convey, in it's entirety, everything about that note: string, fret, duration, slidel vibrato, bend, temolo picking, harmonics, tapping, hammerons, pulloffs, anything that the guitarist could do has to be contained in that one tiny note flying toward you, and it's one of several at a time. The game will modulate this problem a bit by removing some of the extra things like bends and tremolo, but this is still serious information overload, so be prepared to have some difficulty with reading what's happening for a pretty long time.- The nearly flawless session mode's one flaw is that it changes dynamically with how you play, which in terms of musical expression, is not always the best way to do it. Do you want to rip a screaming solo while the band lays back? Ehh... This will have problems figuring out what you want. Conversely, are you trying to rip a screaming solo, and the band's dying away? This happens too, especially when your guitar is producing rather low output like with tapping. It may be great to change with the band, but when you both follow each other, pretty soon the band stops playing 'cause you're too quiet.- The riff repeater can slow down parts and manually change difficulty, which is good, but all these parts are pre-determined by the game. If you have a problem with one part at the very end of a solo, it's very likely you'll have to play through the whole solo a billion times to get it right and understand what you're doing, which may or may not be a good thing. Also, and this is infuriating, the slowing down of a song has no metronome or click track that I can find, and past about 80% speed, the audio quality is so bad you can't tell what's happening anyways. Good luck finding a tempo here. You're better off just watching what is happening at slow speed and trying to master it at full speed from there.- The tone recognition isn't perfect, and it never is. This is extremely frustrating if you're going for note streaks, mastery score, and basic video game statistics. I've missed chords in the middle of strumming a long line of the same chords just because the game herps a derp (It was punk rock. 1/8th note power chords? Don't tell me I randomly missed one lol).- A few nitpicky things here: On the minigames, the notifications can seriously get in the way of what you're trying to see so you can play the right thing. The score attack sounds are also extremely distracting when you're trying to rock your awesomest.- And a technical note from one player to another: Always tune up. The game seems to hint that as long as you tune down to the right note (say for drop D), you're good. This is not always the case, especially if your strings are a little too thick for your nut. They can stay just a hair too tight on the playing end compared to the segment after the nut. This means that as soon as you bend or play one of the strings, your tension will equalize and you'll be slightly flat. So remember: Always go below the note you want and come up from below it. This could concieveably make you slightly sharp, but if you're having that much problem with string tensions, you need to get your nut slots widened for your apparently super-thick monster-tendon He-man/Hercules strings.So, on the whole: Is it awesome? Yes. Will you learn guitar? Yes. Will you learn songs? Yes. Will you happily lose track of hours of your life? Yes. The review officially ends here, but I have a few personal notes for the dedicated reader.Just remember while you're playing this game, take the time to learn what's comfortable and right for you. Just because Rocksmith says you should play a song a certain way doesn't make it right. You'll love guitar that much more if you find your own voice on it. This game will definitely teach you to play if that's what you're looking for, but always try to put your own spin on what you learn afterwards. For example, the game doesn't recognize if you play more notes than are in the song, so I always add my own licks, fills, and harmonies when my part gets quiet just so I can get a better feel for what I would want the song to sound like. By all means quote songs you love and guitarists you idolize, but don't become a riff junkie who brings nothing new to the table. Put your own inflections on their ideas, because that's what makes your playing interesting.			"

												This game is fantastic and is a must-buy if you play guitar. If you don't play guitar and are curious, it's actually good enough that I'd still recommend getting it. It is far and away my favorite music game on the market.Be warned that it's more of a guitar practice tool than a game. But that's exactly what it should be: a practice tool that has just enough game-y design to keep it interesting, but not so much that it gets in the way of practicing. The only linear progression the game has is in the form of ""missions"" along the side of the menus that encourage you to try different things. You can ignore them entirely if you want, but sometimes they are very helpful (especially the ones associated with the Session mode, which teach you bits of relevant music theory). It's a well-designed experience.The interface is very slick and the game has no loading time or lengthy transitions between browsing and playing songs. This is great news because the interface was the main flaw in Rocksmith 1. ""Riff repeater"" phrase rehearsing options are integrated into the pause menu, so you can drop into them on the fly while playing songs.The soundtrack is excellent. It has hits (Knights of Cydonia, Paranoid Android, etc), more obscure music with fun guitar parts, and even a few tracks from small indie bands I have never heard of. The song Stay In by Jaws is one of the indie songs that stuck out to me. And it's very worth it to import Rocksmith 1 songs -- they have had their tabs updated to fix inaccuracies and to use new features in the new game (RS1 DLC songs have be updated as well).The game has a Session mode, where you can load backing instruments, jam, and have them follow along with you. It's alright. It's implemented well and has a ton of options, but I and other friends find it odd that it follows you, rather than maintaining a constant rhythm for you to improv over. Your mileage may vary with it, but it's a welcome addition.There are also a number of Guitarcade mini-games that focus on various guitar techniques. They are a distraction for when you're bored with performing songs, but some of them are pretty amusing. There is even a House of the Dead 2 spoof where you play chords to shoot zombies.I'm an amateur guitarist, but it's thanks to Rocksmith that I've kept up with practicing as frequently as I have. When learning an instrument it's easy to get bored when it turns into a grind and you don't know what music to try. You need some structure. Rocksmith is that structure, and it makes it easy to practice.			"

												Ah, Rocksmith 2014 (now remastered!), the sequel to Rocksmith and a game, which is claimed to be 'the fastest way to learn guitar' (and bass). I'm here to elaborate on this statement. First, I'd like to answer some potential questions related to the game.  Q: ""What do I need and how do I start?"" A: Well, it IS in a way a guitar teacher, so you will obviously need a guitar or bass (notice: it can't be a classic or acoustic guitar) and the Real Tone Cable, so I advise the reader to buy the Rocksmith bundled WITH the cable. From what I heard, there was also a bundle with the guitar, but since I already had a guitar, I decided to buy Rocksmith for Xbox 360 with the cable. Starting is relatively simple, you plug the cable in your guitar and the computer, read the manual, and start the game. Q:""Will I learn to play it like a super pro?"" A: I can't guarantee anything, it depends on YOU and YOUR dedication. If you want to master the guitar, you will have to train hard. Q:""How long will it take for me to master the guitar/bass?"" A: Once again, it takes some people a couple of months to get really good, some might train for years. I learned the guitar in two years. Now, questions aside, I should write down pros, cons, features and setbacks of the game. Pros:  -You can play this game anytime. Unlike having scheduled lessons, choosing the perfect time is up to the player. -This is not just a teacher. Rocksmith has many other features, which will be written down below. -Huge amount of DLC. You can buy lots of songs you prefer, from Social Distortion to The Smashing Pumpkins. -Cable versatility. If you, say, bought an Xbox 360 Rocksmith 1 version with the cable, like me, you can still play the PC version of Rocksmith 2014. -You can finally play without the cable! Yes, that's right, if you have a microphone, you can connect it to your computer and play the acoustic guitar! Alternatively, you could choose to play without any input, although this way most of the game's features won't be available. Cons: -Poor song selection. Not that I want to say there are more bad songs than good, there are just not enough free songs bundled with the original game. However, if you're willing to pay, there are lots of songs listed as DLC in the store.  Features: -Guitar lessons, Rocksmith 2014 includes over 80 interactive lessons to help teach you almost every technique associated with guitar and bass. -Session mode, where you can assemble and play with a virtual band. -Mini-games. Yes, Rocksmith 2014 includes mini-games, concerning different techniques. -The tuner. You will also be provided with a variety of guitar tunings to choose from. Not all Rocksmith 2014 songs are in E standard tuning. You can choose from several open tunings, as well as Eb, Drop D, C; D, C#, C standard and many more. And now you can even skip it! -The chord book. It's not much of a book, but it sure has lots of different chords. Diminished, augmented, 13th, they're all there. Setbacks: -Uplay account requirement. Yes, unfortunately, you will have to create a Uplay account to play Rocksmith 2014. However, I somehow managed to start Rocksmith 2014 directly through steam, so I suppose it is no longer necessary. Apparently, however, now it's not a requirement. You COULD use it once or twice in order to unlock special songs and arrangements, but for the most part it's unnecessary.Of course, I could not fit all of the things I wanted to say, but I believe it is enough to form the reader's opinion.In conclusion, I would like to say that if you want to learn to play the guitar/bass and don't know anybody who can teach it, or just want to have fun in the game and play your favorite songs, Rocksmith 2014 would be one of the best solutions. Do get the game if you get the chance!			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is not an ADVANCED system for learning guitar. Nor is a complete system. It doesn't provide much background in music theory, nor does it provide support for reading either music or tabs. However it is a GREAT tool for the beginner. This is because Rocksmith 2014 gets you to play the instrument from the first lesson. And it is fun. It's a LOT of fun. After over a year enjoying it I'm finding a natural limit to its usefulness. But great game and highly recommended for the beginner,			"

												This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.			"

												I got this game since Christmas 2013 and let me tell you. THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE! I didn't even know how to hold a guitar or do a chord. Now I can rock out to my favorite songs from System of a down to Marvin Gaye. If you've never played any guitar and you want to be able to play your favorite songs, this game is for you!Enjoy being a rockstar!			"

												This game is interesting and fun even if you don’t want to learn guitar.Pros:It really teaches you.Informative.You can play it even if you don’t have any experience with guitar.Many lessons.Various mini-games.Riff-repeater (you can repeat part of a song, slow it down, see your mistakes etc.)Session mode - good way to learn scales.Good price.Cons:No music theory lessons (It would be great to have at least beginner level)..RS2014 miss some notes (especially low E string on first frets).Game will count some notes and chords even if you miss them or play wrong (for example palm\fret muting).Song progress freezes - you can play song for 90%+ accuracy/mastery, but some parts of song still stay on “easy level” (To fix this you need start that part in Riff-repeater on 100% and then press “resume song” from ESC.menu.).No global statistics (like those huge graphs of your success etc.)About the game:Half of my life I listened metal\rock\electronic rock music, but I never thought about playing e-guitar, then I saw this game and listened Amon Amarth - As Loke Falls (omg I love that intro - I tried to learn it when I was creating this review, and now I can play it, now I must focus on alternate picking to play all song). RS2014 interested me - you can play and you can learn, this was something new to me. So I bought this game ,cheap guitar and cable to try it.Good interface, interesting modes, various guitar amp\pedal effect settings. There are a lot of DLC’s (official and not) - you can find almost all you want from reggae (which is not represented in game) to game music. Game freezes sometimes (like once in week for me, may be that because of broken unofficial DLC). Overall game is good and worth money.I started with games - simple Nintendo-like games like duck shooting, street racers e.t.c. After like 10 hours of playing I decided that it is time to try some songs - playing with you favourite bands that is something, even hitting 1 string is super fun, I never had so much fun playing games.After like week of “playing” songs I decided that it is time for next step “Lessons”. Rocksmith covers like 80-90% of all you need to know about guitar playing only questions I had\have are about my better posture\picking\sitting\guitar holding methods\thumb position.I played every day for 1 hour minimum. Whole month I played lessons and after I finished all to 80-100% “score” I thought “Now I am ready to Rock \m/!”. RS2014 have very interesting thing - “Session mode” where you can play along selected instruments, learn scales or use metronome. So after I “finished” lesson mode - I launched Session mode to Rock like hell.  I hit strings and instead of epic music heard nothing even close to what normal people call “music” that was random note pickings\bends. “I suck”, “Time to uninstall and die”, “60 day challenge”...So what was wrong with me or is it game? -nothing is wrong here, you can’t play like Slash after 2 months in Rocksmith, sorry. Then where is problem, why I felt so badly? I could play some songs like to 90%, but when I try session - almost nothing (I can play some parts from songs but no improvisation). Main reason for that is - game teach you how to play Guitar, but almost nothing about how to play music. You can learn how to drive a car, but how you will ride if you don’t know any rules? And that was the answer for my suffering - game gives you good start, then you must walk by yourself - and here comes youtube, books, lessons etc. After Rocksmith you will feel more comfortable with guitar, you will understand what that cool guy on youtube says about technique.And I continued to practice, even more every day. I watched many videos on youtube, read forums about techniques (how I hate my boney fingers when I practice bar chords). Next I decided to buy new guitar and amp to practice without RS.2 months after that (5 total in RS) I hear some melodies and clean sound when I play , I still can’t play good improvisation, but I can see progress - from someone who picks string, then looks at monitor and picks next one, to someone who can play some songs to 90-100% and play without RS2014. With all my progress I still think that I suck - and that is normal too, it is called “Learning”. More you play more critical you become to yourself. I still play RS everyday, downloaded many DLC’s - some easy, some hard. With time you will play better, you will see mistakes what you are making (wrong finger placement, wrong hand position) and understand how to fix them - for example now I more and more try to place my fingers correctly and mute strings that aren’t used when I play, month ago I hadn't even thought about it.Worst thing in all this is when I start comparing time wasted on other games and time I played Rocksmith. 169h in RS gave me more emotions, skill, progression and joy than all other games with 4000h+ together - so much time wasted.Try Rocksmith, it can change your life.Some thoughts about game:Many people ask same question over and over again: “Meh cool, but can you play without RS? Can? Silly game!”Well there are 2 different things - learning song and playing it. You can read book many times, but you still can’t repeat it word by word - same with songs. It is possible to play without Rocksmith if you Learn a song.Don’t waste your time and go to real teacher.Well that is good advice. I even hear stories, that in our small city we have someone who can teach you for bottle of vodka for 1 lesson (1-2 hours). Some people don’t have money for teachers. And even if you take lessons - Rocksmith can help you learn faster (session mode\or repeater). Plus this game is cheap,and you can buy it on Summer sale.Ubisoft:Only problems I had with game are freezes (only killing process helps) when you start song. And I think because of bad Custom DLC songs. Game runs without lags, no sound delays, easy interface.Real Tone Cable:There are horror stories about how often this cable breaks - I use it every day and it still working without any problems. Also I heard there are cheap alternatives.DLC:Official are made by Ubisoft with all copyrights etc. and are sold for money (you can buy them twice cheaper on Sale). Unofficial DLC’s made by users\players and can be downloaded for from customsforge.com. There are many songs from games - try search: Doom, Morrowind, Skyrim, Darren Korb (Bastion), Mass Effect M4 Part II by Faunts - 8 minute song which will melt your hands :D and many more. Gear:My first guitar was Rocktile Pro ST60-BK (also bought real tone cable).Now I have Epiphone Les Paul Standard (Black), Marshall MG10CF amp, Boss DS-1 pedal.Useful lessons (search on Youtube):Steve Stine,Lessonface,SecretGuitarTeacher, BB King Guitar Lessons.justinguitar.comThank you for reading, I hope that my experience with RS2014 help you make decision to buy it (or not.).

												Let me begin by saying that I am an experienced guitarist, playing for 34 years, and therefore I am unable to provide a beginner's view of this software. If you are a beginner reading this review, please understand that I can't fully appreciate the suitability of this software to your personal needs as a new player. I hope that you will still find my review useful.RS2014 is an interactive songbook which features fully notated guitar and bass arrangements for a great many popular songs, mainly from the past few decades. The base content is diverse, and the DLC includes a wide variety of genres and styles with the abilty to download band or theme packs or individual songs. Many songs have two guitar parts, plus bass. Not all songs have two guitar parts, but you'll find plenty to keep you busy.The way the notation is presented may be difficult to get used to at first, especially if you are used to using TAB up until now, but you will adapt to it and find it quite intuitive. Beginners seem to have little trouble adapting where experienced players may be more....resistant :XRS2014 is the ultimate practice tool, motivating you to pick up the instrument often and therefore practice regularly. There are lesson features and technique guides which cover many aspects of guitar playing, like hammer-ons, slides, harmonics, pull-offs, etc. Some arcade style games are included, using the guitar as the controller. These games are designed to improve your skills and muscle-memory.A session mode includes a band that dynamically plays according to your own playing intensity. This is a useful jamming tool, and good for practicing and learning scales.'Learn A Song' is the main part of Rocksmith, and the notation will be simplified at first, then as you improve it gets harder until you have the whole tune. At the end of each song you will get stats on the percentage of correct notes hit and your longest continuous streak. This is a fun way to learn new songs and you always have something ready to practice, just a few clicks away.With very few acceptions, the songs are the actual recordings by original artists, so you'll be playing along to tracks that sound like they should. Additionally, your guitar tone will sound like the guitar in the recorded version, allowing you to play the song more authentically. This raises the immersion and enjoyment level as well. I don't know if the emulation is perfect, but it is certainly very good.For added motivation you can use the leaderboards, though I don't personally, but many others do and seem to enjoy the challenge very much.You need the Real Tone Cable to use this software. I like RS2014 so much I bought an extra cable. Check online stores. One cable is compatible with all platforms and works with guitar or bass.There are literally thousands of hours of value to be found amongst the core content and the additional songs available as DLC. This is not a game, this is a guitar practice portal. Rocksmith is a digital interface for an interactive guitar tutorial/songbook which encourages you to practice, makes you want to play, helps you hone your techniques, and teaches you songs.Rock on, brothers and sisters.Oh - and Hendrix. So, yeah.			"

												I just uninstalled it. After ~ 170 hours.Because I wanna sell my pc.For money.That I will spend on a new guitar.*Edit: (now its kinda a real review ;D) I started with this game/program and it helped me to teach myself a little of guitar but mainly bass, and it helps you a lot to become familiar with your instrument and the techniques. This was great for me because I already knew music theory from my epic Sax playing :P After some time you can simply switch to normal tabs/sheets with tabs like me. If you start learning songs in Rocksmith, you should REALLY practice through a real Amp, too, because, no matter how well your system is set up, you HAVE a delay with the Rocksmith Interface Cable. This confuses your ""sense of rythm"" or how you wanna call it on the instrument and really makes it almost impossible to play faster stuff (I noticed it on Toxicity by SOAD) if you really hear yourself playing with that delay. But for a total guitar beginner it was great in my experience.			"

												I am a guitar Player. I've been playing it for over 15 years. I bought the game out of curiosity, and what can I say? It impressed me. I remember my days learning to play guitar. The basics are crucial. The exercise and motivation are crucial. It is very difficult to do it by yourself. I needed a teacher for over 6 months before I could start searching and learning things on my own. With Rocksmith you have a teacher at your place. Not only have everything you need to learn to play guitar, but it’s also fun for people that already know how to play. People compare this to Guitar Hero, saying it’s like Guitar Hero but with a real guitar. I wouldn’t say that. Guitar Hero it’s an awesome and fun game, but what Guitar Hero can teach you musically ends in maybe a month. I think Guitar Hero can teach you a little bit of rhythm, but that’s it.The only issue you might have is that you need the cable to play it. Also, it does not support a lot of Audio Cards, so if you have a good Card installed, you will have to switch it to the one that came with your motherboard or so. That is my only complaint. I have a Monster Cable with a M-Audio interface, and I need to use the cable they give me. I don’t buy the whole “it’s to protect us from piracy crap”… but oh well.Buy the game if you want to learn to play guitar or just have fun "

Rocksmith 2014I'm absolutely in love with this game. Learning to play guitar or bass has never been more fun than this. All you need is your electric guitar or bass of choice, the game and a cable that you can buy in a lot of stores that sell things related to music or just electronics in general. When you first start up the game you get to set up a few things just so that you get the most out of your Rocksmith experience. I went with the option of starting out as someone who has never played guitar previously although I did have some knowledge about how to play. If my memory isn't failing me you get to calibrate and tune your guitar before the game lets you continue onwards. The game then explains the basics and how the layout of the so called 'Note Highway' will show you what notes to hit on the guitar. After you've made it through the basics you're ready to go! At the start menu there are a lot of options to choose from such as 'Learn a song', 'Lessons' and 'Guitarcade'. As most other people I went with Learn a song instantly because I was so excited to start playing songs. If you chose the option of starting out as a complete beginner the game will take it easy in the beginning by only giving you a few notes now and then. It will feel slow but it was still enjoyable for me. The way this works is that the more notes you hit and the better you do will increase the amount of notes you get on screen. This is called 'Dynamic Difficulty' and is one of the main reasons Rocksmith actually works as well as it does.I would recommend starting out in Lessons learning some more of the basic stuff like posture, picking and how to use a strap if you want to play while standing up. I think that most people, like me prefer sitting down when playing Rocksmith or they just don't have a strap to stand up. There are a lot of great lessons ranging from the more simple techniques like chords to the advanced stuff like tapping.Something that a lot of beginners tend to neglect is the Guitarcade, I really think that the Guitarcade is one of the most important features of Rocksmith as the mini-games are fun and help you build up muscle memory that you will need if you want to play the guitar. One of the best mini-games for me is the 'String skip saloon' as it helps you learn to hit the right strings without looking. 'Ducks ReDux' is another important one teaching you the distance between the frets of your chosen instrument.The most commonly asked question is probably: ""Does Rocksmith 2014 really work?""Yes! It most definitely works. It provides the motivation and fun aspect needed to learn to play the guitar and your favourite songs. If you are thinking about buying this game and your biggest concern is ""does it actually work?"" then buy it and see for yourself, I can guarantee that you will atleast to some degree improve your playing and general technique.Rocksmith 2014 has to be one of my favourite games of all time just because of how detailed and enjoyable it is. A function that I didn't even discuss but is a great way to get better is the 'Riff Repeater'. It lets you slow down and practice certain sections of a song or a lesson and really fiddle around with a lot of settings to make it easier for you to learn. Also in 'Session mode' you can jam with AI musicians playing scales at your own tempo and with a lot of different instruments.10/10- Liam			"

												If you think the first one was good, Rocksmith 2014 is light years ahead! RS2014 is faster, better and harder, automatic tone switching is awesome and the system that recognizes the notes has been improved and you will have to play really good if you want a good score, it's more responsive to mistakes but if you have problem with a riff or section the Riff Repeater will help you in a faster and simpler way.Guitarcade is simply awesome, that section alone is worth the price of the game but if you're still hesitating, the game includes the Session Mode, that mode is simply one of the best innovations that  I've seen in game history, seriously Rocksmith 2014 can be considered a game only because it's entertaining and fun but this software is a state of the art learning tool, it should be sold in instruments stores. If you're willing to spend $100 an hour on a teacher better grab Rocksmith 2014 and use it to improve your skills, to get faster, to master some techniques, the first years of learning at music schools are always frustrating, hours and hours and hundreds of dollars to play boring scales, RS2014 will help you with that, you'll feel motivated and with practice and dedication you will be a better guitar or bass player, after that if you still want some proper music education you can always pay for lessons or a teacher but you won't struggle anymore with the basics and your teacher will see that you're not a beginner but a Rocksmith player, the real stuff!!! Now do yourself a favor and get rid of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plastic joke, yeah I'm talking about that piece of crap Rock Band and Guitar Hero call a guitar LOL.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is not only for beginners who want to learn how to play, but also for fairly experienced players who wants to improve their skills or simply take advantage of the many tools in-game. There are several modes:''Learn A Song'' which allows you to play along to one of the songs that are included in the game or can be bought as a DLC. It might be remind you a bit about games like Guitar Hero. The difficulty adapts after how good you are, and get harder and harder as you learn more and more.  ''Session Mode'' gives you a virtual band to play with! You can customize and choose your scales, tempo, groove, atmosphere (club, studio, arena) and what instruments that is in your band. Or you can load up a stock one, like ''Electric Blues'' or ''Psychedelic Rock'' all after what music you intend to play.There are also a whole catalouge of lessons that learns you everything from playing chords and the basic scales (and even how to hold your guitar, lel), through harmonics, hammer-on's and pull-off's, to the master classes. Also there are arcade style mini-games that let's you train on your tecnhicques. Temple of Bends, Scale Warrior and Harmonic Heist are some examples. Along with that you get some very useful tools. The tuner which allows you not only to standardize your tuning, but also change into different tunings based on the song you are playing. So it might be smart to plan ahead so you aren't stuck too long in the tuner. Also you get ''Tone Editor'' which allows you to change your effects, pedals and amps. Coolest product placement ever with Eden, Orange and Marshall. Every song that you play also have an ''authentic tone'' that loads up when you start the song. If for example the solo and the riff has different tones in a song it changes automatically. You can also load up these in Tone Editor so you can play with it in Session Mode. The included songs ranges from hits like ''My Generation'' and ''We Are The Champions'' to songs from underated indie bands that no one has ever heard of. Try to play every song, you might find something you like. If you have the original Rocksmith you can import them with updated tabs or you can buy it if you didn't own it previosly.Looking at the large amount of DLC, it's easy to think of this as another ''DLC: The Game'' but it isn't. New songs are released to this game constantly, but the artists need to be paid. So you have to pay for the license.If a song you like hasn't been released however, you can download custom songs for free using some modding tools. They might be faulty however since they are made by sparetime modders. There are some things to remember though: This is not Rock Band or Guitar Hero. You might and should have fun while playing this game, but remember it's an educational game. This means that you can't expect to learn the songs by playing it over and over again. You have to go deeper and use the ''Riff Repeater''. Riff Repeater allows you to slow down certain sections of a song and play it at any speed you want, again and again until you get it. Also this is a TOOL not some kind of potion that magically transforms you into Jimmy Page. The challenge to take the skills you learn in the game into the real world might be tough. Sometimes you will find yourself cutting shortcuts just to hit the notes, which makes things even worse (espescially when soloing). If you really want to learn, you are gonna have to use other means too. In short: It is a great game if you want to learn the basics of guitar/bass, improve your skills or just have some fun. Use it with caution and don't rely solely on it if you want to learn guitar properly. Great songs, good tabs and useful tools. It's worth buying for every aspiring or aspired guitar player out there.			"

												Rocksmith is a brilliant package. It's essentially a self-contained training program. The main component is an automatic tab player that lets you play along to album versions of songs. The self-adjusting diffuculty is key here - if you're playing well, the game scales up the complexity of the tabs to match, eventually having you play the song for real, chords and all. The majority of the songs come with seperate lead guitar, rhythm guitar and bass guitar tracks, so you don't have to stop at learning just one part of a whole song.The game also comes with a collection of arcade-style games designed to help you develop muscle memory, teach you chord names, fretting, scales, bends, harmonics - the works. There's also a dedicated lesson section to help you learn the basics of guitar playing and maintenance. Another interesting feature is ""Session Mode."" Here, the game lets you set up a virtual band that plays along with you. You play hard and fast, so do they. Play softer, they slow down too. It essentially gives you a crash course on how songs flow and gives you a free environment to get creative with your playing.Now, the bad news: while it IS good, Rocksmith is not going to magically turn you into some kind of Hendrix-Slash-Dylan-Malmsteen-hybrid guitar beast. Think of it as a tool, not a magic potion. If you want to learn guitar, and you're serious about it, Rocksmith will definitely help. In the end, though, it comes down to you.Basically, let me put it like this: the game has an achievement named ""0.25% of the 10,000 Hour Rule."" Google it.			"

												Posted on 8/17/2016I purchased this software 3 months before my 49th birthday.  I had always wanted to learn to play the guitar but I just never had the time or money to do it before so I had absolutely no experience when purchased.  I was a total novice.The initial investment was expensive (I purchased a very cheap electric guitar online along with the realtone cable and some picks, a strap, etc.)When I first started the lessons I was having some trouble with the software not picking up the notes as I played them but this was fixed by turning the gain on the realtone cable up to around 5.5 db or so (2/3 of way up bar.)  Once this was fixed I spent the next 3 weeks injuring my left wrist by playing as much as my  body could stand.I had to take a week off of playing.  When I went back I quickly realized my fingers were too short and fat to effectively play a 6-string at the level required.  I was muting way too many strings.  My chords sounded awful and I couldn't get passed 60% mastery on any songs.Before I totally accepted defeat I decided to bite the bullet and invest in a bass.  Probably a better bass than I should have.The first song the program suggested to me was Def Leopard ""Pour some sugar on me.""  As I was playing it I noticed (with more than a little amusement) that the entire song only uses 2 strings.  Since the program slowly shows you more and more notes as you play (you start off only playing certain notes in a bass line and the program will slowly fill in more notes as you properly hit the ones they are displaying [it is genius]) it took me around 5 tries hit 102% mastery on it.  This truly boosted my confidence.  While this song is easy to play I do love it and have since I was a teenager *cough* As I tried more difficult songs and moved through the bass lessons and mini-games I realized that the extra space the neck of the bass provides between the strings allowed my fingers to move a bit more easily up and down the fretboard.  The thicker strings also stood out more to my pudgy fingers.I am sharing all of this with you, reader, essentially to say that now that it is 2 weeks before my 49th birthday I just tried to play ""Everlong"" by the Foo Fighters and nailed a 99% accuracy on my 2nd try.I am bouncing up and down the fretboard like I have been playing the bass for a year.  The more difficult songs still give me trouble.  ""Play that funky music"" by Wild Cherry and ""Satch Boogie"" by the great Joe Satriani are examples of just hellish bass lines.I have managed to impress all my friends and I play a version of ""Hollow"" by Alice in Chains that brings chills to them (they say.)At this point I will only get better at the bass and I cannot believe how well this program has taught me (along with help from some youtube courses to nail techniques.)If you are willing to put in the time, money, effort and maybe even some blood this program will teach you how to play a guitar or bass.  How well you do does depend a bit on talent of course.I whole heartedly recommend this program.  It has been worth every penny.  But I usually wait for a good sale to get the expensive song packs.

												Well I've played over 300 hours on this, so I guess I like it.Compared the first Rocksmith it's streets ahead, it's almost like a totally different game, the latency is better the modes are better, the guitarcade is awesome and Session mode makes me lose huge chunks out of my day.Is it perfect, no but it's pretty good.

												I would describe Rocksmith as a learning tool disguised at a game. I have used it for practicing guitar and bass, and my skills have developed a lot since I started playing the game.There is a plethora of features to be found in Rocksmith 2014, the most prominent being Learn a Song mode. In Learn a Song mode, the game basically plays similarly to Guitar Hero, except the notes may span the entire fretboard of the actual instrument you are playing (guitar/bass). When you are first beginning, the songs are watered-down. Rocksmith decides to just throw a few notes at you at a time, until you get the hang of it, then it gradually increases the complexity until you are playing it just the way it was recorded. The game registers all kinds of techniques that are used with a guitar, such as hammer-ons pull-offs, slides, bends, harmonics, palm-mutes, etc. The Real-Tone cable just knows. You can unlock new songs by doing missions, you can also buy song-packs as DLC.Another feature I enjoy is Session Mode. It allows you to program a backing band that plays according to the scale that you are playing. It sounds really sweet and gives you a feel of playing with an actual band. Session mode also gives you some pretty good tutoring about scales, and playing with a band if you follow the in-game missions. Also, the game offers a huge amount of video based, interactive guitar lessons, to help out the newbies, and experienced players too.Rocksmith has local multiplayer for Score-Attack mode, Session mode, and Learn a Song mode. It works great, you just need to have two of the Real-Tone cables (and two guitars, of course.)There is a tone designer within Rocksmith, which basically allows you to choose equipment and effects for the game to synthesise. Allow me to say, the game sounds almost as good as my amplifier through my stereo, and the latency for playing a note is unnoticable. You can unlock new sounds for your guitar, just by playing the game.Rocksmith also offers arcade-style games to help you practice with techniques, which are pretty fun, to say the least. I have put in a lot of hours just trying to get the achievements in these, and I'm still working at it.Does anyone else play this? Add me through Steam if you do, I would love to have some friends to compare scores with and stuff. I got it around Christmas time and I'm up to 250 hours through Steam (only counting online sessions.)			"

												Rocksmith will really help you improve on your skills, Rocksmith 2014 is a good sequel to the first game and is worth the purchase. I started off with Rocksmith 2012, played over 130 hours of that and here we are, 2013, over 120 hours of 2014 played and i am a hell of a lot better than i was at playing guitar before. Now, of course this does not replace an actual teacher but for the price, and the fun... It's very much worth it. The only thing i would like to say is there are issues that STILL have not been fixed. Tuning in this game is all over the place, one second the volume is too high and the next it's too low. But putting aside the small issues, i highly recommend this game, or the first game. Either will be great fun and help you become a GUUUITTARR LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe not, but you will get close :]*EDIT* There are now custom songs for 2014, and lots of them.			"

												Incredible piece of software. I tried to learn guitar when I was 18 and then again at around 22 and quit both times after struggling just to learn a few basic riffs. At 27, I  thought I'd give it one last hurrah and my fiancee purchased me Rocksmith 2014 to assist in my learning.  I've been playing Rocksmith 2014 since July 2015 and I'm excited to say that I can play full songs now. Not just one or two, but over one hundred at 90%+ accuracy. I still have a long way to go but I believe Rocksmith has cemented this as a life-long hobby for me. The developers are amazing and released a free ""Remastered"" update for existing owners of the game. They also release DLC song packs on a weekly basis, and while they are not free, they are an excellent value considering the price of lessons and how accurate the tracking of the notes is. I recommend this software wholeheartedly to anyone aspiring to learn electric guitar or bass.			"

												After decades of playing (off and on), I can say without hesitation that this is the BEST method for learning songs on guitar and bass I've ever come across.  I think my hours played alone vouches for the game's appeal and effectiveness.  Can't really speak to this effectiveness for completely new guitar players though.  I imagine it could be difficult for some, but I would recommend its use in conjunction with a knowledgeable traditional teacher.The absolutely best feature of this program is the Riff Repeater -- and this has been improved in the  latest Remastered edition.  The ability to slow down a song or even a portion of it to work on a difficult section is PRICELESS!!And check out the Weekly Guitar and Bass Challenges on the UIbisoft Rocksmith 2014 forum.  These are for ALL skill levels -- from complete beginner to expert -- and are a great way to improve with community support.http://forums.ubi.com/forumdisplay.php/151-Rocksmith-2014-Edition "

												I was dubious at first about Rocksmith 2014, mainly due to how quickly I grew tired of Rock Band and Guitar Hero. However, those fears were quickly put to rest due to one simple element - the use of a real instrument. I've been playing guitar on and off for over a decade now, but hadn't played for a few years due to no longer being in a band. So Rocksmith was a great excuse to pick it back up and give it another go.So if you had any fears about this being another Rock Band or Guitar Hero put them to bed, this is guitar tutorial software wrapped up as a game. It'll take you through all the techniques you need to know to play guitar, with explinations and video demos. It even teaches you scales... SCALES! Imagine that. Scales in a music game. Black Magic.It does a good job of easing you into the program, and providing you with some lessons and advice before jumping into a song. When you do pick a song to play it starts off with an easy note track to follow and play. Basically a reduced note count, often root notes, to get you used to the song and moving single fingers around the fret board. As you get better at the song the complexity increases and chords start to form, and more notes in a bar (Section of music) appear too. This can be a little confusing at first, especially if you're somewhat used to playing guitar and want to play all the notes you hear, however from a beginner's point of view I can imagine this is a very useful level progression to build up confidence.There is a slight 'delay' from auido input of guitar to audio output through the headphones, which can be a little disorientating, however you grow used to it if you continue to play. Other than this I've had no real issues with the game, and enjoy an hour or two once and a while.I've lost countless hours just jamming away in the Session Mode, while it isn't as complex as I hoped it's still a good little tool for popping out riffs and licks. I think the only real issue I have with Rocksmith at the moment is the lack of some genuine Classic Rock songs in the track list, however I'm hoping this will be resolved via DLC at some point. So if you've been interested in guitar and sort of held back about learning then this could be a useful game for you, especially if it has songs you like on the set list/DLC. Likewise if you have a guitar but haven't touched it for ages due to a lack of interest, why not dust it down and plug in! The only caution about buying the Steam Version of the game is that it DOES NOT come with the Real Tone cable that you'll need to play. However, you can pick up Rocksmith with a Real Tone Cable very cheap on Amazon (with the added bonus of being to port over the RS1 songs to RS2!).			"

												SOME TiPS TO GET THE MOST FROM THiS AWESOME GAME AND TO MiNiMiSE FRUSTRATiON: ( Please Thumb Up if this helps so that others get to see! )Rocksmith 2014 is VERY sensitive to deviations in tuning. Contrary to the usual recommendation that light strings ( < 9's ) are better for beginners (because they are kinder on the fingers) I would suggest that, for Rocksmith, slightly heavier, medium strings will serve you better in playing this game. (try 10's on regular guitars, perhaps even 11's on shorter scale guitars: Les Pauls, Jags, Mustangs etc.) This is becuase the thicker strings tend to be more stable in pitch and also deliver a stronger signal than those skinny, so called 'easy' strings. Trust me - it's more important for this sortware to 'hear' your notes consistently and in tune. Those bendy, skinny strings' pitch will veer all over the place as your fingers struggle to learn their correct position and pressure. Slightly firmer strings give more positive response and feedback - Your fingers will toughen up soon enough cry-babies! GET NEW STRiNGS! - Especially if you have an old guitar that's had the same strings since it got chucked in the back of Dads cupboard back in 1979; don't wait for them to break! - I put Ernie Ball Slinky 10's on an old Stagg Strat I was given and was astonished at the strong bright tone they delivered. Compared to with the dull old 9's that were on it before, this was like a whole new instrument!THE PERFECT ViSUAL AiD FOR NEW ROCKSMiTH PLAYERS -  Dr Neon strings UK[www.amazon.co.uk] USA[www.amazon.com] may look a bit gaudy however they perfectly match the Rocksmith string colouring system and this really, REALLY helps to coordinate my fingers, moreso than I thought they would and particularly in the guitarcade excercises where I'm learning to move my fingers quickly between chords. Once I'm at the stage where I can play without looking at my fingers, then I'll switch back to Ernies or Elixirs or or such-like. 'til then, these definitely have accelerated my progress!TUNiNG, TUNiNG, TUNiNG. I can't emphasise it enough. I often found this game incredibly frustrating when I'd see myself missing notes I'd swear I'd hit. I assumed at first it was because of my utterly crap technique but soon realised that often I'd hit a note or chord and it just wasn't being recognised. This became particularly apparent in the Guitarcade modules, Starchords and Castle Chordead, where I'd find myself thrashing away at a perfect simple chord with no effect as the opposition chewed me up. Getting an expensive new guitar made very little difference  (:-o - What I've since discovered is that keeping your guitar perfectly in tune is what makes the critical difference. Make sure also that your guitar is in tune all the way up the neck. If the intonation is out, Rocksmith is extremely unforgiving; consider investing in getting the instrument serviced by an experienced guitar tech. Even if it's a dirt cheap guitar, having decent strings, optimal action and accurate intonation will help avoid a whole world of Rocksmith pain, perhaps even make the difference between keeping your guitar or defenestrating it. Seriously, even Eric Clapton would suck at Rocksmith if his boutique vintage strat ""Blackie"" was out of intonation.HERE'S A TiP FOR GUiTARCADE - Pausing the game, you can see a little tuning meter at the bottom left of the display that indicates which note you are playing and the degree by which it is sharp or flat - Sound each string repeatedly and make sure the circle around the note lights up promptly and consistently to indicate it's in tune. I find this tuning method far more effective than the dedicated tuning module you get at the beginning of each song - Your foes will fall before you!Finally: TiMiNG, TiMiNG, TiMiNG! - It was when I was getting to grips with ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" that I realised that there was a very slight but significant difference between the music I was hearing, and the moment the chords ""arrived"" in the display. I didn't know whether to play the chord the instant when I see it or when I hear it? The answer is in the Audio Settings where you can adjust a delay setting. On my own Mac this corrected the difference on a setting of 4 - (Setting the delay at 0 caused an alarming bug/issue where all sound became completely distorted - Robot Voice says ""Raa.aa.ck.smm.iithh"") Once I'd nailed the timing setting (trial and error) my playing has really come together quite literally. Specifically, I can look away from the display and when I look back I haven't missed the notes because the display, the song and my guitar are all syncronised.OKAY - so this hasn't been intended as a review - It's just my hope that sharing what I've learned in fine tuning this amazing game helps you to find it as rewarding as I do and ensures that you get to enjoy playing WiTH Rocksmith rather than against it. - If you've found what I share helpful then please give it a thumbs up promotion so that others get to see it too.Thanks - Pól			"

												Rocksmith 2014 Remastered9.99 / 10.0 Rocksmith  Rocksmith 2014 Remastered Learning to play Guitar or Bass is a lot of Fun with this game; heck, just playing along with your favorite song is a blast. You play Guitar or Bass? then this game is for you. There is nothing like this software out there.... Unique.I purchased both Rocksmith (original) and Rocksmith 2014 (auto upgraded to Remastered version) and I am telling you to buy both. Buying both gives you access to more songs. Any song purchased in the older Rocksmith(original) version is automatically installed in the 2014 Remastered version. Rocksmith Original: 51 songs (6 unlockable, 169 DLC)Rocksmith 2014: 55 songs (10 unlockable, 800+ DLC and growing)Customforge 2016: always adding custom DLC (CDLC) == FREEMany basic skills are covered in this game; although nothing beats a real teacher for instruction on tone, clarity, smoothness, and savoir faire; THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU MINUTE BY MINUTE the most pleasure per dollar spent; your teacher cannot match this. It is literally as fun as jamming on weekends with your band. Pure fun. Pure entertainment. Pure value. Get it.NotaBene1) when you purchase the Rocksmith(original game) add the ‘disc import tool’ to import the original songs. DLC is automatically transferred to the 2014 Remastered version whether or not you purchase the disc import tool.2) Fun includes discovering songs and styles that you do not listen to on the radio or in your car.... Play every song that you can and learn; I discovered Bob Dylan for the first time on my Bass Guitar [Bob won the Nobel !]3) Don’t like the Steam/PC choices of songs? Just download all the custom DLC that is on the .net [free].... Heck, why don’t you make custom DLC of your favorite song and upload it so that everybody can learn the song that you love?!My scoring system / 1010 / exemplary execution of the genre with compelling innovation9 / exemplary execution of the genre don’t miss out, for fans of the genre and the curious alike8 / for well done not a must play, fans of the genre and newbs will be happy it is well done 7 / for calibrated expectations only, fans of the genre would not miss out if they skipped this6 / only for serious fans of the genre for whom game play with bugs is acceptable5 / enough bugs to make me unhappy			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is a great improvment to the original Rocksmith. It feels fluid and there is no more loadtimes in the same song when you try to Riffrepeat.Having features like the Riffrepeater, tuner and all the guitarcade games, makes Rocksmith 2014 truly the fastest and by miles the most fun way to learn to play the guitar.The Added session mode is one hell of a feature, just try it and play with a virtual band and it'll feel awesome and also you will learn new tricks.

												I was that guy.. Ive probably tried learning guitar around 10 times since the age of 11. Always start of well... but then get bored with the lack of direction and inspiration.UNTIL NOW!! After seeing this game advertised on steam and looking at videos I was intrigued enough to purchase it from amazon (free usb cable) I have been regularly putting in hours everyday and can definatly see improvements. I could go on about all its amazing features, but I would like to keep this short. This game inspires you to believe that you can play guitar. The learning curve can be steep at times but the entertainment value makes it worthwhile.  There is no doubt that down the line you will need to do your own research into theory etc. But this is by far the best software to get you playing songs you know!!You can even download Custom DLC for FREE... Any song ive wanted to play, ive found..Well done Ubisoft..  10/10  Would lick guitar strings again.. :)			"

												While not a substitute for a *good* teacher, it is a much better option than many crappy teachers, and most guitar teachers are pretty crappy. While I haven't gotten to ""hero"" yet, I've gone from Zero, to well, having callouses and being able to improvise over scales in a mere 30-something hours of practice with the app. The way I've been explaining this game to my friends is, think Guitar Hero but make it an educational game with a real guitar. Individual phrases are simplified and you level them up individually from each other, and instead of ""failing"" you if you miss too many notes the game tries to keep you at a level to where you're on your toes.One thing I really appreciate about this game is that it's teaching me actual songs I can relate to. I sat down the other day to practice a prhase from one of the Radiohead songs, realized it's in the same key as the primary Salsa riff, the Game of Thrones theme, the Legend of Zelda theme and the Super Mario Castle music, and had a lot of fun going between them all. I'm not just learning more about the guitar, I'm learning more about music.One thing I find really frustrating with this game is that it has a hard time recognizing my playing of some techniques. It doesn't recognize a vast majority of my pitch bends, for example, though an accomplished guitarist friend of mine says they're fine. The game doesn't offer any feedback on how I might improve them, other than to watch the tutorial video again.Overall, if you want to learn guitar, it's hard to go wrong with this game as part of a larger practice. Props to Ubisoft for creating something that's more about learning and less about ego.			"

												If you want to learn the Electric Guitar or Bass in the comfort of your home while stoned and or drunk this is the way to do it. It takes Guitar Hero/Rock Band but instead of using 5 buttons you use a real guitar struming the real notes to the song while it plays the actual  note you play. It has a very nice step up system for learning the song starting off with the basic easy notes and as you play it successfully it adds in more notes until your playing the full actuall song.It also has a hand full of mini games for warming up and fine tuning your skills*************************************************WARNING YOU DO NEED AN ADAPTER THAT CONNECTS YOUR GUITAR/BASS TO THE USB*************************************************************You need it to play, Eb games or any pawn shop well have one for cheap			"

												It's like Guitar Hero, but with a real guitar.It's pretty good, and will actually teach you songs. Although the multiplayer being constricted to local only is annoying, meeting up with friends to jam is a fun experience. New songs get added to the game very regularly.I'd reccomend it if you either want a hard, realistic version of guitar hero, or want an easy and fun way to learn songs. (I would not, however, reccomend making this your only method of learning songs.)			"

												TL:DR editionBasically Guitar Hero for guitarists, Rocksmith 2014 lets you play along with popular songs with either a 6-string electric guitar or a 4-string electric bass. You do need to buy a cable to plug your guitar into your computer, a special 6.5mm-USB cable specifically for Rocksmith which adds roughly $40 onto the cost of the game if you don't already own one so keep that in mind before buying it. Also DLC is expensive, just buy Cherub Rock and mod in songs instead.+great tool for learning guitar (if paired with other things)+fun way to practice+solid selection of tracks in base game+easy to mod+supports both guitar and bass+local 2p multiplayer-only 2p multiplayer-requires an overpriced cable-overpriced DLC9/10Full ver.This game is pretty much perfect, and I would say it's an incredible tool both for people who want to learn guitar or bass and for those who already play and just want to jam some new songs. There's also a solid modding community who are constantly making ""custom DLC""/CDLC/mods that import songs into the game unofficially.I used to find the ""dynamic difficulty"" feature annoying and patronising in the first Rocksmith, you'd start off playing one note every 4 bars and the game would get harder as you improved. In the beginning it was annoying because it was too easy, once you got to a solid difficulty it was still annoying because it would drop you back down to baby mode if you ever made a mistake. This feature makes a return in Rocksmith 2014, but is vastly improved by the option to turn it off if you already know what you're doing.I like that it has local multiplayer, a rarity in PC games, however it is a bit of a shame that you can only have two players at a time. Most songs on Rocksmith 2014 have 3 different parts for each song (rhythm, lead, bass). Unlike a console, you can have more than 2 USB ports and multiple displays on a PC and it would've been really cool for Ubisoft to include the option to have a third player on a second monitor. This way, a whole band (sans drummer) can practice and jam together.There are really only a few minor issues I have with Rocksmith 2014, one of which is the tuner. It's pretty sensitive, which is good, but its idea of a guitar being in tune is a bit too lenient imo. A few times the game would tell me a string was tuned when I could clearly hear that it was out in relation to other strings.Also, the game seems to have trouble detecting very low bass notes, low Cs are missed in songs that call for C standard or drop C tuning but maybe that's just my bass' volume being too low. I wouldn't know since I don't have a second one to test on multiple instruments.Another problem is that many tracks teach the player ways to play the song that are harder than necessary. Gonna get a bit technical here. Keep in mind that in standard bass tuning, the 5th fret of every string plays the open note of the next string, meaning the 7th fret note of the E string (a B) plays the same note as the 2nd fret of the A string. Many songs will have you moving from, say, the 2nd fret to the 7th on the same string, when it would be much easier to stay on the 2nd fret but play the next string. R U Mine? by the Arctic Monkeys is a very good example of the game making a song harder than it has to be.My final, and biggest, problem with this game is the pricing. Going by current conversion rates, the game costs $53.65 AUD. This would be a very reasonable price, however buying a separate Rocksmith ""Real Tone"" Cable is required to play and adds roughly $40 AUD onto the price (and a guitar, fairly obviously). The game offers a decent amount of songs without DLC but you'll want to make sure the song list is VERY much in line with your music taste if you want to get a decent experience from the base game. DLC songs cost $4 AUD EACH, which I think is a pretty unreasonable ask for one song, especially because this game has around 480 DLC songs at this point. Even if you don't care about most of the DLC songs it's still likely to run you a few hundred bucks for the ones you want. Thankfully the only DLC you need to buy is Cherub Rock so you can mod in CDLC. After that just torrent the other official DLC or wait until a sale if you REALLY want to buy it.			"

												One part rhythm game, one part music instructor, Rocksmith 2014 takes away much of the tedium of learning and practicing the guitar by presenting drills and exercises as games. There are plenty of video lessons included, complete with ""graded"" practice tracks to help you with the techniques. Songs are learned through a system that auto-adjusts difficulty depending on how well you are doing, and the Riff Repeater allows the user to stop, slow down, and loop segments of the music (even the entire song) to help master difficult passages.The song selection included with the base game[en.wikipedia.org] is decent, and the catalog of music available through DLC[en.wikipedia.org] is incredible, offering a wide range of (mostly) western music across a number of decades and genres. Another fifty or so songs[en.wikipedia.org] can be added cheaply and easily with the purchase of the original Rocksmith and the Disc Import Tool, which re-licenses the song list so it can be used in RS2014. All songs are by the original artists; no cheesy remakes. (It's fair to warn people that due to licensing issues there are a few songs which do not transfer from RS to RS2014. Notably, the Clapton songs. These songs are still playable in the original Rocksmith, however.)I would highly recommend Rocksmith 2014 to anyone involved with the electric guitar. Whether you are picking up the instrument for the first time, or have been playing for decades and would just like something fun to help motivate practice and master a few difficult songs, there should be something for you to use.

												great gamea helpfull tool to learn guitarit can be a fun game for both beginner and the more experience guitar playerthe best thing about this game is dynamic difficulty , it allows the game to adjust the difficulty of the songs to your skill levelfor a beginner the song would be reduced to its very core by only playing the root notes, this will make it so you can play the song and it will still be recognisable for others because all songs are at your skill level you can pretty much play any of them with the help of the game, this gives more variety while you practiceanother issue learning a single song can have is that some parts of a song can be very hard and you will probably take months to be able to play that part, but here you can play a reduced version of that part that is within your skill level, and its more fun to play a song because it will still sound good even if you play less in the hard partso you'll play this song more=more practiceanother great thing about being able to play more songs is that some songs require different techniques and these might be executed at different speeds or they move around the neck moreso in song x you for example a set of slow barré chords while in song y they are done much faster, now if you start learning barré chords you might be able to play them in song x but not yso you can practice barré chords when you play x and suddenly song y  will become easier because even though you just played x for fun you still practiced these techniquesand practice is all you need to do to get better, doesn't mean it can be funthis makes the game so good for me you can just have fun and still get that hard needed practicethe game also has some interactive lessons that will teach you pretty much anything a person that never touched a guitar has to know, while it isn't perfect it does the job, and maybe some video's on the internet, can help too, but an experienced guitar player will always be better   another great tool is the riff repeater it allows you to adjust the songs difficulty, or if you wanna start practicing a certain section of the song, you can set it to loop that specific part and adjust speed, difficulty, pretty much anything you wantits great, easy to acces and you can approach learning a song in a more traditional way( slow it down and slowly ramp up the speed)the more gamey parts of the game consist of a score attack for the songs with some set difficulties guitar hero styleand you also have the guitar arcade, these are mini games that are build around a certain guitar technique, you have some that help you have an on rail shooter where you kill the enemies by playing the chords shown on screen, you have a saloon where enemies come down 6 lanes and you shoot them by playing the coresponding string this will help you learn skipping strings, and you got other that help you learn scales move around the board, they are a fun distraction and it helps you practicethe last big thing of this game is session mode, it is a place for improvising and experimenting, they have created a virtual band for you, you can change what instruments they use and these instruments have a certain style associated with them, jazz, rock metal blues, besides a the normal instruments you find in the average band you also have some more special ones like a kazoo or some rain or city noisesyou can also pick wich scale they will play and in which key, its like haveing a million play along improvise songsbut the best thing is here it can change dynamicly and you can change how much they will vary(from aways playing in same scale and key to dynamicly changing key and scale) you can set the bpm of a song but the band will react to how you play if you play fast they will pick up speed too while if you play relaxed they will also do so,for beginners this might seem overwhelming and it kinda is but the game can slowly guide you through it, it will also tell you what notes will sound good, besides that you can do anything you want and use the plenty effects the game has for your guitarintermediate/experienced players will get less out of the game because dynamic difficulty isn't something they need and they already have the means to learn songs outside of the gamebut if they can get over the unique interface( its easy to read on the fly, but different from anything else)the gamey stuff still exist and the many effects and session mode can still have their value for youbass is also fully supported and it wasn't an afterthoughtyou need the realtone cable thoughoveral i fully reccomend the game  "

												It isn\'t a music teacher and it can\'t spot things that you\'re physically doing wrong (like using the pads of your fingers instead of the tips, or having your nails too long), but this will teach you more than enough to be confident in picking up a guitar at a party and playing in front of everyone.

												I've been a guitarist for 8 years.I've learnt the hard way, learning by tab, by ear, through sessions musicians like Amy Winehouse's Personal Guitarist...but this game reminds me how sloppy of a guitarist and bassist I can still be at time.I don't even use guitar on this because I already know all there is in term on techiniques that are implimented in the game but I love the session mode, I got to try it out pre-release at Gibson HQ in London last year and it caught me.For those like me who own basses but don't get to use Bass much, this is very much for you alike, some of the greatest basslines are in this game and even with CDLC you have unlimited learning of music material on offer to you.It's not a toy.It's not even a game.But it's a SELF TEACHING TOOL and an ENHANCER for those who knows the fingerboard			"

												Awesome game..  I  really love it and play it often for a couple years now.. i have over 1000 hours playing and I have noticed a difference in my playing.  Learing songs is cool and a good motivator to play but the session mode will make you a better guitarist.   Something else that I dont see commented about the game and for me a perfect reason to buy the gaem if nothing else is the AUTHENTIC TONES.  you can just select the tone from a song you like and your guitar sounds just like the guitar in your favorite song.. You can also create tones with sound from just about any guitar equiptment out there.  The cost of just a decent amp  is alot more than this game, and this game offeres you LOTS of amp and pre amp options, with pedals.   soo much to play with.

												If you're wondering whether Rocksmith 2014 can teach you to play guitar with no prior experience, the answer is a resounding yes.  It's not going to teach you perfect technique, but it will get you started on the basics.  You'll likely need to suplement it with youtube lessons (I highly recommend justinguitar), or in person lessons - but they're not necessary to have a good time, and pick up some basic skills.It provides the motivation, enjoyment and sense of progression to keep you playing (and learning), and while I'm by no means ""good"" after 100+ hours, I'm definitely learning, improving, and having a lot of fun.  Sometimes I even sound good while doing it!  This was a great buy, well worth picking up.  The cable can be hard to track down (and is required, no-cable methods just don't work properly), so check you can get one before buying the game.			"

												One of the best music games and the best music simulator on the market. I got some trouble to get the Real Tone Cable in my country because it wasn't sold seperatly but now that I got it I don't regret any time/money I spent to get this game. For what I've saw  I've been getting better playing guitar since I played this, but only more time will tell.10/10 You should buy if you've a guitar or bass.			"

												I've played this game for 16 hours in the past 2 days so I feel like a review is necessary. I've been playing guitar for 17 years and I got this game as a fun way to jam without my band and maybe learn some songs. Little did I know that despite playing for as long as I have, I've learned more in the past 16 hours than I have in probably the past 5 years. Whether you are an experienced guitarist or are thinking about learning, get this game. Period. You will not be disappointed.			"

												I've been playing guitar for roughly 8 years now and only got rocksmith a few months ago, but it's great. I'm having a lot of fun learning new songs, and downloading custom songs is definitely a must, adding potentially hundreds of songs to the setlist. I mean, the technology isn't 100% there are flaws, note recognition being the most damaging to gameplay, but for the most part, rocksmith is a must have for guitarists and bassits. You will have fun mastering songs and developing your skills and techniques.			"

												I've been playing Rocksmith daily for 11 months now and my playing has improved tremendously. Nothing motivates me to practice like this game: I used to find it hard to motivate myself to practice an hour a week but am now playing at least this much every day.I used to think of myself as a decent bass player, but I'd say that I've improved more over this past year than the last 20 years combined. I am now comfortably playing material that I used to think would forever be out of my reach.			"

												great game, it tought me how to play guitar. my only issue with it is that the menu is pretty bad.i will say, the learning progression system didnt work great for me because it starts with just one finger on one string, then slowly adds more strings and more fingers. but its hard to tell which fingers are meant to go in the places that are displayed, so you figure out a hand position. when it adds another finger position suddenly you realize you were putting your fingers wrong and now you cant fit the new chord with your hand. so you have to learn the proper way all at once instead.after realizing this, i turned to the riff repeater. that thing is great, you setup the section of song you want (you can do all the song if you want) and you can turn the dificulty all the way up, then slow it down to 5% or something so you have plenty of time to figure out where your hands go between each chord/note. then once you are comfortable at that speed you turn up the speed.doing this i learnt to play the songs at full speed.there is one thing the game wont teach you though, and thats how to make the notes sound good. it will accept the note as long as its close to the same pitch and timing - if it sounds weird that doesn't matter. i suggest after you can play a song you play it while paused and listen carefully to your notes. this helps you not only hit the notes, but make the notes sound good.

												Very easy review to write, it's a freaking great program.Pros:Rocksmith 2014 is a tremendously efficient guitar tutor masked cleverly as enjoyable entertainment.  If you have any desire to learn guitar or bass you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  Even at full retail price it is bus fare compared to one-on-one guitar training at a music store.  You'll learn the same stuff, perhaps not the nitty gritty theory, but certainly the techniques as you would from a professional tutor but at a fraction of the cost... easy peasy decision.  You will Rock out... oh yes, you will.The Steam version doesn't come with the cable but it can be sourced through Amazon and other retailers.  Be aware that it 'could' cost more than just buying the physical box with the game DVD and cable when they're bought seperate.The only Con:Cost of DLC.  Most songs are 3 bucks a piece, gets expensive fast.  Buy packs where you can, and wait for Steam sales.Edit (March 2017) -250+ hours in, time for an update...I've found that I get the best experience playing Rocksmith if I use pedals, not effects, just pedals to get a better line signal.  I have a buffer, a compressor, and a noise gate and they are all set to be mild to medium in their attack and release.  I find this tightens up the dynamics enough that notes I'm clearly playing that didn't register with the game engine, now do.  It has meant song scores going way up and a near ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic level of joy playing the tunes I like to play... okay maybe that last bit was too far.For anyone that might be interested, here's the rig:Gretsch/Strat -> Boss NS2 -> Friedman SirCompre (omg so cherry) -> TC Bonifide Buffer -> RealTone Cable -> Profit???I've actually got an A/B switcher in place so I can push my pedal board to either the RealTone cable or to my audio interface.So yeah, if you're reading this thinking I like the idea of the game but half of what I play it ignores?  Get a cheap compressor at the minimum, or borrow one to try first before investing that it does indeed work for you, but I think you'll find it does.I mean, I got 'Eye of the Tiger' up to 99.9% and I totally suck!Cheers!

												1. I have both this and the original Rocksmith and this one is better. Though I do miss a few things from the original, that this has superior note recognition, less lag and a few more techniques give it a solid edge.2. I can only review this as someone who has played guitar for years. I think it would work for learning guitar to begin with but what I can say for sure is practicing with this will maintain and improve your guitar skills if you already play. It is much better than just picking up a guitar and noodling around for an hour and it is more fun than practicing with a metronome. The only thing I could recommend over this is jamming with other players.3. For new players: learning guitar takes a long time. That 400 hours you spent before you got really good at twitch shots in Counter Strike, that is not even close. Sorry you had to hear it from me.4. For everyone: learn to play and get good at the songs you don't like. You will be exposed to techniques and rhythms you would otherwise miss. It will make you a better player. 5. Getting 100% on a song does not mean you can actually play it well. I have seen way too many YouTube vids of people 100%ing songs with this that just sound all kinds of shaky rhythmically. This gives you the ability to listen back to your performance. Give your fingers a break and do this every now and again.6. This still has trouble with note tracking on bass sometimes. Sometimes it's pretty severe. Yes, I checked my intonation. 7. If you follow the path specified for you in this game, it makes you spend a lot of time playing w/ these cheesy jam-along tracks and that is just annoying. I dunno about you but playing scale notes to a poor sounding fake classic rock band is just not my idea of a good time. 8. The guitarcade games actually help you so play them. They do help w/ your playing somewhat but they really excel at is keeping your attention on the screen and not on the fretboard since you can't memorize them like you do a song.9. It is kinda a bummer that they make you pay an extra ten bucks to play the tracks from the original game. Or, not so much that, but that you pay ten dollars and it still doesn't transfer your progress over. Sucks to you for that, Ubisoft!10. The feature in this called riff repeater that lets you repeat and slow down tough parts of the songs is way better than in the original where I found it nearly unusable. I do wish you could just play slowed down versions of whole songs though.11. I would not suggest sinking too much money into a guitar for this if you are just beginning. A guitar in the range of like $150 or maybe even cheaper will be perfectly adequate. Buy it at a guitar store and ask if they will check the intonation and set up for you as a condition of your purchase. This is a reasonable thing to do and they won't think you are being a big nerd or anything. 12. Every now and again you will be truly killing it on a rad song and the dumb cable will stop working and you will get really, really mad. Express this anger. You are an artist.13. There is more to life than video games and more to life than playing guitar but if you put both together, you are pretty damn close. Maybe have a kid or something if you feel unfulfilled. I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.			"

												HIGHLY Recommend this if you're serious about learning guitar.  Ive been playing for 7 days at this point and can play 2 songs completely at about 98%.  It works.  Like any instrument, hours of practice is how you get better, but the thing with Rocksmith2014 is that it helps you feel like you aren't 'working' or 'practicing'.  It cleverly disquises learning chords, progressions, scales and harmonics (you know, all the boring ♥♥♥♥) by putting them into arcade games.  It also spoon feeds you (if you need it, which i do) in learn a song mode, gives you a little bit at a time, but also helps you by pushing you with new techniques and chords.  But the BEST FEATURE is RIFF REPEATER,  at any point you can stop the song and repeat any part on any difficulty at any speed up to 100%.  keep cranking up the difficulty and speed until you're playing just like it was written.  Awesome...  my fingers are killin me, but I don't care, I can't stop playing! :)			"

												A little background history: I have had a guitar for like 15 years and never had enough motivation to actually learn chords and such. I've only been practicing specific metal songs from tabs, until now.. One day one of my friends told me that they have the cable and I decided to borrow it, bought the game and started to practice.Now on to the actual review: The game provides lots of lessons, starting from very basic stuff all the way to the ""master"" level lessons. The way things are taught is good and simple, even I understand them!There are also different sorts arcade games in which you can practice different techniques and finger dexterity, altho I have to admit that the game design in these minigames is not that great. Many people might say that it's down right broken, but I'd say that at least you can improve a bit while playing, despite how merciless the minigame might feel like. For example the Harmonic Heist -game can be rage inducing when it comes to the guard you have to avoid. Sometimes you just can't avoid him despite how well you're performing.Learning a song starts off simple enough. Once you've completed your first song the game gives you tips what to do and where to focus on improving. There's also a neat feature called Riff Repeater, which allows you to practice specific parts of the song. You're allowed to slow the song down and practice that part as long as you like. For me this tool has been a blessing.You might wonder if your electronic acoustic guitar works with the game? At least for me it does, but keep in mind that the mics in a acoustic guitar might not be as good as in electronic guitar. For example while doing bends my acoustic's mics are giving me trouble, most of the time I get misses while bending the strings. The problem might be guitar specific but then again, I don't have hard evidence.So far I've loved this game. I've improved a lot and the passion of playing guitar burns bright in me once again. I'd highly recommend the game if you're about to start practicing and have few extra bucks in your pockets. Some purists might say that you'd be better off practicing like they were before the wars, but that is just a preference in my opinion. Pick whatever style you find comfortable for you.4 strings out of 6.			"

												Please ignore my current game time (3.5 hrs), I have played Rocksmith 2014 for well over 100 hours on PS3.Rocksmith 2014 is truely a great way to learn how to play the guitar or bass and it's very ideal as you're not paying for lessons (which could cost more than the game and cable and maybe even some DLC) and you can practice in your own time. If you have an electric or electro acoustic guitar/bass that you haven't learned how to play, money for the cable (I believe it's around €30) and time to dedicate I would strongly recommend you to buy this game. Guitar/bass is a great skill to have in life. I've been playing Rocksmith 2014 for over a year now (26 December 2015 is current date, game bought for PS3 on 19th June 2014)Pros- Easy way to learn guitar/bass- Really fun to play- You can practice in your own time- If you buy Cherub Rock you can also get loads of Custom Downloadable Content (CDLC) from http://customsforge.com- Guitar/bass is fun- The game features an automatic level up/down system called the Riff Repeater. It will judge your skill based on how well you've been playing at the current difficulty and make the riff easier/harder to play.- Loads of DLC and CDLC is available- Includes minigames to practice scales, techniques and chords- Rocksmith can tell you what you need to improve on, for example, if your bending was a little poor Rocksmith will say ""Check out this Bending 101 lesson""Cons- Riff Repeater can sometimes be annoying- The Real Tone cable is pricey and a bit fragile- You don't get a Real Tone cable with the Steam purchase. I would advise you to buy the disc edition starter bundle (two exist, one with game and cable and one with an Epiphone Les Paul, game and cable). The disc edition is installed through Steam.- The game sometimes has trouble picking up signals from your guitar- Audio latency can become an issue. It's advised to have your video and audio running through 2 different cables. I have my video going from my laptop to my TV via HDMI and sound going from my laptop to my headphones via 3.5mm.- lag between video and audio can throw off your sense of rhythmI've taken lots of care to cover as many pros or cons in my review, if I've missed any, please tell me.If you enjoy Rocksmith I strongly recommend you to buy an amp for your instrument so you can practice outside of Rocksmith.Final conclusionRocksmith 2014 is a great learning tool/game and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to learn how to play guitar/bass. If you have enough time and dedication I guarantee you many hours of fun.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is amazing. I began playing guitar at 12, and when I was 13, I got the original Rocksmith for my Xbox 360. I played the heck out of it, and it helped me learn many techniques I would have otherwise never known about. I have since progressed with my ability to play guitar, and bought Rocksmith 2014 on my PC. I was very grateful that my RealTone Cable from my Xbox 360 was compatible with my PC. I started the game up, and shreded away. The best part about the Rocksmith franchise is that it is not biased towards beginers or experts. You can start the game knowing nothing about how to play guitar/bass, but if you give the game some time, it will pay off, I promise. The best feeling while playing this game is when you reach 100%+ mastery on a song. I remember the first time I did. I noticed the notes seemed to be fading away until they did not show up anymore. It was as if I was jamming to this song in my room. The game automatically put the song on ""Master Mode"" seeing as I had already been hitting every note. I finished the song, and I was ecstatic to see that I had 104% mastery. This game is for anyone interested in learning guitar, or simply just jamming if you already know how to play. Do be warned though, it's like being on a diet; results do not show up overnight. If you want improvement, give the game time and patience, and be sure to practice frequently.			"

												I am your classic bedroom guitar player with two fat hands and stubby short fingers. But this game has allowed me to live the dream of being Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Matt Bellamy and many more. I even love playing the bass parts for all of my favourite songs from the past and present. I don't care how good or more importantly how bad you think you are at learning or playing the guitar. This game is a must have for anybody with a musical bent. The game comes with loads of great songs and many more are available for a small outlay as official dlc or free from the excellent modding group who can easily be found online.

												First and foremost, based on reviews, the Rocksmith Real Tone Cable is very fragile so take extra care of it! Over at my place the cable is not easy to find and is rather expensive so you don't want to go through hassle of getting another one or modding a guitar usb cable. Rocksmith is a fine tool for beginners and pros alike. There are plenty video lessons that would be helpful for beginners, even when you are playing a guitar for the very first time. In Rocksmith, you don't do readings, unlike reading tabs, chords, music notes or using Guitar Pro software. Rather you learn through videos, visual graphics and repetitive motions. All you really need is an electric guitar, and the game will handle the rest. The tones, amps, and all the tools that will mod & filter the sounds that are available in real world are all installed in the game and it sounds really, really awesome. *Branded, expensive stuffs, mind you*. Jamming in real life won't get you the exact sound without these proper tools thus in this game you will play the songs as it is meant to be played. *Thank god the tones are not DLC's* *No, I'm not giving any idea, Ubisoft*The game has a mode called Riff Repeater where it allows you to learn sections by sections of the songs. It also have difficulty setting whereby you can control your pace of learning so it really caters to beginners very well. *Imagine learning the solo's without this mode, oh god*. Practicing would be boring, if you're not interested in the song in the first place. So song choice matters! Start immediately with the songs you like and don't just play at random! Also, it has a build-in tuner so you won't get your tuning wrong for all the songs. Having said that, outside of the game, you gonna have to learn how to tune the guitar to suit the songs perfectly and that would depend on your own initiatives. Ultimately, with or without Rocksmith, you have to be passionate and dedicated enough to be able to enjoy playing the guitar. Rocksmith is just a tool, and it's not a game where you will have fun without practicing a song over and over again. I see that many started this game but stopped after a short while because they seem to lost interest. So take this into consideration if you are going to start this game as you don't only have to buy the game, but also the guitar and its cable and almost everything that accompanies it which by then you will find out this hobby is as costly as any other. Points doesn't matter, as long as you enjoy playing & I do, I enjoy playing. So if you are looking to play a guitar, whether beginning or restarting the musical journey, I wish you good luck and have fun! "

												So I finally got around to buying this game for the third time. The past two being on the 360 and One. (Not including the first installment) I can tell you right now that if you aren't prepared to spend a lot of money, or don't have the mindset to learn, then do NOT buy this. If this doesn't fit you, keep reading.Rocksmith 2014 is a game that requires you to plug in any electric guitar into your computer and play along to a set of notes on a screen. This means that in addition to buying the game, you need an electric guitar, and the Rocksmith Real-Tone Cable, which you can find here: http://www.amazon.com/Rocksmith-2014-Cable-Trilingual-playstation-2/dp/B00I0701P4/ref=sr_1_1/183-4779015-1118238?ie=UTF8&qid=1462759501&sr=8-1&keywords=rocksmith+realtone+cable . I have heard there are ways to use a microphone to listen to your guitar and effectively do the same thing, but I have not tried it and I recommend just using the factory issued cable. Now to gameplay. With about 1000+ hours between all my copies; I can tell you firsthand that this game will teach you to play from no experience, as what I did when the first game came out. This game is for all levels of play and is not restricted to experts or newbies. This is the current way to learn guitar fast, while being fun too. With the overwhelming amount of dlc (It's like $3000 for everything at full price atm), you can also download tracks that other users have created here: http://customsforge.com/ (You need to make an account).Given what the game is, the replay value of this game is literally limitless, and is well worth it. The final bits to note are to not give up on this game! The better you get at the game, the more fun you will have mastering all your favorite songs.			"

												If you're like me, you played guitar WAY before even the original Rocksmith came out. I started playing 9 years ago and still love it to this day. However, at some point I stopped playing for a few reasons. Guitar is an instrument that suffers from feeling kind of lame if you aren't jamming with other people. Playing alone to a song is cool, for around an hour or two, but then you start wishing you had a drummer, or a singer, or a bass. Hence the reason why lots of people form bands and showcase their talent, put it to good use. I was like many who didn't have the opportunity growing up to join or form a band, I just simply didn't have enough friends that played instruments that would sound good together. That's when Rocksmith came around. I'm sure you understand the basic premise of Rocksmith. Simply put it's real life guitar hero. Notes come on the screen in vibrant colors to actual rock songs and you play along, except the catch is you play on a real guitar and are actually learning to play the songs. Great concept!Here's the deal. Rocksmith will NOT teach the average Joe how to play guitar. The thing Rocksmith succeeds at is making guitar fun for people who already play guitar. I'm sure if you gave it your all you could learn to play guitar with Rocksmith, but it doesn't teach you how to read sheet music or tabs which are rather key in playing guitar outside of Rocksmith. Nevertheless, Rocksmith is awesome for people that play, and it also took me down a peg, realising that playing guitar is NOT like riding a bike. You don't just set it down for a couple years, then come back to it and start jamming to Holy Diver. You have to rebuild lost calluses, regain flexibility in your fingers, all that great stuff. If you have never touched a guitar before and think you can learn how to play guitar from Rocksmith, that all depends on your determination but like I said before it doesn't teach you to read music. If you're a guitarist like me and are looking for something to bring back that initial spark in your marriage to your guitar then this is the preverbial sexy weekend getaway. With some drinks, a few half broken guitar picks, a spare pack of strings, and a whole lot of 80's hair metal.			"

												Many years ago I bought a bass. A sexy matt-black Epiphone T-bird goth.I've been ""playing"" it on and off but I never really learned to play it.Now, along the years I've been tempted to buy a 5-stringer for that deep fatty B-string.But I never did, as I would remind myself that I couldn't even handle that 4-stringer.Enter Rocksmith 2014.................3 weeks of f@#king around with it and I really feel like im able to handle that T-bird.It only took one drink too many and a halloween sale...........I now own a  6-string bass.Buyer beware.

												Ohh what to say about Rocksmith?If you want to learn the guitar on a small budget and you are a motivated person, then rocksmith is amazing. Yes to be optimal you need to purchase the real tone cable, and yes you might have to adjust some settings. Once you have the game optimized though you will find that the game is pure gold if you are truly trying to learn the guitar. The first point is riff repeater, being able to slow a song down and play with the slowed tempo note for note while having the correct tablature is absolutely amazing. You play with the song at a slower tempo to match your current skill level, just as a student of the guitar would try to learn via a metronome however you feel the groove and you can miss some notes.... people trying to learn a new song for the first time miss notes all the time, and the game lets you know what notes you missed for further improvement...constant practice is ideal and this system is the best I have found. The second point is the in game effects. Being able to play any song that’s on the game and not having to worry about effects (it automatically switches for you) is a great addition. In order to play and sound similar to songs at home you need to have effects, all of which cost money to have in pedals or software programs. You can also have have fun in tone designer where you can create any tone you want via the provided effects, which seem somewhat comprehensive. The last point is the session mode. As a guitar player you will be expected to improvise and jam. Session mode lets you load up any scale you are currently studying, or just for a jam to be played with automated band mates. The mode is great for ""finding yourself"" on guitar and its displays all of the notes that you are trying to jam on.pros:guitar hero like learning experience that has been optimized for real student’s playerstrue guitar effects offered in game that would cost much more than retail price of RS14Riff Repeater... need I say more?Session mode to be there when you have no band mates.As a gamer it seems like it makes learning fun, things not mentioned are guitarcade, score attack, in game tuner to many popular tunings. Cons:Requires purchase of real tone cable. (this is a small cost when compared to the value of RS14)Requires guitar to be setup or in the ball park. (you cannot accurately play RS14 with a cheapass guitar, care about your tone and be careful about buying a guitar. look for an ideal neck and most importantly play the guitar and get a feel for it. I add this only because my first guitar had a warped neck due to the ignorance of myself, the buyer when I purchased it from a pawn shop. additional thoughts:Grab a guitar, have a positive outlook on things and I can guarantee that you will progress as a player. Take the time to slow songs down, develop your ears, and try to improvise as a player. Check out guitarcade if you get burntout, however its more of a game than a teaching toolI would be estatic if a new release of this tittle came out, till then jam out brothers.final verdict: 9/10 "

												2 and a half years into my guitar journey, hundreds of professional hours being tought by a fantastic guitarist, a few thousand hours clocked on personal practice time...was told this is what counted so took it by the horns. Started adding a little of Rocksmith to my diet as well..I`ll admit in the beginning I could not play sheeeeeeiiittt, but with my tutor slowly guiding me, my practice time clocking up and the odd little fiddle with this software my playing has become less of a chore for people listening to me. Now when I come back to Rocksmith, it is with a renewed excitment, I mean most of my Steam Library I`ll never complete...game debt if you call it, buy more than I can handle during sales but who doesn't right :o ...anyway back on topic, some of the songs I thought I could only play if I sold my soul or my left nuttsack like the other players but over time I have come to realise it really is about forgetting the pain and struggles and the horendous sounds I was making and just to pick the dam thing up and push through each session until you hit a moment you feel awesome about and have no clue where it came from. Anywayz enough waffle from me, probably full of more grammatical errors than my guitar playing so who gives a toss, I can play meaningful sounds from my Gibson :) Happy Days people! For those looking for a single tool to learn from then wake up, there is no one tool...in my own person limited experience unlike many other awesome players here, I feel strongly that what is required is an awesome teacher, followed by your unfaultering patience to learn and put in the hours, and I mean hours...then add this into the mix and it will come together ;). Thanks Rocksmith Team, now go put some Dire Straits on for us to play to!			"

												i would say if you have an electric or even a semi acoustic guitar, but if you will use your semi acoustic you will have to make sure that your pickup/pickups are strong enough, if the pickup is not strong enough it will have a delay from what you are playing irl and what the game picks up. this game is 100% a really easy way of getting to know some awesome songs and even learning a little bit about guitars, i would give this game a rewiew of 8/10 the reason i do not give it 10/10 is because you will still need to get the official cable that does not come with this  purchase.there are a big and helpful community, and some of the guys have even made some songs that are not a official dlc songs that you can download for free on (http://customsforge.com/) under cdlcs but im not gonna get into that here you can just google it or look on youtube for some tutorials how to download the songs. have a good time and happy rockin ! ! !

 I didn't even realize when my guitar skills have improved, untill my father said: dude you're playing so much better. I was very beginner guitar player when I bought this game and probably without Rocksmith I'll play ""Smoke on the water"" and ""Come as you are"" untill these days (18.10.16). Game is awsome and doesn't matter you're beginner or advanced guitar player. You can learn every single part of any song you want. Learn Guitar and Bass techniques and make your own tone and that's not all.In my opionion only one weak Rocksmith point is that the game requires Real Tone Cabel. Cabel is expensive  (I have paid 139 PLN which is over 30 EURO)   and hard to get  (I have spent few weeks at searching good offer). I would recommend it to everybody.  10/10 "

												The Rocksmith Cable does not work with Intel H81 or H87 USB controllers on Windows 10. Ubisoft support sent me through a bunch of troublshooting steps (most of which I had already found online and tried). In the end, their response was ""Windows 10 is not supported, so there is nothing more we can do for you."" Never mind that I had the same problems wiht Windows 8.1, and tried upgrading to 10 in hopes of solving the problem. Works great on my AMD laptop (which isn't supported either) though.I love the game, I really want to give it a thumbs up, but since they don't support Windows 10, and MS is pushing to get everyone off the OSes they do support, I can't give it that thumbs up until they fix this.

												Temp review (will update as I learn more and more)This review is coming from someone who is learning his first instrument and from scratch, on a brand new Fender acoustic guitar with the cable. I have the game set to Rhythm Guitar. In short, the game is definitely good, it will definitely help you learn an instrument in a way that is more fun than having a tutor throwing mass amounts of complicated difficult to remember information at you, but has enough imperfections to make you frustrated and annoyed with each song until you're able to push through them with patience and get used to it. So it might not be better than a tutor, but it's probably not worse either. And it's likely a lot cheaper too... so there's that.I don't know the game all that well, so I won't pretend to know everything about it, and there's a good chance I might be wrong on a few things I'm about to write, but this is my experiences so far.I wish the game had better options for setting the difficulty and song speed before starting each song and during the song, instead of a regular speed and instead of the difficulty curve based on how well you do during the song. Because most of the time, I'll finally start to get the hang of the song's current difficulty, but then throw a bunch more new notes at me, overwhelming me with notes I can't handle at all. Most of the time, it'll go from 1 or 2 notes per strum to 5 or 6 in a very awkward hand position on the guitar and quickly go to other notes without even giving you a chance to figure out the first set of new notes. I just end up looking at the screen and going ""Are for f****ing kidding me?"" and just quit the song and move onto another one that I haven't played yet. Now if I was able to manually set the difficulty myself and maintain that difficulty until I'm ready for the new notes, and if I was able to manually set the speed of each songs, and maybe increase or decrease both while in the song... then I'd probably be a lot less frustrated, would enjoy the game far more and would definitely learn a lot quicker too.I will add that this is currently the only way that has helped motivate me into learning an instrument. I've tried to self teach myself into learning the piano, drums, etc... I could never learn proper notes on a sheet, let alone get used to the hand positions and hitting the right notes, etc... I can see this game becoming quite fun once I actually start getting pretty good at it. So far, the highest I've reached so far is about 55.9% on 1 song, 50% and lower for the rest, but one of them hurts my fingers a lot (and it tears through finger tip protectors quickly, which isn't good cuz they're expensive) and the the rest seem to get more and more difficult rather quickly.The game is really good for tuning your instruments (even better / more accurate than the built in guitar tuner), picks up on the notes while playing surprisingly well (unlike Songs2See), it even has options to allow the game to be more lenient on your imperfect / badly timed note playing so even if your instrument isn't tuned in 100% perfect, it'll still pick it up just fine so long as it's set up at a lenient setting.I do definitely recommend this game since it's currently the best program / game out there for learning how to play an instrument (much better than Songs2See even though S2S might be better for learning the actual notes on a sheet).On a side note, I do wish the game had a few easy / beginner songs in which rookies could actually complete 100%... like a sort of tutorial, to allow us to get comfortable with this style of game and feel like we accomplished something. Right now, I have a nasty bloody blister on my thumb, I still feel like I completely suck at playing the guitar, I have nothing at all to show my friends for all my efforts, even after almost 20 hours of playtime, I still don't know how to play any of the songs and I have the feeling it's going to require around 100 more hours before I can finally complete 1 song. I have no intentions of quitting, of course, but I just wish the game had a motivational song which we could complete 100% instead of slowly being able to get better over time and maybe someday be able to complete most if not all the songs all of a sudden (since they all feel equally very difficult).

												Whoever green-lit this game was a genius! Anyone who's ever played Rockband/Guitar Hero has had the thought of ""man, I wish there was a game like this where you could plug in a guitar and get good for real"". And this game indeed grants that wish.While I wouldn't make it a primary teaching source, it is exemplary supplementary material that will familiarize you very quickly to the fretboard, the strings, and the feel of holding your guitar via a marvel of lessons (excellent introductions for novices, and decent review for the experienced), cute arcade-esque games (with LEADERBOARDS to give you some competitive motivation)…and of course, a ♥♥♥♥ ton of DLC songs to play along with (yes, the vast majority of songs are only available as DLC-- suck it up and support your favorite artists already!!).I had purchased Rocksmith 2014 under the impression that it was going to ride hard on the gimmick of using a guitar as a controller, but nope! You can tell that all hands on the drawing board really goaled for a feasible, functional, addictive, QUALITY product and could be both instructively useful and still hella fun.Much of this game is quite intuitive in what and how it allows players to control their practice. For instance, song difficultly gets automatically upped ever so slightly whenever the game detects you getting a steadier handle on certain song segments. And plus, there's RIFF REPEATER!: You can control the speed, select which part of the song you're struggling with, and even manually lower/raise the difficulty-- and it loops automatically.^^ Those are such little things that really facilitate the learning process in how much it smooths over what could have potentially been extremely frustrating moments to a player. And in a world where more and more devs seem to delight in ripping off their consumers with crappy product and shrugging and spouting bs like ""TRUE fans won't complain!"", it's so gratifying knowing I gave my money to people who actually seem like they cared and put a lot of thought into the players' experience.And as a result of their effort, I tend to plug in my guitar with the intention of only playing for a bit to kill time, and then only much much later realize I'd just spent hours simply dicking around on this game. It is that enjoyable. Definitely one of those things that earns the 'what a time to be alive' phrase.			"

												I can't guarantee whether or not it's the best way to learn guitar, but it went a long way towards getting me started. There are a wide variety of lessons and technique games for practicing them, and with the tone designer, you can have a lot of fun messing around with a lot of ""equipment"" and making all different sounds, turning your computer into a makeshift amp.I was actually sold on the game because of the ability to play along with a band, but find I actually don't use that feature as much as I thought I would. The downside of learning guitar by playing other peoples' music by rote is that you don't really end up learning how to make your own stuff that sounds good, and though they try to help by highlighting the notes that ""go together"" in any given key, I feel like the band would require a lot of fiddling to set up and getting used to to keep it going as I noodled around trying to make something, anything, that sounded good.Really, though, for learning songs you like and learning your guitar and building up your confidence with it, you really can't go wrong here. It's so much more fun than just playing tabs all by yourself, especially when you're starting out and they don't sound like much of anything. This will ramp up the difficulty as you continue to succeed while still letting you feel like you're playing along with the band, which keeps motivation high.My one complaint about the game would be in the technique games: it doesn't seem to be a problem everyone has, but I'm not alone in experiencing that the low E string doesn't always register properly, and sometimes you have to intentionally make it out of tune for it to pick up the note it expects. It's a consistent problem across all of the minigames, but not in the song playing section. Other than that, and my anticipating laying out a few grand in DLC and a bass guitar down the road, I can't really complain. I'd easily recommend this to anyone who's looking to get started or get better at playing guitar.If you've ever wanted to learn guitar and you can pick up a nice beginner electric or you've just got one collecting dust and you've been promising yourself you'll learn one day, pick this up and give it a shot. Don't let your dreams be dreams!			"

												This is one of the best games that I own.I've always had a dream to play guitar since I was two years old, (now im 16) and I must say that this game is helping me make my dream come true. I went from a complete beginner 7 months ago to now being able to actually play guitar and play full songs and impress the people around me.I love the the Riff Repeater feature that the game has because when im stuck on part of a song I could just put the section into Riff Repeater, slow it down and get comfortable and then slowly speed the section/s up.There's also a session mode option that you can use and you're able to form a band, and while you play the band keeps up with what you're doing which may help you come up with some cool riffs of your own or just jam out.In conclusion I would say that this game is a must buy if you decide you want to learn how to play gutiar. P.S; Remember to practice everyday!			"

												The only game that channels your dopamine addiction into the possibility for an active sex life....but in all seriousness.Please Note: This isn't the be-all-end-all of playing guitar. You still have to put in the effort and practice while watching Netflix or something to improve your fingering strength. Studying music theory to increase your understanding also goes a long way.Now on with the VERY positive review...If you're addicted to flashing lights and a reward system then it might just be the thing that starts-off or increases your passion for playing guitars. I bought the game and yes, it is possible to play it without the Rocksmith plugin cable but you have to hack it to use a mic (A Good One), a direct line-in or a sensor plugin: I'm using an acoustic guitar.Shame on you Ubisoft for forcing people like this when it's clearly not neccessary. You did however redeem yourself by making this game because it's Fncking brilliant! EXTREMELY detailed! If I had the money I would rebuy this game every single time for the amount of effort Ubisoft put into it. I would literally remove my clothes so that Rocksmith could have its way with me. Seriously, that's how much I appreciate the creators of this game. Dammit, my nipples are moist again after I promised  a serious review.Pro's*Reward system helps you learn and actually puts the enjoyment back into playing guitar.*It looks pretty with the notes flashing when you get it right which adds to the dopamine reward system brain effect thingy...fnck, you know what I mean.*There are built in retro games where you can use the guitar as a controller called Guitarcade.*Its tutorials are some of the best I've ever seen, mainly because of its practical implementation. Also note that there is a negative side to this because sometimes the tone doesn't register in practice mode no matter how accurate you play it.*You can repeat and slow down song parts, which improves how fast you learn it.*It shows which finger goes on what string, this helps when it comes to studying notes and if you want to do them correctly. Although, this might be somewhat misleading because there are a number of ways you can play a chord and that's why I said you have to study how music works.*You can flip tablatures vertically to read it ""Upside Down"", which begs the question. Why the fnck do professionals write their tablatures the hard way around!? It's like the music industry is refusing to use the metric system.Con's*Sometimes the note detection is unresponsive so you'll have to live with a few ""missed notes"" and just listen if your play style was correct, you know, like they did before all this technology. This might be my biggest beef because of how much frustration this can cause.*There isn't a feature where you can slow down the games in Guitarcade, this might be frustrating to new guitarists because the vanilla difficulty doesn't really build up slow enough. Unexperienced players will spend more time in the Game Over screen than the actual game.*Ubisoft forces you to buy their Rocksmith reciever to play, unless you change your game settings. I understand why, it's business, but still shame on you Ubisoft: Doing that after all those private teenage sessions I had with the sexy girls in Prince of Persia Warrior Within!*For some, Uplay might be a con but to that I say, stop whining and play the god forsaken game for fncks sake! It's the only game on the market that teaches you a skill people find sexy! Playing Dota or Starcraft doesn't induce arousal!*Unfortunately this con is something no game can fix which is patience, practice and dedication. It does increase the passion with its reward system and this makes all the other aforemention aspects more bearable.In short I give it a 10/10 for what it set out to do. So, if you're a veteran player who stagnates on your passion or a gamer who procrastinates when it comes to playing your expensive guitar then open your buttcheeks and let Rocksmith have its way with you, darling.

												A great game/teaching software.While the lessons are somewhat of a mixed bag (you quickly stumble upon a problem of unforgiving difficulty), learning songs works perfectly and is very motivating. The idea of progressive difficulty based on player ability to play is implemented flawlessly.The selection of default songs was disappointing in the beggining. However after learning basic of playing guitar, I started to enjoy many songs, which I found mediocre at first. If standard set of songs is not enough, there's always DLC, where most players should find something interesting.			"

												Rocksmith 2014;What started as a dream is now turning into a reality for thousands of people across the globe. You said to yourself as a kid while listening to the radio to your favorite song, or while listening to your favorite cassette/8 track (whatever you grew up with) that you wanted to be just like the people in that band. You wanted to grow up to be a ""rock star."" Well Rocksmith 2014 is the way to go. While it might not make you a rock star it'll certainly show you how to play guitar/bass.Rocksmith 2014 is the fastest/easiest way to learn how to play guitar. Either buy yourself a Real Tone Cable (the 1/4"" jack for your guitar/bass to USB) or with their newest ""Remastered"" update of Rocksmith 2014, use your microphone that's on your computer. Personally I would recommend you spend the extra money for the cable if you don't have that amazing of a microphone.Rocksmith 2014 is LOADED with tons of your favorite artists/bands to choose from and believe me, that list of DLC can look a little intimidating but if you don't wanna spend the money now. just wait for a Steam sale.

												Amazing game to add to your guitar practice routine. I wouldn't recommend relying solely on Rocksmith to further your guitar playing, but if used in addition to normal practice, it's a great tool to either introduce the basic fundamentals to beginners, polish up some skills for more intermediate players or just to have some fun and learn some songs. Learning songs is very easy as you can slow down the songs or simplify them until you're comfortable enough to move up in difficulty/ speed. The ever-expanding library of available songs to add to your playlist is huge and you'll definitely find something to suit your tastes in the vast selection of DLC songs. The only small problem I've come across is in the dropped tunings (mainly Drop C), where the low notes don't always register.Overall 9.5/10			"

												I can rock out to Iron Maiden's ""The Trooper"" in my underwear and kill zombies with the magic of power chords. 10/10In all seriousness, though. I adore this game, and I deeply thank who recommended it to me. It's not only the most fun I've had playing games in a long time, but has also reinvigorated my love of guitar in a big way. For so long I would just pick up my guitar for specific things, like accenting synth lines or playing the same Cure and Bauhaus songs that I've been playing for years. Rocksmith has kind of lit this spark in me where I once again am picking up my guitar with a renewed sense of joy and wonder. I've been playing Rocksmith a LOT, but an interesting side-effect is that when I close it, I don't want to stop playing. So, I'll immediately after closing it pick up my other guitar and start to work on songs I've been writing and whatnot.Don't know what else to say about it. It's absolutely wonderful.			"

												After years away from music playing, I decided to start getting guitar lessons a month ago, then I noticed RockSmith.It's not going to make me quit the lessons (a physical teacher can give you more feedback on your posture mistakes), but it's making the learning process more fun, and coupled with my normal lessons it's also getting me better at playing.It gives challenges that guide you through a personalized path, and helps you get a grip of the phrases where you encounter the most issues.The minigames in the guitarcade section also allow you to get better at scales, chords, and technique, besting your highscores and giving you a fun way to learn technique.Expensive (especially because you need external hardware), but well worth it!

												I quit playing quitar in 2006 and picked up bass because my friends didn't have a bassist in their group and my guitar sucked really hard. After that I always wanted to pick up a new guitar and restart guitar but didn't have time although last year I bought a fine guitar. This fine piece of educational game really helps you get it up from where you left off. I don't know if it would let you learn from zero but if you learned at one point and want to continue but don't have the courage, this game might be the thing that you need.Also session mode is awesome if you don't have a band to train with. Only downside is you can't plau a smooth solo under a fast rhythm because they immediately follow you and slow down. Other than that it's amazing.10/10 highly recommended.			"

												When I first got Rocksmith I couldn't tell you the first thing about guitars. I ordered it for christmas just so I could set my new years resolution to learn guitar. Now, a little over a year later, I can play all of my favorite songs, I know tons of chords and notes and I have a great time playing. For the price it's asking that's hours upon hours you could be spending money on a lesson playing scales or something gross. In this game there are scales, but when you're first starting all you're gonna want to do is say ""Hey, I played my favorite song!""Also, NO MATTER WHAT. You MUST buy the ""Cherub Rock"" DLC. It's only around 3 dollars or something but that enables you to get ANY custom made song off of www.customsforge.com and play that on your rocksmith game. All you have to do is get the DLCThen go to customsforgeThen find a song you've been wanting to learnFrom there you can navigate to your DLC folder under rocksmith 2014And all you have to do is drag the file from your downloads to the DLC folder, and then you're set.Rock on.10/10			"

												 Don't go into this game thinking its going to teach you how become a guitar god or something like that. This game is more suitable for beginners than it is for intermediate players.Songs sound accurate but have weird note positions that make simpler songs more awkward to play. Game is good for finger  exercises and muscle development but not that good at ear training and or teaching more complex guitar techniques. Other problems I encountered were the game's difficulty in recognizing or even registering some notes. If you are playing through HDMI there will be some slight audio lag that is kind of annoying. Also make sure to use a guitar that is properly intonated because the notes higher up the fretboard will be misrecognized by the game.  Other than that its a pretty fun time killer I would reccommend buying it when its on sale.			"

												For those of you who want to rock, here it is: the answer to learning guitar. If you are some neckbeard who hates going outside and intereacting with people to learn guitar, this is the next best thing. Not only do you not have to interact with anyone, you can learn at your own pace.With a variety of custom songs on the internet, you don't have to drain your wallet until the next Steam sale for the official dlc's (which is worth). Depending on what kind of music you like or how you want to play, find those songs and jam to your heart's desire. The game has been getting frequent updates, so don't like ""2014"" make you turn and scratch your head. It is a very modern program and enjoyable. Not a game that will give ulcers or hernias like most of the other games with script kiddies or the early access ones.Only beef with this is that some notes can't be heard when played, but for me it's on the second fret and usually have to give more thrust to the string. Though the game and cable has been out for a while, the price of the Real Tone Cable has not dimished. It is a steady $30 new, sometimes $25 used from certain websites.			"

												UPDATE AFTER 100 HOURS IN GAME.....OK, so we are changing our review of Rocksmith 2014 to a thumbs up.  I now have 100 hours in this game.  I sometimes do exercises and cord drills while watching TV but not as much lately.  So why am I changing my review?  Well, although I feel that I am not musically gifted I now know that I can play and this is really growing on me.  I can actually play songs, hear what I am playing and am actually getting better at them without even using Rift Repeater.  I have more fun playing every song on lead and rhythm over and over and naturally progress.  Now Rocksmith will never let you rest so you have to be patient and know that if you nailed that song the last time then it will be harder this time.I can now say that I am very happy to be doing something really fun like playing a guitar rather than just playing some other game that takes you nowhere – I still do love unwinding with Defense Grid 2 and watching people playing Rocksmith on Twitch.As for errors: Once in a while a song by Foreigner and another song lose their tone but that is it.  The broken string thing never happened again.  As for the Xbox – Have not went back to that as I loving it on Steam with no issues.  For the bass – I am so busy with both guitar modes that I have yet to have time to get to that.  As for not hitting notes when you do – Try not to retune a lot and when you do tune again once you enter a song and you should be fine.So lately rather than logging out and feeling like a failure or know understanding my progress I now able to improve on practically everything that I play.  There are a couple of songs where I just need to dive into the Rift Repeater to move them forward.  Right now though I am just playing everything in both guitar modes and having fun.  In a few months from now I will probably start attacking songs one at a time and finishing them up.As for this being a computer game it could have some really easy improvements in functions and graphics but it does do what you want it to do.  So after 100 hours I can really see some improvement, can learn new things on my own, am having more fun and suggest this game for you to try.  Still faithfully doing 1 hour each night (even if I am in the mood or not  LOL).FIRST REVIEW.....If you REALLY have a passion to learn the guitar or bass then get this for sure.  If you want to play a game and learn guitar then pass.  For computer gammers the graphics are just horrible in the learning games.  There are no slow modes in the games so you spend more time restarting the games rather than playing them.  Every time the game tunes me from E standard to E sharp my little E string breaks - Lost 2 now.  DRM so watch that.  The people that you see ripping it up on Twitch have all played for years and just use Rocksmith to see what to play on a PC rather than on paper.  This game will not teach you to read music but only Rocksmith string colors.  Rocksmith also seems to favor speed over slowly developing good habits.  This is probably because the game is geared to hard rock, metal and alternative music.Now, I am probably not a natural at this and am a total beginner.  Am I getting better? - No clue really.  After 40 hours still cannot play Mary Had a Little Lamb yet.  I can play partials of many songs though - That said I have yet to attack any one song and have played everything once on lead and rythm.  Even when I do good on a song run I play it again to relive that experience and they throw more at you - You really never get a chance to just relax and repeat things.I play some pretty intense computer/console games and always have fun - I seem to log out of Rocksmith a lot feeling like a failure despite getting good progress in most things.  I have even logged out flustrated a few times.  Each night I play the games until I beat any 2 of my high scores then off to songs.  Lessons are horrible for me as I have to practice just to do one - Well the first few are easy but after that they are just way to fast.  Session mode is really cool if you can already play but if you are like me then you are just making noise even though they tell you what notes to play.  Game has some weird issues at times like the path tells me to go into session mode and tune my guitar using the tools - I do that but never seem to get the progress.  I have two hung progress goals so I quit doing those.I first bought the game for Xbox One thinking that this would be a cool living room game but that was a total failure - Freezes/hangs and is practically unplayable.  The PC version from Steam is much better with only minor issues.  No matter how good you play you will see everyone on Twitch rebooting the game after an hour of play.I have tested the bass and guitar.  My guitar is a Mexican Fender Stratocaster and I seem to like it but cannot tell you what is the best one for me or you.  So for me Rocksmith did show me that I can learn the guitar but I doubt that it will be my end game.  I have found some passion and play 1 to 2 hours each night.  I am also afriad that I am doing things wrong that I will have to unlearn later.  I might look into lessons later but will continue to test this out.Oh, one more thing: A note to play comes down to you put #1 finger on it and play it only to find out that that you are about to play some notes in the other direction so you need to shift.  Why not just show you the range that is coming down?  I will keep at this game and see where I am at a month from now but I am already worried because I cannot seem to feel good despite getting better.Good luck to you all with this game....			"

												I have tried to learn guitar a number of times before. My friends all told be ""Just look at some YouTube Videos"" or ""just get some tabs and you're away"". Realistically, you need 1 on 1 tuition to get started and for the price of a couple of lessons you can buy this game and a real tone cable. I am really glad I got this, it encourages me to pick up my guitar every day and practice. I am sure I will reach a wall in terms of how useful it is, but it got me over a lot of hurdles and gave me a lot of confidence. I still have a long way to go, but I feel like a have a path mapped out and I look forward to playing a little every day, which is always a good sign for musical instruments or games.Based on discussions with a lot of my muso mates, I picked up a Yamaha Pacifica to use with this and it works really well. I have suffered no input lag with the real tone cable and I've really enjoyed how it lets me play the way I want to. I have learned a lot by playing the songs and then going into session mode and mucking about. I am not a huge fan of the arcade stuff, but it's easy to avoid. If you've always wanted to learn to play then I think this is a really great place to start. Alternatively, if you have never really cared but have enjoyed playing games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero, this is the natural progression (a basic starter guitar like the Yamaha doesn't cost much more than the cheap plastic peripheral you need to buy for these games either, and it certainly feels a lot nicer to hold)			"

												Ever wanted to try out the guitar? Or maybe you laready own one, and you need help geting good at it? This might be the tool you need.When the first RockSmith came out, it was a novel idea, but not a new one. Games had tried to teach people to play music for real before, and the guitar was no stranger to this. But what made RockSmith good in my eyes was that it actually worked. It didn't just drop you in the deep end and say 'go', it helped you get through each riff step by step until you could play them note for note without even seeing them on screen.But it wasn't without it's faults and shortcomings. Thankfully, that's where this version comes in.The 2014 version added many features to the game, but it's overall shape became much less of a 'game', so to speak. The score you earn for each song is outright removed (available in a seperate mode if you still want that though) so now learning a song only tracked your progress in learning it. You still have objectives to clear, but these are all again geared towards advancing your learning of the instrument. While bass guitar was added late in the first game, here it's a native choice to play bass. And for both the guitar and the bass, the style of playing guitar has taken leaps forward. Gone is the options of learning a chord ttrack, single note track and combo track for each song; Now they exist as a much more sensible Rhythm and Lead option, alongside the Bass.Playing the instrument itself is now much clearer too. Many styles of guitar and bass play that were sorely absent from the last game, such as two-hand tapping, pinch harmonies, fret hand muting, and slapping and popping for bass, are now in the game for you to learn, alongside a far more accurate slide and bend notation, that actually shows you how far to bend the string this time and where to raise or lower the bend as the note carries on.But if you ever want to make it just  little more 'fun', then the returning Guitarcade can perhaps help you there, featuring a much nicer looking set of games to help you learn guitar play while under pressure. As earlier mentioned, there is also a new Score Attack mode for those that still want to chase the leaderboards with their songs, and it also features the ability for you to fail out now, meaning you'll have to know what you're playing before you come in here.Last but certainly not least, Session Mode. An entirely new addition, this is a more free-form jam mode that allows you to play your own riffs and have an AI band back you up. It also helps teach you the different scales. A very useful addition for those looking to move beyond playing cover songs.Overall, RockSmith 2014 is an improvement over the first game in far too many ways to count at this point. You'll need a decent rig to run it, mind, but if you're looking for a good fun tool to get you somewhere on guitar, there isn't really anything else out there that meets this standard.As long as you can get the RealTone Cable, of course.

												You will absolutely learn how to play guitar exactly how its supposed to be played.  You can learn at your own pace and modify the learning experience to meet any need that you have.  If the song is too fast, you can slow it down,  too many notes, lets break it down and remove a few, or if you want to really learn a groove you can put it on repeat.  The song library is generous for all genres and the dlc is well worth its price.  You can make any guitar sound like a million bucks with the amp features.  If you want to play bass but only own a guitar, the game can also emulate bass.  This is the perfect education program to get into learning guitar.  If you already know guitar then you can pick it up easy, this is not Rockband or GuitarHero, you'll learn exactly how to play the song.			"

												This ""game"" is a must for someone who would like to start playing the guitar and does not know how to get into it. I did this and then started learning some music theory to, just to expand my abilities and understanding of music. It is rather a tool than a all in all guitar experience, do not fool yourself into thinking that you can be a guitar player just by following this simple yet addictive teaching platform. Now, first of all, it does not have everything, it misses the human interaction but I guess, it excuses a real teacher from having to wait for you to get better. You can learn at your own pace without having to get distracted, it is just you and your will to learn. Now, that is fine as long as you do not resume your learning to just that of the game, it is fun, simple and addictive, but why not take it further and start learning music like a pro? You can do this but only outside the game, as Rocksmith 2014 does not teach music theory, only techniques define-related to guitar or bass. The presentation of the game and menus are nice and they tell you exactly what to do, but it can get overwhelming sometimes, as too many representations of notes on screen will get you into believing it is all a sad joke. After a while you get used to the pace and start playing by memory because simple eye-hand coordination from the display wouldn't normaly be enough to play, it is that fast. It has a guitarcade, an area of the game where you do stupid-fun games to further enhance your skills, these are fun laid back games, made for gamers. These minigames are difficult and they will better your dexterity and skills with the guitar, a nice addition to a good package. It also has a session mode, where you jam with your guitar in different rithms and beats accompanied by other simulated instruments. The way you sing and the pace you give the play will make the instruments come to a good play and you can sing like this for hours. Great mode!I will give this a 9/10 for minor bugs and crashes. The only downside is that it can only be compared to it's earlier version, Rocksmith. It is a great and simple tool to make you start playing the guitar. If it does this I guess it serves it's purpose.			"

I'm not saying that with RS guitar teachers are ""disposable"", not even close, but for those who cannot take lessons, RS is the perfect solution imho.Just play every day, even if it's just 1 song and you're very tired from work and it's late and you need to go to bed..... just play every day, the maximum amount of time you can and sooner than you ever thought you'll be playing guitar like you probably never thought you would be capable of doing.Ofc I highly recommend this amazing product, which is an extensive and most certain a lot of hard work from the game devs, since the game basically doesn't have any significant bugs (or even insignificant, just no bugs at all, at least that's my experience) and works perfectly, exactly like expected.Kudos to the RS development team, they've ""invented"" and accomplished a product(s) that changed and will continue to change the lives of many people, for better ofc.

												As a game, it's slightly better than mediocre, but as a guitar trainer, it's phenomenal! I'm a week into the 60-day challenge, and already feel more confident playing. It's not for everybody, and can get expensive once you start buying songs you want to learn, but keep at it, and you will have a skill once it's over.			"

Rocksmith 2014 is a must have for the guitar player!There's no plastic guitar with buttons here. Rocksmith 2014 is more a tool for learning and practice, than an actual game.The game has great songs, guitar tones that sound amazing and mini-games that will help you improve your guitar techniques. It can be simple or advanced - depending on what you want it to be.			"

												OK, so I have played this game for 24 hours now and I feel like I can give a decent review of it. Suffice it to say that I love it! It is a really engaging way to learn to play the guitar. There's hundreds of songs to learn to play, dozens of games to play, and lots of video lessons to take. There are exercises at the end of each lesson so you can test yourself to see how well you've mastered each one. The games are pretty cool, each game covers a different playing technique, so if you feel like you might need more practice in a specific area of playing there is most likely a game that corresponds to that certain skill, i.e. scale games to build speed and learn the notes and scales and chord games to build up your set of chords and to learn to shift between them.Learning to play the songs is by far the best part of the game to me. You might want to check out the game thoroughly to see if the DLC and the core game has music that you like! I know the game is called ROCKsmith, so if you are a country music fan and want to learn by playing country tunes, you might be a bit disappointed by the absence of country tunes in the game. I can see that the devs really try to keep a healthy mix of rock tune styles, which I really enjoy. I have heard a lot of songs that I would not have ever have had the chance to hear if it were not for Rocksmith-it really has broadened my musical horizons, as it were.I am still on the ""easy"" levels but I can feel myself inproving. I really look forward to practicing my guitar now because I truly enjoy playing Rocksmith 2014. Lastly, the other people on Steam that play the game are pretty cool. I can say without reservation that Rocksmith 2014 has the best Steam Community that I have ever seen. There's lots of help and support and friendship from the other Rocksmith players should you ever need it.Get it! Play it! Love it!			"

												I love playing this game.I am an experienced guitar player, as i have played in a few years now, and i have to say that this is some of the most fun i've had playing the guitar. It is so fun trying to get a highscore on a song, or a minigame, however, i didn't really feel like i've learnt something. I don't really remember the songs i've played without looking at the screen, and i believe that i becomes a too big of a reliability for thos who have just started playing the guitar. But all in all, it is still a great game, and i guess you could use it for learning to play guitar, just also remember to play without rocksmith.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is the only game in the world that makes good on its promise to teach you an actual real-life skill, and it's super fun every step of the way. The Remastered Edition takes what was already a solid A game and polishes it up to an A+ with bug fixes, UI improvements, and so on.If I had to spend the rest of my life on an island with only one video game, it would be this one. Purchase it if you are even slightly interested in learning to play guitar and/or bass.EDIT: I forgot to mention the most important thing - the custom songs! The game has an enormous community of creators who make custom songs that are 100% free to play and function exactly like official songs. Check out the database here, there are literally thousands. http://ignition.customsforge.com/ "

												Rocksmith is a game that attempts to teach guitar via a Tab-like medium not unlike ""Rock Band"" or ""Guitar Hero"" type of games, but via real instruments connected to the computer. This kind of software has its benefits and shortcomings, though in my opinion Rocksmith is one of the best solutions of this type today.I will begin and say I am a Bassist and have spent about two minutes on this game playing guitar. So 99% of this review goes towards the Rocksmith Bass experience.PROS:- Learning an instrument requires repetition. ALOT of repetition. Rocksmith takes these repetitive basic exercises and makes them fun! Learning accurate slides is annoying? Not if it helps a ninja jump from pole to pole! Skipping strings is boring? Not if it saves a bar from an invasion of drunken cowboys!- One of the best ways to get motivated to play more is playing songs. But most songs are too hard for a beginner to play. Rocksmith has a solution for this: Dynamic Difficulty. According to your experience in the game (i.e. success rate and playing time), the game suggests songs and even changes the amount of notes shown in order for people of all levels to feel their gradual success at playing songs.- The game does not expect you to get new things on your own. There are instructional videos about every technique used in the songs, and you can always practice these techniques separately until you can use them in the songs.- The game has a humongous variety of songs, and in addition to them, a huge database of FREE user-made DLC that you can get from customsforge. It's all legal and requires you to buy one DLC song - Cherub Rock by Smashing Pumpkins.- The game also lets you play around with various amplifiers, cabinets and effects. Can't really say much about this one, since I never use this function, but it exists so nyah. (Unfortunately there is no expression pedal input so no WahWah and the flangers are automatic only).CONS:- It's very easy to mistake the game for a full fledged course in music. Musical Theory, a very large part of playing music, goes completely ignored. I can understand that - it's much more complicated and less hands-on, so basically the developers would spend alot of time creating content that almost nobody would use.- Despite what they say in the trailer, you will never remember the songs you play in the game unless you practice them separately. I think it has something to do with processing efficiency of our brain - once it decides the song does not have to be memorized to play it (because the notes run around the screen), you simply won't remember anything you'd play. This is true for ALL the games of this type.- I think the order of the song, by difficulty, in this game is kind of wrong, and was much better in the first RS version. They might've fixed it in the Remastered version. 100 hours is enough for the game to automatically suggest everything on ultra-hard difficulty so I may have a wrong experience about this.- The ""Real Tone"" cable that needs to be used with this game has its limits. First and firmost - it's really bad for Bass guitars. It can't read sustain unless your guitar is Active and Neckthrough and has a huge amount of overtones (Tested with a Fender Precision and Cort A4 - Precision has more sustain but the game thinks the A4 does). Second, its driver is really bad, so if your guitar is quiet and the microphone driver for the cable needs to be turned up, you will have to turn it up every launch of the game.All in all, it is a very solid game that can definitely give a huge boost to beginners, and breathe new life into practicing for pros. I recommend. If you grab RS1 and the RS transfer DLC, you will get like 60 songs for $30 so it's also a good deal.			"

												Works really well when configured properly, it's very sensitive with the calibration and sound settings, but once you get past that and the tuning you're good to go!!! Definitely helped me get better at guitar and is continuing to teach me. I don't know about the 60 day challenge, but I (and probably most people) don't have time to dedicate 2 or 3 hours each day to the guitar to do that challenge, but regardless it will help you and what you learn you won't forget. I stopped playing Rocksmith for a couple months, but one I picked it back up, it didn't take very longer for me to get past my previous playing level. There's a huge selection of songs, so give it a try.			"

												Great game!* I play bass and I don't have any tuning issue, all my notes are recognized perfectly. Just be careful to turn up the volume of your bass or guitar to the maximum, otherwise the game will definitely miss a few notes. *When I started I had never ever played bass in my entire life. This game teaches you a lot through lessons and adjusts the difficulty according to your level... And when you start from ground zero, it's such an amazing feeling to finally get 100% on a song - even if it's the easiest one hahaWhen I felt more confident with my skills, I've actually spent some time learning songs outside the game and the rythm and maniabilty skils you get from the game perfectly transfers into ""real"" playing. I'm far away from being a pro yet, there are some techniques and positioning I definetly have to work on, but this game is a very fun way to practice and keeps you motivated everyday.  PS: if you play bass (I guess guitar players don't have this problem), remember to turn up the bass volume in the game and turn down the other instruments a bit, just to hear what you're playing more clearly.

												I've always dabbled with bass, but never got really serious with it. Now I find myself reaching for perfection in certain songs and trying to improve my skills. While some of the guitarcade games don't work very well with bass, the songs are fun to learn, and mastering a song gives you a true sense of accomplishment while you learn a skill.Rocksmith has inspired me to go beyond the game and pick up some theory and technique books, as well as seeking out information on how to become a hobbiest Luthier and build my own guitar for fun. (Why not, right?) I'm sure everyone's experience will be different -- some may approach it like Guitar Hero and play it only as a game, others (and most of us) will use it to learn a few tunes. I was a mediocre bassist before, but I truly think RockSmith has given me a better understanding on how to play. It's a great starting point for learning, and also excellent to learn some of your favorite songs.Beware, you will probably get calloused fingers. ;)			"

												I don't know if I can write anything here that hasn't already been written in praise of this game. I will start off by saying that I'm 38 years old and I haven't touched an instrument in years. I played piano for 6 years (grades 2 - 8) which taught me to read music and a lot of music theory. I plunked around on an acoustic guitar here and there in high school, but never really learned to play anything. A few years ago I was introduced to Rock Band 3 and had a lot of fun with it. I got back into Rock Band with the release of 4 and started wondering about turning that Rock Band experience into real music experience. I remember running across Rocksmith reviews and reading good things about it. I started looking into Rocksmith, reading reviews and watching videos. I was floored when I saw that playing along with songs was nearly identical to Rock Band. Hey! I know how to do that! :)Fast forward through boring details about buying a guitar with my boyfriend and then buying a bass for myself...Going into Rocksmith, I knew that all the important technique things that you need to force yourself to practice were disguised as games (the Guitarcade). I usually don't get caught up in score chasing or leveling up or earning banana stickers so I wasn't sure if I'd be motivated enough to play them. Holy cow, they are fun! My goal is to be able to play without looking at my hands and playing String Skip Saloon and Ducks ReDux has gone a long way in helping me do so. I was spending 50% of my play time (playing at least 1 hour a night) in the Guitarcade and it was paying off in leaps and bounds. My boyfriend, who has been playing guitar on and off for years, noticed that I was outpacing him in a few areas. (He tends to put on continuous play for an hour and go through songs.) He remarked ""I need to start playing more Guitarcade games!""I also follow along with and try to complete the goals that Rocksmith sets out for me. Although I don't do much with Session Mode, I did learn a lot about using it and learned some important music theory along the way. Pretty neat!After 3 weeks of playing, I am floored by the progression that I have made. I never expected to be as far along as I am. I am by no means a ""Rock God"", but I'm doing way more than plunking out Mary Had a Little Lamb or Happy Birthday. :)I look forward to practicing. Let me say that again: I LOOK FORWARD TO PRACTICING. Crazy! The Guitarcade games are fun and challenging. It's fun learning songs and there are a lot of fun songs to learn that come with the game. Through Guitarcade playing I found that I unlocked some original Rocksmith songs. Neat! I haven't bought any DLC yet and I'll wait for the Steam sale for that.We bought a second copy of Rocksmith and we will sometimes play multiplayer mode. It's a lot of fun! ""Oh my god! This is real life Rock Band!""Just like any talent, if you put the time into it, you'll get something out of it. Rocksmith makes it super easy and fun to put that time in.			"

												A sequel to a game that I could not fault in any way smashes the original into a brick wall and recycles it into toilet paper. Rocksmith 2014 is fantastic. It improves upon every aspect of the original game and has a metric tonne more features to rock out to.Firstly it has done away with the performance mode, which was where you would play a gig at a number of Royal-Albert-Halls to a crowd of cardboard cutout people. The people were well rendered greenscreens of actors, in a very L.A. Noire-esque style, but they were all individually animated and in great abundance, so the game would lag on a lot of systems potentially making the songs unplayable. The other problem was that the actors danced away to a predetermined tempo, so every few seconds the animation would have to restart itself, assumably to prolong the lie of synchronisation. Rocksmith 2014 has scrapped the stadiums in favour of silhouettes of your audience all dancing in time. It's simple, pretty and doesn't defeat the object of a musical game.Everything in the game feels a lot more smooth. There's no delay or lag within songs like the previous game had, especially when the computer had to decide if you played a chord right. There are 100% no loading screens. You pick a song and it throws notes your way. It is nice to see that Ubisoft have taken what the community says on board. The original greeted a loading screen with the information that you could give your guitar a little play while you wait. After suggestions from consumers, you can now play at any time in the menus.The types of notes that you play are improved very well. The bend notes are described excellently telling you how far to bend and how long to bend the string, which is a damn sight better that the ""It's a bend, off you go"" from the first game. The same goes for slides, which before reminded me of ""cut it carefully"" from the Cooking Mama series. You can now expect to see palm mutes within chords as well as single notes and you can expect regular mutes as well. Two-hand tapping is also included in the songs which is great fun.In short, this game is everything a sequel should be: more refined, more features and so much better.			"

												There are two things Rocksmith 2014 stands for.One is that it's the most fun and probably the easiest way to learn to play guitar. You may have zero knowledge about music and musical instruments yet still play the game and get results. It will teach you everything you need to start playing and creating music - from how to attach the strap to the guitar to more advanced things like slapping or using effects pedals (available within the game).Another thing is that even if you're already a good guitar player, you can still enjoy playing Rocksmith. There are over 50 songs of different genres and decades you can play along with. You can have a friend connect their bass guitar and join you, or you can even sing in the mic. You can also treat the game as something to beat, by mastering all the songs without any visual help from the game. You also get to experiment with the large amount of sound effects Rocksmith provides. Still not happy? Try the mini-games with leaderboards. Beat the world or just your Uplay friends at sliding, playing chords, scales and so on. And if that doesn't satisfy, the Session Mode will give you a band that can equip a variety of instruments related to many genres to create a rhythm for you or support you adjusting to the way you play.All in all, it's a must-buy if you have an electric guitar or a bass. The amount of money invested totally pays off, even if you buy the Import tool to get the tracks from the original Rocksmith or choose to add more songs by buying separate DLCs from well-known bands like KISS, AFI, Muse or The Police (Sting).Having a music teacher, finding a band, guitar tabs, buying amps, effects pedals or a dedicated computer program that would emulate these would require way more money and effort.

												I recently purchased Rocksmith® as I had seen quite a few good reviews and wanted to give it a shot. Keep in mind that you may have to purchase the Real Tone Cable ($28 USD) unless you have a good microphone to use.I've been playing guitar for about 30 years. The first thing that I did was set up the Settings to Never played Rocksmith®>Beginner>Lead Guitar>Lessons. I wanted to see how helpful the game was to someone that has never played a guitar before and quickly found out that it was not very beginner friendly. I tried the same Settings as Rhythm instead of lead and came to the same conclusion, a new player may get seriously frustrated with learning from this game.The Guitarcade seemed really thrown together in comparison to the rest of the game.My first attempt at difficulty set to Master (which does not even show the tab during the song) I received a platinum score that placed me around 800 out of 18,000+ other players. With even the slightest delay, it can affect your score, so I'm sure I can do better if I can sort out the latency issues.The game is fun for someone that already knows how to play, but I would never trade the lessons I received for what they are trying to sell here. I would highly recommend that you get personal training over this 60-day sales pitch.The one thing I can say that I currently like about this game is the preset tones for each song. They did a really great job on that part and if I can fix the latency issue, I can see myself enjoying the game a little more.However, I can't say that I'm shocked at the amount of money you must dump into purchasing additional songs. After I added all the songs available to my cart, the total hit $2,000+ USD... To sum things up on Rocksmith®: If you’re new to guitar, don’t jump straight into something like this. Take the time, spend the money and learn from a human first. Buy this game later to have some fun.			"

												I purchased RS2014 just wanting it to be a ""game"" like Rockband or Guitar Hero. I didn't have a real interest in learning to actually play the guitar (I've tried numerous times in the past and given up), all I wanted from this was something I could casually play, but with a bit more challenge/reward than the ""plastic guitar"" games.It started off exactly how I was expecting - just playing a single note every now and then, but as you improve and play the notes its' giving you well the game will adjust and add more into the mix. Before too long you'll be given chords, double-stops, legato techniques, and plenty of other new bits to play.The way the difficulty works is good, it won't give you something to play that's way over your head (too often), but keeps you improving at a good rate.In the few weeks I've been playing, I've progressed a lot further with my skills than I have in all my previous attemps to learn guitar without Rocksmith. I'm interested in learning to play again, and this makes it a great way to do it.Pros:* Very cost-effective way to learn (if you already own a guitar).* Being able to have your skills quantified (Mastery percentage, song accuracy, scores etc) and improving is great motivation to see your progress and keep playing.* Makes practicing fun!Cons:* Music choice is decent, but could do with a lot more songs. New songs are released every week though.* There's no option to see the music to play in Tab format.Overall, I highly recommend it, it's a lot of fun and you learn something while you play.			"

												I am going to edge towards recommending this game, because there is no maybe button.If you are learning the guitar I think this would be a great tool, but I have been playing the guitar a long time and bought it as a practice tool, there is nothing more boring than practicing by yourself - so I was basically looking for glorified backing tracks and maybe to branch out and play some styles I wouldn't ordinarily play.The first problem I hit is that you have to basically learn a new notation, also I am colour blind so the colour coded strings were not a great help to me. I've spent 20 years reading tab and standard notation sheet music and suddenly I have to learn another system, let's just say that motivation was low.Also as other reviewers have mentioned it starts you out very slowly which is frustrating if you know the song, but I discovered if you just play the full part then it will quickly build it up. The problem I came to was when I was completely unfamiliar with the song I didn't get enough warning of what was going on to follow along. So a song I could have easily played along with if I had had the tab or music I was left with no idea what was going on.Another issue I had was it not recognising when I had played the right notes, especially at the low end on my Les Paul - maybe it didn't like the signal from the humbuckers. I found it greatly frustrating to have played something note perfectly and it to tell me to repeat a passage because it hadn't registered the input correctly.So - in conclusion: If you are an experienced guitarist this may provide more frustration than fun, but for a beginner I can see it being a fun way to learn.

												Although I had already played guitar for 3 years prior to picking up Rocksmith, it has helped me improve in a lot of ways! If you are a beginner who wants to learn how to play, then RS is great for you. If you are a seasoned veteran it is also great for you!The songs in the game aren't that great (atleast not for me since I prefer metal, there are only a couple metal songs in the game), but there is Custom DLC! If you head over to Customsforge then you can browse thousands of songs to add to RS, which is amazing! And there are normal DLC songs to buy aswell, that are official. The arcade games are fun and very helpful aswell. RS is definately worth your time if you are wanting to learn guitar, or just looking to have fun!also you need to hit 10K hours to git gud			"

												At the time of the review i played the game for about 90h. I started as a complete guitar noob and now i can play a lot of songs pretty decent and got my first song on 100% completion! I should have bought that some years ago and i would probably play in a band right now (so many time wasted with guitar hero :D ). Think about it more as a learning programm than a game, because you still have to put in a lot of effort and ambition, but it makes learning a lot more easier than to do it by yourself by tabs or online tutorials. I recomend this firmly to everybody who wants to learn playing the guitar!11/10 would buy again to travel back in time and give it to my younger self "

												A complete must have for all beginners. My initial impression was the game throwing you into a song and you trying to hit the notes in the same fashion as a regular rhythm game, however on top of a dynamic difficulty system, where the game adjusts to your skill level, it offers in-depth tutorials to a variety of the most important guitar playing tricks and techniques every guitar/bass player should know. The real tone cable required to play the game is definitely overpriced, but well worth the investment, as it also feels a lot more fulfilling to learn a song with the music and other instrumentals playing in the background as opposed to trying to learn a song on your own, pondering whether the melody you're playing even sounds right.In short, if you wanna learn guitar/bass consistently, this is an option well worth considering.

												The remastered version is better. It added a tracking option where the player can pause the song and view the notes one by one. Better than going into riff repeater and putting the song at 1% speed. I hated playing the songs that slow. The tracking feature makes learning the solos much eaier. Also the song search option is great. Instead of just sorting the songs via a catagtory, the player can now type in a specific song. Good for intermediate players.			"

If you have the money and are interested in learning an instrument (guitar) buy this game! You won't regret it! I would recommend looking through the songs Rocksmith and RS2014 offer and then Youtube-ing them to see how they are played in game to see how awesome you will become! Don't get me wrong...your fingers will hurt, you will get upset with some techniques, and you will never want to tune a damn guitar again while getting use to the game.

The DLC's are expensive, but if you don't find the song you want to learn as one of them, there's always hope that someone made a ""custom song"" at CustomsForge for free.

												Get it while it's cheap! You will still have to buy the real-tone cable, somehow.I've played guitar for over 20 years, on and off.  When I picked up Rocksmith a little over a year ago, I didn't think I'd be playing it on a daily basis.  It's a good stress relief and learning tool.  The 'bass emulation' feature has got to be my favorite option, since I don't own a real bass guitar, I can use my electric six string instead and have the software mimic a bass tone.  Get it if you know how to play guitar and wanna have fun and maybe learn more.Get it if you're a guitar noob and want a fun and easy way to learn guitar or your favorite songs.PS:  There's a large community site that offers 'customs' of songs made by the community from real songs.  There's thousands to download and the community is pretty active. "

												LONG OVERDUE:I stopped using Steam to play this game and I now use a pirated version that still supports custom songs. This game no longer does that. I suggest that no one ever pay this company for a copy of this game again.Playing acoustic with books and sheet music/tabs for a year hasn't gotten me the experience I've had in a week with this game. No more stumbling around or being unsure how to hold your hand for a certain chord. Rocksmith has everything easily explained, as complicated as it knows you can play, rewarding with levels of progression, and an awesome session mode. It suggested I play along with it's band for 10 minutes, and I was locked in learning scales and chords for two hours. A cheap guitar is 100 bucks at your local pawn shop and the cable you can order online. This game is good for your soul and you need to be playing it.EDIT:300 hours later and I can say this:My fingers have hurt for the last year. I play as much without the game as I do with it now, maybe more. I'm making my own music, meeting new people, and I feel like I'm developing a skill worthwhile.I don't know how many people have asked me ""Does it really work?"" or ""How long have you been playing this?""This game is motivation. Without it, I might stop a painful riff after 5 or 6 reps of it. When a song is 7 mins long and you've gotta repeat that thing 100 times, it whips the ♥♥♥♥♥ little ""uggn... my FINGERS huuurt..."" into shape and keeps pain levels at maximum. When you finish a song over 95% when a quarter through the song you were sure you wouldn't make it? Best of feels.I mean, I rocked out to ""Killing in the name of"" on bass so hard the first time I caused my fingers to bleed. I didn't notice bleeding fingers I was so into it.I'd notice bleeding fingers if I was playing TF2.			"

												I've only just started playing with Rocksmith 2014 and I can already tell I've stumbled upon something really cool! I can't wait for the Remastered version. I never really understood the Guitar Hero/Rockband craze of the early 2000's and I doubt Rocksmith would ever catch on the way those games did, but for a guitarist who has been in the musical equivalent of cryo-stasis for the last few years, this game is simply words-can't-describe amazing!If you're reading reviews, wondering if you should pick this up, or if whether you should get it for a young guitarist to be. Look no further. This game is worth every dime! They even make coated strings that color match the games strings for extreme beginners. Have some fun with your instrument. It doesn't always have to be work!Pros:1. Rocksmith cable is easily modified/repaired with a bit of soldering. (I put a right angle jack on mine)2. Tone Control section lets you set up a killer amp model with way more options than my Peavey Vyper modeling amp3. Learning has never been this entertaining in the 15+ years I've been playing.4. Custom songs found online are awesome and free to use once you've purchased and installed Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub RockCons: 1. Paid DLC songs can become a bit pricey if you are trying to create some sort of huge library (Cheaper/cooler than song books though!)2. It's made by Ubisoft... Meaning Uplay... Meaning projectile vomiting.3. The cable's 1/4"" connector supposedly breaks easily due to the thin cabling. (Easily repaired, I modified mine out of the box.)4. Doesn't come with a free 1967 Les Paul Custom guitar... "

												I've played acoustic for about 7 years now and had a really crappy electric laying around the house. Yesterday decided to buy a proper electric + RS2014 + Tone Cable for my birthday. Funnily enough today the game just got remastered which is awesome! So far I've had A LOT of fun with it. I honestly feel like I just purchased an ultra portable AMP considering I've got the game running on my Lenovo Y50 laptop. Despite what some older reviews said - YES this game DOES fully work with Windows 10 64Bit and the tone cable recognises as a piece of hardware and works with my guitar totally fine. My only gripe with this software is the painful $3.30 CAD for DLC. I understand it takes time to develop professional sheet music and gather licences but $3.30 CAD is a lot of money when you consider how quickly it adds up. I couldn’t help but purchase ""Smooth"" (one of my fav Santana songs) but I'll likely need to hold off for a DLC sale cus at the moment its totally wallet killing.RS2014 Edition - Remastered is totally worth the buy. There is a lot to do, and with the ability to import custom songs you can pretty much play anything popular enough for someone to make a file for (which is like over 500 songs to download free online). For those who are interested, the guitar I got is a Monoprice Route 66 (Les Paul Impressionist Electric). It's got legit humbuckers and looks/sounds/feels fantastic. For $250 CAD and free shipping via Amazon, it was hella quick to arrive in just two days. Check it out if you're thinking of getting a good quality but affordable intermediate guitar above the crappy beginner Epiphones / Academy / Squire models that are about $100-150.			"

												Finally I can pluck a G string, Drop E, and finger a minor on Steam!I feel I have progressed more in a day than in the last few year bumbling around by myself with a guitar. The jam sessions are good for learning timing and practising scales. The song lessons seem easy at first just having you play key notes, but it ramps up according to your level and gives you feedback on your performance, the goal being to eventually play every note perfect and master the song. The only downer is you need the cable for the full experience and it is overpriced, make sure you get the game in a steam sale and then the cable price is a bit more palateble. "

Hundreds of songs to chose from (although 99% of them must be bought first) and different difficulties to help you in the journey to becoming the next Jimi Hendix, Dave Mustaine, Slash, or whoever your favourite guitar player is. Metal, rock, even jazz lessons are included in this game.However, more gamemodes can be added into the game to make it less frustrating to learn to play a song, and the cable is VERY expensive. 45$ for the cable from Ubisoft, because other cheaper cables like this dont work with the game.9/10 Get it if you like playing the guitar.

												1) Most people who don't like this game are having issues with installing it. Or there's a conflict of some kind on their computer. Or they're using a 3rd party cable.2) The overwhelming majority of people are able to install it without problems and get it up and running in no time.3) The game is fast. There is little to no delay or loading time between songs or exercises.4) Session Mode ALONE is worth many times the price of purchase. It allows you to select from among dozens of different instruments to create a backing band and jam in any key and in any scale in any style of music. And it shows you the notes in that scale on the fretboard so you can learn the scale and work on your improvisation. Not only that, but the band REACTS to the way you play -- softer, louder, faster, etc. Not too long ago professional musicians paid thousands to set up backing track systems that weren't NEARLY this sophisticated.5) There are 55 or so songs from multiple genres to play, plus hundreds of downloadable tracks.6) There are several mini-games that teach guitar skills for those starting out and for those who are rusty. Back in the day, you had to practice alternate picking/chords/bending/scales etc. by rote.7) The game has a Riff Repeater where you can take sections (or the whole song) and slow them down and practice it until you have it down.8) You and a friend can play along with the songs or with Session Mode at the same time: Guitar/guitar, bass/bass, guitar/bass.9) There are lessons with video demonstrations and practice sessions for most guitar techniques. Even tapping!!!If you, or anyone you know, are at all interested in playing guitar or bass, this is, by far, the best money you will ever spend.ps Some people have problems with note recognition. That is, you play the note correctly but it doesn't register. If this is happening it's probable that your guitar's input level isn't high enough due to quiet pickups, guitar volume not being high enough, or your cable input isn't high enough. When it asks you to ""make some noise"" it's calibrating the input level. If you strum with regular force, it will turn up the input to an appropriate level. (You can re-calibrate at any time through the menu.) If you strum too hard it will set the input so that when you play at regular levels it won't always pick up your notes. When calibrated correctly, the game picks up notes perfectly on both guitar and bass.			"

												ok im pretty sure that i got enought time in this ""game"" to get a well based review,so lets start with the pros first to note it's NOT a replacement for a real in person leasson, although it really is a great way to start and feel like a great guitarrist.second to note is if you never played before rocksmith will give you a nice way to learn or just to train the techniques with the sometimes overlooked guitarcadethrid is that the game wont push you beyond your level and if it's too hard the game will ajust the song level for you and the same if it's too easyfourth thing is that the songs avaliable are all great for leaning some techniques and have a good timenow lets start whit the consfifth, the amount of song packs are way above the average to dont find something that you like you probably dont like music in general (what you doing here?)first the cable is not perfect soo some times you may feel like some techniques are not really recgnized second is that sometimes the leasson seems weak and lacking a better explanation so you will need figure out by yourself or with real lesson elsewerethird to note is that the session mode its way bellow the rest of the rocksmith it lacks a better band creation and a record modefourth is that a lot of good bands are overlooked while some other got multiple song packs (may be because of the legal mumbo-jambo)and for the last you will need to always have spare strings and picks\overhall its a great way to get started or just to learn new songs, but with some flaws that dont affects the experience,and just in case you are looking for some cool songs check the custom forge if you dont find the song you are looking for in the official packssorry for the bad english and hope you read it all and decided to give a chance to the best ubisoft ""game"" ever			"

												As I never had touched a guitar before this, I always thought it would be impossible to play songs from my favourite bands as it would take years of learning with teachers and it would feel like a chore, but rocksmith made everything easier and more interesting! I played for one or two hours each day and I couldn't believe the way I was progressing! It was way faster and more enjoyable than I expected! I think that playing guitarhero/rockband in the past helped me understand and follow the way notes are presented in rocksmith cause they appear in a similar way as in those games. If you are not familiar with those games, you will find it a little difficult at start, but as you keep practising you will get better and better in no time!I Recommend it as a great tool for everyone that has a guitar!-Xzibit: Yo dawg! I herd you like tool so we put tool in yo tool so you can tool while you tool!-Satisfied Customer: It works!!! It really works! I can't believe it!			"

												Easily the best thing that happened to my guitar. I had a Classic guitar for 10 years, and an Electric for 3 years prior to Rocksmith, but I never practiced as frequently or intensively in all these years, progressed that far, or had so much fun as with Rocksmith. Just plug your guitar and have instant fun. I always dreamed about something like Guitar Hero / Frets on Fire for a real guitar, so when I discovered the original Rocksmith on Steam, I grabbed it right away, and a year later also got the 2014 version on launch. It's not without some flaws, but the Value I get from it dwarfs any negative things I can come up with. If you like to play guitar, Get it. Buy the original Realtone cable, buy another one so you have spare, and also buy the original Rocksmith 2012 (preferably cheaply on sale), so you have access to the original DLC library. Don't ask why it refuses to work with non-original cable, or why it requires you to buy the original Rocksmith just to be able to buy a DLC from original library that appears in Rocksmith 2014 anyways - no one cares and no one will fix it. Concentrate on playing the guitar and having fun.The DLC library is pretty damn amazing to my taste, and keeps growing constantly at a steady pace. And now with the addition of Spinal Tap DLC it rightfully goes to 11.Best game on Steam. 11/10. "

												Great software.  A couple of problems though;-The biggest complaint is the lack of complete tablature for any songs.  Notes flying at you make it difficult to practice song sections, and I have to resort to pausing and looking at the notes through the pause screen.-You cannot pause properly in Riff Repeater mode; if you go to the pause menu, you then either have to reset the sequence or if you resume it bugs out and plays the song normally.Besides that, I'm having a of fun playing through the set list of 50 something songs.  The note detection is fairly accurate, and the game has a lot of tools and modes from tuners for different set ups (Standard E, Drop D...) to a jam mode with a virtual band.  Not much latency on the cable either (using their official one).  As an intermediate player who hasn't played guitar recently, helped me brush up and hone my skills a lot and it's damn good fun to play through some of the song arrangements.			"

They market it as a learning tool for new guitarists, and although that is exactly what it is, it can be a great help to those of us with guitar experience. I had concidered myself a good to exceptional guitarist before rocksmith 2014 (so modest) but after having played it, even my band mates have commented on my improved playing. HIghly reccomended to anybody interesting in the instrument. 11/10			"

												So, short review. I like this guitar learning tool. It's easily the best way to learn guitar because it gives the player incentives and puts the notes right there, on the screen and you play that note like it's Guitar Hero, only real. This game has several different modes too, it has a session mode where you can jam with a virtual band equip with any musical style you wish to jam with as well as having several minigames that help you hone different techniques. There's a game where you have to bend the string at a precise point, there's a game where it's like Space Invaders and you hit the notes on your guitar to shoot at the aliens coming down. Rocksmith's main feature is the song list it has and by itself. this song list does appeal to everyone, even the old rock fans, like myself. I got to play Don't Look Back by Boston or My Generation by The Who. It's got other songs that tackle different genres but I haven't really paid any attention to those. The game will adjust to your skill level and you can, now, manually adjust to the skill level you think you're ready for and the game will work with it. I highly recommend this to beginners and advanced players alike because Rocksmith 2014 is just plain fun and you can even get the DLC from the previous game so it's a win win. Don't get the previous game but this one because it improves everything from the old one. The old one felt clunky and didn't let you play at a skill level at your choosing. This one does. You can also play Bass on here so if you're a bass player, they got you covered.			"

												Back in the day when Guitar Hero and Rock Band became popular, I used to think how cool it would be if you could do the same thing but with real instruments.  Well, I've only put 10 hours into this so far, but it's very useful for learning to play guitar.  The starting selection of songs is OK with at least one or two songs I wanted to learn to play.  The prices for some of the DLC songs is a bit much for my liking but assuming they keep adding to the list of songs it may very well prove to be a case where I'd actually WANT to purchase and use the DLC.  Right now I think I can live without them (especially since I'm still very much a beginner).You've got basically a set of lessons for everything from how to hold the guitar and manually tuning it all the way up to some complicated techniques.  These include practice lessons so you can demonstrate to the game that you've mastered it (except for the first few lessons that don't include actually playing).  From what I've seen, most of these lessons can be taken from 0% to 100% mastery in no time at all, though some of the techniques are tricky enough that it could take some hard work to get it down.The Voice Over/Teacher in the game does his best to sound non-intimidating, but can instead come off sounding insincere, especially when you know that you flubbed the lesson and he says ""good job!"" at the end.  Then again, at least one point he told me I needed more work and yet another time I was told ""it could be worse"".  Gee, Thanks.Your other options include ""Learn a Song"", Session Play (where you have a virtual backup band play for you), and the guitarcade.  Learn a song is self-explanatory, Session Play could be fun when you're ready to jam assuming you can tell the backup band just which chords you want to play, and the Guitarcade is a great way to practice without it feeling dull.I've played a bit of the guitarcade to help familiarize myself with the guitar and it's slowly helping.  I can feel myself reaching for the right strings more often, and hitting the proper frets without having to look quite as much.  I am not sure I exactly agree with their system of levelling up on these games, but that helps to give you a secondary goal to just increasing your score.   Speaking of goals, this game is chock full of them.  Sometimes the game will decide it's time you looked at a new song, or tried a new mode, and other times the game considers you need more practice with chords and sends you to the guitarcade to work on it.  This is kind of a nice feature, but it feels too random at some times.   Other times the goals make more sense, like when you're learning a song, it may recommend you work on a particularly hard phrase.  However, It can be rather demanding for a newbie.  When you first learn a song, it tells you to play one note on one string and that's it.  After you demonstrate you can do this ONCE it may decide to up the ante and now you're playing two notes on two strings.  Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, it throws more at you until you feel like you're overwhelmed again.  I would like to feel like I've made progress first before going into the harder territory.  I think there's a way to reset progress on a song but that could put you too far back.At least when you're using the ""Riff Repeater"" you can choose how much it throws at you, for how long, how many times you have to play it before it moves on, if it should get harder or not, etc.  The riff repeater is probably the best thing about learning a song since you can customize it fully. The store has tagged this mistakenly as having Uplay.   The game itself does not require Uplay at all though.  It doesn't show up in my list of games on Uplay when I do launch it, and even though I am given the option of logging into Uplay, it's through the game with an email and password only...No Client running in the background.Also, the Rocksmith website offers a ""60 day Challenge"", where you can show your progress from complete beginner to novice guitar player in just 60 days.  The caveat to this is that they expect you to play at least one full hour per day, and the timer doesn't run unless you're actively in a lesson, learning a song, doing the guitarcade or whatever.  Steam at this time says I've played for 11.4 hours, Ubisoft says I've played for 3 hours and 44 minutes and the 60 day challenge website says I've done 2 days worth of practice. :(I was going to update this at 60 game hours but that  blew right by so fast I had no idea it was gone. Instead I'm editing this at the 60 day mark since I got the game.  Can I play a song 100% No... almost though.  I've got a couple in the 80%-90% range right now. Next update when Ubisoft thinks I've completed their challenge.  It seems to only record 1 day of the challenge if I've spent at least 2 hours in game (not in menus).			"

												I almost never review things, so this is really telling you something. This is better then getting taught by a real guitar  player. You can focus on what you need to learn. You play any song you like. Yes, I have been taught by other people, I know how it is. This is WAY cheaper then real lessons by A LOT of dollars.  I saved myself a ton of money. Also, you can slow down the song you're playing, repeat riffs that you need work on, and play mini games to help you learn the ways of guitar. Amazing peice of work. I began with no experience of bass, and now I have learned so much about it. Would rate this game a 10/10.			"

												I could already play guitar/bass to a substantial level before I bought this game, however, the game has tought me a thing or two about the guitar. I would definitely recommend this game to someone who wants to start playing the guitar as songs start off extremely simple and then eventually get to their full dificulty. But before you buy, make sure you have the Rocksmith cable, or else you will not be able to connect your instrument to the computer.			"

												Ever had an interest in learning to play guitar? Or Love music rhythm games, well this is for you.Personally from my experience so far, Rocksmith 2014 is much more polished and with lots of new fun features in the new 2014 edition to the first release, arcade games are better and the learning process for each song has improved too with feedback and recommendations after you play, built in video guitar lessons from professionals (which are very good), and you learn at your own pace. Even if you cannot play guitar after playing this you will be able to learn to play or enjoy playing a simpler version of the song with the simplified notes.Also another thing is back in high school i took guitar lessons, and played guitar but i never actually played a song from start to finish, usually just random riffs or just mucking about, but Rocksmith makes learning the song and practicing even just a single song for hours fun.Also for a low price, if you own a guitar and don’t already own this game, I recommend giving this a go, Super fun, and makes even the boring and hard part of learning guitar extremely fun, and having the progress bar is extremely nice to see how well you are doing and the game motivates you to try and 100% master the song. Also for musicians the Jam sessions have intelligent Ai to Jam with which is pretty cool.Only issues I had was a little audio lag, and also the volume on my High E and sometimes the B string might not get recognized however takes a bit of time calibrating the right settings, but once everything is all set up and sounding nicely, it’s a very fun game and fastest guitar learning software & game out there.

												 A Very good Game /learning tool, but you MUST make sure prior to purchase that the PC is up to spec and that any existing software on your operating system will not interfere with this game, as it is so heavily relient on audio and graphics.There has been an issue with users not being able to download Dlc for 2014's previous incumbant Rocksmith. this is due to the unique way that valve downloads its Dlc, as dlc is not usually compatable with two concurrent games. The Cheapest way around this if you do not want to wait for a fix is to download the original rocksmith game for about £5 or  7 euro's and register it on Steam.  you will then have access to all dlc. A further purchase of the Rocksmith import tool will for £8, $10.00 10 euros will get most of the original on disk Rocksmith songs, (Licensing issues).for the 5 missing ones.TIP :-buy a spare cable. they do break. they are on offer you just have to shop around.So what do you get:50 songs of varying difficulty.blitzkreig bop - so easy its unrealprogreesing to intermediate songs like Aerosmith's Walk this way and the Muse, Pantera stuff through the more difficult Rush and Avenged Sevenfold.to the insane Satch boogie- Uber difficult- master this virtuoso piece you can tell your mates 'yeh I play a little bit'.The lessons are very good, shows you from the basics to more difficult techniques encountered.riff repeater is an improvement. But not 100% reliable it will tell you you have missed a note when you know you haven't , you can slow a phrase down, take away notes add them. it fits to the way you play.Some people say that it ramps up the difficulty too quickly, the counter to this is that, well you must have been doing something right for the software to increase it,try harder find your level.The Session mode is awesome you can do what the program recommends or use it to back up what you have learned in the lessons or songs.The score attack feature is very good as it gives you a level of easy, medium and hard or master. I use it to check my timing as I play; as it tells you whether the note was good, missed or perfect. So its good for tempo and feel.The games are quirky, scale racer you really need to know the shapes shown in other games and by using the zoom out function in session mode(this extends the scale forms across the fretboard)bending gets you bending quickly and to pitch.harmonic heist gets you playing harmonics. I am sure this game has been adapted from something off the Commodore 64 but i cant remember.Scale Warriors gets you playing scales and memorising them.String Skipping gets your picking hand moving, Its part of my daily routine.Ducks gets your fretting hand moving and should be played without looking at the fretboard it explained this in the Original Rocksmith but not in 2014.ninja slides is self explanatory gets you sliding everywhere, backsup the lessons.Hurdles is another picking hand game but is more about adapting the technique of the game than good picking technique. IMO the original rocksmith game for this was better.So can it teach you guitar- no only the user can do that.you need time, patience,and be prepared to stick the hours in.But, its a lot better than trawling through shedloads of tab,  tweeking fx units.and using a pause and rewind button.No it doesnt teach theory either, but if you went on to learn theory for the purpose of being a musician or expanding your musical vocabulary there is enough in this software to guide you . You just have to relate the highlighted markers as notes and pitches and listen to what you play.Will it replace a teacher, probably not, but you will know a lot more for using this software.I am a guitaroholic so I may be biased do i recommend this yes. because like everything in life you will get out what you put in.

												After reaching all 47 achievements, I guess its time for a review.  This game is the most awesome learning experience for a musical instrument I've ever encountered in any media.  I've tried learning guitar a few times in the past but it was boring and painful making it hard to stick with it.  This game isn't perfect but it gets so much right, you just want to keep coming back for more.  I hope this game has a very long life.One of the achievements was bass only so I decided to get the Electro-Harmonix PitchFork pedal so I could switch between playing all 3 paths (lead, rhythm, bass) at the press of a button.  That was a great addition to my setup and opened up all the bass items which are a lot of fun too.  I'm playing with a basic starter guitar: Epiphone Special II.Pros: The most motivating features for me were the achievements and the methods for grading your progress.  Each song has 5 ways of scoring your progress (Learn A Song percentage, 4 levels of Score Attack) that makes me want to ace them all.  Learn A Song supports a breadth-first progression through a song (gradually adding notes as you get better in each phrase) and Score Attack is an arcade-style depth first progression through a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Master).  Master mode hides the notes and was scary at first but its a great motivator for weaning you off the sight-reading and encourages you to listen for cues instead.  Learn A Song also has Riff Repeater which allows you to mark a section and then slow it down and vary the difficulty level -- this is indispensible for getting those hard riffs down.  I also enjoyed working through the Lessons and Guitarcade.  Guitarcade is a collection of about a dozen games and they are an excellent way to get some technique practice in without feeling like you're doing something as boring as scales.  I'd really like to see more of these mini-games as they are much more fun than practice exercises.Cons: Ubisoft sites really suck at consistency.  Achievements and unlocks are shown on the Ubisoft site, the Rocksmith site, and Steam.  Steam is rock solid but the others are woefully inconsistent and aggravating to use.  500 missions?  Really?  What an annoying achievement!  Guitarcade's Hurtling Hurdles seems much too sensitive and poorly balanced compared to the other games.  Session mode -- the mission system kept pushing this but I found it a dreadful bore since I'm not good enough to improvise anything interesting at this point.			"

There is a built in riff repeater allowing you to slow down specefic sections of songs which you may find difficult to comprehend. My only concern prior to buying the game was  the Song catalogue, but there is no need to worry, here are some of the bands, Alice in Chains, Slayer, Tenacious D, Iron Maiden, Def Leapord, Megadeth, Alice Cooper, naming a few. Another great feature is the ability to test out a huge selection of amps, from the marshall jcm800 to the orange tiny terror, there is a large variety, this serves as a try before you buy, and allows you to make some pretty nice riffs, either with a high gain crunch sound, or a low gain clean sound, its all up to you. You can even tune the amps!.To conclude if you want to learn guitar, or master it for that matter, this is the way to do so, the UI might be difficult if you are used to tabliture but you can get used to it.

												Have you bought this on sale? Have you bought this at all? Do you like to play guitar or bass? If you do stop reading and start buyiong. If you don't: are you gifting? No? buy anyway!!! This game is amazing! If you don't know how to play, this game will teach you! It has lessons to teaches you from the ground up. you you play, you can choose rythum, lead, or bass and you dont need a bass to learn(it has a bass emulator for those who oly have electric guitar and want to learn). start with some lessons, move to some excercizes to get you familiar with the fretting, finger and note placements, the notes and chord names. Then move on to learning your favorite songs. I love this game for how well it was made and how well this teaches. doesn't matter wether you're brand new and just touched a guitar, or wether you are an experienced player this accepts players of all difficulties. THANK YOU creators and I hope you keep doin more and more songs.			"

												From my controversial review from the 1st Rocksmith game - it seems that certain individuals persist on crushing your hopes and dreams of one day playing with Clapton at the Albert Hall. He knows who he is and is what I like to call a ""life speed bump"". By destroying your spirit by shouting ""FREE BIRD!!!"" everytime you go on TeamSpeak, he will try to make you fail at every hurdle. Ignore him / blank him completely if they try and stop you from playing guitar and this game.This game is a fantastic improvement from the original Rocksmith game - if you want to learn guitar, then get this game. It will be a better way to spend your time rather than wasting it on WoW, GTA etc...			"

												After reaching all 47 achievements, I guess its time for a review.  This game is the most awesome learning experience for a musical instrument I've ever encountered in any media.  I've tried learning guitar a few times in the past but it was boring and painful making it hard to stick with it.  This game isn't perfect but it gets so much right, you just want to keep coming back for more.  I hope this game has a very long life.One of the achievements was bass only so I decided to get the Electro-Harmonix PitchFork pedal so I could switch between playing all 3 paths (lead, rhythm, bass) at the press of a button.  That was a great addition to my setup and opened up all the bass items which are a lot of fun too.  I'm playing with a basic starter guitar: Epiphone Special II.Pros: The most motivating features for me were the achievements and the methods for grading your progress.  Each song has 5 ways of scoring your progress (Learn A Song percentage, 4 levels of Score Attack) that makes me want to ace them all.  Learn A Song supports a breadth-first progression through a song (gradually adding notes as you get better in each phrase) and Score Attack is an arcade-style depth first progression through a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Master).  Master mode hides the notes and was scary at first but its a great motivator for weaning you off the sight-reading and encourages you to listen for cues instead.  Learn A Song also has Riff Repeater which allows you to mark a section and then slow it down and vary the difficulty level -- this is indispensible for getting those hard riffs down.  I also enjoyed working through the Lessons and Guitarcade.  Guitarcade is a collection of about a dozen games and they are an excellent way to get some technique practice in without feeling like you're doing something as boring as scales.  I'd really like to see more of these mini-games as they are much more fun than practice exercises.Cons: Ubisoft sites really suck at consistency.  Achievements and unlocks are shown on the Ubisoft site, the Rocksmith site, and Steam.  Steam is rock solid but the others are woefully inconsistent and aggravating to use.  500 missions?  Really?  What an annoying achievement!  Guitarcade's Hurtling Hurdles seems much too sensitive and poorly balanced compared to the other games.  Session mode -- the mission system kept pushing this but I found it a dreadful bore since I'm not good enough to improvise anything interesting at this point.			"

												I can't praise this game enough. I love all forms of rock and soft metal music. From a very early age I always wanted to play guitar but will openly admit that my skills don't match my enthusiasm. Many years ago I tried electric guitar and wasn't very good. I eventually gave up through lack of improvement and and injury where I lost my left middle finger tip. It wasn't until just over a year ago when I was fancying the idea of trying guitar again. Because of my finger I thought about trying bass and out of the blue my girlfriend bought me a bass starter set for my Christmas present. I was immediately hooked but again my enthusiasm exceeded my skills, then I came across Rocksmith 2014. For me it has been a revelation and although I accept the purist musicians might not think it's great for people like myself that have a love for music but lack the skill it is a must to have. I don't have a very good memory and can't really play son's without out the help of Rocksmith 2014 but the big incentive is that I can now play music to which I consider a pretty good standard. I am now the guy that has all the gear and no idea lol. I bought myself a Schecter stiletto custom 4 bass with an Orange bass amp and various pedals and use Rocksmith to compliment them. While i'm realistic and know that i'm no Duff McKegan I couldn't have achieved what I have without rocksmith and in the end of the day I have fun and enjoy it which is what it's all about. For other people like myself I couldn't recommend Rocksmith 2014 enough. I would like to add that what you get for the price is an understatement. I would dread to think how much money I would have spent on lessons to get to the stage i'm at. While I accept with tuition I might be at a better standard for the cost difference involved it doesn't compare. Also initially I played this on my PS3 but moved to using my PC as I love being able to have such a massive library of custom songs available to me through customforge.comI can honestly say that I only have found two drawbacks but this is not due to the game itself as the things I am doing are outwith what the game was originally designed for. I'm a bit of a gadget geek and I use Rocksmith via my amp and tv for sound by using a switch blade+ spliter which can sometimes cause issues with the real tone cable and also the game very rarely crashes after prolonged use using custom songs. But as I say these aren't official features of the game so it's unfair to mark it down on these cases.			"

												After reading some of the bad reviews and knowing that the game is made by Ubisoft (uhh...), I was hesitant to get it.But I absolutely love this game. The microphone feature doesnt work for me, but the True Tone cable works great. I mostly play with 2 guitars and with one of them I have some weird delays when playing some of the arcade games, but everything else works fine.Before getting the game I had already played guitar for about 10 years, so I can play most of the songs in the game, but the one´s that I dont know I find the learning process intuitive and fun. I imagine that even for absolute beginners this is a great game, especially if you want to move up from Guitar Hero.The arcade games are fun and useful and I personally enjoy the jamming sessions.If you are you going to buy this game, then you can get custom dlc (songs) for free from http://customsforge.com/The catch is that you need to have at least 1 original DLC, some of the newer one´s dont count though, so check the list.I bought the game for like 10 eur? + 35 for the Real Tone cable + I bought some dlc. Very happy with the purchase. "

												I've always wanted to play guitar but every time I've tried I got to a point where I'd get bored, reading tabs was confusing for a beginner and I was really having trouble with chords. I've had Rocksmith since February 2014 and at the point of writing this review in July 2015 and after putting in I'd say around 200-300 hours with the xbox 360 version and now the PC version, I've pretty much got to a point where I can play most songs without trouble, some chords I still struggle with and obviously Sweet Child O'Mine can be a tad difficult but I'm definitely pleased with how far I've come in regards to ability.The learning tools are fun and the skill games in arcade mode are challenging and actually help with remembering notes. The DLC track packs are constantly being rolled out so you're never short of songs to play, not to mention CLDC being made by members of the community (check out Custom's Forge, they have literally thousands of songs to download for free).As far as the graphics go there's not much to say really, similarly to Rock Band graphics aren't really important, that being said the menu's and in game interfaces are all solid.Overall, well worth the money, I don't think I'd have ever got to the point where I can actually say yes I can play an instrument.

												Rocksmith is an amazing way to improve your guitar & bass playing abilities, jam, learn new songs, and even discover new artists. I've been playing bass guitar since I was 16. I haven't been in a band for 5 years and it's hard to stay sharp and find time to practise. Also, bass is a pretty boring instrument to play by yourself. I continue to write and produce music independently and Rocksmith is a great way to get through the grind of practise. The game works great with my basses and electric guitar. It also works really well with my classical acoustic (which has a built in pickup). The acoustic has been a very fun way to play too since I have the heavy guitar tone coming out my headphones, but I can hear the body of the acoustic as well which confirms that I'm actually playing something nice.I had no idea I like Metalcore, but after playing an Avenge Sevenfold track on bass I've spent my whole weekend mastering all of their songs. Thanks Ubisoft!I've played with the settings and have only 2ms latency with the real tone cable which I'm very comfortable playing with. My DAW tpyically runs at 5ms, so as an audio processing app it's pretty legit. There are also amp modelling modes and an effects board. The tones in this mode are really great, however it is difficult to use the menus to really dive deep into all the functions. My guess is that the menus were designed for console and not PC.One thing that I would love would be the ability to set my own tuning in the game and have the tracks update as per my bass config. I play a 5-string bass so for a SOAD song I can just as easily play on the low-B rather than tuning my whole setup to drop C. Also some songs are very reliant on open notes which I personally don't like, I'd like to be able to say rather than going open D, playing the 5th fret on the A string. This is all nit picky stuff though, the game is amazing.The songs bundled with the game cover so many genres that there really is something for everyone. The DLC has been great since day one. I've bought DLC for Avenge Sevenfold, Motley Crue, Iron Maiden, Deftones, Killers, Strokes, Smashing Pumpkins, Rush, and Pantera. I plan on buying a whole lot more but I need to master a few tracks in my library first!			"

												This is an first impression review, after playing like about an hour. Most important thing: Buy the Ubisoft Real Tone cable and dont try another one. I did, and its only a mess. Ubisoft cable works perfectly, plug & play. The other calbe didnt work.Second: People are complaining about delay. THIS IS JUST NOT TRUE. Maybe it depends on your overall system setup. Maybe you play too slow. Maybe you dont grasp the display and when to play. I didnt exerience any delays yet. Timing is good.In the beginning the display is not easy to understand. I had the impression that they dont explain much and just throw you into the cold water. So you try to hit the right tones and understand the display while playing. Its ok, because you need to put some effort in terms of thinking and attention into it. So its a bit challenging in terms of usability in the first place. But its not bad and I had the impression its all thought through quite carefuly.The software is quite smart. I tried the lead guitar mode. You pick a song you like. And it makes you play single tones of that song, but with a lot of time distance between the tones, so you have enough time to undestand what to do and when and find the right tone to play. When you get better or are good already the software increases the density of the tones successively and according to your progress. Quite smart.Fun thing is: When you hit the right tones or several in a row, the audience is screaming in the background. Quite nice. After you completed the song, the software might even praise you. :DThe strings you have to play have different colors in the display, which is nice since it connects your visual imagination with your hearing. I like that very much. The whole experience also improves connecting listening, playing and singing at the same time. It really makes you want to sing and play all at once. Its all quite encouraging and makes your neurons connect and firing. A small minus is, that for advanced players it might be interesting to see where to put several of your fingers at once, so you could increase the speed of playing and switching from one tone to another. The display only shows you single tones to play and if you dont know in advance where to put your fingures and are not experienced how this usually works you dont know how to play it fast enough. Hence, I think the software cannot stand for its own. Its an addon to other. more traditional sources of learning. Get to know tabs or get a teacher or online learning.I think the software is good to either learn some basics or have it as a kind of addon and it is a different playing experience with the features of connecting different of your senses. It makes you practice and play a bit, its fun to do and gives you some motivation and smiles. Hence, it's a smart software with some nice features and ideas to it and I like it. For beginners it might be a good basic start and for advanced players a nice addon or different experience with some benefits to it. If I had to rate it would get a grade ""B""or maybe like a 7.5 out of 10. "

												Love this thing. Been plucking away for over a year with this system and it has helped keep me engaged while I've matured from a complete novice to a slightly more experienced novice. Would have certainly lost interest in practicing without this software. There will be things you need to research and learn outside of what this program offers, but it keeps me coming back to play that one more song which is what I consider most impressive and worthwhile. Recommended for any other newbies that find themselves losing heart easily.			"

For example the game has lesson, songs to play, and even the ability to play with a band.   And that isn't even all it can do.  You can play minigame!

												I got both Rocksmiths for myself on Christmas 2014. I have had played bass and guitar 9 years before I got the game so I didn't actually think that the game would teach me anything, and it didn't.EDIT: After releasing more Rush songs and some Dream Theater, the game definitely has given me something of a challenge.What is Rocksmith good for if you are a long term musician?- It's a game like Guitar Hero- it's fun to play and get scores- This means that you can play while putting your brains away, just watch the screen and play.- The game took me out of my comfort zone, it made me learn songs from k-pop to Mozart, some things I would never play myself.- This game offers Riff Repeater which  is awesome for learning long and pain-in-the-♥♥♥ style of guitar solo's.

												Decent learning tool. Defintly for novice guitarists like myself to lean the ropes.  However it is not perfect.The note detection is hit and miss. How the tracks are set up, slowly adds notes once you hit a track perfectly or removes them when you miss a fraction, is a decent idea. Once you put it into practice though it is psychologically frustrating. Here is why. Once you learn a riff on a lower dificulty you have to relearn that riff again when the difficulty ramps up. Subconsciously you are relearning a single song multiple times over and over again. Then muscle memory will not have a clear memory to focus on. Leading to frustration for guitarists. No matter who I talk to about Rocksmith is irritated with the software.You can however max out the song and play at slower speeds then manually make them faster over time. This slightly less irritating because hitting/missing unkown chords or riffs will continue regardless. What would make it better is for the a training mode to stop a track until you hit the note or the chord perfectly then move to the next one to get a taste of the dish. Then move on to nonstop tracks. Occasionaly, on my rig anyway, the chord is very picky about how it is placed in the guitars output. Buzzing sounds cut off all outputs as well as the output cutting off alltogether. Rocksmith provides a lot of information and is a decent escape for bordem. But you could search for the same information online for free.			"

												As a complete beginner with stringed instruments as a whole, I have never before played a song on the guitar, or even held a guitar for more than five minutes without getting bored of it, in just four days, I was already playing full length songs on a beginner level.Well, until my guitar's high e string snapped while tuning it. I need to get that replaced. :')This game definitely does teach you guitar. While it may not teach you music theory, it is recommended that you teach yourself on the side so that while Rocksmith teaches you how to master the guitar itself, which it actually does, you can also teach yourself how to play guitar notes on the side so that you can read sheet music.You can play guitar by ear and skill, sure, but you're only half a musician until you know music theory too.This game's definitely a great choice for a beginner or even an experienced guitarist.And yes, it definitely makes practice addicting.

												The best and funnest Game to learn Guitar & Bass. Was just Remastered! Whether it makes a difference or not is yet to be determined. As far as I could tell I didn't notice anything that needed to be called Remastered. Doesn't mean there isn't. since I finally decided to leave some notes for this game. I will update this post once I do if ever notice any worthy changes. If we're lucky maybe a 3rd game isn't as far away as I once thought.This Remastard Edition Udate fixed tons of bugs. The game runs at least twice as good. On my PC away. Unfortunateitly the Motor Reving Sound after each Score Attact Game is Still Played.One last this there is a bit of a learning curve. For those who never picked up a guitar before. But like anything else practice, practice, practice. Do just that at your own speed. I don’t see why you wouldn’t get better in time. This game will teach you how to play guitar and bass is you want it to.And for those who already know how to play it will sharpen your skills and hey it’s better than guitar Hero.			"

												At the time of writing this, I have around 27 hours in the game. That's not much but I will definitely be spending a lot more time on this game.I'd reccommend this to any guitarist, beginners and experienced players alike.  I've been playing for about 6 years, and have learned more songs in my 27 hours of having this than I would learn in a year without it.  It has drastically improved my playing, I can do pinch harmonics now :DNot to mention the song list - there are tons of classics to choose from. They generally cost about $3/song, but truthfully it's worth it.If you're looking to learn the guitar, or simply improve upon your playing, this game is the way to go.			"

												The best and funnest Game to learn Guitar & Bass. Was just Remastered! Whether it makes a difference or not is yet to be determined. As far as I could tell I didn't notice anything that needed to be called Remastered. Doesn't mean there isn't. since I finally decided to leave some notes for this game. I will update this post once I do if ever notice any worthy changes. If we're lucky maybe a 3rd game isn't as far away as I once thought.This Remastard Edition Udate fixed tons of bugs. The game runs at least twice as good. On my PC away. Unfortunateitly the Motor Reving Sound after each Score Attact Game is Still Played.One last this there is a bit of a learning curve. For those who never picked up a guitar before. But like anything else practice, practice, practice. Do just that at your own speed. I don’t see why you wouldn’t get better in time. This game will teach you how to play guitar and bass is you want it to.And for those who already know how to play it will sharpen your skills and hey it’s better than guitar Hero.			"

												This is my favourite game of all time. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's thought of learning to play electric guitar or bass,  I purchased my first electric guitar and bass when the first game was released and I've been playing ever since on Xbox on now on PC. It gets expensive with all the DLC but since I've built my collection over time, it's been just a little here and there.  My only issue is with the Real Tone cable. I've had endless problems with the two I have since I switched to Windows 8 and then 10. The drivers continue to be a problem with the cable not being recognized by most of my faster USB ports.  I had to buy a powered USB 2.0 hub to get it to work with Windows 10.  I know others have had this problem as well. The recent remastered edition is great. It fixed all of the little annoying things about the menus.  My favourite is that you can now access all versions of a song from the song's top page, no need to dig in each instrument to see what's avaialble.  "

Do some reading and practice a little on your own before playing this.If you plan on getting this for the purpose of playing/learning bass, be prepared to buy some DLC, there's only maybe 6 or 7 default songs that are good for bass. These are some of the dlc I would recommend.Yes Song PackRush Song Pack IIIron Maiden Song PackDream Theater Song PackWynona's Big Brown Beaver - PrimusPeace Sells - MegadethTornado of Souls - MegadethI Want You Back - The Jackson 5 "

Stick with it and you will be playing your favorite songs in no time. The price of dlc is a bit of a kick in the balls but you can always wait for a steam sale to pick them up, I guess you can import songs with the previous version and the disc import tool (all sold seperately).

												Pretty dissapointed with the song selection, but it's still a cool game.Now what it REALLY needs is a mode that completely stops the song on every note and waits for you to play it before moving to the next, rather than flying them all past your screen. Because note by note is how we read and play tabs, right? You look down at the note, play it on the guitar, and move onto the next; it's not as if your eyes skim past the tab while your fingers helplessly play catch-up, but that's how this game does it.Granted, you can emulate something close to that with their Riff Repeater mode set to 1% speed, but that also isn't perfect.The note-by-note function is already present in the very start of the game, but you never see it again after that. I just wish the developers provided an option to play songs using that.			"

												Wether you are looking to pick a string for the first time or want to get back into play guitar, this is the game you want to go for.With numerous modes such as Non-Stop Play  and Learn A Song you can easily pick up a guitar and RockSmith guides you though the song- slowly at first with not many frets to play but then, as you practise RockSmith adds more notes and riffs to play- slowly building up a song.Guitar-cade is another thing I like about this game, it allows you to practise slides, fret finger placement and more through use of old arcade style games.Really worth picking up for a guitarist or someone who wants to learn.

												Before I had ever heard of this game, I had bought a guitar years ago. I always wanted to learn, but never came through to learning how to play a song. I had once in a while picked up the guitar and strummed a few cords, just for the heck of it. Until December 2013 I heard about this new program called Rocksmith 2014, and although I've heard about the Rocksmith 2011 and I heard reviews that the 2011 edition was not accurate guitar teacher, I passed for buying the game. Since I heard about this new 2014 edition, I seemed interested on what all the fuss was about. After reading reviews and watching videos, I finally decided to buy the game. When plugging in my guitar for the first time, I was confused with scheme of the game. When I reversed of to the Learn a Song section, and played a song, I was confused with the notes and did not seem to be getting anywhere to playing the actual song. However, after playing the song for about a half-hour, the notes started to adjust to my ability as I learned the song more and more. I even used the handy riff repeater that can strengthen my skills within the notes of the song by speeding up or slowing down, and/or adjusting the difficulty. The game includes mini games if you ever get bored of Learn a Song and want to practice chords, finger picking, or just strumming the guitar. Don't worry too much about the option as I focus much with Learn a Song and the mini games. And after 8 months and 20 hours of practicing, not including off time practicing, I have learn about 10 songs fully. And the worth the price rather than paying a guitar teacher, in addition to paying the game on your own time. -Also supports bass :P "

												This is a really awesome game and a great way to learn guitar or improve and hone your skills if you already play guitar or bass. I'm really impressed with the minigames that teach you proper technique and dymanics, and they're fun and challenging. I recommend this game, I bought it during the summer sale and I don't regret it. I've been playing this a hell of a lot more than Pokemon Go.PROs:* Fun* Learn how to play or get better if you already can* Learn without tryingCONs* Challening or overwhelming to a beginner* 50$ cable to connect your guitar* 3$ DLC SongsI've personally has audio issues using this with TeamSpeak 3 and just general bugs like the amp emulation stopping, and the game not loading fully. Though I think it's worth a little frustration, still I wish I didn't have to deal with them at all, and other days bugs can be so bad I just stop playing the game.

												Fun way to play with guitar! I've played guitar for years so I don't know how easy it is to learn with this, but still a lot of fun to learn new songs. At first it was a bit hard to read the note highway as I'm used to guitar tabs, but after a while you get it. And of course harder songs need to be learned first and not while playing for the first time the whole song. Quality of the transcriptions will vary, some song are very good some are not as good transcriptions. Some lead tracks don't have rhythm almost at all which is in accurate in most cases. Mostly RS1 songs and DLC are crappier than RS2014, but had to buy the old one to get old dlc... Otherwise I enjoy this, it's the best that is available at the moment, hope they bring new version later and add possibility to see the songs in TAB format! Only other I've played is Bandfuse, I like it more than this, but as the company is bankrupt, this is the best we can get.			"

												So to start this review off , I started playing guitar 6 months ago and I bought Rocksmith roughly 5 months ago I suppose. So this review is by an actual beginner guitar player.Rocksmith really is a great tool if you want to learn how to play e-guitar , more speficially said it helps you play your favorite songs. There are technique lessons in there that you can tune in to and it might help you get better at the overall guitar playing techniques. the different scales are also included, so if you want to deeply delve into stuff like that , it gives you the most basic informations, but I guess further research is requiered.But now the most important part about Rocksmith. Does it help, wil you get better at guitar and just as important , is it even fun?Yes, Yes and Yes.It helps- It's just TAB's made into a graphic game basically. You play it kinda like the Guitar Hero games , hit the notes/acc/bendings/etc when they hit your screen.One of the biggest benefits for a beginner is the visualization of the Rhythm. It's much easier to memorize the rhythm when you kinda see when , which and how often you have to hit each strings.Furthermore there are quests that help you to be diversive, which brings us to the next point....It helps you to get better at your guitar playing.Even in the standard game there's a good bunch of songs that range from country to metal , from very easy beginner friendly songs too songs that are for more experienced players.The quests kinda motivate you to try out songs that you normally would'nt have touched and this will not only broaden your horizon in terms of music , it will also help you too see and use techniques that you wouldn't have used otherwise.I can only give you the advice to try a majority of the songs. Even if you dont like them , they might be fun to play and since you bought the game anyways you own them.And ofc , yes it is fun. It's fun because it is an easy and kinda ""fast"" way to learn the guitar. Is it the fastes like Ubisoft describes it? I doubt it , since every human being learns different. But alongside the song's you also have funny little minigames that are educational and let your train your chords , bendings , scales etc.It's also just a fantastic feeling to rock out your favorite songs and learning them, until you can play them without Rocksmith with your home equipment.What brings me to my last point , the sound of the ingame Amps.The guys that decipher the songs note for note and try to get the tone for the song as real as possible , they do a great job. On all the songs I own , the sound is very close to the original.But on the otherhand , the ingame amp sound without the original tones from the songs is not the best in my opinion , I would not want to use this for any kind of playing besides Rocksmith.But there's also a major problem with the game that I don't think will be ever fixed.Some of the bendings in some particular songs track very horrible and playing with a very low tuning like Drop C can be frustrating , some notes , strings and chords get veeeerrrry poorly detected.You can still learn the rhythm and tabs however.A quick summarize.Positive+ It helps you start your guitar hobby and helps you to continuesly get better at it+ You can very easily learn your favorite songs and discover new bands/tracks that you never heard off+ You can learn probably the majority of the most important techniques and scales+ The tone of the songs is very close to the original tone , on the other hand....Negative - .... the standard ingame amp seems to lack a good tone. might be only my configs though.- Bendings get sometimes very badly recognized- If you want to play in low tunings like Drop C , be prepared to be frustrated. I would recommend getting thick strings , they tend to help the real-tone cable to recognized your chords better when tuned down.- CARE THERE ARE SONGS OUT THERE THAT REQUIRE A CAPO. (ex. ""WONDERWALL"")I hope my review might help you guys "

												About me:I starting playing guitar in January of this year and bought the game two months later. I am playing on a Yamaha FSX700SC acoustic. Although music has been a part of my life for many years, this is the first time I have tried to learn a traditional instrtrument. Rocksmith 2014 is a great tool for learning songs and techniques without requiring the use of teachers or traditional self help books and videos. I do not recommend using this game as the only resource for learning the guitar but it is a great adjunct for players learning in a more traditional way. The learning curve has felt daunting and frustrating at times but patience and persistance has helped me learn some really cool stuff from this game. With that said, there are some things that this game cannot teach you:Strum patterens are covered in some detail in the Lesson mode but the game never indicates if you need to strum up or down. This makes playing 'rhythm' songs that are very chord heavy almost impossible unless you are already familiar and comfortable with this concept. Same with alternate picking; there is a lesson on it but beginners will inevitably have bad habits because the game has no way of knowing or correcting your technique. Learning outside of the game seems crucial for really getting better down the road.Now here's what this game can teach you:Self help books and videos are great when it comes to timing, strum patterns, and reading sheet music but one thing I love about this game is that you are playing real songs which means you are constantly playing up and down the neck. Books and sheet music for a beginner feel restricted because it is a very slow process. Learning scales and keys means that you are only working with a limited amount of frets at one time. This game has helped me learn which string/fret represent each key in a way that is fun and fast.Chords are obviously essential and this game is worth it for the chord book alone. Learning all the different shapes and barre chords can seem daunting but this method of learning is a lot more intuitive and fun. I really like how it tells you the chord names as you are playing/learning a song.My experience with playing the game on acoustic has been alright. Electric might be better for this game because a lot of the songs were originally played that way. Also, there can be some sound issues with acoustic because of how loud they are but the 'Mixer' option let's you tweak the sound to your liking. If you are thinking of picking up a guitar for the first time this game is an essantial learning tool. Learning the guitar without real lessons or a teacher can be almost impossible in the long run but this game is the beginning of something exciting. I credit this game for the majority of my current skills with guitar, and who knows where I would be in terms of skill without it. Sure, I may have bad habits in some areas but the gratifying feeling of playing real songs and learning real concepts is unparalleled to other methods of learning.			"

												8 hours of gameplay so far.First impressions are good, I feel asthough my bass playing has improved already. I really enjoy the way Rocksmith has taken away the ""punsihment"", it dosent tell you off if you play a note that isnt there or top the song if your not doing well enough, this combined with the way that ricksmith seamlessly increases and decreases difficulty makes the Rocksmith encoraging to play and learning to play alot more enjoyable. There is a wide varitey of songs to chose from, however it would have been nice to have seen more tracks includeing those from other genres. Its also anoying how dlc songs will show up in the track selection with no way to turn this off other than playing offline.PROS:    *Easy to pick up (no pun intended)    *Encoraging and fun way to learn music    *Wide varitey of tracks included and avalible as dlcCONS:    *Included tracks could be larger    *Non-owned DLC show up in track selectionTL;DR: Incoraging way to learn guitar 10/10 recomend for anyone trying to learn bass or guitar.PRO TIP: if you want more songs cheap percahse the origonal rocksmith and import tool to get all the tracks from rocksmith 2013.

												If it looks like Guitar Hero with a real guitar, it's because it is. Very easy to pick up, very easy to learn songs, and there's a huge selection of them as well - you're bound to find something you like. The main downside of RS is the price, which comes with all music-related things. The game itself is kind of expensive, then you have to buy a guitar (if you don't have one already) and the 40mm-to-USB cable which costs quite a lot for a cable. I bet it's gold plated. Also the DLC is 2.99 per song, so don't waste your money on four minutes of power chords. At least there's a lot of artist packs which allow you to get more songs for less money. In short: great game, kinda expensive, but that's to be expected with music things. Get it now and l2shred, kid			"

												I saw a guitar teacher in a video on the Internet say that it takes about 3,000 hours of practice for someone to really become decently competent at the guitar. His point was simply that there was no substitute for putting in the time, and no real shortcuts  - though of course good instruction (such as his own) would help.RS2014 went away from its more ""gamey"" style predecessor to become more of a full-fledged training tool for the guitar. This was a good move. It's easily three times better than the original Rocksmith at meeting this goal. Everything is much, MUCH more instructive and convenient. It gives you lots of tools to learn popular (and not-so-popular) songs... really learn them, to the point where you can completely play them from memory. From the basic ""Learn a song"" tool to the flexible ""Riff Repeater,"" which allows you to practice a section of a song over and over again, to the ability to test yourself at various skill levels in Score Attack - which is a lot like classic Guitar Hero / Rock Band type play. But it also includes dozens of lessons - many with practice tracks. And a number of ""Guitarcade"" technique games to take some of the boredom out of common drills. You can simulate a large number of amps, cabinets, and effects to simulate all kinds of tones and use the game like a sound system and amp - and to learn how your favorite band got a particular tone for a particular song. `There's a ""Session Mode"" where you can practice jamming and improvising with a computer-controlled band. The game supports lead guitar, rhythm guitar, *AND* bass techniques - including a ""bass emulation"" mode to learn to play bass on a regular six-string guitar. And there's multi-player (really 2-player) capability, so a friend can plug in (with another cable, which currently runs $30) and the two of you can learn songs together, jam together in Session mode, play a duet with different song parts for a high score, and go head-to-head in a competition at the same difficulty level and part to see who is the better player.The game isn't perfect in detecting the notes, and will allow some sloppiness in your playing that does not sound good to the human ear. Unplugging or adjusting the mix and really listening to yourself is a must, or you could develop some bad habits because the game will let you get away with it.Ultimately, the success of the game is dependent on how successful it is at teaching you to play guitar. It's supposed to be ""the fastest way to learn guitar."" I don't know if that's exactly the case. But I will say this - it's helped me make more progress in the last six months than I had in twenty years on my own, so that's a good sign. I've been playing about 45 minutes per day, on the average, and it's really made a difference.But the important thing to remember is that it doesn't work miracles. If you think you can master the guitar in the time it takes for you to master Super Mario Brothers, you are going to be disappointed. You won't go from being a beginner to playing like Eddie Van Halen in 60 hours. That 3000 hour thing is not super flexible. The game does help in two ways:1) It can provide lots of feedback and support to help make your practice time more efficient. This may yield somewhat greater improvement per hour of practice than doing so unaided.2) It can make your practice time more fun, which may encourage you to practice more, and stick with it. And that's really all it can do, though that's awesome. In the end - if you want to learn to play guitar, you are going to HAVE to put in the hours. There's no way around that. If RS2014 makes those hours more productive and more fun (and I believe it does), that's a win!			"

												See my full review with screenshots and more at http://misstoxia.com/review-rocksmith-2014/Rocksmith 2014 is both a game and learning tool for use with a real electric guitar or bass. You plug in your guitar to a USB port with a special cable and can play through step by step guitar lessons, learn specific songs and riffs and play a variety of arcade style games with your guitar as the controller.Everything the game does is done in a very incremental, adaptive and intuitive way, from the games to the lessons, everything is designed to help you retain information about notes, chords and scales, etc, as well as building up your muscle memory to improve your skill at playing guitar. It’s obvious a lot of work and research has gone into making Rocksmith 2014 a powerful education tool that can teach anyone to play guitar while still being fun.The lessons try to teach you how to play in the way a real guitar tutor would; by explaining techniques, showing you how they are played and then giving you a go while gradually making things more advanced each time. The practice riffs also slow down and let you do things at your own pace if it thinks you are having trouble.There are also a decent amount of ‘Learn a Song’ songs that come with the game that start you off by getting you to play the very base notes that hold the song together, the game reacts to how well you are doing and gradually adds in more notes if you are getting everything right, eventually the notes will become chords and with enough practice you will easily learn how to play a song from start to finish.The arcade games are designed to make you remember specific aspects of guitar playing as well as increasing your reaction time, muscle memory and being able to play without looking at the guitar neck. One game has you shooting ducks by playing the right note as they appear in front of different frets, another has you strumming entire chords in a zombie rail shooter. I found all the games to be both fun and very helpful.Some other nice features Rocksmith 2014 has is a full tone designer where you can create your own digital sound using a variety of pedals, amps, loops and more. The real life equivalent of this kind of equipment is really expensive so I found it really fun to be able to play around with this kind of stuff. There’s also multiplayer modes, online leaderboards and session mode where you have an automatic band accompanying your guitar as you play.I don’t have many bad things to say about Rocksmith 2014 other than the song selection not being entirely to my taste, but a few DLCs fixed that for me. I also had an incredibly hard time getting a Rocksmith RealTone cable in Australia, all of the retail stores were sold out for over a month and I had to order one online. Some may also argue that the game is too repetitive, but with learning any instrument, repetition is the key to success and I think this game really makes the repetition as fun as it can possibly be.If you have a guitar sitting in the corner of your room which you don’t really play because you’ve given up on learning it on your own, then I highly suggest you try Rocksmith 2014, you will almost definitely improve at playing guitar, learn some new songs and have lots of fun. If you want to learn guitar on your own, this is the way to do it.			"

												Makes me play guitar everyday, few flaws, huge amount of official and unofficial DLCs. Having someone who plays guitar is sometime reccomended to understand how to play something but for the most part the game/learning tool is self explanatory and full of practice lessons with video explanations on various techniques. Custom DLCs can be found here http://customsforge.com/search/ although I recommend them only to the more experienced player due to their lack of precision that needs some knowlegde to fill up. Anyway I suggest buyng official DLCs if you want a quality product, many of them are really worth buying.8.5 / 10    Recommended to everyone who wants to learn guitar or just don't have time to study tabs			"

												Wether you are looking to pick a string for the first time or want to get back into play guitar, this is the game you want to go for.With numerous modes such as Non-Stop Play  and Learn A Song you can easily pick up a guitar and RockSmith guides you though the song- slowly at first with not many frets to play but then, as you practise RockSmith adds more notes and riffs to play- slowly building up a song.Guitar-cade is another thing I like about this game, it allows you to practise slides, fret finger placement and more through use of old arcade style games.Really worth picking up for a guitarist or someone who wants to learn.

												UPDATE: 8/10 - Awful G String Detection. Awful bending detectionI give the game a 9/10.I played the original Rocksmith on PlayStation 3 and enjoyed it very much. Got this one for $15 in the Summer Sale for fun and to be able to have a Rocksmith to play on PC :)However, I prefered the tuner in the first Rocksmith over this new one. Sometimes the notes don't match up correctly and they ""Miss"" when clearly, me playing all the chords without a problem through songs, especially when playing Knockin' on Heaven's Door, a lot of the notes on the 2nd fret of the G String seem to never go through how they should. Yet, a lot of other chords involving the G String work without a problem.There are some flaws, but the game is still VERY much worth getting.I know it can't be my guitar, the first game works fine on PS3. I have an Epiphone Les Paul and I will be running a new Gibson Les Paul 1959 through it here in a few weeks! :)			"

												At the time of writing this, I have around 27 hours in the game. That's not much but I will definitely be spending a lot more time on this game.I'd reccommend this to any guitarist, beginners and experienced players alike.  I've been playing for about 6 years, and have learned more songs in my 27 hours of having this than I would learn in a year without it.  It has drastically improved my playing, I can do pinch harmonics now :DNot to mention the song list - there are tons of classics to choose from. They generally cost about $3/song, but truthfully it's worth it.If you're looking to learn the guitar, or simply improve upon your playing, this game is the way to go.			"

												About me:I starting playing guitar in January of this year and bought the game two months later. I am playing on a Yamaha FSX700SC acoustic. Although music has been a part of my life for many years, this is the first time I have tried to learn a traditional instrtrument. Rocksmith 2014 is a great tool for learning songs and techniques without requiring the use of teachers or traditional self help books and videos. I do not recommend using this game as the only resource for learning the guitar but it is a great adjunct for players learning in a more traditional way. The learning curve has felt daunting and frustrating at times but patience and persistance has helped me learn some really cool stuff from this game. With that said, there are some things that this game cannot teach you:Strum patterens are covered in some detail in the Lesson mode but the game never indicates if you need to strum up or down. This makes playing 'rhythm' songs that are very chord heavy almost impossible unless you are already familiar and comfortable with this concept. Same with alternate picking; there is a lesson on it but beginners will inevitably have bad habits because the game has no way of knowing or correcting your technique. Learning outside of the game seems crucial for really getting better down the road.Now here's what this game can teach you:Self help books and videos are great when it comes to timing, strum patterns, and reading sheet music but one thing I love about this game is that you are playing real songs which means you are constantly playing up and down the neck. Books and sheet music for a beginner feel restricted because it is a very slow process. Learning scales and keys means that you are only working with a limited amount of frets at one time. This game has helped me learn which string/fret represent each key in a way that is fun and fast.Chords are obviously essential and this game is worth it for the chord book alone. Learning all the different shapes and barre chords can seem daunting but this method of learning is a lot more intuitive and fun. I really like how it tells you the chord names as you are playing/learning a song.My experience with playing the game on acoustic has been alright. Electric might be better for this game because a lot of the songs were originally played that way. Also, there can be some sound issues with acoustic because of how loud they are but the 'Mixer' option let's you tweak the sound to your liking. If you are thinking of picking up a guitar for the first time this game is an essantial learning tool. Learning the guitar without real lessons or a teacher can be almost impossible in the long run but this game is the beginning of something exciting. I credit this game for the majority of my current skills with guitar, and who knows where I would be in terms of skill without it. Sure, I may have bad habits in some areas but the gratifying feeling of playing real songs and learning real concepts is unparalleled to other methods of learning.			"

												This game is an absolutely incredible learning tool and peice of software. It really isnt so much a game as it is a practice device but with that said I really love it. The way the game gradually ups the difficulty as you go along strongly aids in the learning process. There are tons of modes and minigames with which to hone your skill.My favorite part may be the amp integrations and fast transitions they make during the course of a song. It feels really great to have a near identical tone to the song without having to fiddle with a peddleboard. That said I am a little dissapointed at the amount of songs and the cost of the DLC ones. $2.99 per songs seems a bit steep for me but I will still probably end up getting a couple here or there. Bottom line if you even have a slight interest in guitar then I highly recommend Rocksmith 2014			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is a great starting point for anybody that has wanted to learn the guitar.  For a long time I've wanted to learn how to play but never had the means or resources to do it.  Like most people I got hooked into the whole Guitar Hero and Rock Band craze which was fun but at the end of the day it did nothing to help me learn the guitar.  If I could take all those hours of playing those games and invested it into Rocksmith who knows how much better I would be.  Games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero had one thing going for them in my opinion: They made me realize how much fun it was to be ""playing"" music that I liked.  Fast forward a few years and I learned about Rocksmith.  I researched the game a bit and saw some videos which demonstrated how the game worked.  In theory the game sounded amazing: a way to learn how to play songs that I like (and discover some new ones) with a real guitar.  I was skeptical at first because on one hand it would require you to own/buy/borrow a real guitar to do it.  After a few months I broke down and went to Guitar Center to buy a guitar to play.  I first purchased the game for the PS3 off of Amazon because it shipped with the Real Tone cable and it was on sale.  Firing up the game for the first time the game asks you a few basic questions about your skill level and your guitar.  The game boasts that you can enjoy it whether your a pro or never touched a guitar in your life.  There are a variety of lessons that range from the basics (how to hold the guitar, put the strap on, and intro to chords) to more advanced techniques like palm mutes (and other techniques that I'm nowhere close to trying).  There is a session mode where you can jam with a virtual band that will jam along with you while you mess around with all the tools they offer.  The other instruments will play differently depending on how fast or slow you play.  There is the Guitarcade mode where you can play mini games designed to help you work on different skills.Finally there is the Learn a Song mode which I probably where I spend most of my time.  There is quite a collection of music and it spans many genres.  Since purchasing this for the PC I've also picked up some extra songs whenever they go on sale (usually during the holiday sales).  Most of the songs have three different paths you could play on any particular song: Lead, Rhythm, or Bass guitar.  Once I started playing the notes were few and far between with little to no emphasis on chords.  You don't have to worry if you mess up too much because unlike Guitar Hero or Rock Band you can't fail a song.  The game will simply take away notes to make it easier for you to play.  There is also the Riff Repeater tool which allows you to focus on certain sections of a song, slow it down, and change the difficulty if you are having trouble with a particular riff or section.  Within the last two days I've gotten close to entering Master mode on a couple of sections of certain songs.  As you progress and improve the notes will begin to fade away so that you will have to start memorizing the song.In my opinion this game is an excellent tool for anybody serious about trying to learn the guitar.  It is not a magic wand that will make you a master guitar player but it's a great place to start.  If you are not willing to put the time in and practice no tool or game will be able to help you improve.  I can honestly say that the time I've put into the game has at least allowed me to improve .  I still have a long way to go before I'm anywhere close to being good but I'm having fun learning and I believe that is what will keep me practicing and trying to get better.			"

												I have both versions of this game for xbox.. and now rocksmith 2014 on pc now that my xbox finally died on me. Though I feel the first Rocksmith had more of a reward system and felt closer to the rockband/guitar hero games. I Feel that this version is more inclusive and adaptive for the player. If a section gets to hard for you then it dials it back a bit, if its to slow for you it dials it up a notch. Now had they incorporated the rewards system (ie earning new guitars and venues from the first rocksmith) instead of the new amps and heads i think it would make it feel more rewarding.. With that being said I REALLY enjoy this game. I enjoy the guitarcade games and some of the changes they have implimented, there are some changes i didnt like, (the sessions menue wasnt much to my liking, but i can see why the added it and the way you change up your ""gear"" needs some improvement) but all in all  i feel this is a good game for people who are learning guitar or want to add some knowledge to what they already know and get started learning songs quick.

												Have you ever played one of those plastic toys? You know those toys that you jammed so hard on with a rubber band to master Through the Fire and The Flames..  and those baby plastic toys broke within months due to shredding 5 colored buttons for Guitar Hero? Well yea, you had a dream didn't you? A dream that you could intentionally smash that piece of crap plastic and pick up a solid piece of wood.. You know.. Wood with strings, tuning pegs, and.. real wood.                                       Guess what.. Ubisoft had the same dream.. But unlike you.. they made it a reality.. and here it is, Rocksmith 2014! Rocksmith had came out in late 2011 and was a game that you had a simple cable plugged into the guitar in one end.. and the other end of the cable going into your computer or console. The game was meant for anyone of any skill. But for people who do not know how to play guitar, this was an amazing teaching device. 3 years later Ubisoft released a new Rocksmith.. Also known as Rocksmith 2014. This jamming game was a kick A** version of their original game with improvements to almost everything from visuals to lag compensation. This is a dream come true. At first I thought it was a big gimmick.. but only a month later I already felt like a true rockstar. I went from not knowing how to tune a guitar to knowing how to play Chop Suey by System of a Down. And if you bought this game.. some of you may be wondering.. ""Um.  How did you get Chop Suey? I don't see that in the game.. I also don't see it in the DLC store. I am very confused..""   Well let me help you out:  CDLC (or Custom Downloadable Content). This is content created by the community (Not to be confused with Steam's built in Community Workshop).. There are many videos out there on Youtube and plenty of guides people have created on both the internet and Steam that explain how to do this. Please remember this is NOT official Ubisoft material! Ubisoft has allowed this to be done but they do not endorse it. Remember this is not a work around to Ubisofts offical released DLC you buy through the Steam store. That is considered copyright and is not allowed! But anyways back onto the game, Rocksmith 2014 is an amazing game. It does not matter if you are Van Halen or some little boy from Germany who has made his way to the United States with very little money and nothing but a computer and a guitar but has no knowledge of how to shred! There is a skill level for everyone! You will never regret this purchase, as long as you want to play guitar and are willing to buy a Guitar and Rocksmith 2014. You are all set. (Please remember if you buy the digital version of Rocksmith / Rocksmith 2014 you must own the OFFICIAL licensed USB - 1/4 Cable Rocksmith sells. Third party adapters will not work. The cables work cross platform.. so the same cable you buy for Xbox360 will work on PS3 and PC and vice versa).  Do I need to say more? Buy it!Edit: October 4th, 2016; Ubisoft just did a big update ""Remastering"" the game. It is amazing they are still showing their support for this game! If you have not bought this yet, I highly reccomend it still!			"

A vast library of songs continuing to expand through DLC, tutorials ranging from two-handed tapping to just putting on your guitar strap, and even the ability to emulate bass so you won't go hungry... The results are undeniable.Rocksmith will teach you the guitar.			"

												Let's get down to business... This game was certainly one of Ubisoft's best games. You require an Electric guitar/bass guitar and a Rocksmith Real Tone cable in order to play this game. But I'm very impressed with how it worked, I understand that there are so many glitches in this game, but when the game works, it is just amazing.To simply state upsides and downsides, I'll list them:Pro's:You can learn guitar easily.There are many songs to choose from whether it's Rocksmith 2012/2014, DLC, or CDLC.You can get a Rocksmith 2012 import for Rocksmith 2014 giving Rocksmith 2014 a lot of Rocksmith 2012's songs.There are lessons and arcade games to play which uses the Electric guitar, it certainly helps.Missions to unlock songs/gear/inlays.Layout is simple and easy, whether it's the interface or the Riff repeater.Con's:For some, guitar is hard to play, I certainly had trouble, and that was beacuse I didn't practice the practice tracks, which I recommend you do if you're having trouble shifting/bending etc...DLC is way too expensive, asking £2.39 for a DLC with Rythym guitar, lead guitar, bass guitar and vocals... a little too much right? YOu can find all this stuff on the internet, but I buy these DLC's to help me learn the songs.Some CDLC may crash, and a while back Rocksmith 2014 just kept crashing when I started a song or lesson.Setting this up with a ♥♥♥♥. took me at least five hours to fix the bugs myself and get my guitar to be picked up on this game... thanks internet too.Missions... now, these... are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've never seen a game as bad as Rocksmith 2014's mission system... you had to do it... you had to be a bunch of idiots, put a basic coding into the missions, and from like... play 1 new song, you ask for 3. From a 10 note streak, you go up to 300 after a while, and you have to get 100% mastery in songs... and yet, no matter how many times I repeat the song, you can't get 100% mastery, and once it had bugged out and not registered. And every single mission is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, allow for skippable missions and I'd recommend wasting time completing missions. I have to alt-f4 and launch the game to get a decent easy mission since I am only a beginner. Ubisoft idiots went too far with judging players skills, Beginner mode is what I started out as, and because of missions, they appear to think I'm pro. Also, there's no support for guitars with more strings. And no support for drums or vocals.About the stupid coding stuff... let's just say, there's only 2 songs on each path that the game recognizes, or at least 3. 2 CDLC's and one Rocksmith 2014 song... why not any of the others? Why not? Seriously, fix this or at least release an expansion pack that doesn't cost anything. But I recommend this game for the guitar player who wants to learn songs and learn guitar. But this is not for completionists, it is impossible to complete this game, it's just an unlimited game. For ♥♥♥♥s sake ubisoft, release updates for this, not DLC.			"

												Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.			"

												A week ago, I didn't even know how to properly hold a guitar pick, and had no idea how to tune a guitar.  Since then, I've put about an hour or so a night into this.  Today, I went online, figured out I was able to read Tabs, and was able to play Saria's Song from scratch in about 30 minutes of practice.  I've still got a long way to go, but this is huge to me.If you're wondering if this game can teach you how to play the guitar, the answer is a resounding YES.  You will get as much out of it as you put into it.That said, the game isn't without its flaws.  It has a hard time reading certain notes, especially on my cheapo guitar, so you might have to play with the tuning to get it just right.  It also has a really hard time reading bends, making you feel like you almost have to snap the strings just to get it to read right.If you've always wanted to learn how to play guitar, but thought it looked too hard or were too afraid to try, get yourself a cheap guitar, the cable, and this game, and you'll get over your fear really quickly.

												If you really interested to play/jam a music of your favorite band but you can't play guitar, this game is recommended for you. I do really have fun playing this game even though I don't understand about how to play chords stuff etc. Just follow what is on screen and I really enjoy it. :) But if you follow all Lesson part in this game you will get a lot of knowledge on how to play guitar, techniques, chords, etc. "

												Remaster Update:They made some smart changes to the game menus, allowing you to more quickly filter and sort your songs. This is awesome if you have a lot of DLC. The overhauled Riff Repeater is great as well. I still recommend this game -- they consistently release DLC, and the quality of life improvements make the game even better than before.Original Review:I've been having a blast with this game. It takes the addictive elements of guitar hero and rock band, and teaches you real guitar techniques. There are lots of fun songs across all genres to learn, and the game does a good job of letting you ramp up until you are playing every note. It also has a cool ""riff repeater"" mode that lets you slow down and repeat sections of the song in order to practice. I've played about 50 hours of the game and I can actually play a few songs on my own already.There is also has a mini game mode that turns practicing scales, chords and other drills into games, which is more fun than just practicing those things over and over.My only complaint with this game is that it doesn't have very good tools for calibrating audio/visual input lag. I wish it had more robust tools like Rock Band does, because there's not much you can do to correct it. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who has had fun with Guitar Hero and wants to actually learn guitar.			"

												First off, do ignore my playing hours. I've put this game down and restarted so many times my ACTUAL gameplay count would be like... 2 at best.Now, onto the review.The bad:Missions. Missions you say? What is this, GTA? Skyrim?!Yes, this thing has ""missions"". And that little rectangle will ♥♥♥♥ you off beyond belief. A good chunk of said missions are useless. ""Play ____ in the guitarcade!"". Yes, ""guitarcade"". You get to play little minigames, like a weird version of flappyybird or some kind of space invaders thing. Except with ducks. I don't know why ducks either.The idea is THERE, again, but the ♥♥♥♥ poor ability of the cable to distinguish various sounds makes it harder to actually hit anything. And god help you with the chord games.The tuners.There are two tuners in the game: one when you calibrate your gutiar between songs (eg. one that is regular E and one that is dropdown D) and the tuner in the options. The calibrating tuner is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Sure, you can't expect your guitar to be precisely calibrated every time because tension physics is a thing. I would suggest using the tuner in the options more than the calibration tuner. It's more accurate.More songs than technique.The game has a lot of songs. Like fifty that come with the installation and an option to download more, assuming you're willing to shell out a few bucks. They're not too expensive, though I must say that I haven't tried to purchase any yet. Not sure how THAT bit would work.My guess here is that Ubisoft is going for the idea that if you learn a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of songs, you'll be able to rearrange the chords into your own style. Kinda having this whole thing as a secret, GIGANTIC tutorial.The good:The game does try to encourage you using recordings of a ""hip"" guy, presumably in his thirties who may or may not have played in a band in college and now his life is in shambles as he tries to recreate his glory days.He somehow sounds both happy and depressed at the same time. Not sure how, but he also has this ""punch me in the face RIGHT NOW"" voice.There is, in fact, an amount of basic explanation of how to perform various techniques needed for songs. Sure, there's no explanation of how to practice them, but at least you're getting information on what you can do with your guitar. Before I encountered Rocksmith, I thought you just hold strings and flail like a maniac.The basic pack is actually good!In many games with a ton of DLC, such as Rocksmith, the basic pack is there to provide you with a reasonable experience, ending up with you yearning for more. Usually, the DLC is stuff you wouldn't even ponder. Here, the situation is quite the opposite: You get quite a versatile list of free songs to choose from, and if you want to search for a song that you desparately want to learn and it's not in the free pack, it's probably in the DLC somewhere.There's a ♥♥♥♥ton of DLCContinuing my previous point, there is indeed at least one metric ♥♥♥♥ton of DLC. Assuming you don't get bored and/or die of natural causes as you attempt to bring all of the free songs to 100%... level...? rating...? You have quite a lot of DLC to choose from. So far, it's only extra songs to play, meaning, no equivalent's of Skyrim's golden horse armor plating. The DLC in Rocksmith is actually USEFUL!ConclusionIs this game fun? It depends on the personality. I personally tend to get obsessed with a game and the drop it for a year. As I'm writing this, I'm trying to get my obsession back up.I do believe that if you give it quite some time, you will master the guitar much faster than youtube classes.You may also end up in ER with insane calluses, bleeding fingers and possibly, bone fractures on your fingers and wrists, but at least you'll enjoy getting these injuries.

												I can't recommend this game enough!  I've owned guitars for a long time, but never really stuck to practicing.  Most of the time before playing Rocksmith 2014, I would just fiddle around with making melodies and wanting to figure out how to make chords go along with the melodies I was creating.  I didn't get very far with Guitar.When Rocksmith (original) came out I was excited to pick it up and give it a shot, but had many issues with the game:  Input Lag, Audio feedback, and just wasn't really into the method.Then comes Rocksmith 2014!  So far I've put about 45 hours into 2014, and I'm still having a blast.  All of the issues I experienced on Win32/x360 versions of Rocksmith 1 have been resolved.  And now there is a recommendation system that suggests things for you to do.Rather than level up like in the first game, you focus on mastery of each song.  Once you have mastered a section of the song, the notes will fade out, and force you to memorize the patterns. (brilliant! and optional if you dislike it)I have yet to play Bass with this, but from what I can glean about being able to play Lead Guitar or Rythm Guitar, I expect it will be just as fun to play.  (I will probably pick up a bass soon; but there is a bass emulation mode as well for guitar)I have a deep musical background, and the only thing I find lacking is that it's all focused on Rock.  (But it is Rocksmith after all!)  I wish it had some classical guitar tunes that can be very technically hard, so I could focus more on picking and more difficult techniques.  But overall this is a great start, and I'm excited to see where this takes me after another 40 hours of play (or practice)			"

												I am very happy with Rocksmith 2014 as a learning aid and that it feels like that became far more of a focus when compared to the original Rocksmith. Though it's a matter of taste, I also find the tracklist of the 2014 version far superior and varied. I use it with bass only and feel that it caters to it just as well as regular guitar and I'm glad it takes into consideration that I play a left handed instrument.I produced a short first impressions video with more details and opinions on the game that you can check out here:

												Awesome! I'm learning a lot on how to play a guitar as lead guitarist. I managed to pull off my first riff which is amazing all under an hour. They expect you to do at least 1 hour a day which I believe for 30 or 90 days and they say you'll know how to play guitar! You learn the positions of the frets and strings, it will all become second nature and playing guitar is so smooth. This is definitely much better than guitar hero\rockband! You're having fun and actually learning!			"

												First off, I'd just like to say the big annoyance of this game. It is that every guitar and bass I own apparently has a really low volume. Every time the tuning screen comes up it says it. These are not low quality instruments. Apparently my massively loud Rickenbacker 4003 is too quiet! I don't not what guitars and basses they were testing with but seriously? So with that out the way I think I can talk about the rest of the game. It's fun! Though I'd question it's worth as a teaching tool. I picked this game up with 7 years bass experience, so I haven't really used it as a teaching tool. I got it because I'm a big fan of guitar hero and thought it'd be cool if I could learn some songs on the way. Unfortunatly, many years of playing Guitar Hero have made me quite good a sight reading this game. Every time I learn a song in the game to 100% or near mastery, I can't remember a single note when I come away. This isn't so much of a problem with the game as a problem if you've played a lot of Guitar Hero that I thought you might want to be aware of.This game has made me less prone to looking at the neck of my bass though. I didn't actually realise how much I did it until I started playing Rocksmith. It has taught me to only look down for the big jumps, which is cool. So it's not without it's uses if you're experienced.The big thing I wanted to get out of this game apart from another cool rhythm game, is a few new songs to learn that I otherwise may not have thought to. It has done a great job of that. I've learned Radiohead, Stone Temple Pilots, Dead Weather. It's all good stuff. Plus there are an enormous amount of custom songs available for download. They're easy to install and they're all actually of pretty good quality that I've tried. Not like they were in Guitar Hero 3. So check this out if you want to learn some songs. Though I haven't seen anything that explains any music theory to you, which you really need if you're starting out. So maybe only get it if you already have a pretty good idea what you're doing.

Now all those things are still true, however I have a blast trying to melt faces with my axe.

												As someone who can legitimately play the guitar to a ""mediocre"" level, I probably wouldn't recommend this game as a tool to learn.Let's get this straight. If you don't play guitar, and you ask me if I can play guitar, my answer is ""hells yeah"". If you do play guitar and you ask me, my answer is ""I own two but I don't play them as much as I like"". Reality is I'm OK, but everyone else is probably better than me. I know all the chords, but I don't really know any full songs. I know a few riffs, and I know parts of some songs.This game basically lets you choose a song, and play it over and over again. To start with you have ""not many"" notes to play, it adds them in over time and adapts if you fail by taking notes away next time. It has a few features that let you slow down and increase the difficulty manually, but to be honest I didn't feel like this taught me much.Basically this game is a slightly more educational Guitar Hero. It lets you listen to some banging tunes while feeling like you're achieving something that will matter in real life. To some extent I guess it probably helps with dexterity and the basics of finding notes on the fretboard faster and hitting some chords/power chords.It does however have a really cool ""jam"" mode, where you can play like you're plugged into an amp and have AI play along with you. I probably used this more than the game itself.Don't get me wrong I would recommend the hell out of this game, but it really isn't much more than a ""game"". It's not going to teach you guitar better than online tutorial videos or a tutor. You'd be better of with those.			"

												Since I used to love playing Guitar Hero, I thought it would be awesome to play a game like it while learning how to play the guitar. I like most of the variety of songs on Rocksmith and even if you don't like many, you always have the option to buy more. I believe that this game can be a lot of fun once you begin to get the hang of moving your finger up and down the fret board. After you play the game for a while you begin to realize that the game is a bit repetitive. I wouldn't recommend this being your only source of learning the guitar since it only teaches you the basics of playing the guitar. Though, I do love this game and I feel like I can play a little bit of the guitar now even though I haven't played it that much.			"

												Wow! It is everything it promises to be. I've tried learning guitar in the past, but got discouraged by the difficulty curve and the tedium of practicing. This software makes all of it enjoyable! From the beginning you're playing along with great songs. The notes are presented on a Guitar Hero-like note highway and the dynamically adjusting difficulty adds or removes notes depending on how well you're doing. Naturally, you can scale the difficulty and speed to your level, either in sections or for the whole song. Each song has its preset guitar sounds -- modeled after the original song -- but the software allows you to customize the sound of your guitar by setting up virtual amplifiers and pedals. You can have jam sessions with a vitual band. The lessons seem to cover pretty much everything you need to know and are well presented. The mini-games for practicing guitar techniques are all fun, excpet for Gone Whaling (which is about controlling the volume of your playing).I first got a cheap guitar just to see if I can remain motivated using this software and after a month -- averaging a bit over an hour a day playing -- upgraded to a much better guitar. I'm also buying a bunch of the DLC songs. Do remember that it takes a lot of time and effort to learn to play an instrument. Maybe this software speeds up the process somewhat, but it most definitely makes it fun!			"

												Amazing game for learning to play guitar if you don't feel like taking lessons. For the best experience do combine this game with actual lessons so you don't teach yourself bad habits/techniques. This game made me learn to play guitar from scratch. I'm still somewhat a beginner but that's because of the little amount of time I put into improving my guitarplay. Getting good with an instrument that requires precision takes much more time than your avarage videogame. Keep in mind that you'll have to buy a rocksmith realtone cable to play this game. It really sucks to buy one individually so I recommend you buy the game+cable edition online (not on steam). Great game, minimal lag (still noticable though, but waaaaaaaaaay better than rocksmith 1), buy it if you don't want to end up in your fifties thinking ""I should have learned to play the guitar""			"

												This game will teach you how to play guitar. Should you also look up lessons online and watch videos on YouTube? Absolutely, but honestly this game is one of the most amazing purchases in regards to learning I've ever made, and I already sort of knew how to play in the first place. The game will adapt to how accurate you play, but if its still too hard or fast there is a built in system that will let you change the speed or difficulty. There are also tons of fun minigames to help you practice getting used to watching notes fly at you quickly, so don't be afraid of that. There is a reason this is my favorite steam game, learning music and playing a video game at the same time is one of the most amazing things I could think of. The only thing that I don't like about this game is that they took out a couple features from the original that I enjoyed, which was the ability to select different guitars and have their tones digitalized. However, they more than made up for it with the crazy in-depth amp customization and super cool session mode that can quickly teach you an entire scale and how to jam with it. Overall I'd say this game deserves a 9.5/10, and I am seriously in need of a Rocksmith 2017 or whatever the next one will be called.			"

												Alright, after 600 hours of play time I think that it's time I endorse this program.  I love this.  It is the epitomy of an ideal ""game-ification"" of an often times tedious chore of practicing an instrument.  With that said, this isn't a product for everyone.  If you are looking for the fun silly party game that was Rock Band or Guitar hero you will be seriously dissappointed.  On the other hand, if you sat down and mastered expert mode and played guitar hero for countless hours on your own so that you could say you beat Reverend Horton Heat's song with 5 stars then you will find Rocksmith to be an utter joy.  What Rocksmith is: The perfect practice tool.  Guitarists of all skill levels will find satisfaction in either the freestyle session mode where you can have a band back you up while you jam, learning to master lynard skynard's grueling runs or expanding your skill set in the guitarcade.  The DLC offers an genuinely insane amount of songs and there is enough there to sample virtually all styles of rock. What Rocksmith isn't: Something that anyone can pick up and enjoy in 10 minutes.  The guitar interface isn't entirely intuitive and just like learning to read music and tabs you have to learn how to read the guitar promts as well.  It works wonderfully, but honestly there is a pretty substantial learning curve.  It also isn't really something that you are going to enjoy with many other people.  If you shell out and get a second cord then you and a buddy can play, but still this is generally a solitary experience.  There is no online mode.So you think you're in? Buy the game and pick up the cord from amazon. Good luck and have fun.			"

												I've been using Rocksmith since the first version came out for the PC. This is definitely the best way to build your ""chops"" without paying for weekly guitar lessons. The ONLY negative I can think of regarding Rocksmith is that it doesn't teach anything about musical notation or reading sheet music, but how many rock musicians do you see on stage with a music stand and sheet music? :D			"

When I picked up this game I definetly had my doubts, but after 10-15 hours I started to notice significant improvements in my playing and I also start to pick up new songs faster and easier.

												If you really want to learn how to play the guitar and have fun doing it, this is the game to buy. This is the best do it yourself guitar learning application I have ever come across. There are lessons that teach you the mechanics and then there are little games that help you do the much needed drills to become a better guitar player. In addition, you get to learn to play songs by the original artists. No cover bands are playing with you, you are playing with the real artists.  I can't recommend this game more for anyone that is interested in learning how to play the guitar.			"

												After a lifelong career as an air guitarist, and several instances of complete failure trying to teach myself guitar, I decided to try Rocksmith.  A couple of years later I'm actually a passable guitar player.What the game will not do:It won't make you Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Guthrie Govan, or guitar hero x.It won't hold your hand or answer every minor question you have when you first start playing.It won't teach you all the theory behind the songs you're playing.What the game will do:It will teach you enough theory to get by (via some pretty generic lessons and mini games).It will introduce you to improvisation (session mode).It will probably introduce you to some pretty cool music you haven't heard before.Possibly trigger a mid-life crisis.Probably turn you into a guitar gear junky.But most importantly it will get you past those first HUGE humps to learning guitar - building callouses, finger dexterity, and getting in some effective practice.  The biggest roadblock for me on my previous attempts to learn was wondering WTF to play when I did sit down to practice.  This game helped me personally with that a lot since you can just flip on a great song and play along without turning the pages in some book or trying to decipher a tab.  The dynamic difficulty has some quirks no doubt, but in the end you can always manually adjust what level you want the song at (for those wondering how to do this, just put the whole song in riff repeater).  So even beginners can fire up Satch Boogie and just put it on the lowest difficulty and play along (admittedly even on lowest difficulty this one could be tough for beginners).    In the end, I would call this an extremely effective introduction for brand new guitar players, and a very good practice tool for beginners and intermediate players.  If you can't get into playing using this software, then playing guitar may not be for you.			"

												Wow! It is everything it promises to be. I've tried learning guitar in the past, but got discouraged by the difficulty curve and the tedium of practicing. This software makes all of it enjoyable! From the beginning you're playing along with great songs. The notes are presented on a Guitar Hero-like note highway and the dynamically adjusting difficulty adds or removes notes depending on how well you're doing. Naturally, you can scale the difficulty and speed to your level, either in sections or for the whole song. Each song has its preset guitar sounds -- modeled after the original song -- but the software allows you to customize the sound of your guitar by setting up virtual amplifiers and pedals. You can have jam sessions with a vitual band. The lessons seem to cover pretty much everything you need to know and are well presented. The mini-games for practicing guitar techniques are all fun, excpet for Gone Whaling (which is about controlling the volume of your playing).I first got a cheap guitar just to see if I can remain motivated using this software and after a month -- averaging a bit over an hour a day playing -- upgraded to a much better guitar. I'm also buying a bunch of the DLC songs. Do remember that it takes a lot of time and effort to learn to play an instrument. Maybe this software speeds up the process somewhat, but it most definitely makes it fun!			"

												Rocksmith is an amazing tool for learning guitar.  I started teaching myself (incorrectly) about ten years ago.  Before Rocksmith I could play a few dozen songs, but certainly not with what I would call skill or technique.  Nor did I have a proper understanding of the instrument, and thus could never just jam freely.This innovative program teaches players the RIGHT way, even those who have never touched a guitar.  Rocksmith includes lessons for beginners and seasoned players alike with many guitar-related topic covered from tuning and learning your first notes to power chords and solos.  Learning scales and technique is also made incredibly easy and fun through a number of mini games using the guitar as a controller.Then comes the best part: learning songs.  This is where Rocksmith is truly amazing.  In the beginning songs start very simplistic, allowing players to learn finger placement and tempo.  At first, difficult techniques and even chords are omitted so players can learn individual notes and strings.  If the player struggles, the song will remain undifficult.  As the player improves consistantly, the program increases the difficulty, slowly adding techniques such as chords, slides, bends, solos, and much more.  If the player struggles again, Rocksmith responds by intuitively lowering the difficulty.  Advanced players can indicate their skill level and bypass this process.  At any time, players can pause a song and practice difficult sections.  In addition, with each song, the program will make suggestions about lessons to revisit or sections to practice for improvement.  The base game's song bank includes plenty of excellent tunes to keep players busy with many hours of shredding.  When those are mastered, the DLC library grows constantly and includes a plethora of amazing music, both iconic and lesser known.  Please don't let the fact that Rocksmith was developed by Ubisoft turn you away.  The program is well polished, easy to use, and extremely responsive.  I cannot speak for others, but I have yet to encounter any type of bug or crash.  Please be aware you will need to purchase the Real Tone cable to play, and of course have an electric guitar or bass.If you are interested in learning guitar, or know anyone who is, Rocksmith is the perfect personal tutor.  And with it, you will learn a skill that will provide far more satisfaction than all the games on Steam.  Also the ladies love a guitarist.  Just saying.			"

												I was originally a bit skeptical but as the first game has been interesitng at the very least I decided to give this one a shot.I have to say, it puts the first game to shame. I had expected them to either focus on improving the ""game"" part or simply make the game more of a digital guitar tutor; which was the primary issue with the first game as it failed to really properly do either. Instead, Rocksmith 2014 does both, and brilliantly at that.As a guitar tutor it eases you in if you are new (as it asks your skill level at the beginning) and is, unlike a human tutor, infinitely patient. As I had previous experience (including the first Rocksmith) I was able to jump right in. The lessons are much more fleshed out; with several of the techniques having several lessons and practice tracks to play to really learn the skill. Most importantly, the Learn a Song section of the game is not only accessable, lets you choose what song you want to play and learn and do it. On top of this they made the Riff Repeater simply part of the Learn a Song, so if you want to go back and retry a part you missed you can do so. Slow it down, make it easier or max it out. You can do it at your pace and really learn what you want. You can even make it mark notes you missed so on th next pass you can be on the look out for them.On the other side of the coin is the game mechanics. The first rocksmith tried to instill game mechanics through a kind of ""path"" but really all it did was restrain gameplay. Instead you have free access to every song and guitarcade game from the first moment you start the game. Not only this but they have added a ""Score Attack"" mode which approximates one of its plastic guitar forebears, but with the real thing. The guitarcade games have gotten a massive facelift as well. Most of the games in the guitarcade are not only solid but assist in developing key skills; and most of them are references to old school games (I was particularly impressed with the ""Rad Racer"" reference game Scale Racer.)  One thing I don't feel goes in game or tutor sides of the fence is the Session mode. Essentially it can be thought of as a virtual band that will jam with you. They don't follow any particular song, and neither do you. You play what you want and they will join in as their AI decided to. You choose whatever instruments you want in your band, how fast, in what scale and go. The game teaches you how to play wiht the digital band (and even how to use this with a real band) and lets you have fun playing whatever you want.It is really interesting in that you spend some time with an AI band and you can adjust your sound to match the band; or just rebuild the band, or tweak it. Granted this doesn't allow you to write songs for the band to play; but instead it is what it says, a jam session. You play what you want and the band does too, they tend to be swayed based on what you are playing but you can even take more of a back role. Turn up the volume on one of the AI members and let them do their thing.Admittedly there are some faults with the game. Firstly and most importantly, a lot of the best and most popular songs are DLC. I understand that the base game is trying to pick and choose a wide selection, but when you put the B or C lister songs from an artist in the game then put out A list songs as DLC it does feel a bit wrong. Granted you can knock this up to the song licensing company having higher costs for popular songs, but it is irritating nontheless. Another thing is that occasonally the fact that the game doesn't catch a note due to the simply the game not catching a note will happen. Occasionally you will play somehting right and the game misses it. While I don't expect the technology to be 100% perfect, it does get irritating, and is especially common on palm muted notes. Overall for the price? This game is amazing. You get a guitar tutor that is infinitely patient, willing to repeat lesson after lesson and tell you when you do things wrong. You get a long list of songs to learn, even longer if you are willing to shell out a few bucks. You get a fully fledged rythym game where you can try to go for high scores. You get a slew of practice minigames that all focus on pumping up your techniques. You get an AI Band that will play along side you.And most importantly of all, you get motivation that may not have been there before. One thing any musician will tell you is that you have to want to get better to get better; and Rocksmith 2014 provides so many reasons to practice just a bit longer that you would have to try hard *not* to get better at guitar from playing it.

												I've been playing guitar for about 9, maybe 10 years now and the biggest problem I've had is finding motivation to practise and learning tricky songs. Rocksmith manages to get rid of both problems for me. I've not had this much fun playing guitar since I started, it's 'note progression' system makes learning difficult or tricky songs incredibly easy and it progresses at your level, and even if you can't keep up you can simply pull it back a few stages to a level you can keep up with. It's helped me to learn songs I've loved for a very long time and failed to learn such as Electric Eye by Judas Priest (DLC song), Fear of the Dark by Iron Maiden (DLC song), Knights of Cydonia by Muse and Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard. It also gives you the option to learn the bass, lead or rhythm sections of each song allowing you to choose what you want to focus more on per song.To sum up, whether you're new to playing guitar, or you've been playing for years or even if you're looking for your first lesson, Rocksmith can definitely help you out, and I'd reccomend this to anyone with an interest in playing guitar.

												OK, been playing this for a week a now, and I have forgot my wife's name.I think she still lives here, but If not, it's alright, cause Rocksmith is so frikin' awesome, It's all I need.Had to figure out, and alter latency and calibration to optimise the guitar recognition quality, but it's super sweet now.I went straight in for hardest difficulty setting, and found it to be accurate, and more difficult after 6 bottles of beer.Easy is mega boring, but for a beginner, it is nice. Medium difficulty is alright, but if your a seasoned guitar player, challenge yourself at hardest level. I found the cable for £25.00 which is very reasonable. Just look on the famous rainforest shopping site. TIP: It says to calibrate with volume knob turned right up. Some pickups may be a little hot, so in there case, back off the dial a little. Trial and Error. Cant wait for my finger tips to heal, so I can get back on it.			"

												This game is pretty cool.Pros: Interactive, uses real instruments, multiplayer, decent song list, ""local co-op"", lots of different modes and activities to check out, walks you through all the basics, automatic difficulty adjustments as you get better.Cons: The UI feels like it was designed for a console - e.g. can't search for songs with keyboard (by typing name), can't use the mouse to select the riffs to repeat (stupid keyboard layout for controlling this), game with latest patch is slightly buggy - crashing, locking up occasionally, audio output levels a bit strange (we noticed this on the latest PS3 version too).Other: Would be nice to support the Steam workshop for custom songs. Some of the song packs seem to be missing some of the ""defining"" ballads, missing other classics like The Verve, Pink Floyd etc, Japanese anime punk rock could be very fun.			"

												I loved guitar hero back in its heyday, but found it too simplistic after going through a few games. That's when I decided to pick up the real guitar, but frankly it was a little difficult to commit in the long run because it was sometimes hard to find tabs, know what to play, and it didn't always sound great alone. It's been 3 years since I've touched my electric guitar so I decided that if I didn't get rocksmith, I'd never pick it up again. It was a great decision; for me the gameplay is about as much fun as GH but with practical experience, higher potential for difficulty, and it teaches very quickly. I can't wait to see how far it takes me. The biggest downside I foresee is the pricey $3 per song in the dlc, though the game has a good number of songs.			"

												Rocksmith is an amazing tool for learning guitar.  I started teaching myself (incorrectly) about ten years ago.  Before Rocksmith I could play a few dozen songs, but certainly not with what I would call skill or technique.  Nor did I have a proper understanding of the instrument, and thus could never just jam freely.This innovative program teaches players the RIGHT way, even those who have never touched a guitar.  Rocksmith includes lessons for beginners and seasoned players alike with many guitar-related topic covered from tuning and learning your first notes to power chords and solos.  Learning scales and technique is also made incredibly easy and fun through a number of mini games using the guitar as a controller.Then comes the best part: learning songs.  This is where Rocksmith is truly amazing.  In the beginning songs start very simplistic, allowing players to learn finger placement and tempo.  At first, difficult techniques and even chords are omitted so players can learn individual notes and strings.  If the player struggles, the song will remain undifficult.  As the player improves consistantly, the program increases the difficulty, slowly adding techniques such as chords, slides, bends, solos, and much more.  If the player struggles again, Rocksmith responds by intuitively lowering the difficulty.  Advanced players can indicate their skill level and bypass this process.  At any time, players can pause a song and practice difficult sections.  In addition, with each song, the program will make suggestions about lessons to revisit or sections to practice for improvement.  The base game's song bank includes plenty of excellent tunes to keep players busy with many hours of shredding.  When those are mastered, the DLC library grows constantly and includes a plethora of amazing music, both iconic and lesser known.  Please don't let the fact that Rocksmith was developed by Ubisoft turn you away.  The program is well polished, easy to use, and extremely responsive.  I cannot speak for others, but I have yet to encounter any type of bug or crash.  Please be aware you will need to purchase the Real Tone cable to play, and of course have an electric guitar or bass.If you are interested in learning guitar, or know anyone who is, Rocksmith is the perfect personal tutor.  And with it, you will learn a skill that will provide far more satisfaction than all the games on Steam.  Also the ladies love a guitarist.  Just saying.			"

												I've wanted to learn bass for what seems like forever; yet, like many others, I've made one excuse after another why I should not get one. Well, I finally got my bass (Fender Squier Precision Bass starter kit, btw) and was checking prices in my area for private lessons. Would you believe I was quoted as much as $300 per month?! That's outrageous! Then, my friend told me about Rocksmith(R), so I checked it out.     The first thing I looked at, of course, was the price. It was only $39.99 and I had to buy a special cable to plug my guitar into my PC (any guitar with a 1/4"" jack input will work). The Real Tone cable from Ubisoft was only another thirty bucks. Here's the math: A total fee of $70.00 vs. $300 each and every month. Okay, so far, I'm thinking, ""this is a no-brainer, but just how good is this software, really?""     Unlike your typical CD/DVD lessons that come with books and such, Rocksmith(R) is completely interactive, covering many necessary technical skills and even provides real feedback when notes are not played correctly, In addition, it includes several fun, arcade-style mini-games to reinforce the skills you just learned in the technical lessons, so you can start playing like a pro in no time!     Well, that's my review. I hope you found it helpful. I've told you how Rocksmith(R) is both incredibly affordable and amazingly innovative. Are you still wondering if it's the right time for you? Believe me, there is no better time than now. Come on, grab your axe! Your friends are waiting to jam with you!  \m/			"

												If I had a doller for every note this game couldn't detect... I'd have a lot of dollars...Seriously, though, if you want to learn guitar but don't know where to start, start with this game. It's got a lot of really good songs, technique lessons and various other cool things that make it fun even after playing 1000+ hours of it. The note detection may be a bit wonkey at times, but it functions like it should for the most part and even when it doesn't, it's normally missing really small detailed bits of a song. Also, the DLC list is really intimidating, but there are a lot of great songs in the base game including some new ones that are included with the Remastered edition. It may seem a bit pricey, and it is, but chances are, you'll get a hell of a lot out of this game if you get into guitar as much as I did.			"

												I obtained this game on Christmas, and I can truly say that it has helped me learn guitar a lot more than i could ever imagine. I already have around 25-30% mastery score on most songs. This game is extremely fun, and i very much recommend this game. I dont feel like i'm struggling and slowly learning, it just feels like im having fun playing guitar. Even though I am absolutely HORRENDOUS at guitar, I somehow still feel awesome while trying to play. XD although i sometimes get frustrated at trying to play songs, its still incredibly fun.The only problem i have with this game is... the DLC. oh man, the DLC song prices... For some song packs with 3-5 songs, they charge 7-10$ for it. And for specific single songs that you know and love and would like to play, They cost 3$ to buy. In my opinion, this is a bit pricy. Around $1 or maybe $1.50 would be sufficient. For some people, this may not be a problem, but for me it is.Pros:Good Song ListGood TutorialsNice, non-confusing Note TrackTeaches how to play guitar fast (at least for me)Incredibly easy to set up (need Real Tone Cable)Anything else that i cant think ofCons:DLC PricesCouldnt (yet) figure out how to get CDLC (customs)P.S yeah i know i have to get Cherub Rock, did that, and the customs appear in game, but they wont run8.5/10			"

												I highly recommend this game if you just want something the jam to every once and while, tighten your guitar skills, or possibly learn how to play in general. I used to play guitar in a couple different bands about a decade or so ago, even traveled the west coast playing shows and opening for some decent acts... then I went to film school, left the music behind me (fun while at lasted, lead to a lot of firsts in my life :) but never managed to sell all my old gear. I've hung onto a couple of amps, guitars with various sentimental values and rarity in the market place through several moves, but in all honestly only jamed on them a handful of times, and usually just playing the old stuff form muscle memory. Rocksmith is perfect for me with a variety of progressive difficulties, and challenges to learn new material and get outside my comfort zone. Been working too hard to play recently, but since I bought the game I've plugged in more in the last couple of months then I have in the last several years! The Mavericks bug did suck though, dragging down my ability to use the software for several weeks, took them the better part of a month the fix... guess that's what I get for jumping into a new os that hasn't been properly tested.

												I have written this on day 3 of my 60 day challenge.  The fingers on my left hurt and you can even see the marks now.  But, this is so much fun.  I am amazed that my terrible playing sounds like a member of the band of whatever song I am playing.  I am 50 years of age, and playing an electric guitar has always been on my bucket list.  Here it is, my best chance of crossing one thing off the list.  There are lots of challenges within the software, and it learns from you very quickly to the point of being too challenging.  Just stop things and wind down the speed or accuracy and away you go.I bought a guitar, amp and stuff in a pack from an E-Bay retailer and then Rocksmith 2014.  So far so good, and the fun continues.			"

												Rocksmith is a great game and tool for beginers at guitar. I had some basic knowledge before hand, but no real skills. After playing this game, my skills have increased greatly. For the beginer who doesn't want to to shell out the money for lessons or have the time for them, this game is a great substitue. However, this game does not ""teach"" you that much. I honestly haven't learned much from this game that I didn't already know. The game has lessons which teach basic techniques and chords, but thats really it on the teaching. This is more of a very fun way to practice than an actual teaching game. While this game may not be for the more experienced player, I do highly reccomend this game for beginers who are looking to improve their guitar skills without the cost of lessons. The game is very fun and very effective.			"

There is a huge community out there where people have developed thousands of songs (check customsforge) to play. I think having that community has made the game even more fun, given I can play artist I like, along with the 50 or so songs that came with the game.

												I picked up this game rather cheap on the humble store, so even though I dont have many hours logged on this PC version, I have had the PS3 version since last year.This game has honestly made me a better guitar player and is a hell of a lot of fun. If you have any interest at all in picking up a guitar it teaches you right from the basics like how to hold the pick, how to put the strap on properly, etc.It is SO much more than just 'guitar hero except with an actual guitar' this is more than just a game, you can learn some serious skills using this and eventually surprise yourself. The only thing about this game is not only do you need to buy the game, but you also need the RealTone cable and a guitar(guitar isnt very hard to come by, goto a pawn shop, there is a LOT of great guitars there in need of a home).The only thing I wish this game had that the original Rocksmith had, is the ability to record yourself playing(some of us wanna be vain and see how badly, or amazing we sound when not in the moment of pulling off all this stuff). Other than that this game has everything I could ever ask for.All in all, this game is seriously addictive, and the dynamic difficulty was the song progresses means you can dictate how hard the song is to play, hell it was such a good game I bought it twice so you know it has to be good!10/10			"

												Initially this was alright, but the lag is really bad for playing. I can't stand it. Makes playing tricky fast sections really hard. Also its soo strict with actually playing chords. If you miss a note in a chord (or even play it a little too quiet) - it decides you havn't played it properly, even when it sounded perfectly fine (to my ears). Yet other times i would blatantly make a mistake which sounded terrible and it didn't catch it. It became hard to tell if i actually made a mistake, or the game was flagging false positives. I stopped playing after a while becuase of this.Several months later i was bored one day and decided to checkout session mode and worked through a few more missions. Then i fully comprehended what you can do in session mode. Its the perfect practice tool, i started doing my scales and playing along with the band. Now I just jump in session mode and jam for a while, practicing new and old techniques. As there's no critical timing in session mode, the lag isn't so much of an issue. I am enjoying it way more now.Overall i would recommend this game becuase of session mode. Once you had a bit of fun with score attack and learning a few songs, start using session mode and work through the missions.Note: I would consider myself an intermediate guitar player at the time i bought RS2014			"

												Great way to learn guitar!  I already knew how to play rhythm guitar pretty well just by learning from tablatures over the years, but I was never good at scales or soloing.  This game has increased my dexterity quite a lot and CDLC is an awesome way to learn songs that aren't already official DLC or aren't likely to become official DLC (I listen to a lot of indie music).If you ever played Guitar Hero, it's definitely much harder but it's also that much more rewarding because you are actually learning to play the song for real.If you have always wanted to learn guitar and just could never motivate yourself to actually learn, buy this game!  It is THE best tool for learning and is adjustable to EVERY skill level, even someone like me who knows their way around a guitar but still is lacking in certain areas.			"

												I've wanted to learn bass for what seems like forever; yet, like many others, I've made one excuse after another why I should not get one. Well, I finally got my bass (Fender Squier Precision Bass starter kit, btw) and was checking prices in my area for private lessons. Would you believe I was quoted as much as $300 per month?! That's outrageous! Then, my friend told me about Rocksmith(R), so I checked it out.     The first thing I looked at, of course, was the price. It was only $39.99 and I had to buy a special cable to plug my guitar into my PC (any guitar with a 1/4"" jack input will work). The Real Tone cable from Ubisoft was only another thirty bucks. Here's the math: A total fee of $70.00 vs. $300 each and every month. Okay, so far, I'm thinking, ""this is a no-brainer, but just how good is this software, really?""     Unlike your typical CD/DVD lessons that come with books and such, Rocksmith(R) is completely interactive, covering many necessary technical skills and even provides real feedback when notes are not played correctly, In addition, it includes several fun, arcade-style mini-games to reinforce the skills you just learned in the technical lessons, so you can start playing like a pro in no time!     Well, that's my review. I hope you found it helpful. I've told you how Rocksmith(R) is both incredibly affordable and amazingly innovative. Are you still wondering if it's the right time for you? Believe me, there is no better time than now. Come on, grab your axe! Your friends are waiting to jam with you!  \m/			"

												If I had a doller for every note this game couldn't detect... I'd have a lot of dollars...Seriously, though, if you want to learn guitar but don't know where to start, start with this game. It's got a lot of really good songs, technique lessons and various other cool things that make it fun even after playing 1000+ hours of it. The note detection may be a bit wonkey at times, but it functions like it should for the most part and even when it doesn't, it's normally missing really small detailed bits of a song. Also, the DLC list is really intimidating, but there are a lot of great songs in the base game including some new ones that are included with the Remastered edition. It may seem a bit pricey, and it is, but chances are, you'll get a hell of a lot out of this game if you get into guitar as much as I did.			"

There are lessons that teach you the mechanics and then there are little games that help you do the much needed drills to become a better guitar player.

												Amazing game for learning to play guitar if you don't feel like taking lessons. For the best experience do combine this game with actual lessons so you don't teach yourself bad habits/techniques. This game made me learn to play guitar from scratch. I'm still somewhat a beginner but that's because of the little amount of time I put into improving my guitarplay. Getting good with an instrument that requires precision takes much more time than your avarage videogame. Keep in mind that you'll have to buy a rocksmith realtone cable to play this game. It really sucks to buy one individually so I recommend you buy the game+cable edition online (not on steam). Great game, minimal lag (still noticable though, but waaaaaaaaaay better than rocksmith 1), buy it if you don't want to end up in your fifties thinking ""I should have learned to play the guitar""			"

												Alright, after 600 hours of play time I think that it's time I endorse this program.  I love this.  It is the epitomy of an ideal ""game-ification"" of an often times tedious chore of practicing an instrument.  With that said, this isn't a product for everyone.  If you are looking for the fun silly party game that was Rock Band or Guitar hero you will be seriously dissappointed.  On the other hand, if you sat down and mastered expert mode and played guitar hero for countless hours on your own so that you could say you beat Reverend Horton Heat's song with 5 stars then you will find Rocksmith to be an utter joy.  What Rocksmith is: The perfect practice tool.  Guitarists of all skill levels will find satisfaction in either the freestyle session mode where you can have a band back you up while you jam, learning to master lynard skynard's grueling runs or expanding your skill set in the guitarcade.  The DLC offers an genuinely insane amount of songs and there is enough there to sample virtually all styles of rock. What Rocksmith isn't: Something that anyone can pick up and enjoy in 10 minutes.  The guitar interface isn't entirely intuitive and just like learning to read music and tabs you have to learn how to read the guitar promts as well.  It works wonderfully, but honestly there is a pretty substantial learning curve.  It also isn't really something that you are going to enjoy with many other people.  If you shell out and get a second cord then you and a buddy can play, but still this is generally a solitary experience.  There is no online mode.So you think you're in? Buy the game and pick up the cord from amazon. Good luck and have fun.			"

												This game is a highly enjoyable highly effective way to learn guitar. The biggest comparison you probably hear is true. It's like Guitar Hero, with an actual guitar. I started playing guitar at the time I got the first Rocksmith. Within a week,  I already had improved in my skill. I highly recommend this game to any aspiring guitarist. This game tracks your progress, how well you play, and adapts the difficulty to your skill level so you are always being pushed to do better, without having to tackle challanges that you can't succed at. You'll improve in skill while learning to play your favorite songs.TL;DRPros:Never have to tackle a challange you can't beatImprove within short amounts of timeLearn to play your favorite songs along the wayA sense of acheivementCons:Pricey cable with reliability issues (so I've heard and mine hardly lasted a year)Game seems to have a hard time detecting bendsHave to pay to import songs from the first RocksmithMy final verdicts? 9/10, highly enjoyable, highly effective, worth while for anyone who loves guitar and music.

												This is a very fun way to learn to play the guitar. Both me and my 11-year-old daughter began playing this with no prior guitar playing experience. I've progressed considerably, but am still quite mediocre, as I haven't been able to play very much, nor am I particularly young. On the other hand, my daughter has become quite good in only a matter of a few months. Clearly, she had a hidden talent. Tomorrow she will be playing Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" for a talent show at her elementary school, without using Rocksmith.  Rocksmith is great at adjusting to weaker players like myself, only giving me a portion of the notes and filling in the rest.  If there is one fault, it's that Rocksmith doesn't teach the fundamentals or theory very well.  Adding better instruction to the next version would be one of the the best ways to improve it.			"

												Great way to learn guitar!  I already knew how to play rhythm guitar pretty well just by learning from tablatures over the years, but I was never good at scales or soloing.  This game has increased my dexterity quite a lot and CDLC is an awesome way to learn songs that aren't already official DLC or aren't likely to become official DLC (I listen to a lot of indie music).If you ever played Guitar Hero, it's definitely much harder but it's also that much more rewarding because you are actually learning to play the song for real.If you have always wanted to learn guitar and just could never motivate yourself to actually learn, buy this game!  It is THE best tool for learning and is adjustable to EVERY skill level, even someone like me who knows their way around a guitar but still is lacking in certain areas.			"

The tracks from the first game can be played in the second, except that they don't actually play the same in both games.  The arrangements are different, and some of the arragnements aren't even there anymore.  It's a good idea to get the first game, too, to be able to play it's DLC packs natively instead of through 2014, cause some of them were just plain better played through the old game.All in all, though, still  fabulous game and learning tool.

												I've been playing Rocksmith for 3 years now. I went into the game having given up on ever learning to play the guitar after failing miserably years before. When I saw Rocksmith for the first time I thought “Hey, I like Guitar Hero. And always thought it would be cool if you could play it with an actual guitar; might as well give it a try"". I was hooked from the start. The lessons made it easy for me to get the basics, and the wide selection of great songs made it hard for me to stop even when my fingers were so tired and sore I could hardly play. The biggest surprise for me was seeing how much improvement I made without really trying to. I seems like I just play around, not taking anything too seriously, and I just get better and better. After 3 years I've by no means master the guitar, but I can definitely play it, with or without Rocksmith.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is essentially an improved version of the earlier installment in the series, and I have to say that Ubisoft really nailed it with this one.The game provides a simple, good-looking and smooth experience for people to learn and play the guitar, regardless of skill level.With this game you can learn to play along to your favourite songs, practice your slides, harmonics, chords, play minigames in the Guitarcade, test yourself to reach higher and higher scores in the Score Attack mode and much much more.Being an intermediate guitar player that just picked up the electric, I have to admit that playing this game has been a blessing. Within the first five hours of playing I had already learnt more than I had after 3 years of lessons. The game is easy to use and gives you plenty of time learn the songs you love, allowing you to increase and decrease the difficulty and speed of specific segments with the Riff Repeater.The game starts off with a generous amount of songs for you to play, and allows you to purchase hundreds of other songs for a relatively cheap price with new DLC being brought out weekly. If there's a song that you want to play that isn't in the main game or any of the DLC, there's also a great chance that you can find and download a Custom DLC from any of the many community websites.The only bad things I can say is that the game might not recognize you playing some power chords if there's a lot of distortion going on, and that you have to go to a store and buy a Real Tone Cable before you can play.Buying this game is probably one of the best decisions I've made recently, and  if you are a beginner and want to improve your guitar playing skills, or if you're a master and just want to have som fun challenging yourself to clear Fury of the Storm with 100% accuracy. I suggest that you spend the around 50€ for the game and the cable, and go have some fun! ;)			"

												Around December of last year, I was looking for a good and solid method for learning guitar. I came across Rocksmith when I visited a friend. When trying it out on his PC, I got into the game immediately and it became very difficult to put my friend's guitar down. After that, I purchased the Rocksmith guitar bundle on Amazon and got it for Christmas. Rocksmith introduced me to guitar in an incredible way. The dynamic difficulty system started off with simple notes that gradually led to chords over time. As I got the hang of chords and techniques, I became better at more difficult phrases. Fairly soon, I found myself jamming constantly on the main menu. (Due to that, I purchased a Fender Mustang III to step it up a notch). The vast expanse of DLC kept me hooked with the game. I became exposed to more and more varieties of music, and I learned many different play styles. After getting over 300 hours up my sleeve, I have made it pretty damn far in playing guitar. Every cent I have spent on my new hobby has been worth it. You can say it has made a big difference for me in my spare time. I find myself lost in the music all the time and I don't mind it one bit. If you intend to get into guitar, buy this game. With dedication, you can achieve the skills to be good player. The only few cons that I can list with game are very minor ones.- I'm on my second Real Tone Cable (They don't last long, so handle them with great care)- Bugs on some occasions (My scenarioes are usually where the guitar audio will simply cut out and the audio feed will stop.) - Can't turn off Dynamic Difficulty once I reach a certain level. (I kinda wish that was an option once you get to that point)That's all I can really complain about. These problem won't hinder anyone since they are simple to resolve. All I can say to finish this review off is ""BUY THIS GAME!""			"

The dynamic dificulty helps you go from a beginer to an intermediate player within the space of playing in a month. It starts off with one note then levels you up accordingly to your skill level at the time. Riff repeater is a fantastic tool for helping you learn and nail that section you just can't get down, allowing you to change speed etc. With a ton of official DLC and forever expanding CDLC, you have a lot of songs to learn till your hearts content.

												Plug in your guitar, learn to play songs. Rocksmith is pretty straightforward on the face of it. But underneath the hood are the tools that players of all levels can use to improve their performance, from Guitarcade mini-games, which make speed and technique drills better and more rewarding; to the Riff Repeater, which can slow down a single section of a song so that you can get it down right. A vast amount of DLC for this game means you should be able to build a huge library of songs you enjoy playing, and the Session Band lets you put together a band that will automatically play along with you.It should be noted that a Rocksmith RealTone cable is required to play this game, and that costs extra, so if you want to save some money then you should buy Rocksmith on sale. But any guitarist who feels like guitar games are a good idea but that implementing that with a toy instrument is disingenuous should look no farther than Rocksmith 2014.			"

												This is an absolute must-buy for anyone currently owning an electric-capable guitar who wants to learn guitar or better their skills.It has tutorials from as basic as how to put on a strap, hold your guitar, how to strum/pick, etc to some hectic and challenging stages in the Guitarcade games that will challenge your skills in scales, picking, volume control, etc.Also, if you often find yourself wanting to play with your guitar, but not knowing what to play, this is also a really intricate tool for learning new songs to play, and a beautiful excuse to play on your guitar.Every guitarist who indulged in this game which I highly recommended unto them left with a copy and a big fat smile on their face (and sometimes a bleeding finger).Good progression throughout the game, and excellent all-in-all. Very evident that a lot of time and effort went into making this one.			"

												Overall I reccomend it, only two problems1: is the tabbing is not always the most efficient way to play, for example on Jimi Hendrix Little wing there's a double stop tabbed as fret 5 on the G string and fret 9 on the D string. That's ridiculous, in Eb those notes are B and Bb. You can just play fret 5 on the G string and the open B string. THe songs are full of annoying quirks like that. If you know the fretboard you can do the conversion but for learning, who the hell is revieweing these?2: The open note notation, they use a bar that takes 2 to 3 frets, when you're playing arpeggios in the lower frets (1 to 3) and lower strings (E, A, D)  combined with the other strings it gets REALLY crowded in the screen and it becomes really impossible to sight read.Everything else has been improving consistently and becoming better.

												Rocksmith 2014 has helped me in certain aspects. I now feel like I can play a game with tabs instead of staring at a blank book/screen. Pros: Fun, cool for learning, lesson packages, session MODE!, DLC, good interface.Disadvantages: - Not everything is taught through this package, which may make learning rigid.                          - Why not include the tabulature also if we're going to have to pay 3 dollars a song! This way we could observe the songs in their entirety too.                          - No recording feature? I mean it would be fun to jam, and record with session mode.                          - No free DLC sponsers?All in all, a fantastic emersive experience that I cannot complain about.Please make cables more bloody durable.

												This game (although more of an education tool than a game) takes the concept of gamification and successfully marries it with a hands-on guitar training program.It's like having a personal guitar teacher chained in your closet, that you can whip out whenever you feel like, for as long as you feel like. It doesn't matter if you have never touched an axe in your entire life. He will sit you down, teach you how to hold the guitar, hold the pick and he will hold your hand through the first note down to the last. He will sit through with you, as you fumble your way through lessons that you are honestly not ready to start and no matter how clumsy or oafish you are, hitting the wrong string or fret time and a time again, he. Will. Never. Lose. Patience.In one week I have learned more than I honestly believed I could ever learn with a guitar.If you want to learn to play as well and you don't get this game, then you are stupid for it.Get it!

												I wish this game existed when I was first learning music. It completely lowers the barrier to entry for a starting musician. Years ago, you'd get your first instrument and make absolutely horrible noises for months, eventually graduating to semi-tonal, repetitive boring folk tunes. After about 5 years of hard work, you might actually be able to play something resembling a modern popular song. If you were practicing alone, you could only hope to simply play along to a recording if you wanted to hear the rest of the band. Enter Rocksmith - now from the first note you play you sound awesome. The rest of the band is there, sounding awesome. Next time you play, you learn a little more. You still sound awesome. Do a couple of 5 minute lessons, learn how to sound more awesome. Not awesome enough? Put on some headphones.There are enough songs to cycle through that your roomates/parents/neighbors aren't going psychotic after two weeks of ""happy little teapot"" over and over and over again. Now, there's nothing to be done if they don't like Weezer, Aerosmith, The Allman Bros, Blue Oyster Cult and so on... but seriously, who wants neighbors who can't rock out?			"

												I own RS2012 for PS3 and for PC, the Bass expansion for PS3, RS2014 for PC, plus 20-25 songs. I think i may like the game. If you own a guitar and are between beginner to intermediate skill level. Pick this game up now at 75% off. I have only had 2 complaints since the first time i played. 1 ) get a tuner too, the 2012 one is to weak and the 2014 one is too sensitvie. 2) For the love of god bring out a pedal that functions like a controller or my keyboard. The most frusterating thing is having to reach for a controller or the keyboard EVERY SONG. Beyond those drawbacks if you can wrap the EADGBe colourcoding into your grasp you're home free to learn hundreds of songs and avoid learning 4 different incorrect versions that are in the wrong key from online tabs.

												This game is awesome for anyone just starting out on guitar, or wanting to improve his/her skills on the instrument. So many different songs really help diversify playing and style when playing guitar not in game. So many DLCs to choose from. Lessons that really push your skills forward and make it fun to do so. The tone designer is great for getting ANY kind of sound you want out of your guitar. No more tedious scales or the same boring tone from your amp. The mini-games allow you to level up your skills in bending, string skipping, shifting, tremelo, etc. The session mode has various instruments you can play along with and almost any scale to try out. The game thinks for you and customizes missions and recommended items to help you improve. The Riff Repeater allows you to slow a segment down and really practice those hard solos and riffs. I never get bored with this game, and will often practice for 6 hours in one go.			"

												So, I started rocksmith a few months back noticing the youtube '50 days' videos and I had played some acoustic before but never really got the hang of it. So I purchased my guitar , a squier classic vibe (really solid, great sound for beginners) and purchased the cable and the game. First of all i thought the cable was a little expensive for a simple ADC and later I noticed that there were some great alternatives, if you know nothing from adc cables just stick with the one from ubisoft though.The game is great for any level honestly, there is not much theory but instead you can watch some short videos explaining techniques and you try them out, which actually worked fantastic. Only downside for me is that sometimes the cable doesnt pick up the signal, which makes me lose my streak.There are not so many songs in the basic game, but every week, ubisoft brings out some new songs which you can purchase (for an ok price). Yet ubisoft doesn't let us download songs from the previous version of rocksmith  unless you buy the previous version, they claim it's an error of some sort, but after 5 months they haven't fixed it (yeah right).Anyway, great game, I enjoy spending my time on a game and still learn :)  "

												If you have an electric guitar, it will work. Works with my bass too. You can learn guitar totally, concentrate on lead or rythym or play a bass if you have one. It's also like a game guiding you. Alot like guitar hero but better and with a real guitar. I have it. I've been playing guitar since I was 6 on and off. Full-time since I was 27 and I'm now 43. I really like it. Fun. My fingers hurt or I'd be playing it right now. Can't have them bleeding since I also fly Phoenix 4 and Realflight 6.5 radio controlled flight simulators. (and the real thing there too..real trex 500 and blade 300x). Back to Rocksmith 2014 though...it works fine with my Fender bass and Fender guitar. Says it will work with every guitar. I haven't tried it with my 1967 Noble yet. Oh, I bought it with the cable retail for the same price as it is here. THIS GAME REQUIRES A CABLE. And I'd recommend buying TWO. I bought a second one since I have friends that play and we can play together in two player mode. So buy the game if you have a bass guitar or a regular guitar, but make sure they are electric guitars or basses and get two cables. Have fun! -Squiggy Wigginz owner of www.NakedCoed.Com "

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn to play guitar or bass, or also to anyone who already plays but wants a fun way to practice. The best way to advance your skill as a guitarist is to play constantly. Practice, practice, practice - With this game, you can practice all the fun licks while playing a game on Steam. What's not to like?There are a couple issues that I run into though with my guitar - it's an older Ibanez RG100, and the hardware isn't as good as it once was. I think with the lower quality/older pickups and instrument cable jack, my guitar sometimes has issues playing clear enough for the game to pick up. Often times when I try to play around the 9th-14th fret on the D string, it will tell me I miss the note when I know I'm hitting it. That's really my only issue, and it only occurs if you have an older guitar. Simple fix is to upgrade the hardware if you have the cash, or better yet: Buy a new guitar!When all is said and done, like I said at the beginning: If you want to play guitar, or if you want a fun way to practice then you should definitely buy this game. Hit songs, weekly dlc, and fun mini games really sell the game for me. I have this game on PS3 and PC both with a ton of hours between the two. It's easily worth $60.			"

												In roughly one year I've gone from hardly knowing which end of the guitar to use to actually being able to play some tunes both on my electric guitar and my acoustic one. It probably goes without saying, but Rocksmith 2014 is the best interactive guitar tutorial out there, and I imagine it's a good heap of fun for those who play it more often than myself as well.I have so many superlatives for this game, and I haven't really found any big cons at all. The gameplay modes are both varied and intuitive, and the song library is highly relevant and ever expanding. The tunes they make available lend from all genres, from blues through mainstream rock to metal, and I've found several of my absolute rock favourites among both the included songs and the DLC.If you're looking to get more out of your electric guitar there really is no way around Rocksmith 2014. Be sure to look out for the original Rocksmith as well, it's a cheap way to expand your song library with a decent amount of tunes.			"

												Overall it's a great way to have some fun playing with a guitar, even if you have no prior experiences.  You will want to look into CDLC or else you might get bored with the limited selection.Also, they don't really update these games aside from releasing more songs you can buy, so when you run into something that annoys you you're stuck with it until they make the next version of Rocksmith. Feels more like a console game than a PC game in that way.EDIT: see comments for a link about RockSmith2014 Remastered edition. Sounds like they are giving us a 'core game' update. But with that said there isnt really any competition making this the best of its kind. My only complaints are things like not enough minigames, not enough options for sorting songs and making playlists, and just some general interfacing issues.  The core gameplay itself is still really solid.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is essentially an improved version of the earlier installment in the series, and I have to say that Ubisoft really nailed it with this one.The game provides a simple, good-looking and smooth experience for people to learn and play the guitar, regardless of skill level.With this game you can learn to play along to your favourite songs, practice your slides, harmonics, chords, play minigames in the Guitarcade, test yourself to reach higher and higher scores in the Score Attack mode and much much more.Being an intermediate guitar player that just picked up the electric, I have to admit that playing this game has been a blessing. Within the first five hours of playing I had already learnt more than I had after 3 years of lessons. The game is easy to use and gives you plenty of time learn the songs you love, allowing you to increase and decrease the difficulty and speed of specific segments with the Riff Repeater.The game starts off with a generous amount of songs for you to play, and allows you to purchase hundreds of other songs for a relatively cheap price with new DLC being brought out weekly. If there's a song that you want to play that isn't in the main game or any of the DLC, there's also a great chance that you can find and download a Custom DLC from any of the many community websites.The only bad things I can say is that the game might not recognize you playing some power chords if there's a lot of distortion going on, and that you have to go to a store and buy a Real Tone Cable before you can play.Buying this game is probably one of the best decisions I've made recently, and  if you are a beginner and want to improve your guitar playing skills, or if you're a master and just want to have som fun challenging yourself to clear Fury of the Storm with 100% accuracy. I suggest that you spend the around 50€ for the game and the cable, and go have some fun! ;)			"

I like everything about this game, from it's training minigames to its progressive learning system- it doesn't just slow down a hard song and make you hit every note. It starts from the basics and gets harder as you learn a song- it even gives feedback- suggesting actions you should take to improve. I've had no problems with any input lag or sound quality; it was plug and play with a little bit of calibration. Would highly reccomend to someone who wants to pick up guitar or bass, or for an experienced player to learn some songs while having fun!			"

												Highly recommended for beginner, intermediate, or advanced guitaristThis is a great way to learn guitar. I know it doesn't really cover all the technique you'll be using while playing guitar, but it covers all the basic thing + a bit advanced technique you need to know in order to be a good guitarist. Why? You'll experience yourselves while using a lot of features here.I'm gonna mention all of its basic features and its advantages:- Lessons, this is a great feature for a very beginner in playing guitar. It covers mostly the basic of playing guitar, from holding your guitar, using its strap, to advanced techniques the professional guitarist use- Guitarcade, a lot of arcade games made by ubisoft provided by you in order to improve your muscle memory according to the techniques, like fretting, sliding, and etc. There's also score attack to prove your skills in mastering a song. It's such enjoying ways to improve your fingering greatly- Learn a song, it is definitely the core feature of the game. They'll let you play at first then they recommend the lessons you should take, and it's been mostly helpful. Also if you want to play the song directly, but you prefer to memorize the song, then there's a Riff Repeater to help it. It slows down the song and decrease the difficulty a bit. This is a great feature Although there's a bit bug like when you use the tuner, sometimes it falsely tunes your guitar. But it can be easily solved by using the feature againConclusion: A must have game for you all. But I recommend you buy it in a retailer, not on steam. As stated by steam itself. ""The Rocksmith™ Real Tone Cable is not included"". :P			"

												Highly recomended to those who would like to learn to play and those who already play. Rocksmith allows you to take advantage of effects (pedals, different amps etc) that you normally couldnt (unless your rich as ♥♥♥♥ and can buy whatever). It also allows you to practice quitly without disturbing anyone if you happen to live with people. Overall 9/10.

												I bought a guitar when I was 16 and it sat in the corner of my room collecting dust for 7 years. I found myself bored of the initial stages of learning guitar which can be very slow and unrewarding. Then I found Rocksmith last September.When I found Rocksmith, everything changed. Suddenly, the initial, usually slow process of learning guitar became fun. That, to me, is the best thing about this game. It reduces the harsh learning curve of playing a musical instrument by using fun minigames or allowing you to play along with songs even though you aren't good enough to hit all of the notes yet.Today, only 9 months after picking up a guitar, I can play fairly well because of Rocksmith. I can play a good amount of songs from multiple genres including classic rock, country, modern rock, and metal. I still have trouble with fast guitar solos, but it's something I'll get down eventually.However, Rocksmith is not a game that is going to entirely teach you the correct way to play from the basics up to being a master. It works best as a supplemental learning device and you should still be reading and watching videos and even getting lessons outside of Rocksmith if you're serious about learning the instrument.For most people, Rocksmith will do what it says it's going to do: teach you to play guitar. And it does that well. I'd give it a 10/10 as a supplement to regular practice and lessons (even video lessons on youtube). I'd still give it a 7.5/10 if you are only interested in the game itself and aren't going to be playing guitar outside of the game. All in all a great way to pass some time and learn an instrument.

												Definitely an awesome tool to help you play, practice, and just enjoy the guitar. I started playing guitar about the same time (almost a year ago as of writing this) that I bought this game, and it's helped me extensively. The song selection is pretty good, there's lots of variety for no matter what you're into. I even discovered a few indie songs I've never heard that I actually enjoy very much. Some of the songs are more difficult, while others are a good match for even beginning players. The dynamic difficulty is a really great feature, as it really teaches you the song slowly so that you can get the hang of the structure of the song before the game unleashes all of it at you. Even if you're playing a really difficult song, you can still enjoy it and not get completely overwhelmed by it because of dynamic difficulty. Something that was useful for me when I bought the Megadeth song pack after only playing guitar for a month...Whether you prefer chords and rhythm guitar, the bass, killer solos and lead guitar, there's for everyone.The gear unlocks and progress meters on tracks really give you something to work towards. Picking up a guitar for the first time and learning the basic mechanics is a grueling process that many give up on, but the game has tutorials for everything, even things as simple as how to hold a pick, to help you through the learning curve.There's even a website with custom songs you can add into the game. I've added over a hundred custom songs I've downloaded. The vast majority of songs I've added (even lesser known ones) include rhythm, bass, and lead as do most of the ones I've seen as well.Ultimately, if you've ever wanted to learn to play the guitar or bass, I recommend this game extensively. Even if you already know how to play, whether exceptionally well, or pretty mediocre, there really is something for everyone here. As a guitarist, this is easily the best game I own, and the most value for my money.			"

												You're going to read tons of negative reviews saying ""I've played guitar for x amount of years and (negative remark)"" just because this is a different way to learn. Well I've played guitar for 10 years with 5 years lessons and I can tell you that this game can teach you everything an instructor can teach you as long as you're dedicated to it. The one thing it doesn't teach you is how to read tabs, but that is super easy and rocksmith kind of prepares you for that. Scales, chords, bends, harmonics, vibrato; all the techniques are in here and they have lessons on how to properly use them and give you feedback on if you are doing them right.  The riff repeater is extremely useful as well and much less annoying than the original rocksmith repeater that would restart you ever time you missed one note.Overall I think Ubisoft actually did something really cool for once, (the cable is a little BS since you can buy a generic one at a music store for like 10 bucks but still cant use it because I guess cable drm is a thing now), I really hope this game inspires novice guitar players to continue working towards their goals.

												Absolutely love this game and the possibility's it opens for future musicians as they learn from today's great hit to those classics from yesteryear. 100% must have if your child is interested in bass or guitar. It will keep them more interested than that book, and or the instructor can at times by just making it plain old fun to play with no pressure whenever you want. I was nothing more than a vocalist and songwriter with very little ability when I got this and now I am a musician as well able to get the music out of my head instead of relying on another musician entirely like in the past. I still have a long road ahead in learning to flow live with seasoned musicians but I am branching out to do so and without Rocksmith I would have never got this far in such a short time due to my busy life and mass hobbies/study's. Hoping to release a few songs I am creating later this year and that in itself feels simply amazing.I need them to make a Drumsmith & Keysmith or Midismith as well for my other beginning study's I have taken up in the past few years.100% my favorite game			"

												Makes playing guitar alone A LOT more fun. Weekly DLC is a big plus. Dynamic difficulty works fine most of the time but can be a bit easy on tracks you haven't played before. Multiplayer is awesome when it works, but audio lag just keeps stacking until it becomes unplayable. Not being able to download a profile from a friend is a huge bummer, and creating a profile for them to be able to join multiplayer is a hassle.Recomended if you can play a little guitar or bass and what to make playing alone fun.

												After attempting to teach myself guitar for about 3 months, I realized I was hardly making any progress. This could be because I wasn't doing it correctly or well, but I wanted to find some way to actually learn guitar and learn it well. Rocksmith 2014 did more for me in 1 month than I learned by myself in 3.For those who are new to guitar, I recommend buying ""Seven Nation Army"" by the White Stripes, as it is both a simple yet fun song to play and learn.One problem I had with the game is while I do try to do at least an hour of practice a day, I never knew exactly how much I practiced that day (the current session time on Steam includes time where you are in menus and whatnot) unless I did nonstop play for an hour straight, which is difficult to do when you want to do other stuff. This has led to me practicing for around a few minutes less than 60 and not getting a day on the 60-day challenge that you can connect your account to. This could be easily fixed by an ingame timer that basically could record how much time you spent practicing that day or that session, excluding menu and afk time.			"

												If you used to play Rockband / Guitar Hero Like I did, and you wonder if you could play a real guitar or bass, buy this game/ learning tool. For me Rocksmith has a dual purpose: 1) Use it to learn Guitar and have a lot of fun doing it. I don't feel that RS can turn you into an amazing guitarist because it really doesn't teach much music theory or much technique, but it is a lot of fun and will encourage you to improve your skills in and out of the game. 2) This can also become a great party game since you can hook up a mic and even have 2 ppl on instruments simultaneously. I usually kick back a few beers while playing, and I have a blast doing it. If you treat this game only as a party game, you probably won't see much improvement in your skills, because you really need to practice daily if possible.If you've been kicking around the idea of buying RS, I would recommend you do so, just be sure to get the real tone cable   before you buy the steam version.

												As a learning tool, I must say this program has taught me about 25-33% of what I know. The rest was self taught. As muscians, we are always learning. Even if your super distracted by small children or a nagging wife. You will walk away with some kind of skill progression. I have yet to master a song yet. (Although 90% of the notes dissapear on Blitzkreig Bop for me!) Must be my Super-ADD? Squirrel!I can honestly say that I am far from a master guitarist and have a lot to learn/be desired. But for what I do know. I could stop learning right now and create a local band playing my own stuff.  This software/game is not going to turn you into Michael Angelo Batio over night. Nope Thats years of practice. You cannot walk away from this game and NOT progress.(Unless your of M.A.B. or Vai, or Malsteem, or maybe Satriani status) You get my point.Fun, sometimes repetitive, but getting over the learning curve is a very satisfying reward.*Edit:Don't expect to progress by just playing all the notes correctly. The songs move forward when you do the ""Rocksmith suggests"" criteria below each song.Yeah it seems mundane, but it is how the software knows your skill level.Riff repeater is another way to nail those hard to fret areas of a song.I myself struggle to aknowledge what ""Rocksmith suggests"" a lot of times. Once you do those little tasks, Rocksmith makes that song just a tad bit harder by adding more sections and notes/chords; challanging you, and making the songs seem new and fun again.			"

												I just started playing this yesterday and I LOVE it.  I am one of those people who's owned a guitar for years and could kinda play it okay, but also who played tons of guitar hero and rock band.  Well, this game isn't quite the same kind of arcade-y fun as guitar hero, but you're actually learning to play real songs on a real guitar which is amazing.Like I said, I haven't gotten a whole lot of time in the game yet, but I can already see that a lot of care went into setting up the songs so that the difficulty could gradually increase while the work done on ""easy"" mode could still provide benefit as the difficulty increases. It's not perfect, sometimes it'll count notes as ""missed"" that I'm sure I hit properly, but not really give any feedback as to why they counted as a miss.  But, I'm working through that stuff.Song selection is pretty broad and it seems like there's lots of options for all levels of ability.So if you liked guitar hero but wish it was helping you play your actual guitar, then buy this game.  Note that you gotta buy the cable- it turned out that the cheapest way for me to get the cable was to buy a bundle for a console... so instead of buying the cable by itself, I saved a few bucks by buying the xbox 360 bundle on sale on Amazon.  So be on the lookout for those kinds of deals, I think it'll be nice to be able to play at home on my console but also on the go on my laptop.			"

Usually it would take learning various chords and riffs for a beginner, so he would feel like he has made progress. In this game, I actually felt after every 5 minutes that i made progress.For experienced guitar players this game might not be that much of a blast, like for a beginner, but it certainly is worth a try.

I don't know if someone can learn starting from scratch, but it's indeed a good way to get a grip of guitar (or bass).If you are already experienced, well, it's indeed a good exercise to improve specific areas/techniques or just play some songs.Worth it!! And I hope that the library will grow even further :)			"

It has it's flaws, the note recognition isn't perfect, you can get away with some mistakes, although you most likely won't regret getting this.			"

			Views: 388		

			Someone requested I do some videos not sitting, figured I'd move around some while also trying not to break my office. This was a 1 take I hadn't played it in a while.		

 -- That's me at 500 hours practice.This is easily the best way to learn bass guitar I have ever seen.  I tried to learn using sheet tabs and playing along with songs along with some 1 on 1 lessons over 10 years ago and got nowhere but frustrated, and gave up after a couple months without ever feeling like I got anywhere.I have played 7 days.. we were snowed into a huge ice storm and couldn't drive and were stuck at home the entire 7 days, so I played a LOT of hours.. I might have played 30 hours worth of this game this week.I did look into the custom songs. Buy the Smashing Pumpkins ""Chereb Rock"" then there are TONS of external custom DLC for this game.. I think I added maybe 150 tracks via custom DLC website. The DLC prices for the games inside the steam store are priced outlandishly, I have no idea why they're so expensive when people will literally manually track the songs and give them away for free at the same quality online.. I'd pay 50 cents for a track with tabs per bass/guitar, a buck is reasonable per song.. but 3 bucks?  This is a price that is so high I cannot recommend buying the DLC other than the one song that enables custom DLC listed above.. Google will quickly show you that you copy a DLL file into the directory containing the game files, and buy that 1 track, then you just copy any other DLC you can find into that folder.In a week, I'm playing several songs with a profenciency level where I can complete them on the ""hard"" setting with no difficulty with a 90% or higher accuracy every time, I miss a note or two in some sections, I could probably adequately play in a cover band and play these songs live if I had tabs like this in front of me on stage.. It's that good.  You could track a live band with it and people could play kareoke covers of songs they had no idea how to play with no difficulty whatsoever once they got used to the tab system.  It's the most fun I've ever had playing an instrument ever.  These aren't the easiest songs in the world either.. some of them are fairly fast punk beats.  I'm trying to hit 100% on the Foo Fighters Everlong right now, and I'm convinced I can do it.  I just can't hit the section with the switch between the open d string and the 5 on the a with all the fast notes(I think it's still the a string in drop d) at 100% accuracy yet.  I watched a video of the foo fighters on stage I'm not sure their actual bass player hits that section the same every time either.  My tone is correct most of the time and I KNOW when it isn't it's glaring to me when I screw it up now.  I've never played any song on any instrument this well before. I couldn't endorce this game highly enough for someone who is willing to sit down and peg away for an hour a day at it for a month or so.. You'll actually be able to learn songs, and that's a hell of a lot more fun way to learn than anything.Tip if you want to hear what you're playing.. go to audio settings.. turn the music to 30%. Leave the bass at 100%.  Turn the game audio for sound effects to 50%, voiceovers to 50%, and crank the volume. It's got the bass too low in the mix for someone to really hear if they're playing correctly.  When you do that, I'm playing with a low end logitech 5.1 with a 5"" sub, but you can get a very decent representation of what you are really playing.. Turning yourself up a lot in the mix will help you HEAR what you're playing though, and once you can hear yourself and can't avoid tone issues.. I had a dramatic improvement to the point where I'm flatly amazed.TLDR: I couldn't endorce this strongly enough.Edit: At 500+ hours now, I could play on stage in a band no problem if you have the capacity to play you can learn with this.

												As a learning tool, I must say this program has taught me about 25-33% of what I know. The rest was self taught. As muscians, we are always learning. Even if your super distracted by small children or a nagging wife. You will walk away with some kind of skill progression. I have yet to master a song yet. (Although 90% of the notes dissapear on Blitzkreig Bop for me!) Must be my Super-ADD? Squirrel!I can honestly say that I am far from a master guitarist and have a lot to learn/be desired. But for what I do know. I could stop learning right now and create a local band playing my own stuff.  This software/game is not going to turn you into Michael Angelo Batio over night. Nope Thats years of practice. You cannot walk away from this game and NOT progress.(Unless your of M.A.B. or Vai, or Malsteem, or maybe Satriani status) You get my point.Fun, sometimes repetitive, but getting over the learning curve is a very satisfying reward.*Edit:Don't expect to progress by just playing all the notes correctly. The songs move forward when you do the ""Rocksmith suggests"" criteria below each song.Yeah it seems mundane, but it is how the software knows your skill level.Riff repeater is another way to nail those hard to fret areas of a song.I myself struggle to aknowledge what ""Rocksmith suggests"" a lot of times. Once you do those little tasks, Rocksmith makes that song just a tad bit harder by adding more sections and notes/chords; challanging you, and making the songs seem new and fun again.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 is essentially an improved version of the earlier installment in the series, and I have to say that Ubisoft really nailed it with this one.The game provides a simple, good-looking and smooth experience for people to learn and play the guitar, regardless of skill level.With this game you can learn to play along to your favourite songs, practice your slides, harmonics, chords, play minigames in the Guitarcade, test yourself to reach higher and higher scores in the Score Attack mode and much much more.Being an intermediate guitar player that just picked up the electric, I have to admit that playing this game has been a blessing. Within the first five hours of playing I had already learnt more than I had after 3 years of lessons. The game is easy to use and gives you plenty of time learn the songs you love, allowing you to increase and decrease the difficulty and speed of specific segments with the Riff Repeater.The game starts off with a generous amount of songs for you to play, and allows you to purchase hundreds of other songs for a relatively cheap price with new DLC being brought out weekly. If there's a song that you want to play that isn't in the main game or any of the DLC, there's also a great chance that you can find and download a Custom DLC from any of the many community websites.The only bad things I can say is that the game might not recognize you playing some power chords if there's a lot of distortion going on, and that you have to go to a store and buy a Real Tone Cable before you can play.Buying this game is probably one of the best decisions I've made recently, and  if you are a beginner and want to improve your guitar playing skills, or if you're a master and just want to have som fun challenging yourself to clear Fury of the Storm with 100% accuracy. I suggest that you spend the around 50€ for the game and the cable, and go have some fun! ;)			"

												Overall it's a great way to have some fun playing with a guitar, even if you have no prior experiences.  You will want to look into CDLC or else you might get bored with the limited selection.Also, they don't really update these games aside from releasing more songs you can buy, so when you run into something that annoys you you're stuck with it until they make the next version of Rocksmith. Feels more like a console game than a PC game in that way.EDIT: see comments for a link about RockSmith2014 Remastered edition. Sounds like they are giving us a 'core game' update. But with that said there isnt really any competition making this the best of its kind. My only complaints are things like not enough minigames, not enough options for sorting songs and making playlists, and just some general interfacing issues.  The core gameplay itself is still really solid.			"

												If you used to play Rockband / Guitar Hero Like I did, and you wonder if you could play a real guitar or bass, buy this game/ learning tool. For me Rocksmith has a dual purpose: 1) Use it to learn Guitar and have a lot of fun doing it. I don't feel that RS can turn you into an amazing guitarist because it really doesn't teach much music theory or much technique, but it is a lot of fun and will encourage you to improve your skills in and out of the game. 2) This can also become a great party game since you can hook up a mic and even have 2 ppl on instruments simultaneously. I usually kick back a few beers while playing, and I have a blast doing it. If you treat this game only as a party game, you probably won't see much improvement in your skills, because you really need to practice daily if possible.If you've been kicking around the idea of buying RS, I would recommend you do so, just be sure to get the real tone cable   before you buy the steam version.

												Around December of last year, I was looking for a good and solid method for learning guitar. I came across Rocksmith when I visited a friend. When trying it out on his PC, I got into the game immediately and it became very difficult to put my friend's guitar down. After that, I purchased the Rocksmith guitar bundle on Amazon and got it for Christmas. Rocksmith introduced me to guitar in an incredible way. The dynamic difficulty system started off with simple notes that gradually led to chords over time. As I got the hang of chords and techniques, I became better at more difficult phrases. Fairly soon, I found myself jamming constantly on the main menu. (Due to that, I purchased a Fender Mustang III to step it up a notch). The vast expanse of DLC kept me hooked with the game. I became exposed to more and more varieties of music, and I learned many different play styles. After getting over 300 hours up my sleeve, I have made it pretty damn far in playing guitar. Every cent I have spent on my new hobby has been worth it. You can say it has made a big difference for me in my spare time. I find myself lost in the music all the time and I don't mind it one bit. If you intend to get into guitar, buy this game. With dedication, you can achieve the skills to be good player. The only few cons that I can list with game are very minor ones.- I'm on my second Real Tone Cable (They don't last long, so handle them with great care)- Bugs on some occasions (My scenarioes are usually where the guitar audio will simply cut out and the audio feed will stop.) - Can't turn off Dynamic Difficulty once I reach a certain level. (I kinda wish that was an option once you get to that point)That's all I can really complain about. These problem won't hinder anyone since they are simple to resolve. All I can say to finish this review off is ""BUY THIS GAME!""			"

												I would like to start off saying that this is a very, very good game to learn how to play guitar if you are a newbie, or even if you are experienced it REALLY helps you out in learning songs if you're pretty shoddy at playing by ear or tabs. While it has its downsides, an exceptional downside especially for a newbie, is when you go to tune your guitar it very often may get your tunings wrong to a point where once you start playing a song you may be off by 1, 2, or even 3 (pardon me if I'm not very literal in terms of guitar) sections of the string, and it gets very frustrating when you keep missing notes thanks to this, and it's a real pain to tune it perfectly yourself while the song is playing, and I'll say this:  When I try to play System of a Down, those D Drop Cs are a B*TCH to tune and they are almost ALWAYS off, especially the two thickest strings. Which brings me to the fact that I will say GOOD LUCK tuning your 2 thickest strings because it is ALWAYS  pain in the a$$, especially when you try playing Ducks ReDux, you ALWAYS pray you never go back to your red or yellow string. But that is literally the only thing wrong with this game aside from there needing to be more songs (lol).Also a side note:  I think it would be much easier and much better to take regular guitar lessons from someone for at least maybe a month to get yourself much more familiar at guitar playing, and then warm your fingers up to moving with Guitar Hero, because that is what I've done over the past years. I took guitar lessons every Tuesday every week for at least all summer, and played Guitar Hero for maybe 4 years, and when I made the switch to real guitar on Rocksmith, well, lets just say I went from 0 to 65% on BYOB, 0 to 70% on Reptilia (not on this version of Rocksmith :( I have it on Xbox and PC), 80% on Knights of Cydonia, and I'm doing fairly well in Ariels and Toxicity, ALL IN ONE WEEK. Knights of Cydonia less than a DAY. So I don't know if maybe I'm just a natural or all those lessons and Guitar Hero really did helpI hope my review persuaded you to buy this epic way to learn guitar.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 has helped me in certain aspects. I now feel like I can play a game with tabs instead of staring at a blank book/screen. Pros: Fun, cool for learning, lesson packages, session MODE!, DLC, good interface.Disadvantages: - Not everything is taught through this package, which may make learning rigid.                          - Why not include the tabulature also if we're going to have to pay 3 dollars a song! This way we could observe the songs in their entirety too.                          - No recording feature? I mean it would be fun to jam, and record with session mode.                          - No free DLC sponsers?All in all, a fantastic emersive experience that I cannot complain about.Please make cables more bloody durable.

												A really good game...packed with a tons of activities, other than just learning and playing songs. I don't know if someone can learn starting from scratch, but it's indeed a good way to get a grip of guitar (or bass).If you are already experienced, well, it's indeed a good exercise to improve specific areas/techniques or just play some songs.Worth it!!

												Experience the beauty of playing songs on your guitar with less effort and less costs, than before. To me, the biggest advantage of this game, compared to anything i know, is, that you can play along your songs, even record it easily.All you need is:One CableOne Guitar(Maybe more, if you need other Tunings)One off-the-shelf-PCWhile you play along a song, the game automatically adjusts your Amp-Settings, meaning, that you dont need an expensive amp, footpedals and other stuff, that you would actually need.Other than that, for beginners this game might be just that ounce of motivation, that they sometimes need, to keep practcing. Usually it would take learning various chords and riffs for a beginner, so he would feel like he has made progress. In this game, I actually felt after every 5 minutes that i made progress.For experienced guitar players this game might not be that much of a blast, like for a beginner, but it certainly is worth a try.

												I highly recommend this game if you just want something the jam to every once and while, tighten your guitar skills, or possibly learn how to play in general. I used to play guitar in a couple different bands about a decade or so ago, even traveled the west coast playing shows and opening for some decent acts... then I went to film school, left the music behind me (fun while at lasted, lead to a lot of firsts in my life :) but never managed to sell all my old gear. I've hung onto a couple of amps, guitars with various sentimental values and rarity in the market place through several moves, but in all honestly only jamed on them a handful of times, and usually just playing the old stuff form muscle memory. Rocksmith is perfect for me with a variety of progressive difficulties, and challenges to learn new material and get outside my comfort zone. Been working too hard to play recently, but since I bought the game I've plugged in more in the last couple of months then I have in the last several years! The Mavericks bug did suck though, dragging down my ability to use the software for several weeks, took them the better part of a month the fix... guess that's what I get for jumping into a new os that hasn't been properly tested.

												Great way to learn guitar!  I already knew how to play rhythm guitar pretty well just by learning from tablatures over the years, but I was never good at scales or soloing.  This game has increased my dexterity quite a lot and CDLC is an awesome way to learn songs that aren't already official DLC or aren't likely to become official DLC (I listen to a lot of indie music).If you ever played Guitar Hero, it's definitely much harder but it's also that much more rewarding because you are actually learning to play the song for real.If you have always wanted to learn guitar and just could never motivate yourself to actually learn, buy this game!  It is THE best tool for learning and is adjustable to EVERY skill level, even someone like me who knows their way around a guitar but still is lacking in certain areas.			"

The tracks from the first game can be played in the second, except that they don't actually play the same in both games.

It's a good idea to get the first game, too, to be able to play it's DLC packs natively instead of through 2014, cause some of them were just plain better played through the old game.All in all, though, still  fabulous game and learning tool.

												Definitely an awesome tool to help you play, practice, and just enjoy the guitar. I started playing guitar about the same time (almost a year ago as of writing this) that I bought this game, and it's helped me extensively. The song selection is pretty good, there's lots of variety for no matter what you're into. I even discovered a few indie songs I've never heard that I actually enjoy very much. Some of the songs are more difficult, while others are a good match for even beginning players. The dynamic difficulty is a really great feature, as it really teaches you the song slowly so that you can get the hang of the structure of the song before the game unleashes all of it at you. Even if you're playing a really difficult song, you can still enjoy it and not get completely overwhelmed by it because of dynamic difficulty. Something that was useful for me when I bought the Megadeth song pack after only playing guitar for a month...Whether you prefer chords and rhythm guitar, the bass, killer solos and lead guitar, there's for everyone.The gear unlocks and progress meters on tracks really give you something to work towards. Picking up a guitar for the first time and learning the basic mechanics is a grueling process that many give up on, but the game has tutorials for everything, even things as simple as how to hold a pick, to help you through the learning curve.There's even a website with custom songs you can add into the game. I've added over a hundred custom songs I've downloaded. The vast majority of songs I've added (even lesser known ones) include rhythm, bass, and lead as do most of the ones I've seen as well.Ultimately, if you've ever wanted to learn to play the guitar or bass, I recommend this game extensively. Even if you already know how to play, whether exceptionally well, or pretty mediocre, there really is something for everyone here. As a guitarist, this is easily the best game I own, and the most value for my money.			"

												Rocksmith is the best ‘Jam’ title out of all of the others, you get to play the guitar. I can see on a really beginner level how this game would build up the confidence for you to play with some of your favourite tracks and introduce difficulty gradually in playing the guitar. Its great.This version doesn’t have the career mode which I really liked in the last one I played, here you just play the song. Im sure this was a decision made because it had to come out on those stupid consoles which seem to dictate at the minute if a game should be rushed out! We are all slowly turning to Pc boys cos of streaming and general utility, soz consoles, I think your days are numbered, but pc master race been saying that for ages! Anyway!The game has a great selection of songs, but as a metal goer I would say it’s a bit lacking in the real classics. There are community driven sites to get DLC and the DLC that is available from RS is pretty extensive so there are no complaints.The arcade is back which is a good thing if you really want to hone in on score attacks and generally gamery things. The game is top notch if you are a bassist and guitarist and certainly worth the purchase at any price .Now for the downside, this may only apply to experienced guitartistsThe only downside is the frustration of playing the song the way the game tells you to. If you are a guitarist and played these songs for years in your band and shred the hell out of the solos at lighting speed this is where rock smith gets annoying, its still fantastic but annoying!My greatest issue is failing when I can clearly play the song! Im having to spend way too long to level it up sections so that you are playing it near enough closer to the original. One of the gripes I have is when I play the score attack and set it to medium for a challenge presented within the game and find im not hitting it because its far too simple and unintuitive to me, eg, you just played trooper with your band and now have come home and started to compete online with the easy, med, hard leaderboards. You skip easy, because that would be just too easy, so you go to mid. You fail because the way its done the game misses notes youre playing it or doesn’t recognise notes. Personally I do better on the hard setting than I do on the others! Im not saying its useless its very VERY good but this seems to happen a lot and if you are like me and really want to go for high score you kind of train yourself to play it a way which the original artists didn’t! don’t get me wrong the tracking on this game is excellent and there are no issues really, its just the way you have to relearn sections over time as the game increases your mastery. It may be something with me and this isn’t a complaint anyone new to guitar playing would have, I just wish you could say, im a guitarist, set everything to 75% or a button which raises 5%. I spend that much time in the riff repeater learning how the game wants me to play is vs a way I play it. Great game though. Makes me keep the guitar out and constant practice one way or another! "

												Rocksmith 2014 is essentially an improved version of the earlier installment in the series, and I have to say that Ubisoft really nailed it with this one.The game provides a simple, good-looking and smooth experience for people to learn and play the guitar, regardless of skill level.With this game you can learn to play along to your favourite songs, practice your slides, harmonics, chords, play minigames in the Guitarcade, test yourself to reach higher and higher scores in the Score Attack mode and much much more.Being an intermediate guitar player that just picked up the electric, I have to admit that playing this game has been a blessing. Within the first five hours of playing I had already learnt more than I had after 3 years of lessons. The game is easy to use and gives you plenty of time learn the songs you love, allowing you to increase and decrease the difficulty and speed of specific segments with the Riff Repeater.The game starts off with a generous amount of songs for you to play, and allows you to purchase hundreds of other songs for a relatively cheap price with new DLC being brought out weekly. If there's a song that you want to play that isn't in the main game or any of the DLC, there's also a great chance that you can find and download a Custom DLC from any of the many community websites.The only bad things I can say is that the game might not recognize you playing some power chords if there's a lot of distortion going on, and that you have to go to a store and buy a Real Tone Cable before you can play.Buying this game is probably one of the best decisions I've made recently, and  if you are a beginner and want to improve your guitar playing skills, or if you're a master and just want to have som fun challenging yourself to clear Fury of the Storm with 100% accuracy. I suggest that you spend the around 50€ for the game and the cable, and go have some fun! ;)			"

												Plug in your guitar, learn to play songs. Rocksmith is pretty straightforward on the face of it. But underneath the hood are the tools that players of all levels can use to improve their performance, from Guitarcade mini-games, which make speed and technique drills better and more rewarding; to the Riff Repeater, which can slow down a single section of a song so that you can get it down right. A vast amount of DLC for this game means you should be able to build a huge library of songs you enjoy playing, and the Session Band lets you put together a band that will automatically play along with you.It should be noted that a Rocksmith RealTone cable is required to play this game, and that costs extra, so if you want to save some money then you should buy Rocksmith on sale. But any guitarist who feels like guitar games are a good idea but that implementing that with a toy instrument is disingenuous should look no farther than Rocksmith 2014.			"

												I guess it's the f*ckin' best simulator game ever. Previous version was quite a bit uncomfortable to use, but in 2014 ver. they added some nice features and redesigned interface. The game became much more fun to play. However, IMHO, some music in the game sucks, but it has great hits like Pour Some Sugar On Me, Aces High, Peace of Mind, No More Mr.Nice Guy, The Trooper, Round'n'Round, Losing My Religion, Rock And Roll All Nite, I Believe In The Thing Called Love(that's all, I think).Also, in my country it's such a rare game, so I was so glad to recieve.Okay. Seriously, If you want to play guitar every day for 5-6 hours OR you wanna start the guitar - do not waste time -but it immediately!			"

												I would like to start off saying that this is a very, very good game to learn how to play guitar if you are a newbie, or even if you are experienced it REALLY helps you out in learning songs if you're pretty shoddy at playing by ear or tabs. While it has its downsides, an exceptional downside especially for a newbie, is when you go to tune your guitar it very often may get your tunings wrong to a point where once you start playing a song you may be off by 1, 2, or even 3 (pardon me if I'm not very literal in terms of guitar) sections of the string, and it gets very frustrating when you keep missing notes thanks to this, and it's a real pain to tune it perfectly yourself while the song is playing, and I'll say this:  When I try to play System of a Down, those D Drop Cs are a B*TCH to tune and they are almost ALWAYS off, especially the two thickest strings. Which brings me to the fact that I will say GOOD LUCK tuning your 2 thickest strings because it is ALWAYS  pain in the a$$, especially when you try playing Ducks ReDux, you ALWAYS pray you never go back to your red or yellow string. But that is literally the only thing wrong with this game aside from there needing to be more songs (lol).Also a side note:  I think it would be much easier and much better to take regular guitar lessons from someone for at least maybe a month to get yourself much more familiar at guitar playing, and then warm your fingers up to moving with Guitar Hero, because that is what I've done over the past years. I took guitar lessons every Tuesday every week for at least all summer, and played Guitar Hero for maybe 4 years, and when I made the switch to real guitar on Rocksmith, well, lets just say I went from 0 to 65% on BYOB, 0 to 70% on Reptilia (not on this version of Rocksmith :( I have it on Xbox and PC), 80% on Knights of Cydonia, and I'm doing fairly well in Ariels and Toxicity, ALL IN ONE WEEK. Knights of Cydonia less than a DAY. So I don't know if maybe I'm just a natural or all those lessons and Guitar Hero really did helpI hope my review persuaded you to buy this epic way to learn guitar.			"

												Wanted to learn to play electric guitar for a long years ago, but i allways thought ""it is expensive (guitar and at least guitar combo) and also i fear of music theory"" so i got never started. But RS made my guitar dream come very easily. I recommend it to everyone who is interested to try play electric guitar/bass. Now after two months after my first hitting guitar string for my life i am pretty hooked (learning and jamming for about hour-twoo daily, sometimes less, sometimes more) and i know soon i will feel some urge to buy real guitar equipment or at least some guitar combo :). Another really cool thing is you can use any guitar effect/pedal with RS (i just bought wah-pedal which really broadened my possibilities to play with guitar sound).I love RockSmith! :)			"

												So far, this is an excellent, robust training tool -- RS2014 provides a guided experience, but gives you tons of options to go your own way if you prefer. I'm very impressed.I got Rock Band 3's Pro Guitar peripheral when that game came out, and the difference here is striking. Rock Band's Pro Mode was an impressive achievement, but the game was organized around casual group play. That was great for the ""normal"" Rock Band instruments, but extremely awkward for anyone playing Pro Guitar or Pro Bass -- learning new songs for those players was time consuming and would hold up the group, while everyone else could jump in or out and play things at a comfortable skill level, as the game intended.RS2014, by contrast, would not be entertaining for a room full of people. And that's good. It assumes there's one person playing, and it watches them, and tries like hell to figure out how to help them learn. It's as fast or (more importantly) as slow as you need it to be, and it understands that learning an instrument is a marathon, not a sprint.I haven't used Rocksmith long enough yet to know how good it is at conferring really advanced skills. But everything I've seen up to this point has been promising -- I'm having a ton of fun, and I know I'm learning. Definitely recommended.			"

												As for Rocksmith, so far it's done everything I've asked of it, short of giving me a real solid feel of direction. I'm probably going to regret not practicing the basic scales and chords as much, since I've been playing along with some hit songs more during my practice sessions. The fun factor for me is quite high, but I've only found annoyance with the GuitarCade mini games so far. The lessons aren't nearly as in depth and useful as I had hoped. It's also hard to gauge my progression in skill outside of each individual song. I've also noticed it may be a bit too forgiving for timing. I've been singing pseudo-professionally, and feel the timing window might leave too much leeway for folks who aren't particularly good at rhythm to begin with, not giving enough feedback to develop well. 5/5			"

												Great game for learning to play the Guitar. I would recommend that you also get lessons at the same time as this will speed up your learning. Also having a tutor has taught me a lot about the bad habits I had picked up which isn't some think I could have learnt from this game such as proper thumb and hand placement, how to improve switching between chords and more. I have played this game now with three different guitars and not had an issue.The riff repeater is a wonderful tool which helps you to conquer the parts of a song where you get stuck and another great feature is the guitar arcade with games such as star chords which have been fun, challenging and helped me progress my chrod switching and has taught me some more chords. I can't think of anything negative to say about this game. The only thing is before buying this game you have to know that you won't be instantly good and you have to practice in order to get good.

												I've been playing Rocksmith 2014 for a couple months now, and I really can't recommend it enough -- especially if you're an intermediate-level guitarist/bassist (like me) looking to learn some new songs and techniques (also like me). It's far from perfect, and it's certainly not the only learning tool you should be using, but it's a top-notch supplement with loads of great options and features. The DLC list is spectacular, which can make buying new songs a bit of a slippery slope; just be sure to double-check a song's tuning(s) before you buy it. Absolutely worth a look, especially if you happen to find the game and Real Tone Cable on sale somewhere.			"

												After attempting to teach myself guitar for about 3 months, I realized I was hardly making any progress. This could be because I wasn't doing it correctly or well, but I wanted to find some way to actually learn guitar and learn it well. Rocksmith 2014 did more for me in 1 month than I learned by myself in 3.For those who are new to guitar, I recommend buying ""Seven Nation Army"" by the White Stripes, as it is both a simple yet fun song to play and learn.One problem I had with the game is while I do try to do at least an hour of practice a day, I never knew exactly how much I practiced that day (the current session time on Steam includes time where you are in menus and whatnot) unless I did nonstop play for an hour straight, which is difficult to do when you want to do other stuff. This has led to me practicing for around a few minutes less than 60 and not getting a day on the 60-day challenge that you can connect your account to. This could be easily fixed by an ingame timer that basically could record how much time you spent practicing that day or that session, excluding menu and afk time.			"

												If you used to play Rockband / Guitar Hero Like I did, and you wonder if you could play a real guitar or bass, buy this game/ learning tool. For me Rocksmith has a dual purpose: 1) Use it to learn Guitar and have a lot of fun doing it. I don't feel that RS can turn you into an amazing guitarist because it really doesn't teach much music theory or much technique, but it is a lot of fun and will encourage you to improve your skills in and out of the game. 2) This can also become a great party game since you can hook up a mic and even have 2 ppl on instruments simultaneously. I usually kick back a few beers while playing, and I have a blast doing it. If you treat this game only as a party game, you probably won't see much improvement in your skills, because you really need to practice daily if possible.If you've been kicking around the idea of buying RS, I would recommend you do so, just be sure to get the real tone cable   before you buy the steam version.

												Pro: Rocksmith is a fun teaching tool that also doubles as a tone simulator, which isn't bad for only forty bucks. The library of DLC is also pretty extensive these days, with something for practically every player's preferred style of music.Con: Rocksmith's user interface was created by a sociopath. The menu structure makes almost no sense, and most of the arcade games are hobbled by the fact that after each loss, you are forced to sit through an annoying and thoroughly unskippable 20 seconds of point-tallying nonsense, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Oh, and you have to go through a redundant front-end screen just to quit the game.Conclusion: It's a reasonably entertaining addition to any guitarist's collection, but I hope the UI designer gets eaten by rabid squirrels.

												As a learning tool, I must say this program has taught me about 25-33% of what I know. The rest was self taught. As muscians, we are always learning. Even if your super distracted by small children or a nagging wife. You will walk away with some kind of skill progression. I have yet to master a song yet. (Although 90% of the notes dissapear on Blitzkreig Bop for me!) Must be my Super-ADD? Squirrel!I can honestly say that I am far from a master guitarist and have a lot to learn/be desired. But for what I do know. I could stop learning right now and create a local band playing my own stuff.  This software/game is not going to turn you into Michael Angelo Batio over night. Nope Thats years of practice. You cannot walk away from this game and NOT progress.(Unless your of M.A.B. or Vai, or Malsteem, or maybe Satriani status) You get my point.Fun, sometimes repetitive, but getting over the learning curve is a very satisfying reward.*Edit:Don't expect to progress by just playing all the notes correctly. The songs move forward when you do the ""Rocksmith suggests"" criteria below each song.Yeah it seems mundane, but it is how the software knows your skill level.Riff repeater is another way to nail those hard to fret areas of a song.I myself struggle to aknowledge what ""Rocksmith suggests"" a lot of times. Once you do those little tasks, Rocksmith makes that song just a tad bit harder by adding more sections and notes/chords; challanging you, and making the songs seem new and fun again.			"

												Overall I reccomend it, only two problems1: is the tabbing is not always the most efficient way to play, for example on Jimi Hendrix Little wing there's a double stop tabbed as fret 5 on the G string and fret 9 on the D string. That's ridiculous, in Eb those notes are B and Bb. You can just play fret 5 on the G string and the open B string. THe songs are full of annoying quirks like that. If you know the fretboard you can do the conversion but for learning, who the hell is revieweing these?2: The open note notation, they use a bar that takes 2 to 3 frets, when you're playing arpeggios in the lower frets (1 to 3) and lower strings (E, A, D)  combined with the other strings it gets REALLY crowded in the screen and it becomes really impossible to sight read.Everything else has been improving consistently and becoming better.

												Before buying the game, I felt like I was stuck in a rut with little to no progression. Or was it just motivation that I needed? And then I decided to buy the game.Anyway, Rocksmith gave me that motivation and a really smooth progression on various songs, and seeing my progression motivated me even more. In a week or so, already at 70% for Bat Country (rhythm guitar)! You go from simple notes (think Guitar Hero on Easy) to actual chords! (Can't really compare to GH this time.)If you like some songs on the lineup and you are looking for reviews to decide whether or not you should buy this game, take my word and make the leap to Rocksmith. You won't regret it.			"

												Because of Rocksmith 2014, and probably only because of Rocksmith 2014, I've been playing guitar for 3 years. The 556 hours of game time shown above is only since I've been playing on Steam/Mac/PC in the last year.  The 1500+ hours I played on XBox 360 since 2013 aren't included.  You won't find many other games with this kind of replayability.  No form of practice has ever held my attention like RS2014.  Thanks to the skills I've ""self-taught"" through Rocksmith, I'm often near the top of the leaderboards.  Even if it were necessary to start taking lessons to advance to the next level, Rocksmith would still be the best way to practice.  Why play to sheet music of children's songs or 19th century classics; instead play to fantastic arrangements of 19th century classics, or better still, play along with your favorite bands.  Being able to play R.E.M.'s ""The One I Love"" while Michael Stipe does the singing or be The Cranberries lead or rhythm guitarist on ""Zombie"" is magical. It would be impossible to recommend this any higher for someone that has a desire to learn Guitar or Bass.  This not a button smashing rhythm game where being good has zero value.  Skills learned here are real and can be used to play in a real band on a real stage in real life.			"

												As someone who's been playing guitar for almost 20 years, I was excited to get my hands on Rocksmith. I've got plenty of good things to say and one very bad thing, so here goes: If you're a beginner who's never even held a guitar and just want to get a solid basis for building skills and having fun at playing, this is an awesome tool. If you're more seasoned like myself, this is a great way to get consistent practice and improve on techniquest that may have needed work or have gone sloppy over the years. I LOVE the Guitarcade. And the songs in this game are all pretty good (Muse--f*ck yeah!)The bad? If you're used to playing from tablature, the way that Rocksmith wants you to play is infuriating. Instead of common tab view, which is looking down at a fretboard, Rocksmith has you looking THROUGH the fretboard, which turns out to be counter-intuitive when you consider that almost all tab and instructional books/DVDs have it the traditional top-down method. Not only that, but RS refers to the thinnest string as ""the sixth string"", and goes up from there, calling the bass string the ""first"". Again, counter-intuitive if you've ever opened a pack of strings and read what they actually call them. Hint: The ""first"" is not the bass.Despite that glaring issue, this game is an awesome value and great tool. With the amount of actual instruction RS has to offer as well as good gameplay and great music, you really can't go wrong. Get us some cheaper DLCs and we'll be all set. :)			"

												I personally have a difficult time learning music others have written from sheets of paper.  I don't always understand the speed I need to play at, the way it is strummed, etc.  Having started appreciating guitar more from back when Rock Band was new, and countless hours with friends playing that and Guitar Hero 3, I was excited for Rocksmith.  But this is Rocksmith 2014, so I'll talk about it.This game improves on its initial release.  You have access to all the old songs, but now they are less simplified, closer to the actual song.  There is more variety for playing chords, again, closer to the actual songs (probably spot-on).  I can now play REAL music and still have little colored shapes going across the screen.  The game has improved my ability to spot-read, and because I'm using a real guitar and don't just have to get it ""close-enough,"" it encourages me to actually practice the songs slowly so I KNOW what I'm actually playing.  I find myself actually playing bits of my favorite songs, even without the game, making it far more useful than my hours of Rock Band playing.  ^_^With the wide selection of DLC, I can still play many of those old songs for real now.  If I have any issues, they are relatively small.  First, playing Bass on here is terrible.  The system has the hardest time in the world registering that I have played notes in normal tuning.  It's far worse in Drop D, and  I have yet to find the ""sweet spot"" I need to have my finger in to get it to understand I'm playing F instead of .847E#/F...  I have a bass guitar and still feel like I have to practice it without Rocksmith because it's just no fun if you're hitting all the notes and it tells you contrary.  Equally, the game has trouble registering notes on regular guitar the lower I tune.  Drop D is tough sometimes, but it seems if I put my finger closer to the fret, it registers fine.  Eb has been alright.  But going into Drop C territory for Skillet and A Day to Remember has been the worst.  Most of the time I end up frustrated that I sound fine on the actual instrument, but it's not good enough for the game.  Last time I tried to play, I played very soft...the opposite of how heavy, deep, metal songs are supposed to be played, I thought, and it registered just fine.  Maybe I just need control.So for anyone wanting to learn how to play guitar for real and still have fun (yes, there are fun arcade games, though a very different lineup from the original Rocksmith...how I miss baseball...) this is the ""game"" for you.  At first, your fingers are going to have to get used to this because it IS work, and it is playing Real guitar, but after you build up callouses, you're on your way to sheetless rocking!  I have no regrets.			"

												EDITED: Updated the review to account for the new 'Remastered' versionThis is a fantastic game to get if you are looking for something to suppliment your practice routine with. I would still recommend using lessons from elsewhere too since there are aspects of playing that Rocksmith does not address. However, if used as part of a practice routine it is just fantastic. Personally I use this most evenings, having a quick 30 min playing session to random songs for a warm up, and then spending another 30 or so mins working on a particular song that I would like to memorise. It's just a really great way to add some fun stuff to your practice routine, and given the variety of music on offer, chances are you'll be playing stuff you might not otherwise look at. Just this evening I went from playing My Chemical Romance, to some classic blues, onto a couple of disco songs including ""Good Times"" and then finished my session with a quick crack at Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold. Pros:+ Gets you playing along with music from the start which is THE way to learn to play+ Has a very good range of tracks in the base pack, with loads of more on offer via the first game and DLC+ The tracks have a good range of difficulties - even a total beginner will find stuff that is manageable+ The Riff Repeater is great for practicing the tricky sections of songs+ Very little lag when used with a proper set-up (i.e. dedicated A/V rather than HDMI)+ Nice range of basic lessons to help beginning players get a feel for their instrument+ Now has very good search options making it easy to find tracks even if you have lots of DLC+ New interface in song-mode is much easier to use+ Riff Repeater now feels super-slick with mouse-based interface.Cons- Guitarcadce games are a gimmic best avoided- The note-recognition is a bit sloppy - you can play quite poorly and still get 100% on a song- Some of the menu design is a bit of a messAll in all, I really recommend this game to anyone interested in playing guitar or bass. Speaking from the bass side of things, we get the full deal too. Bass is offered for every track in the game, and there are some really interesting parts there. This is great since I had feared that bass would be somewhat of an afterthought. Kudos to the devs for making it a full featured part of the game.			"

												Okay...review in progress. Also: first-time ever guitar player (using nothing but this and a cheap guitar called fazley). Learning guitar is obviously not easy and my guitar hero skills don't apply (alas :P ), so...Now I'm at 70 hours. This went straight up to my most played steam game, and no sign of stopping (I haven't even played all songs or lessons yet). Played for about 60 days, more or less every day. Have I improved? Obviously. Do I have fun? Pretty much the entire time. Have I learned to play the guitar? Of course not. Playing an instrument isn't a ""you can or you can't"" thing. It's about practice, practice and more practice. The thing is not to have it become a chore or hitting a wall. Without testing other means of learning to play it's hard to guess, but I think this does a great job of keeping things fresh and always having something for you to work on that's within your grasp. That, perhaps more than anything else, makes this something worth getting even for non-gamers.(older review)At this point (40 hours in), I can't but agree with all the other reviewers that it's a solid must buy (at least for absolute beginners). It may require some searching and tinkering, but there is always something to improve that isn't outside your (limited) expertise. Be it repeating that riff from Hey ya or paint it black, or just trying songs or guitarcade games or even practicing the tracks from the lessons.I'm not sure about other guitar learning software, but at least this does a great job of making your guitar skills measurable.Becoming good at guitar is still FAR outside my grasp, and that ""60 days to learn guitar"" seems awfully optimistic to me (I'm about halfway in days), but I'm still having at least as fun as the first hours (just kidding: it's actually far more fun).(even older review):I'm about 14 hours in, and still loving it. And that's rather amazing, as I just keep repeating the few lessons and guitarcade games I'm somewhat familiar with in order to not screw up. At this pace, it'll be 100'000 hours before I mastered all lessons, minigames and songs, but I'm having fun while doing it.Obviously, I'm not very far and anything involving bending or above is still way above me (I'm currently focussing on finding the right frets and strumming correctly). But at this time, I can say that the game certainly doesn't make you feel dumb when you're busy attempting things.Thus far no criticism. It's still way too early to tell if this guitar will end up collecting dust or that it'll sill be touching the thing two months from now. But I SERIOUSLY doubt that'll be because of Rocksmith 2014. :-)			"

												This game is excellent. I have been self-taught and playing guitar by tab for years. I could usually select any tab and make my way through it. This game finally introduced me to the theory side of music. **However, this game introduced me to theory by showing me new chords and new progressions/scales - I still had to take the time and learn a good chunk of the theory on the side. The difference... this game finally inspired me to do so!! I knew I had to understand these things to be a successful guitar player and Rocksmith ENCOURAGES you!!The layout/interface of the game and the options it gives you are phenomenal. Sometimes I find it annoying playing one note every 5 seconds in ""Learn a Song"" but Rocksmith quickly realizes you can handle it and adds more. Just wishing there was an option to get more notes/chords right away without having to use riff repeater to cheat the system.Overall, this game is great for any level of guitar player (simply learning a song - beginner/intermediate, to playing session mode for hours trying new lead licks or creating new music - advanced). Hope this review helps you out!			"

												This is an amazing way to learn the guitar, it's taken me from not knowing how to properly hold a guitar to being able to play the basic chords, play parts of leads and hold down sections involving multiple strings. Let me just list down stuff that other reviews might have missed, especially the ones that someone just starting out would want to know1. No need to get an expensive electric guitar, i've been using a signature guitar (Rs 3500) and a humbucker type pickup (Rs. 650) to play this. It's not the best way but it'll still get you started 2. Constant updates: Team Rocksmith (RS) is continually rolling out improvements and new songs for this. At about Rs. 180 per song it might seem steep but compare that against taking proper guitar classes. 3. Broad range of stuff: Formal guitar classes mostly focused on getting me to learn a particular song. If you follow the RS missions they'll take you from songs, to learning scales, to learning techniques like bends (each of which has its own game that you can play while training your fingers) to various tuning styles of the guitar. It's more holistic than just being able to repeat a bunch of songs 4. Takes the boredom out of practicing: the point at which most people leave the guitar is the long hours spent training your fingers to move on the frets. It tedious, repetitive and there seems to be no improvement taking place. Rocksmith makes that fun by giving crazy arcade games, easy versions of songs, score challenges etc. You'll play it for the fun and sense of accomplishment while learning all the key skills 5. It's not a perfect solution: You'll still need to visit websites/youtube etc to get more info on the basics. It won't teach you to read tablature (tabs) that real guitarists use to learn songs. People will tell you to learn the basic chords first (A, E, D, B, C) but Rocksmith seems to favor power chords. But it'll help you learn, it'll help you stick to the guitar when you would've grown bored and left it, and then one day you'll be a guitarist my son			"

It's just a really great way to add some fun stuff to your practice routine, and given the variety of music on offer, chances are you'll be playing stuff you might not otherwise look at. Just this evening I went from playing My Chemical Romance, to some classic blues, onto a couple of disco songs including ""Good Times"" and then finished my session with a quick crack at Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold. Pros:+ Gets you playing along with music from the start which is THE way to learn to play+ Has a very good range of tracks in the base pack, with loads of more on offer via the first game and DLC+ The tracks have a good range of difficulties - even a total beginner will find stuff that is manageable+ The Riff Repeater is great for practicing the tricky sections of songs+ Very little lag when used with a proper set-up (i.e. dedicated A/V rather than HDMI)+ Nice range of basic lessons to help beginning players get a feel for their instrument+ Now has very good search options making it easy to find tracks even if you have lots of DLC+ New interface in song-mode is much easier to use+ Riff Repeater now feels super-slick with mouse-based interface.Cons- Guitarcadce games are a gimmic best avoided- The note-recognition is a bit sloppy - you can play quite poorly and still get 100% on a song- Some of the menu design is a bit of a messAll in all, I really recommend this game to anyone interested in playing guitar or bass. Speaking from the bass side of things, we get the full deal too. Bass is offered for every track in the game, and there are some really interesting parts there. This is great since I had feared that bass would be somewhat of an afterthought. Kudos to the devs for making it a full featured part of the game.			"

Guitar Hero but with a real guitar!Rocksmith 2014 is an excellent piece of software that I really love. This easily goes on my favorite games list. It is the second installment of the Rocksmith series; the first game released in 2012. The new 2014 version has improved a lot from it's previous game.I picked this up with 0% skills and barely touched a guitar before. By the time of writing this I have 140 hours on records and without a doubt improved a lot. I remember when I downloaded ""Take It Or Leave It"" by The Strokes and tried to play I barely could keep up with the song and eventually miss a lot of notes, but now I can get above 90% accuracy in it. There are countless of DLC for R14 mostly for about €2,99. A must have is Cherub Rock by The Smashing Pumpkins because that allows you to download free custom DLC made by other people. Customsforge[customsforge.com] is the main website where you can get your favorite songs for free.Aside from the game you need a guitar obviously and Ubisoft's Rocksmith Real Tone Cable which works with all consoles, both R14 and it's predecessor. It is basically a 1/4 jack plug[i.imgur.com] to USB. The cable was pretty hard for me to get because I don't live in the USA so the store I bought it from had to wait for a new batch to arrive which took approximately one month.Happy shredding!			"

												Okay...review in progress. Also: first-time ever guitar player (using nothing but this and a cheap guitar called fazley). Learning guitar is obviously not easy and my guitar hero skills don't apply (alas :P ), so...Now I'm at 70 hours. This went straight up to my most played steam game, and no sign of stopping (I haven't even played all songs or lessons yet). Played for about 60 days, more or less every day. Have I improved? Obviously. Do I have fun? Pretty much the entire time. Have I learned to play the guitar? Of course not. Playing an instrument isn't a ""you can or you can't"" thing. It's about practice, practice and more practice. The thing is not to have it become a chore or hitting a wall. Without testing other means of learning to play it's hard to guess, but I think this does a great job of keeping things fresh and always having something for you to work on that's within your grasp. That, perhaps more than anything else, makes this something worth getting even for non-gamers.(older review)At this point (40 hours in), I can't but agree with all the other reviewers that it's a solid must buy (at least for absolute beginners). It may require some searching and tinkering, but there is always something to improve that isn't outside your (limited) expertise. Be it repeating that riff from Hey ya or paint it black, or just trying songs or guitarcade games or even practicing the tracks from the lessons.I'm not sure about other guitar learning software, but at least this does a great job of making your guitar skills measurable.Becoming good at guitar is still FAR outside my grasp, and that ""60 days to learn guitar"" seems awfully optimistic to me (I'm about halfway in days), but I'm still having at least as fun as the first hours (just kidding: it's actually far more fun).(even older review):I'm about 14 hours in, and still loving it. And that's rather amazing, as I just keep repeating the few lessons and guitarcade games I'm somewhat familiar with in order to not screw up. At this pace, it'll be 100'000 hours before I mastered all lessons, minigames and songs, but I'm having fun while doing it.Obviously, I'm not very far and anything involving bending or above is still way above me (I'm currently focussing on finding the right frets and strumming correctly). But at this time, I can say that the game certainly doesn't make you feel dumb when you're busy attempting things.Thus far no criticism. It's still way too early to tell if this guitar will end up collecting dust or that it'll sill be touching the thing two months from now. But I SERIOUSLY doubt that'll be because of Rocksmith 2014. :-)			"

												This game/learning tool is amazing. I had played guitar for years prior to purchasing this, but have always had difficulty learning full songs. This game with the riff repeater option has changed all that. prosI play on a mac and it works flawlessly with no lag during complex songs.You can change speed at which to play along withchoose your own path of lead or backup you can focus on one section of a song or lead or a few sections at your own pace in the riff repeateryou can change the difficulty and have less notes to start out with and ease your way in (caution though, as sometimes you will want to put the difficulty up higher than you can play in order to understand the best finger positioning for a certain chord or riff)intuitive on screen display allows you to play without reading music or tablatureyour gaming addiction will now actually give you a tangeable skill! DLC is forward compatible from the original version, so the song list is pretty robust. Just try to remember the game is called ROCKsmith, so there is lots of rock songs and metal songs, but not a lot of country or jazz.consthe steam version does not come with the rocksmith cable, which is required, proprietary, and costly. Any old midi cable will not do. Even if you have an electric or an electric acoustic guitar or bass...you will not be able to just buy this game from steam and be able to play. YOU MUST ALSO BUY THE CABLE!!! so I bought the game on sale for 10 bucks but still had to pay $30 for the cable, which took my broke ♥♥♥ months to actually buy. My advice is to wait for a sale on amazon or something and buy the game and cable together.other thoughtsThe mini games are hit and miss, with some being enjoyable and others not so much.some of these games have a hard time if your guitar's intonation is off, so yu may need to have it adjusted. My guitar has some intonation that is pretty bad, but for the most part in songs it still works perfectly....one or two of the minigames are unplayable...but that is my gear and not the games fault.there is a ""session mode"" which allows you to use preset jams to practice scales over, with a difficulty setting to even allow playing over changes and improvising. Buy the Ronda alla turca DLC from Mozart....it is so fun and if you ever get it down including the solo...you will feel great pride!I honestly wish this game was available 20 years ago. I strongly urge you to get this game for yourself...or anyone in your life who wants to learn or improve their guitar skills.			"

												 A step up from the Original still has it's quirks. The  session mode probably works better with for guitar than bass but is still   entertaining.The chance to use custom songs is a huge saving a £2.39 pers song soon odds up.  Hendrix pack is promised  so  Christmas will disppear in a Jimi fest. Next expansion needs to be a live Jam mode with friends.As teaching tool it seems to work as I can now play instead of just noodling.			"

												Seeing as I have 200+ hours on this game and only 13 achievements you probably think I've been idling and probably haven't played all of the game. The second part of that sentence is true as I have spent the majority of those 200 hours playing songs that have been modded in by the extensive, constantly growing community.  When people think of modding normally they may think of reinstallling skyrim countless times due to corrupt files and installing loads of pointless software off dodgy websites. Rocksmith isn't like this. All you have to do is 1. own a DLC off the game (they cost a pound it isn't bad) 2. download a song of your choice off about 700 pages of songs 3. Change the DLCs ID so the game thinks it's the DLC you own. Thats briefly what you need to do theres tutorials all over the internet on what to do. I've installed 360 different songs onto this game and I've never had an issue.  When I bought this game I wasn't a noob to the games. I had played the original game which was alright and I had been playing guitar for years anyway. I've used this game to practice songs for performing and it has been very successful. The design of the game is simple to use and easy to play along to. This game is one of the few good ubisoft games (other great titles being king kong the video game and Howrse.)   In summary this game is perf if you want to learn or become better at guitar. Once you've played the base game theres a hell of a lot of CDLC for you to chose from.Only bad thing is you have to pay for ""Smoke on the water"" and thats just down right offensive.			"

												Firstly, before I turned on the original Rocksmith for 360, I was a complete noob at guitar. Now I can pick up any guitar and play and sing along with a pretty impressive song list. By the time you read this review you'll see I've spent nearly or over 500 hours on this game. It's my most played game in my library, averaging around 10 hours a week, sometimes more if I get a wind of motivation going up to as much as 20 hours a week. Point is, I clearly like this game, and you don't need a review to see I would recommend it. You can do that just by looking at my profile activity. Note: My Steam time isn't my total time spent on guitar. I dabbled with the original Rocksmith, played quite a bit of 2014 on the Xbox 360 before switching to steam and have also spent roughly the same time playing acoustic.But this isn't just a game. It's a game that teaches you a real skill, so instead of answering the usual questions of how the game works (It's got a UI similar to the Guitar Hero and Rockband games) or the graphics (Pretty straight forward here. Graphics are functional but not over intrusive over the note highway). Instead I'll answer the question people are really interested in ’If I buy this game, will I learn guitar?’.I can’t answer that with a straight yes or no. However, if you were to say to me, ‘I’m learning guitar, should I buy Rocksmith?’ the answer is a clean yes. Why? Because Rocksmith is NOT the ultimate tool for learning guitar. It can, however, be used as part of a toolbox of educational tools (all free minus price of guitar) to strengthen many of the skills needed for effective guitar playing. It just doesn’t teach you them all. If you buy it expecting it to magically teach you guitar in a few months, you’ll be sorely disappointed. If however, you’re committed to learning the guitar, you’ll find it an irreplaceable tool. There are certain things that unfortunately Rocksmith can’t teach, and it comes down to the will and determination of the individual to plough through these physical limitations.For example, if you’re a complete novice picking up your first guitar, you have two hurdles from your body. Firstly, you’re lack of knowledge of the fretboard will have you spending more time staring at your hands position then anything else. This can be frustrating in Rocksmith because trying to play a song, even on the easiest difficulty, will still result in more time looking at the fretboard than the screen. This causes frustration and that’s dangerous because that is when people will start to think ‘Screw this, I’m going to go play to play League of Legends’ or whatever the young people are wasting their time on nowadays and the guitar is never picked up again. Another common issue for the novice is limb independence. This is a person's ability to move one arm independent of the other. At the early days of learning a guitar, again, you’re going to want to focus on hand position and the fret board. This means being able to strum without thinking about it and that’s a challenge in itself. Trying to master both at the same time can be rough for a guitar noobie, and it’s the first and most common wall people will give up on. The good news is that everyone has the same problem when starting out and it’s simply an issue of muscle memory, meaning if you practice then the body will learn by itself and if you stick at it, you’ll have one magical day when something clicks and you’re body just starts to work. You won’t have to think about strumming and your hands will feel like they are more naturally falling into the chord shapes at the right position on the fretboard. This is a magical day for all budding guitarists, and this is when I recommend moving on to Rocksmith because now you’ll be able to play the simpler songs on 100% difficulty at full speed and once you do that, you’ll start to actually feel like a guitarist.Rocksmith’s gift is that it is second to none for being a tool develop accuracy and muscle memory in many of the skills required to play guitar. Add CDLC (Google it) and it becomes essential. If you’re already learning guitar you can jump in at any level and take advantage of Rocksmith. It makes practice time, fun and easy to measure progress. However if you want this to magically and effortlessly turn you into an irresistible guitar playing woman magnet.. well, keep dreaming.SIDE NOTE AND RECOMMENDATIONIf you genuinely want to learn guitar, then instead of starting here, I recommend buying an acoustic and putting ‘easy acoustic song tutorial’ in to Youtube. Start with something like Green Day’s Good Riddance or Oasis’ Wonderwall. Learn the basic chords and get efficient at transitioning between these chords and strumming at the same time. This may take months, even a year of solid practice, maybe even longer. There will be times when you feel like you won’t get it, but I promise your body will eventually start to move on its own. Then move on Rocksmith. Stick to the Rhythm side of things when starting out and once you’re able to strum and change chords effortlessly, move on to the more demanding Lead position with songs that have the face-melting solos. The trick is gradual and persistent practice. Trust me :)			"

												I ""only"" have  about 11h of playtime on this program when writing this review. But I just wanted to tell everyone how pleased I am with this piece of software.I'm somewhat an experienced ""musician"" but not on guitar- it's been always my dream to play it though but I think my parents were in shock seeing LED Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix or KISS in the 70s and never wanted me to be a guitar stomping maniac \m/(~.~)\m/Anyways, I picked up a guitar a few years ago but never really got me more than strumming a few chords. My problem certainly was playing not daily as I used to on my other instrument.Note: It's not just about talent or a teacher- even the best teacher can't practice for you! You need to play and practice regularly with a certain amount of devotion and variety.And this is exactly what this ""game"" does. You pick a song you'd like to learn und play guitar hero like by first just plucking a few notes; the program recognizes your failures or your skills and advances the next time and/or recommends to practice the riffs you've been bad at.I can't tell how much fun it is to learn a song step by step.  It's highly motivating. I never played the guitar as much as now. One of my friends is a professional guitar player and he told me that he skipped 3(!) teachers until he found the one that finally taught him with devotion. In contrast to his earlier teachers- this guy said.. Ok, now take the guitar and let's play Smoke on the Water! Just like Jack Black.. xDI mean ..come on- didn't you ever want to play a song for yourself when hearing that? ""Airguitaring"" it when you're alone? xDAlso, there is a huge arsenal of guitar technique videos- holding the guitar, chords, arpergios, slides... basics but also very advanced techniques just to name a few.And these are not just show off videos- you'll be shown the technique and then you'll have to play it and the computer analyzes your progress.If you're really into really into learning guitar... then get Rocksmith 2014 and the cable! You'll never regret.ROCK ON!			"

******WARNING!******DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!This game has cost me a fortune!  If you are poor, have no personal income, or have to ask anyone for money, stay FAR away from this game!Now that's out of the way - onto the game that I do really recommend.It is a good place to start learning guitar/bass on a reasonable budget, and considering the hours I have put in, it is well worth it compared to paid tuition (at least for starting out and keeping things fun for a while).  I would also highly recommend Guitar Pro 6[www.guitar-pro.com] (or similar tab-software) and using RocksmithToTab[www.rocksmithtotab.de] in the future, as well as getting DECENT tabs from reputable sources, like mySongBook[www.mysongbook.com]; because 66,000+ tabs in a single download or any from Ultimate-Guitar[www.ultimate-guitar.com] for example, does sound like a good idea at the time, but I wish you the best of luck trying to find and short-list the decent ones...Rocksmith 2014 is fantastic at what it does, it adds an aspect of fun to practicing the guitar/bass that can't really be matched.  However, learning correct technique and procedures are not really a strong point of Rocksmith 2014 and unlearning bad technique may be counter-intuitive in the long-run; but you can find tutorials on Google/Youtube, JustinGuitar[www.justinguitar.com], or through the use of tutored lessons to make up for this.

												great game!imo, everything that could been featured a lot better in the first Rocksmith has been improved to a whole new level. (eg. interface - tabsfeatures - quickly switch to practice mode & free select of repeats to practice)I do like the first rocksmith very much, it's so lovely to play along with songs you like!But this one beats it all and certainly the new Session Mode feature; there's no better gaming than jamming on a real guitar with a virtual band. Unless jamming with irl friends ofc!for people who don't play the guitar yet and are in doubt after reading the same kind of bad reviews, I would like to add something.A great deal of the not recommendations comes from people who didn't play the guitar and are impatient, maybe naive.If you didn't play the guitar before, you don't just acquire skill by just launching the game. However, you will if you check the short lessons that actually do explain all the basics you need to know. Just check a lesson, then apply this in a song you like to play, check the next lesson and repeat. Doing this, you will be able to play songs a lot faster than normally. certainly the songs you like! Ofc this takes some time, but afterall and again, it's a real instrument; like a violin, piano, drums, ... And if you aren't convinced still that it is the real deal, then see it as a controller with  21~24 x 6 buttons.for new players this is probably quite a hard in te beginning, but you do like a challenge, don't you?
