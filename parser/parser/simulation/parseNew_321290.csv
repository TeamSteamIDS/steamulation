												If pigeons weren't enough, now you can choose between BUNNIES and KITTENS. Well, kind of. Unlike the pigeons in Hatoful Boyfriend, these animals fortunately (?) don't stay animals forever. (I took a bunny with me to the beach; he was not impressed when I put on my $100 dollar bikini, the fruits of MANY nights of labor at the local art gallery. I would've been pretty weirded out if he was.)Animal jokes aside, Dandelion is a lovely, very professionally done Korean visual novel aimed at a female audience. I think this may be the first Korean visual novel on Steam, and it's gorgeous, with fully voiced Korean dialogue and English text. I believe you can set the text to Korean as well. There are five different possible love interests you can pursue at the start, though at the beginning I swear it plays more like a pet raising simulator than anything else. Steambuns instead of Nintendogs, right? But no, there's a mystery that slowly begins to unfold--and eventually romance. With people. Human people, I swear. Just ignore the occasional animal ears. Yes, the $30 price tag may seem very steep to a lot of Steam users accustomed to cheaper alternatives, but before brushing it off, try the demo (available on Steam right here: . It doesn't take long to see how much work went into it, and how many visual novels on Steam have extensive voice acting? Not enough! I've only noticed a few small translation errors here and there, but they aren't nearly as common, noticeable, or cringe-worthy as a lot of the freemium VNs' rushed translations on iOS and Android. Overall, the translation is very well done.Hopefully, if Dandelion does well enough on Steam, Cheritz might feel inclined to add Nameless, their latest visual novel set in the same general universe--but with dolls instead of cats and rabbits. Yes, dolls. How can any girl resist?UPDATE after completing all routes, including Jisoo's absolutely TERRIFYING ""bad route"" (totally worth it for the extra CGs!):Yes, I sank 35 hours into Dandelion. Yes, every one of them was worth it. I can't think of another visual novel/dating sim that left me thinking so much after completing it. After completing all 5 routes, make sure to check the bonus content! I was really interested in the mystery behind the story--who left me with these animals and why? The bonus content was the cherry on top of an already delicious sundae--and isn't the cherry sometimes the best part?First, I have to praise the characterization of Heejung. I know most visual novels/dating sims use ""blank slate"" protagonists (sometimes without eyes--creepy!), but Heejung is the most relatable, realistic heroine I've encountered in a while. (I may be biased because I, too, wonder where my mysterious new bruises came from and how expensive it would be to install a TV in my bathroom when I take a bubble bath to raise my beauty and femininity stats in real life.) Who doesn't understand the pressures of ""making it"" and continuously doing things you dread solely to please your parents and loved ones, no matter your culture? Who doesn't fear being left behind? The love interests are fantastic too, and are much more than their archetypes may make them appear at first glance (pretty bunny, baby bunny, snobby bunny, sweet kitty, glutton/pervert kitty), though of course I had favorites. I started with Jihae, whose route seemed like a good one for beginners (just remember to raise some affection with Jieun too!), and ended with Jieun because I was super stubborn about not pursuing a baby bunny. He's a baby! Heejung is a college senior! ...But his route was one of the sweetest and actually had the best ending. Jiwoo's was great too, especially if you've seen as many Korean dramas as I have and can appreciate how the game pokes fun at kdrama clichés. (Those envelopes of money! Candy Cinderella and chaebol romances!)There is a LOT of stat-raising, but if you focus first on raising your Stress/Pressure Relief abilities, that helps a lot, and soon you won't even notice your Stress and Pressure stats raising at all. Make frequent use of Quick Save/Quick Reload if you accidentally poke/show love/feed them fruit in the wrong place (sometimes deliberately...!) and get a bad reaction, or if you can't find the bunny/kitten of your dreams anywhere in the entire apartment.If you're on the fence about getting Dandelion, definitely try the demo first--and then just get it. Unless you really, really hate bunnies and kittens (are you more of a dog and ferret person?), you won't be disappointed.			"

												Let me start by saying that I like this game (obviously, seeing as I clocked 60+ hours on this thing). The various story lines are definitely entertaining with more than one little twist and turn that I honestly wasn't expecting and the characters are surprisingly 3-dimensional despite most of them being cat boys and bunny boys. That's right, ladies; after many long years putting up with the cat girl and bunny girl tropes it is now our turn. But wait, there’s more! Not only do we get eye-candy a plenty, but we also get actual personalities with realistic faults and flaws, (yes, even silver bunny and white bunny have their flaws, though theirs aren't quite as pronounced as the other three's). Even the main character has a personality – or quite possibly a severe mental condition that, in most cases, she manages to overcome without the need for expensive therapy and/or medication (come forth and bear witness to the mighty healing powers of cat/bunny boys!).As for the actual gameplay: It’s pretty much a matter of grinding states to progress the story (mostly by avoiding a bad end). I know some people don’t care much for this aspect, but to be perfectly honest that was one of the main reasons I bought the game (that and Dodger). It does make the game pretty long, I admit, but for me it was kind of cathartic so I don't really see that as much of a downside.BTW: Frequent and blatant abuse of the quick save/load feature is a legitimate part of the game. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.So I would love to recommend this game. I really would. The story was quirky and interesting, the characters were great, the typos(which are regrettably frequent) are sometimes unintentionally hilarious, the weirdness is prevalent (which I quite enjoy), and the 'true ending' that you get after you complete all the rest was just amazing. I totally fangirled all over this game for quite some time (don't judge me), but after the most recent update I can't recommend it anymore.You see, Cheritz seems to have graduated with high honors from both the EA and Blizzard schools of DRM♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥baggery. This is a graphic novel. Albeit, it is a pretty good graphic novel, but there is, nevertheless, no possible need for it to require, REQUIRE, a constant internet connection. And yet for some reason you cannot play this game in Offline Mode; some people can't even play it when they ARE online because of all the other little addendums and bugs that have come with it. Oh you can do the grinding in Offline Mode, but the moment a cutscene comes up you're pretty much screwed. I honestly can't understand what logical reason Cheritz could have for this. I always thought that Steam WAS the DRM, but now even that's not good enough for you guys? Really?I'm sick of it. I really am. This DRM bullcrap is getting into absolutely everything, isn’t it? Even effing graphic novels. Graphic novels, people! But hey, if you don't have a problem with all that and have a flawless internet connection (obviously you do not have the same ISP as I do, lucky) then go for it! It's an enjoyable graphic novel game. I just wish the company would rethink this entire thing and go back to how it was BEFORE the constant connection was necessary. If it ever does I'll change my recommendation and I'd buy their other game, Nameless, in a heartbeat. But, so far, that doesn’t seem likely to happen. Oh well. Guess I’ll just get over it and move on.			"

												Chu~So, I have finally found time to write a review to this wonderful game. Please, don`t look at the playtime displayed in my Steam account. I bought this game almost immediately after its official release on CheritZ, when it wasn`t available on Steam at all and used a special security server to play, and played it for around 6 months (completing all possible character stories, of course).I actually love Dandelion. One of the reasons for it is the main character - Heejung. Even though I never was in the same situation is hers, I still can feel her sorrow and pain. She is not some lifeless female protagonist that we can see in many otome games. She has personality and we can see her developing during the game. If you have heart, you WILL want to make her happy, though the road to happiness for this poor girl is a really difficult one.Now, after I have talked about my main reason to love the game, let`s look in details at what it offers.1)	Characters. There is a lot of different personalities here: timid and dreamy Jieun, tsundere type Jiwoo, dark and ""bad-boy type"" Jisoo, mysterious and level-headed Jihae, charming Jiyeon (whom I started to hate at some point because....well, you need to play the game to understand what he really is). And of course the Wizard, a crazy person who is obsessed with Heejung in some way (or in all ways). There is also Heejae - Heejung`s friend from the university, but he doesn`t play any major role in the story. 2)	Story. This one is quite interesting. As I understood, there are two words – the normal one, where Heejung lives, and the parallel one, where animal-people live. The main two classes mentioned are rabbits and cats: rabbits are royalty and wealthy all in all, and cats suffer from poverty and rabbits` policy. That`s the reason why Jisoo and Jiyeon – the cat-boys - don`t like three other young man (who are rabbits). Developers of the game did quite a good job showing the society of cats and rabbits. As far as the romantic part of the story is concerned, it is also worth mentioning. All male characters are really different and their attitude towards Heejung is different too. Some of them are pretty shocking, to say the least, for example, Jisoo`s one. He scared me at some point. However, I don`t want to write spoilers here, so I can`t add anything else without opening some part of his route. It is also really appealing to me that male characters develop along with the protagonist and that all of them are not what they seemed at first sight. Don`t trust your first impression, dear friends, because it will fail you. Every character is unique, so the game has great replayability. Despite having already completed the game I still decided to start it again in Steam, because it is better than many other otome games, its story is more consistent and it provides something apart from love story. Yes, Heejung has to fall in love with one of them but it doesn`t mean that everything will be in pink colour. There is great social context that will make you think about different things, including how to raise your children (Heejung`s mother is one of the worst possible examples, to say the least).3)	Voices. Something I really liked was that Heejung has her own voice. Yes, she speaks, and I like how she does it. She is emotional and sincere. Male voices are very good too, they suit the characters well and if I have ever to imagine them in real life, I would give them the same ones. Though I should also say that at first I found the language funny, no offense here, people from Korea. It is just so different from Russian, and the way some words are pronounced…that`s fascinating. Nevertheless, I got used to it pretty fast, so there is nothing to complain about.4)	Interface and game mechanics. Both were nice and easy to understand in the non-Steam version of the game, but in Steam it has become even better. I like how the Status of Heejung is shown, I like how simple the stats are that you don`t have to run around the map or house to understand what to do and how to improve the protagonist. Everything is simple and it is good. At the same time I can`t but mention that all this stat raising may become a bit repetitive. By the end of the third route (it was Jisoo`s one, btw) I have already learned by heart what to do and where to go to achieve what I want, so the story is the main feature that makes you want to play, not the process of playing itself. 5) Art and CGs. I love the style all characters are drawn. It`s neither childish nor too realistic. Heejung is not a super model and she never was presented as one, she is just a common young woman who is concerned about her future and current life. It is also worth saying that characters` emotions are well shown with both the art and the voice acting. The CGs are all well-drawn, I can see love of the artists who created them. Some are funny, some are scary, some are mysterious (remember the crazy Wizard?) and some are lovely and romantic. I strongly recommend completing all the routes and opening all CGs, because you will most probably love them. All in all, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you – is worth its money and your time. I do believe that you will like the characters and the plot and that you will not be disappointed with any of the endings. There is no fairytale here, even though it looks like one. But there are actual problems of the real world that Heejung has to face every day. I wish you good game and hope my review will help you in any way. ^^P.S. Don`t forget to complete Bad Endings too, they are more then worth it. As I said before, Jisoo`s one is pretty shocking.			"

												Well, first off, I have to say this is an absolutely beautiful game. If you’re looking for a subpar dating sim, you will have to look elsewhere, because Dandelion is very well put-together and a blast to play. The graphics are very nice and the characters are interesting and adorable in different ways. The stories for the different boys are very cool to learn about over time and the mysterious voice from somewhere is, uh, very mysterious. Very I-don’t-explain-anything-but-I-imply-that-there-is-a-huge-background-here-wink-wink-to-those-who-have-played-the-game-enough. So yeah, very mysterious to me. One of the only issues that I had with it was the typos that popped up sometimes, but overall the translation was well done. They did a very good job of maintaining the sweet, giving nature of Heejung while also revealing her struggles and discontent. She can almost seem too placid, but it is understandable, given her past, and as the game moves forward, she does show signs of a backbone as she comes in to her own (thanks, furry adorableness?), which I whole-heartedly approve of.It takes some time to recognize the voices and names (very creative, Heejung…lots of J’s @_@) but once you do, it becomes very easy to know who is speaking during scenes that don’t show faces. The different colors help and the personalities are so unique from one another that it becomes clear pretty quickly. The stat system is very intensive if you want to buff them all out, but the options are cute and for some of the boys, it’s important to max out your stats as quickly as possible. Just think of it as primping and sketching your way to the top. I actually do enjoy the grind, because the little illustrations are cute and it’s nice to become beautiful just by taking a bath. Unfortunately there have been no side effects in real life.The most important thing that you should keep in mind when playing this game is FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FURRY AND CUTE DO NOT TRY TO GAIN HEARTS FROM ALL OF THEM. You may think, ‘Oh that’d be nice to be friends with all of them! I’ll just hang out with everyone and become a more well-rounded person!’ That is the quickest path to a bad ending, except in a few special cases, which I'm sure you'll figure out after a couple of hours of playing. Yes. I was there. Let me lay out the scene for you:There I was on a different guy’s route, when I thought I would go out on the weekend and have a nice, friendly lunch with Jiwoo, you know? Just two buds hanging out and becoming even better friends. Maybe he’d even stop calling me stupid one day! During lunch, he says something about me feeding him, and being the desperate-for-points-and-new-interactions player I am, I chose the ‘Open wiiiide” option, thinking it was a little weird, but hey, I don’t judge friendships. Then he goes and says something about not dating any other boys. And if I were really Heejung, I would have stopped in my tracks and wondered, ‘You think we’re dating?!?!’ But of course, I am not her, and the game just continued on, unmindful to the fact that it had just rocked my world. When I started the game, I thought that Heejung was very oblivious when it came to boys, which was cute but almost a little much. Now, I know the horrid truth. I am JUST as oblivious and stupid about boys as a main protagonist of a DATING simulator. TT_TTLet’s just say there is one bad ending in particular which is more than a little traumatizing and I couldn’t stop thinking about it last night. On the bright side, they did an excellent job of unobtrusively sliding you into an abusive and very dangerous relationship, with you torn between thinking there is something very wrong, and thinking that it will turn out okay once he calms down. He didn’t calm down. I am still a bit emotionally scarred and I have been hesitant to play his good route (I just need some recovery time…). I recommend you get all the good endings before you try to get the bad endings for completeness—that way you’ll still be able to sleep at night without thinking someone’s going to be hovering over your bed. Following you to the bathroom…not letting you talk to people…scarring the actual player for real…or maybe that’s just me. But, what the heck, do whatever you like! (It’s your funeral)On a completely random side note, I like to pretend that the silver-haired man in the city panoramic scene that pops up once in a while is actually the main protagonist from Persona 4 (just to spice up the scenery for me). Unfortunately, no matter how many times I click on him, he does not become a dateable furball of cuteness. But I can just imagine him as a large darker gray-haired rabbit, majestically lording over everyone in King’s Game. X3 He’d fit right in with Jieun and Jihae!			"

Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is a deep, and well thought out Otome game (visual novel and dating sim) for girls. I spent 31 whopping hours on this baby and unlocked all CGs, memories, stamps, endings, etc (which should indicate how much I enjoyed the game itself). I at least got one hour of entertainment per dollar I spent on this item, especially since I got the two pack (both Dandelion and Nameless) directly from their site. I'll lay out in bulletin form the PROs and CONs.PROs: Beautiful CGs (special scenes pertaining to which route you choose) Voice acted (though not in English) Intriguing characters An entertaining story that is deeper than it first appears 5 Main routes which have their own unique scenesCONs: Typos, misspellings, some grammatical mistakes (But one can easily figure out what they meant, some of this is probably due to the translation process). Some CG body proportions are a bit wonky, but it's not extremely obvious As this is a dating sim, there is a lot of clicking... raising stats, going through the same motions every ""day"" of the game. Some people might find this a tad tedious. (It's not ultra hard core though, like some others and generally the stats you need are decently easy to obtain once you figure out which areas give you which stats).Ending comments: You will not regret money spent on this item, as long as you are a fan of the genre. It's one of my favorites, along with Amnesia and Nameless. "

												Amazing, amazing game. Finished it within 6 or so hours. I sat glued to my chair the whole time. This has been my favorite visual novel so far. With my first playthough being with Jiyeon..I think next time i will go for Jiwoo. It had emotions in it that brought me to tears a few times. Highly recommend this game to anime/visual novel fans. 15/10.			"

												OH MY DEAR SWEET OTOME GOD THIS IS AMAZING! For so very long, even as a girl, I've played dating sims, usually being the guy... but I don't usually expect a good girl version. This was by far the most amazing experience I've ever frickin had! The guys are great (two of which are especially a delicious favorite), one seems adorable but I didn't expect much (BOY did HE ever surprise me!!), and one hard to get but one of the most considerate by the end... the last... uh... just goes to show you shouldn't always trust a cute face but... it was almost too hot to pass up by the end lol The art and transitions are beautiful, the story is in depth, and it even seems to make more sense if you play all the scenarios. That and you get quite involved in raising your stats which matter a lot. The opening theme is seriously AMAZING to listen to. Do NOT pass this up! This is clearly on top of the otome list!			"

												I'm so happy I bought this game, which I didn't expect in when I actually started out.I found this game through a playthrough on youtube and they ended up taking a lot of breaks so I just wanted to know what happend myself and I'm very glad I ended up doing so.Apart from the few translation/spelling errors there really were no issues for me, at the start the resolution did bother me as I couldn't see any option to change it. But the storyline quickly made me forget about that.If you're a bit like me, or just to be safe, I'd recommend keeping some tissues at hand. Since you spend so much time with Heejung and the boy of choice, you can really start bonding with them. I'd say one storyline can range from 4-6 hours depending if you decide to skip some things you've already seen if you're replaying the game with a different boy. The cutscenes at the start are mostly the same if I remember correctly.I'd also like to mention that the art and music are really beautiful together with the storyline.I really recommend this game to anyone that considers it!

												Let's start with the few not so good things:1. This game has typos (however, it is not all over the place and maybe if we ask Steam nicely enough, they'll fix it.)2. It is a stat based game (I can see this being a potential turn off)3. It costs 29.99 (however, it is cheaper than some other dating games, like the 70.00 stuff from Japan)Now let's get on to the good stuff,1. Hot guys.2. Multiple different endings.3. Actual plot.4. Fairly deep characters.5. Really hot guys.Other stuff you might want to know:This game is long. You will definitely get your money's worth of hours in this game.It is hard, as mentioned earlier, it is a stat game and you might be a bit doomed without the help of the internet. This is very different from dating the pigeons.			"

												Dandelion was one of the first games I have bought on Steam. Not only the art is amazing, but the story is really good. I’ve cried during all my playthroughs (except on the “chicken ending”. That guy is pushy and annoying), especially on Jiyeon’s route.But Jiwoo is definitely my favorite. I found his personality unique, and he’s the kind of “to hate or to love” character. Possibly one of the best male characters I’ve seen on a otome game so far. I really wish that Cheritz would make a sequel. The status raising can be annoying sometimes tho. But after a while you’ll get used to it.10/10, worth all the tears.			"

												First off, this is not an EVN. Dandelion was made by a South Korean company called Cheritz and it was released in Korean before English. The company is very good about the fact that there is not a long wait between when the Korean version comes out and when the English version comes out. Also they have another game called Nameless (please put it on Steam), and I hope they release many more games. Also I played this game before it got on Steam, so my play time is not very long, but I hope to fix that during my next school break. By the way, I love Cheritz. One, they make amazing games and they release them in English. Two, they have character good that you can order from their store. They do not have too much Dandelion stuff in their store, but hopefully they will add some more since the game got on Steam.Second, this is an otome game with five guys that are pursuable. Supposedly you can also end up with your classmate, but I have yet to do this. There is no yuri route. This is not a pure visual novel game; it does have a stat raising part to it. The art of the characters and the CGs are amazing and top quality. I would say that the CGs are as good as Starry Sky, Hakuoki, Sweet Side, and Dramatical Murder. The backgrounds during the gameplay are not as good, but they are better than your typical visual novel that you see released in English. The test is in English, but the voices are in Korean, which I love Korean so I think it is great. Not everything is voiced, but the main parts are. I think the voice acting is great, but I don’t know Korean, so I probably am not the best judge of that. Is it worth $30? YES, YES, YES!!!You play as a 21 year old girl named Hee-Jung, who is an art student at a university. Fairly quickly you find out she has an inferiority complex stemming from issues with her mother and the fact that her mother never considers what Hee-Jung is doing is good enough. I found this game very relatable considering I am a girl in college, who picked her major based off what her parents wanted, and I pretty much hate my major now. In another aspect Hee-Jung reminds me of someone who has depression, so she is not a happy go lucky heroine, and I feel that she is more realistic than some of the other main characters in other otome games that I have played. She doesn’t seem to have many friends, except for this guy (sorry I forgot his name) in her art club who obviously likes her, so Hee-Jung does not have much to do besides school and her art project. Which as a college student in a time consuming major, I find this to be very accurate. It’s also apparent that Hee-Jung feels lonely.How the story begins is that Hee-Jung come home one day to find a basket with a black cat, an orange cat, a spotted hare, a silver rabbit, and a white rabbit on her doorstep. All of these animals are just peacefully chilling, and not fighting, which is really odd. She can not bring herself to get rid of them, so she decides to keep them. Hee-Jung names the black cat, Jisoo, the prange cat, Jiyeon, the silver rabbit, Jihae, the white rabbit, Jieun, and the spotted hare, Jiwoo. For the first portion of the game you do various things like studying or taking a bath in different rooms to increase your mood or grades. By looking at the map, you can see where all the animals are. If an animal is in a room that you are doing something in then you may get to interact with that animal also. This usually increases your relationship with the animal. Also you can talk to, give gifts to, and touch the animals. Be careful on the touching because if you touch the animal in the wrong place then you may lose relationship points. After a certain point you actually get to the point where Hee-Jung actually figures out that every animal is actually a guy, who can switch between the two forms (surprise if you hadn’t figured that out yet). So no, this game is not like Hatoful Boyfriend, the guys are not actually animals. By the end of the first section, you are more or less on one guy’s route, which is determined by which animal you became closest to. This doesn’t mean you can not interact with the other guys. In fact you can make some characters jealous by hanging out with the others more than him. In the second part of the game, the focus is more on going out with dates with your desired guy, and raising up the stat that goes with him. On dates you can collect stickers of the guy you are out with, which unlock extra content from the extras section on the main menu. By the end of the game Hee-Jung has grown and become a strong character.Be warned the characters do have good endings and bad endings. To be completely honest, the good endings are bittersweet, and they will stay with you for a long time. The feels you get from the good endings are amazing and indescribable, so I hope you experience them yourself.SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!The magician is the guy who sent the animals to Hee-Jung, and created the whole ‘game’ that keeps getting mentioned. Each guy made a deal with the magician to try to get Hee-Jung to love him, and in return the Magician would grant the guys wish. Pro: guy gets wish granted. Con: Guy falls in love with Hee-Jung, but ends up forgetting her after his wish is granted. He doesn’t completely forget her, but he doesn’t really remember what he is missing, and this is what causes the bittersweet endings. Towards the end after the guy has won the ‘game’, the Magician is allowed to actually meet Hee-Jung (he has a very pretty CG), and this is the only time that the Magician ever gets to interact with her. It is hinted at that the Magician is in love with Hee-Jung, and is constantly creating alternate realities (or rewinding time) back at the beginning of the game, so that he can keep meeting her over and over again. In a way Hee-Jung, ends up with every guy. This is speculation, but I like this interpretation. Also the Magician guy supposedly pops up in Nameless also. "

												UPDATE: After a software update, the game will not let you continue if you are not online. That is a ridiculous restriction due to DRM. Being online does not enhance gameplay at all. Although this game is a wonderful game, I cannot recommend it as it stands. I paid for this game so shouldln't I be able to decide when I can play it and not because it can arbitrarily connect to the servers? Steam itself puts DRM in place so this additional layer by Cheritz doesn't not seem to be needed. Since I travel a lot internet is not always available. The game will repeatedly say it is not connected to the internet so it cannot continue. This is pervasive enought that I have to change my previous yes recommendation to a no recommendation. In addition, I no longer intend to buy their next title because of this issue. No use wasting good money on a game that will not function in offline mode. I think Cheritz should beware of alienating their customers just to put their DRM in place. This kind of thing is becoming more prevalent especially with the big companies such as EA and Ubisoft who are getting reviews based on their cr*ppy DRM software rather than the quality of the game and that is just sad.Previous review when I actually recommended the game.The art is beautiful and bright and the story line for each character is different and very interesting. Because of how much I enjoyed this game, This game is a bit heavy on the stat leveling, which may or may not be your thing. I personally had no objection to it but I did take a peek at the walkthrough available in the community forum to get some initial help. I think the game itself could have a small explanation section for people who are new to this genre and stat leveling in general. But gameplay can be figured out without it.  I thought the conversations with the characters during activities were very entertaining. The main character well presented, interesting and voiced.			"

												Dandelion covers the story of Heejung who is a very studious young adult lady who spends most of her time attempting to become the ideal well-rounded student... but it's not what she really wants. She's pulled ahead by the invisible guide that her strict mom has set for her in life, but if you asked her what she wanted herself she wouldn't know what to say. To an otome game regular, I thought she was a refreshing heroine who is quite relatable and strongly written, which can be a rarity in otome games sometimes. Her troubles form an important part of the story and I found it interesting how she ended bonding with the datable cast and changing along with them.Not everything in Dandelion is played straight and all the guys have hidden secrets for you to discover throughout the game, which adds an interesting dimension to what may seem like a silly stat-raising game where you date animal boys. That being said, the story is fairly well-written in terms of depth of character, but keep in mind that this is a game meant for dating pretty boys at heart. You may not find this game to be entertaining if you don't like said pretty boys. Ahem.Anyway, it's difficult to explain the charms of the game without spoiling the story, so I'll try summarizing briefly the different points:♡ Charming and non-intrusive BGM♡ Attractive and stylish art♡ The translation is surprisingly good, though the prose may not be everyone's cup of tea♡ Solid game design and system lacking bugs♡ Relatable conflict and emotional character developments♡ Full voice acting (heroine included!)What you may find to be drawbacks, however, are:X Prose not as strong as, say, an original English visual novel (but don't let that fool you, it's not like it's unreadable, but don't expect a flawless example of the height in literature)X There is some awkward anatomy in the art, but I wouldn't say it's overwhelming and it's generally fairly solid.X Long sessions of stat-raising with very little to break the melancholy once you've satisfied the stat requirements. ---(The stat-raising system can be repetitive after a while but it is fully functional. I think this may be preferable to those who dislike the long sessions of reading a straight visual novel may require or those who are new to the genre altogether.Even if you dislike the stat-raising system, I'd say it's worth trucking through anyway if you would like the story. Keep in mind that the story has more meat on it than you may glean from the description provided, but  you can scratch the surface by playing the demo. I think that will provide you with at least the bare bones to determine if trudging through the stat-raising system to enjoy the story is worth it or not for you.)X Unexpected character developments you may not be pleased with (never without proper justification, though)X It's very easy to get lost without a walkthrough, though it is possible to get through if you're willing to make mistakes (which will sacrifice you much time unless you remember to create individual saves often).I'd recommend this game to those who will form an attachment to the characters because this is one of the game's strengths, those who can enjoy stories that aren't all sunshine and don't feel that stories that will not provide full  closure are weaker for it. ---(Cheritz has always been ambiguous but I don't consider it to be a weakness. Their strength lies in the characters and their relatable conflicts and not the clean tying of knots for a satisfying ending, so to speak.)If you're none of these, I can't really guarantee your full enjoyment of the game. In my own opinion, the game had many lovely moments though I couldn't come to like every character. Cheritz didn't fail to make it generally clear why they were the way they were, however. I strongly suggest playing the demo to have a taste of the stat-raising system because it really is a large part of the game and  the padding to express the passage of time. If you can't stand it, it will be hard to play because it's an unavoidable area. On the other hand, I know many who chose to play despite disliking stat-raising, myself being one of them. I found going through the stat-raising I usually abhor to read the story to be worth it in the end. Cheers.			"

												Downloaded this game due to a gameplay short I saw of Cryoatic and Dodger however I didnt want to ruin the storyline or gameplay so downloaded it myself for a second viewing. Only played for 9 hours so far however am loving the game play so funny and creative plotline, I began with Jieun who was really adorable and with a touching back story of my prince and his ending made me very happy to find out more. Cant wait to play through all the charaters and find out more to do with this 'WIZARD' which I hope is even Heejun or her dad .... it all is very intreging. I'm loving this			"

												After a bit of hard work and a lot of mouse clicking, I've finally finished all the routes, and have seen the Wizard ending. I cannot say enough good things about this game, honestly! The overarching plot, as well the individual routes, are such good examples of how to get your players emotionally invested in the stories of these boys. So invested that even someone as lazy as me is willing to through excruciatingly long bouts of stat building just so I can see the endings. Even the mean boys have hearts, lemme tell you. I'd definitely reccomend this game to anyone who loves Visual Novels! Truly an experience.PROS:- Great plot and storytelling- Well developed characters- Amazing art and art style- Expressive voice acting- Easy to navigate interface- Lots of possible dialogue with all the characters.CONS:- Translation is wonky in some places- Typos everywhere- Tedious amounts of monotonous state building.

												At first, I liked Heejung. But the more I played, the less I liked her. In the end, she just got on my nerves. She was much too weak of a character for me—though I acknowledge others may like her.I finished four of the five routes (mostly on an old steam account...long story), and felt sort of “meh” about them overall. I know everyone’s got their opinions on whose story/personality/ending was better (and I do, too), but I felt like all of them were pretty superficial and left a fair amount unexplained and unresolved. The daily stats building was tedious, especially after the first playthrough. And some of the typos/mistakes were distracting. I can handle typo or translation issues here or there—but there were mix ups with the characters names.I won’t even comment on the aspects of the stories that I found problematic (because I’m sure some of this is cultural and/or personal). I will, however, say that I typically can overlook some of these things and still have an enjoyable game experience. I wanted to like this game. I tried. But, in the end, the stories and characters (which is what I play for), just aren’t worth it—especially not with a $20+ pricetag.			"

I’ve clocked in like at least 40 hours into it. (Steam claims I haven’t touched the thing but that’s because the version I’ve been playing is directly from Cheritz. I bought this game a year or two ago and I still play it from time to time because of how enamored I am with some of the characters! Tsun-tsun bun is best bun. c:)			"

												This isn't a terrible game, it's just pretty ""meh,"" and for the price, that makes it one I can't recommend. This is a stat management game (think Tokimeki series) where you choose different daily activities that affect the main character's intelligence, stress, etc, to build your appeal for the love interests, with the slightly novel spin that  interactions with the love interests occur based on choosing rooms of your house they currently occupy (because they are literally your pets and live with you) and engaging in particular activities in those rooms. You can also choose to hang out with a particular love interest on the weekends and there are cut scenes that trigger based on date and level of affection with that person. It's a solid setup of this type of game. But the interactions with the male characters feel pretty shallow and disjointed; and after a while they become really repetitive too. I can understand the male characters' motivations to a certain extent, and won't get into them for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but it feels like you're kind of forcing the protagonist into a relationship that never seems to pick up steam. It's like you're friends, and there's no romance, and then bam, suddenly you're supposed to be downright Shakespearean. The ending I received was the only part where it finally felt engrossing, but it took hours of mostly boring repetitive gameplay to get there. I know repetition is the stock and trade of these types of stat building games, but you truck through them for the little rewards you get when you interact with a love interest or get a cut scene. The problem here is that those rewards did not feel...rewarding, so the stat building just ends up feeling like a slog. The storyline I chose also suffered from the same type of borderline absuive relationship that makes Amnesia a dubious choice--as in, anyone can see this guy is actually a major chode and you'd tell your best friend to run screaming from him if she was dating him in real life. And yet you kind of have to force the kind, shy, unassuming heroine down that road to get anywhere in the story.All in all, it was an okay diversion for a day, and you might consider picking it up if you have the money to spend and are just curious. But it's not something I'm interested in playing again, certainly not through all the routes-- which is a shame because there is an overarching plot that seems like the completionist playthrough could be really interesting. I'm just not willing to slog through several more hours of stat building for flat cut scenes and bad relationships to find out.			"

												This game had a compelling story that kept me wanting to play on and on. It is definitely one of the best contenders in the visual novel/dating sim genre. There are some things to be aware if though, which I will be addressing in the cons section of my review.Pros+ Each of the characters are supremely unique and have interesting backstories. I've completed the routes for each of the guys, and each guy turned out to be more than what meets the eye. All the characters have positive & negative sides to them, and they each come with some surprises.+ The art is gorgeous! I love a game that will take the time to show you some of the pivotal scenes drawn out, and this game does it awesomely! If you look through the screenshot collection on Steam, you will easily see that the story doesn't skimp on engaging cut scenes with wonderful pictures.+ I *felt* a lot during the game. I really did empathize with what was going on. You can't go wrong with a game that gets your heat invested.+ The voice acting was a great touch! Even though it was in Korean, I loved being able to hear the emotion behind what the characters were saying. + The stat system felt balanced. The stats you needed were different for each character, and I did find myself having to pay attention to make sure I was on track. It added a challenging element to the game without it making it feel bogged down.+ The game is VERY replay friendly! I've spent over 30 hours playing and I haven't even gotten all the endings yet. Every romance route is different and enchants you in ways.Cons- You unexpectedly run into some uncomfortable stuff in this game. Some of the guys get extremely verbally abusive, posessive, physically violent, and stalker-ish. I did fine with it, but just beware - if you are triggered by any of these things, you might want to look up a walkthrough beforehand and avoid certain routes.- This is kind of spoiler-y, but whatever: Jieun's route was BORING. Like... why include this dude as a romance option if the entire time he's just gonna be like ""lol i'm too young though."" I felt more like I was being his babysitter and it was weird. I know plenty of people loved his story, but I thought it couldn't hold a candle to the other stories. That can be up for you to decide though.In short: If you like anime dating sims and can appreciate some upscale art, definitely give this a shot. The majority of the romance routes will tug at your heart, but prepare yourself - the stories WON'T be all rainbows and butterflies.			"

												Knowing that this game was about bunny and cat boys, I significantly underestimated this game. This is an incredible dating sim, and while the plot may be cheesy, as it should be, and the main character may be completely oblivious, I found myself drawn into and emotionally moved by the story. My only complaint is that it takes too long for the animals to turn into boys, but the wait is worth it.			"

												Very nice VN. It has a really cute concept, and I personally think it was presented well. The art is great, and the characters look and feel like adults. The characters and story also seem like they're better developed than in most VNs, and that's refreshing. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. 25 hours in; no regrets. Still need to go through and play one more character's path, then get the bad endings. There are a couple typos, but given the infrequency of such and the overall quality of the game, I'd say they're not a problem. I'd still go back and buy the game again. I definitely, hands down, recommend this to people who enjoy VNs.			"

												Edited version of review:If you look at the time that I (sadly) wasted playing this game, you may think that I've enjoyed it that much, but that isn't even close to truth. I think I just tried to justify the amount of money that I spend on ""Dandelion"". Either way, I finished all the routes and gained all the extras and pretty much did everything there was to be done. Conclusions?It's not good. Really. Not for this price, that's for sure. Good stuff Game is long. I guess it could be treated as both good and bad thing, since it depends on whether you enjoy it or not. Take into account that you will spend most time raising stats and not having any scenes that moves plot forward, but if you don't mind that, this game offers lengthy gameplay.Beautiful graphic. CGs, backgrounds, characters, everything looks good.Original idea. Whether you are weirded out by the concept of dating your pets after their transform into humans (I know I am), the concept definietely had its potential. There is an intruiging backstory that could easily be so much more that it ended up being. I also like the fact that protagonist  re-live each route as sort of different-dimension thing .Extras. Unclockables, additional scenes, gallery - it's all there.Bad stuffToo high price for the quality. For the game that offers more in terms of stat raising than actual story, has LOW RESOLUTION (!), two  abusive  characters, bland protagonist and poorly developed plot, that's really huge price. You will find much better visual novels for half of it.Promising potential, bad execution. The story could be so much more, but end up being so little.Not enough plot-related scenes. With this amount of grinding (I can't call it any other way), I don't want to see the same ""little encounter"" with the same outcome every God damn time I'm doing certain activity. This games is a true borefest when you wait FOREVER until something actually important happens.Protagonist is bad. She's bland and boring, very schematic. There is absolutely nothing interesting about her. She's portrayed as classic, shy, not-speaking-much girl, but really, that's all there is to her. Nothing behind the curtain, nothing to discover, not even a bit of charisma. And don't get me wrong, I don't mind shy and calm characters, I'm like that myself, but ""shy and calm"" doesn't mean boring. Oh, and stupid. I'm sorry, but Heejuing is just plainly dumb and she acts like she doesn't have her own will. She allows to do boys whatever they want to do with her. And she acts like a victim. ALWAYS. It's so tiring, especially since she doesn't have really good reasons for it. I mean, sure, she has bad situation with her mother, that has high expectations and she aims for perfection, don't know how to relax and so on, and so forth, but she lives alone, she as all the possibilities and, at some point, she also have help of her... animals *cough*. There are far worse things that happens to people and they deal with it without constant victim-mask. I wouldn't even mention that, since I think everyone has the right to deal with their problems in their own way, but her ""hard life"" is an important aspect, since this is why important character becomes fascinated with her.Music. Out of place, doesn't fit the mood of the scenes, gets annoying really quickly.~ * ~RoutesJi.ssoo  I felt like he was supposed to be ""main"" love interest, since he had very expanded path and was often important character on other routes. He is super annoying and jealous. He's the type that could do nasty stuff and then find the reason to justify them by saying protagonist that it's all her fault, that she can't meet with other boys (even before they have anything romantic going on), she can't have friends, she pretty much can't do anything related to other male. He made a jealous scene in the middle of the street and he wasn't even dating the protagonist at that time! I seriously have enough of this types of characters, I won't even mention his bad end. Jihae  Silent and shy, typical knight on white horse, he's personal story wat interesting, but the route itself wasn't particularly engaging. Jiwoo Always repeats that protagonist is stupid and he is painfully right. This is the most interesting path, because only here, protagonist actually make a move herself and does not act like she needs to be guided every step of the way. Jiyeon  Character with a ""twist"", but not very interesting and not well executed. Selfish and rude, with him Heejung is even bigger victim than usual which makes him unbearable. Jieun  Weird. Just weird. "

												*This review is based off of the version of Dandelion directly from dl.cheritz.com. This is why Steam only claims I have played this game for a few hours.*Basic plot: A college student, Heejung, is living alone in her apartment. The influence of her overbearing mother forces Heejung to frequently second guess herself. To add onto her worries, Heejung wakes up one day to find a basket of five animals next to her bed. She questions where they came from but accepts them as her own after a week or so. Now she must take care of five animals and manage her college expenses. Things only get more complicated when they turn into humans.The Gameplay: This game is classified as a visual novel but is more of a stat raising game with visual novel elements. The player must focus on raising their relationships with each of the available suitors while maintaining high femininity, art, and beauty. However, the stress and pressure levels must remain low. Doing activities such as going to work or taking a shower will change the stat levels. The key is to find a balance as to what activities raise the most stats while raising the stress and pressure levels as little as possible.Each suitor has stats that they prefer. Some have lower standards, while other have higher standards. If the requirements are met within a certain period, usually 1-2 months, an event will occur. Unlike other visual novels where the player picks different options to make an event occur, the stat raising activates the event. When an event occurs, there are no text options to make. I felt that the stat raising element was a nice change from the other visual novels I have played. Having to watch my stats kept my interest and made it hard to stop playing the game.There are even collectible stamps. When you get enough of them for each character, it unlocks bonus content.The Characters:I feel that the character development is one of the best parts of the game. The stat raising game play allows close interaction with each of the characters. The characters are confined to one house most of the time so the player is forced to interact with each. There are not a lot of events for each character, maybe seven or so. That means that whenever an event occurs, something important is bound to happen. I commend Cheritz for creating characters with faults. For most visual novels, the heroine seems to be either perfect while the options have faults or vice versa. In this game, both the heroine and the characters have problems. This, added together with the stat raising actions, gives the game a sense of relatability.The Voice Acting: Each voice matched the characters perfectly. I have no complaints. The voice actors of the cats even meowed; that is dedication at its’ finest.The Music: The background music often sounds like elevator music, but surprisingly, that is not a bad thing. The music matches the calmness of a house or a stroll around the park. As a whole, the soundtrack is very happy. There are only a few songs for perilous situations, the rest are very calming. I really liked the OP song as well.The Art:The artists for the game are absolutely amazing. I am assuming that the CG artist and the sprite artist are different people since the CG’s look different than the sprites. However, the CG’s still look beautiful. The backgrounds stay consistent from behind the sprite to the background of a CG in the same room. The interface is drawn to look like a notebook and has very cute flowers and drawings throughout.Positive Aspects:Here is a list of some of the best qualities of Dandelion.-All of the characters have distinct personalities; none of the characters are alike.-The art is consistent.-The music matches the scene.-Having to raise stats keeps the player engaged.-Having the characters live together forces the characters to form relationships. These relationships are explored throughout each route, stay consistent, and add to character development.-Players of both genders could enjoy the game.-The main character is not a ‘wall flower’. -The main character develops alongside the suitors. Heejung changes for the better as the game progresses.-The game has ‘collectibles’ that the player can hunt for on dates.-The opening theme song is amazing.-The primary bad endings made sense for each character given their personalities.Bad Aspects: Here is a list of minor complaints.-To get the best end for one of the characters, another character must like you a decent amount as well. The game fails to make this obvious. I was half way through the route before I realized I was on a bad path that I could not fix.-There was no true route for Heejae. -One character is significantly harder to satisfy. Some people, like me, may do his route first and fail a lot. If you are like me, playing his route first makes the other routes extremely easy.-It was never clearly stated that the game ends in  about a year. It only shows signs of ending a month before the game actually ends. For their first route, players will probably be scrambling at the end, reloading past saves just to raise their stats high enough by the end of the month.-It is not always clear what option is considered the best on dates.-Some of the character’s required stat levels did not make sense when you take their personality traits into account. (I cannot explain this further without spoiling anything).-The translation had minimal errors; Jisoo’s route seemed to have the most errors and the ‘Special’ menu’s ‘back to title’ button was still in Korean. Otherwise, the translation was pretty good. Aspects that will be good to some but bad to others:-Since the options are living with the player and are treated as pets in the beginning, it takes a while for any romance to start. -Events are caused by raising stats instead of dialogue options.-All routes connect to each other in some way.-All of the endings except for maybe one ended abruptly. The endings are left to interpretation.-The ability to quick save at almost any time makes the game really easy to get collectibles and items to sell. This also makes it really easy to pick the proper responses on dates.-The game focuses on character development as opposed to plot. -All of the plots are connected, so the player may be confused during their first play through.Final Thoughts: I really enjoyed this game and would highly recommend it. All of the characters had distinct personalities and I liked the stat-raising. Sadly, I wound up playing the hardest route first, and then found out how to raise each stat really easily. This caused the rest of the routes to go by really slowly since my stats were already so high; I had nothing to do between events. However, this did allow me to get the collectible stamps with ease. I disagree with the people who feel that this game is difficult. The game takes time to get used to, but with the ability to quick save almost everywhere, learning what raises what and finding items on dates is really easy. Also, people complain that the stat raising gets monotonous; I disagree with that as well. Once you learn what to do, you can raise Heejung’s stats so fast that it does not feel monotonous for too long. After going through one route, raising Heejung’s stats becomes easier.There is no clear order to play the routes in, but I would recommend one of two orders:Play Jieun, then Jihae, then Jiwoo or Jiyeon, then JisooOrPlay Jisoo, then Jiwoo or Jiyeon, then Jihae, then JieunEither way, make sure that either Jisoo or Jieun is first or last and that you play Jihae near when you play Jieun. As you can guess, their routes go together. I would recommend order two over order one if you want to go by story since Jieun’s route is completely different from every other route. However, if you want an easy play through, go with order one.			"

												This game is one of the few dating sim games I can whole heartly say that I loved from begining to end. And apologies for a disorientated review not very good at keeping track of things. First thing I want to say is that I loved the fact they added the voices on during dialogues it gave the characters much more to their personality and their feelings during the conversations.I liked how differen't each and one character was and their development during the story.The bonus chapter explained some of questions that might have occured during the game play(at least the ones I was wondering about) "

												From the makers of Mystic Messenger comes every woman's dream to date her cats.In this fun and quirky game you are given the option to give your affections to one of three rabbit-men or one of two cat-men. And these animal men are just that- otherworldly mammals sent to your apartment by a mysterious figure in animal form, only to turn into brooding men with animal ears. The different paths, while nothing revolutionary, are that lovely mix of heartwarming, aggrivating, sweet, and bizarre, with each character being an individual full of surprises. The gameplay itself relies on a lot of grinding between cutscenes, which is my main reservation about the game. The interface is fine, although it could be integrated a bit more smoothly. Music is charming, graphics are cute, and so on. Each path from the beginning to the longest ending takes 3-5 hours, so possible to complete in a session or two.Overall, however, the game is cute and charming if a bit weird.			"

												While I loved the story itself, and the characters quite a bit, I often was bored with it... Every single day, stress and pressure went up. Everyday, you had to choose what you wanted to do. Everyday, you can only do ONE THING (even though in real life you'd be able to do lots) and you have to decide which skill to increase or decrease, or to go out on a date. The last 3 months of each character's story, I would just SLEEP or go on a date if it was the weekend. I wanted it to be over quickly by that point, because picking something to do everyday gets old fast.That being said... Only 2 characters really interested me, even after playing all the routes and getting all good and bad endings. The art's cute, story is good, characters are too predictable, and the grinding is a pain.			"

												I wanted to take the time and write a review of this game. I had originally bought this game through the publisher's website, a very long time ago. And played a good 12+ hours of this game. Its a game that is so fascinating , amazing it is  truely hard to put down. Everything about it, just captivates the player, I've played all the routes, and I have cried too many tears, and laughed so many times while playing this game. I even fell so much in love with it, to the point I even started Cosplaying from it. I could relate with the heroine. Without giving away spoilers, she is so down to earth, and is facing the same challenges that us students face all the time. Which is why it is so easy to relate to her, to the point that in moments of scenes between the love interest and her, you belive for a moment that you are the one expierencing it. By far one of the most amazing games I have ever played. Now that its on Steam , I can't wait to start it all over again, and get all the endings for each route. Amazing Storyline, and very attractive Love interests, makes your heart skip a beat a couple of times . :3			"

												This is easily one of the best games I have ever played - definitely worth the money. Each character has a unique and interesting personality, as well as a well developed back story. Not to mention, the story itself is really interesting. As far as replayability goes, this is a game that is easily replayed over and over. Each path has it's own collection of cutscenes, so it keeps the story fresh and there is a skip option so you can speed through scenes you've already seen. So far, I've completed the game twice with two different paths and I'm still excited to play again. This game is full of feels too. Mechanically, it plays well too. The inclusion of a quick save button is helpful in making sure you achieve the interactions and results that you're striving for. But there's also plenty of room to explore the details of the game so you can learn the best way to get what you want. Since most paths have both a good and bad ending, if you mess up, it's not a big deal. You can just replay and go for a different ending.Some of the English translation is a little rough sometimes, but it's still understandable and doesn't take away from the quality of the game. Plus, the characters all have a voice actor that can be turned on or off - granted, they say the lines in Korean, but I think it's a nice touch to hear the emotion behind the lines. There's also a nice inclusion of CG and artwork for the different characters that you can look at and a couple that you can unlock for each character.All in all, this is a wonderful game and I definitely recommend checking it out.

												I finished playing Nameless and I liked it so much that I bought Dandelion since both games were made by the same company. First, I’m just going to say this game is not worth $30. Translation: I bought the game knowing there were translation issues but I can't recommend something that cost money and is not properly spell checked. Visuals: are mediocre. The stills are decent and I've seen worse but I've definitely seen better.Characters: Heejung is very relatable and I like her as the female character. The guys are the typical stereotypes but they’re likeable.  Music: is forgetful and gets a bit grating at times; especially in between events when your finger starts burning from clicking so much during stat raising.Stat mechanic: This is what killed the game for me. It’s the first otome game that I’ve played which used this mechanic and it’s a monotonous chore. I’ve learned that I absolutely hate it. It took me 16 hrs. to do my first route which was with Jisoo. I had to restart 3 times because of stat mismanagement. You have to save and reload constantly and pray the RNG gods give you the item or character placement you need.My main problem with grindy stat raising is when the story finally progressed, any attachment I might have started forming with the guy character was gone. The story itself had too much repeated dialogue. The only variations in each new playthrough were in bite sized sections which came with each new guy. And like I said, by the time those finally rolled around I no longer had any emotional attachment to their individual stories.			"

												I feel really bad for downvoting Dandelion. I really want to like it, and I sank so much time into it so I can get all of the routes and the graphics that go with them. But the more I think about it, this game just wasn't all that fun and the story wasn't too great either. It's not a badly-made game for sure; the music is good, the art is beautiful, the voice acting is very well done, the English translation is solid, and the guys you get to date aren't too terrible. Unfortunately though, I think the place where this game is weakest is in its story and characters, which are the most important things in a visual novel. Every single character in this game ends up being shallow, bland, and forgettable --- some worse than others. I didn't feel particularly emotionally attached to any of them. Most of your interactions with them consist of...going places together once a week and watching some pre-set dialogue that mostly consists of small talk. That just seems like the shallowest way to develop characters and relationships in terms of a visual novel. There are also some routes where almost nothing at all happens, leading to a very empty experience overall. The romances aren't well developed and you don't really spend much my time getting to know any of the characters. I also personally didn't like the setup that  the boys are forced to date you in some crazy game set up by a wizard so they can get their wishes granted. I just thought it made the whole dating thing even more forced than it already was and made a couple of the boys seem like selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Other reviewers have pointed out that many of these relationships would be considered unhealthy or dysfunctional and that the heroine overall comes across as being too weak and passive, and I can certainly see where they're coming from. I know that there's a level of cultural differences and personal likes/dislikes at play here, I know that a game can be enjoyable regardless of whether or not the relationships portrayed are 100% perfectly healthy (I thought Magical Diary and Hatoful Boyfriend were super great for crying out loud)...But, I still just didn't care for it and I can see why others wouldn't either, so it's worth pointing it out at least.  Then there's also the fact that the heroine has to get amnesia at the end of a route in order for her to ever see the boy she dated again after he gets his WISH GRANTED FROM A CREEPY♥♥♥♥♥WIZARD WHOSE MAGIC WORKS OFF OF LOVE AND HER DUDE GOES BACK TO HIS WEIRD RABBIT/CAT KINGDOM DIMENSION AGAIN AND JESUS GOD IT SOUNDS SO WEIRD AND DUMB WHEN I PUT IT LIKE THAT but yeah her decision to do so is about as stupid and frustrating as it sounds, though at least Jieun's route (the young albino rabbit) didn't do that, so that was a nice change of pace. So basically all of the routes are pretty much just angst, boredom, and frustration and not much else. I will admit though that Jiwoo's route (the blonde rabbit guy) was probably the most interesting/enjoyable since both he and the heroine get some character development and have a bit more natural interactions. And of course, most of this game is stats management. The stats barely have an impact on the game, but they take up most of your time, so the game ends up feeling a lot like a chore. There's also the fact that it takes FOREVER for your regular ol' rabbits and cats to turn into dudes (Hell, I think their bonding with the heroine was more compelling when they WERE animals because of how much she brightened up and started to find joy and meaning in her sad and empty life through her pets, which is what many people do experience in real life). Even more frustrating is the fact that you have to start the game from the very beginning for each route if you want to unlock the character graphics, but at least you can start pressing the skip button then. My overall thoughts on Dandelion is that it's not a bad game, but it's not a great or fun game either. I honestly think this game way too overhyped; take away the art and the voice acting and you don't have much else left in this game that's worthwhile, especially for such a steep price tag (I understand why it's such a high price, obviously games take a lot of time, effort, and money to make, especially when there's gorgeous art, voice-acting, and multilingual translations, but the product still felt like a waste of my time due to its shallow and boring content). It just fell so short of the amazing and compelling game I thought it would be. You'd probably be better off just buying Cheritz's other game, Nameless, which still has the beautiful art and voice acting, but has a more compelling story and characters in just its demo than Dandelion has in 60 hours worth of gameplay.

												Dandelion ~ Wishes Brought to You ~ is a visual novel otome game that is (obviously) targeted for the female audience. It looks like your typical shoujo reverse harem otome game, which it is to some extent. The plot, however, is outstanding with a slice of life genre.Let's start with the heroine. Heejung is your typical college student who is struggling to keep up with society and her family's pressure to be constantly perfect (good grades, looks, and social life), even though she is still not aware what she really wants to do with her life. It also doesn't help that her family is quite dysfunctional and somewhat a bit emotionally abusive to her.Her bleak and stressful life takes a turn, however, when one day, she wakes up to find these animals in a basket beside her bed.First part of the game is spent raising your affection to the animal you will potentially romance later on. Yes, I said animal. Don't worry, they will turn into humans (or part-humans?) later on in the game. You get to pick one guy out of five: Jihae (the prettiest one), Jisoo (the bad boy type), Jiwoo (tsundere), Jiyeon (cutesy type), and Jieun (the quiet type). You are able to raise your affection on multiple guys but if you’ve played otome games before, surely you’re aware what happens when you do that. For the remainder of the game, you focus on raising your stats and affection for the guy you choose in order to get the good(?) ending.The game itself remains sweet, cute, and innocent but deals with a lot of real life (and relatable) issues. You grow attached to the characters and the character development is splendidly done well. It does, however, take for a somewhat darker tone later on in the game that will GUARANTEE to make you cry and maybe break your heart into tiny pieces (I know mine did).The stat-raising game does get repetitive and tiring (like Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side) and may discourage some people from playing it for that reason. There are also a few spelling and grammar mistakes but easily forgiven for the well-written storytelling and voice acting (and yes, FULLY voiced). The voice acting delivers the characters' personality and emotions well. The music is beautiful and so is the art.It's definitely a must play for otome gamers. If you want to go for a ride on the emotional roller coaster, this is your game. Also, Jiwoo’s paws are cute and YOU MUST PLAY HIS ROUTE.Dandelion ~ Wishes Brought to You ~ gets a 9.5/10 from me and I'd like to applaud Cheritz for a wonderfully presented game.			"

												What can I say about Dandelion? I bought it on a whim, to be honest. I'm not one to spend money on games I know nothing about, based on a whim.50+ hours and many sleepless nights later, I regret nothing. Every ending, every CG, every bit of  bonus; I've done anything and everything Dandelion has to offer. Including Heejae...The best of the story-lines ironically happens to be the most PG. Jieun owns my heart, at least the most. Each of them have a piece of it because, despite my fears that one story or another might be lackluster, they were all engrossing, heartfelt, and hooked me - hook line and sinker, so to speak. As the Wizard said, no one ordinary would do. Each story will touch you; if not, then you just have no heart, do you? *sniff*The art is beautiful, the story - all said and done - is touching. While the repeatitive stat grinding got on my nerves by the time I was on my third playthrough, it wasn't enough to pull me out of wanting to play. If focused, you can get through one story in roughly 4-6 hours. The music was nice, too. Enough bonus things to be amused and, again, make it feel like it was worth the full price that I paid. Also...I felt for the Wizard in the end. That extra bit was a nice touch. 10/10, would unwittingly be a pawn in the Wizard's game any time			"

												Dandelion is one of the best Otome games I have played. In essence, one day you found a bsaket of bunnies and cats in your room and decided to look after them, only to realised that they can turn into more human forms and they were all here as participants of a 'game'.What makes Dandelion really shine, in my opinion, is the story. It is not one of those shallow sim dating game where there is no content- Dandelion is extremely story rich and you get more and more questions as you play along: why the hell these boys appear from nowehere, what is the 'game' that they constantly talk about, etc. Then when you get the ending of your first character, BOOM! You see the person who is behind all this and all I can say is RAGE!!! Once you have got all the good endings for the characters, BOOM! Everything comes together - it even explains the fact that why as players, we got to go through all the different characters - MIND-BLOWN! Plus RAGE as you just hate the secret character for putting everyone through the game!!! :PAside from the story, the art is amazing. The CGs are so beautiful!!! All the characters have distinctive personalities so you are bound to find one that you like! The voice acting is super professional and you can tell that the voice actors put a lot of thought into the characters and the story so they can say the lines with great emtions... I also enjoy the opening song together with the visuals - looks just like an opening for an anime, extremely professional and well made.I really enjoyed this game, having played all the good and bad endings for all the characters. One thing to note is that if you are looking for some cheesy 'happily ever after' endings, sorry, you won't get them here. When I first got the endings, I was gutted that they weren't true happy endings but after a while, I appreciated the fact that Cheritz has decided to do so as it is a very bold move. The endings were all sort of open ended but I mean come on, it is just life, isn't it? In a way it leaves you room for imagination as well.Now the characters, they all look great and a lot of thought have been put into the character development. At first glance I really like the black cat but his pocessive nature really puts me off a bit (some girls like that so fair enough). Also I will warn you if he is your favourite, you might want to avoid his bad ending as it is dark, REAL DARK. I actually ended up having the tiny white rabbit as my favourite as I played more. At first he seems too young but his character development, together with the fact that he was the only one to KICK THE SECRET CHARACTER'S♥♥♥♥♥puts him my number one!!! I MEAN GO JIEUN, YOU MIGHT LOOK SMALL AND HARMLESS BUT YOU ARE AWESOME!!! If you don't understand what I mean, apologies as it is hard to explain the plot without spoilers but basically, he is the only one with a proper real good ending if that helps :)The thing that really disappoints me is the english translation - mistakes every now and then. Dandelion is definitely my favourite of the two Cheritz games because of the clever plot of linking all the stories together. It might seem expensive but it is totally worth it. If you are looking for otome with a story rich element and amazing characters, seek no further.			"

												Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is a stats-raising visual novel/point-and-click romance game that is, at its core, the story of Heejung, a 21-year-old university student in her last year, who feels like she has no direction in her life, suffers from low self-worth and thinks that she can amount to no more than being a failure. It's also a story about how she changes for the better after having five pets thrown into her lap out of nowhere and deciding to adopt them. It's also about the strange origin of said five pets (three rabbits and two cats) and the mysterious pact they made with an individual known as The Wizard to win a ""game"" he's arranged them to play that involves Heejung's unwitting participation...And, of course, it's a story in which the player, depending on whose affection they raise the most, can help Heejung develop a romantic relationship with one of her five pets after they turn human.GAMEPLAY: The way Dandelion is structured is that each love interest has a route and their own plot, meaning that each character has different conditions needed to get their official good ending. The similarities between these routes is that they all need to have their affection maxed out (get all of their hearts!), their necessary stats need to reach a specific level before the end of the game and the player needs to collect 30 stamps of the character they're pursuing. There are five stats to keep an eye on in all: Femininity, Beauty, Art Skill, Stress and Pressure. The first three cap at level 20, whereas the last two you will want to make sure the gauge never fills up else you will end up with a non-standard game over. In addition to these, there is also the heart gauge that once filled allows you to unlock new actions or to diminish the effects of stress or pressure.Stats can be raised by performing an action, such as watching the education channel by clicking the TV in the living room to lower pressure and raise art, or by going out with a character and choosing to not look around. You can go out with a character in both their pet and human form during the weekend or you can choose to go to work (and receive $40) or stay home. Choosing to go out during a weekday gives the options of shopping at either the item shop or bookstore or to go to work (for $10). Keeping an eye on Heejung's wallet is important since the items or books that can be bought can be used to either boost her stats (or diminish the effects of stress and pressure) or be given as gifts to the character the player is pursuing. Each character has different preferences for gifts so keep an eye out for that!*A word of advice!* Prioritize buying the eye medicine, which costs 200$. This is important since it allows the player to have more luck in finding useful items during the Look Around option during dates, which means better odds of finding stamps, stat-raising items or gifts.Which leads me to detailing the specifics of dates! By choosing to go out with a love interest during the weekend, Heejung will get the option between choosing a stat raising action at the location of choice or of looking around. This is a fun little activity where you will be offered a bunch of random objects littered all over the background and you get to pick up three of them! Alternatively, you can quit the ""investigation"" at any time. Either way, the date ends and the game moves on to the next day.Finally, there's raising a love interest's affection. This can be done either by taking them on dates, as explained above, or by finding them somewhere in the house and choosing the action where they're hanging around and successfully performing an action they enjoy. (For example, Jisoo frequently hangs around the fridge.) Gifts can only be given to a love interest after they turn human. An affection-raising action has been successfully performed if a yellow or pink heart appears; blue hearts or the spikey black circle signify a failed action and WILL reduce affection points.***QUICK-SAVE BEFORE TRYING TO RAISE AFFECTIONS OR LOOKING AROUND DURING DATES*** There is no penalty for quick-loading several times and it will save you a lot of grief! You have about an in-game year to work on stats, so no need to stress, but better not to waste chances!But enough about gameplay! LET US DISCUSS PLOT, PROTAGONIST AND LOVE INTERESTS.As mentioned before, the game is told through Heejung's eyes as she struggles to get good grades in university for a job she doesn't want for a future she has no clear vision of. She's rather depressed and is questioning why she's working so hard for something she doesn't find rewarding, when one night, a mysterious individual bestows upon her the gift of suddenly finding herself to be a pet owner of three rabbits and two cats. Needless to say, when she wakes up to find a basket filled with five strange animals in her room, she initially freaks out, but over the course of the day (and week) she decides to take care of them, and afterwards becomes incredibly grateful for their presence in her life.Heejung, in my opinion, is a huge success of a protagonist. She's incredibly relatable, especially in this day and age when our generation is struggling to find work and pay and meaning in our lives. It's incredibly up-lifting to see Heejung change from being monotone and hopeless to finding time to sit back and relax and enjoy the world around her, not to mention it gives you a warm, happy feeling to see her getting attached to her newfound family. Her backstory is also incredibly real for many of us, and though I won't spoil it, I think that helps give players someone tangible to connect with.That, and it's nice to not play a high school student for once, especially when you've graduated a while back already and are struggling with the realities and responsibilities of Being An Adult.The five love interests that the player can have Heejung hook up with are as follow: Jisoo, the black cat; Jiyeon, the orange cat; Jihae, the silver rabbit; Jieun, the small white rabbit; and Jiwoo, the spotted rabbit. They all have their own personalities and struggles to deal with (all of them heavy in spoilers so I won't go in detail here), each with their own appeals and possible deal breakers.Jisoo, for example, is always looking out for Heejung and cares deeply about her well-being, but he's also the jealous and possessive type. Jiyeon is sweet and caring but his particular deal-breaker is a spoiler, so I'll just advise people to be careful with that one, cute though his ears may be. Jiwoo is hilarious because he reads romance novels seriously and is also just an all around hilariously arrogant and superior-than-thou type of guy, but those exact same traits might not cut it for others who aren't impressed with people who act like a jerkwad towards the protagonist. (To be clear, Jiwoo is a tsundere: Harsh on the outside, sweet and loving on the inside. It requires work to reach that soft side to him, but for many it may be more than worth it. Or not.) Jihae is nothing if not polite and courteous and forever attentionate towards Heejung, but he might also come off as boring and flat. And finally, Jieun is PRECIOUS CUTIEPIE LITTLE BABY RABBIT LET ME PET YOUR HEAD, but, uh, he's. Kind of young. His route is pretty PG, though, but that might still break it for many.All in all, each route adds more to the story and reveals aspects of their origin as the story progresses, making it worthwhile to play every route to gain access to the true ending. The bad endings are also worth gunning for, if only to complete the gallery and memory in the extras, but I suggest playing them last.Dandelion is a fascinating story that probably hits close to home for many with supernatural elements thrown in. I strongly suggest it for anyone who likes good plots, quirky but believable characters and a realistic portrayal of how stressful but varied life and relationships can be.			"

												[I would like to note that this review is based on the original version of Dandelion from Cheritz’s shop, which is why I only have a few hours of gameplay on Steam]Dandelion – Wishes brought to you is a visual novel otome game brought to us by the Korean company, Cheritz. In the English community, otomes are not an extremely popular subgenre. It’s fairly common for companies not to bother with an official translation of their game, and the ones that we do get are often games of fairly subpar quality, obviously meant to try and make the player pay as much as possible for things such as energy points. I had been hoping for something better, however, and after hearing about Dandelion from some friends soon after it’s release, I purchased the game with high hopes. Did it live up to my standards?The short answer is: It most certainly did, for many reasons.Story: Heejung is a young adult attending college. She has a past of being emotionally abused by her mother, which has led her to be depressed and constantly in a state where she feels stressed and pressured by the expectations she feels like she must live up to. Things begin to change when one day, she discovers a basket of animals, two cats and three rabbits, has somehow been left in her room. After some consideration, Heejung decides to raise these animals, and to her surprise, after a while, she discovers they have all turned into human boys!The plot seems silly at first glance when you consider the idea of “dating pets,” but I was easily drawn into the game’s world. It sets up many questions about why exactly these animals were left to Heejung, where they come from, and their pasts. No character is as simple on the surface as you may wish to assume, and everyone is developed very well in their routes. I found everyone to be sympathetic on some level in a unique way. The characters all have very distinct personalities as well, and stand out from one another.I was also impressed by the protagonist, Heejung. I believe Cheritz has written a very realistic and believable depiction of depression in her character. As someone who has dealt with these issues myself, I found her extremely relatable and she was a character I was always happy to see become more happy and confident over the course of the game. Some people accuse otome protagonists of being boring, but I personally do not believe that is the case with Heejung.Gameplay: Dandelion stands out a bit from other visual novels in that it has a different sort of mechanic from what you normally expect of a visual novel dating sim. You spend a fair amount of the game simply managing Heejung’s day to day life by choosing activities for her to partake in during the day. Depending on what you choose to do, different stats of hers will either increase or decrease. Not being careful with your stats can lead to a game over. And depending on what you decide to do, you can run into one of the boys and begin building affection points with them. Not paying attention to your affection points can also lead to a bad ending. This is quite different from the typical dating sim, where you normally just sit through scenes and choose an option every now and then for dialogue. I found this style of gameplay a refreshing change of pace and an interesting difference.The only real problem I have is that every now and then you can find typos in the dialogue, but luckily they’re actually fairly easy to miss if you’re not paying a ton of attention and don’t normally affect the flow of a sentence. I do, however, think that it may be beneficial in the future for Cheritz to have a native English speaker help proofread the script.Art: Like I mentioned above, I’ve played a lot of subpar otomes. In a lot of them, the art isn’t too great, and is often very awkward looking in regards to anatomy. I was extremely relieved to find that the art in Dandelion, which is all originally drawn for the game, is nothing short of beautiful.The anatomy seems quite fine to me, as there was nothing that jumped out to me in any of the character sprites or CGs that looked off at all.The colors are actually one of my favorite parts of the art. The palette is very bright and colorful, which matches the game’s tone extremely well. The brightness however, isn’t overwhelming at all, and all the colors used mix together quite well for a very pleasant arrangement.The backgrounds used are also quite well drawn. Perspective appears to be quite on point, and they are all quite detailed and well-drawn.Music: The music in the game is quite catchy, but I never found it distracting. Every piece used fits the mood of the scene well. I also enjoyed both the opening and ending themes used quite a bit. While there wasn’t any music I considered particularly stand out or felt I immediately had to have on my ipod, it was all enjoyable and certainly not bad at all.Overall: If you’re searching for an otome game of decent quality, with good art, story, music, and characters, this is it. Dandelion is sure to be an enjoyable experience for anyone who enjoys these kinds of games, and I would very quickly recommend it to anyone who is interested. Of course, I cannot guarantee it is for everyone, as anyone who is looking for something more “manly” or with more intense gameplay won’t find that here, but it’s really quite obvious that isn’t who Cheritz is interested in pleasing. Their slogan, “Sweet Solutions for Female Gamers” shows exactly what they’re trying to accomplish, and I’d say Dandelion certainly lives up to that. You’re sure to be entertained by this sweet and fun game.			"

												I thought people were exagerating about the grind. They're not.I feel like I'd really love the story if there'd been more than 5-10 mins of it in the two hours I played.The grinding doesn't even seem useful; as far as I can tell leveling your skills doesn't seem to affect anything.			"

												I really love this game! It had a good story and cute/beautiful/handsome characters! The artwork is so pretty! I almost lost my breath when I saw one of them! xD  I love the opening to the game!!! <3 I listened to it every time I started a new game and more than that! The story is very good! It was way better than I expected! It was interesting, sad and a very good plot.  (On the side note, I like how it connetcts  to ''Cheritz'' other game  ''Nameless'' that I also likes. ) I also like the voiceacting! The characters really comes to life with their voices. Its very well done! Even if I love this game there is ..although the art were wonderful most of the time, did I not quite like one of the main characters poses.. And the friend at school is oddly shaded and drawn without care compared to the others, which make him stand out of place .. But that is about it! I liked all the music except for one melody, cause it sounded funny and did not fit in at all. xD  Something that I thougt was a bit bothersome were the days between the cut scenes! The could sometimes feel endless..... D: But it was worth it to get to know these characters.  Since the all had intressting reasons etc.<3Anyway, when these days go on and on waiting for the story to continue.. And sometimes all of a sudden you got a bad ending... Which also made me insecure to save at times.. Since if you save close to a bad ending without knowing, than its hard to continue ..And noticning that, I saved most  when the first requirments were fullfilled, and the next one started.And last, sometimes did the game disconnect to the server, but I did not have that much of a problem to reconnect. And I do not see this as a hindrence to play... but that may differ I do not know. Overall, I really loved this game, I will probably play through the endless days just for the characters! And their stories. <3  And also for the art! Since I got quite attached to the game, and do not regret it. xD I give this game a half eaten broccoli and 11/10.  Don´t worry I have apples. <3  "

												I got incredibly weary of stat grinding, which became more tiresome with every route. The story and characters were pretty good--not fantastic, but entertaining and cute, except that you have to grind so much just to get to the scenes! It would have been worth it for $15-$20, but definitely not at a value of $30 for me (I'm sure it was expensive to make and I dont think it's unreasonably priced, but I mean personally it was not worth the cost for me.)

												I love this game. It's so much more than a visual novel - lots of choices - only wish they had more games like it! The music is amazing too. Voices are excellent and really add to the personalities. Characters are absolute heart throbs with great background stories. 10/10 would be in a verbally abusive relationship with Jiwoo again. lol!			"

												This is a great game although, for what it is, I think its a little overpriced. It is a stat management style game centered around a dating sim. You basically choose different daily activities to maintain/level up certain stats and develop relationships with the love interest characters. I did a let's play of this on my YouTube channel, feel free to check it out to see some actual game play or even save yourself 30 bucks!

												Cheritz always produces good otome games that are not like any other usual dating sims which is why whenever I see a game made by Cheritz, I automatically assume it's going to be really good. There will be those days when I just want to play a dating sim and usually everything I find that's free is usually really generic and the story isn't interesting. Cheritz is the only company where I am actually willing to pay money just for a dating sim. Good game, good story, cute animals and cute boys ;^))			"

												Relationships Take Time, Some Skills, and Apparently a Really Bogus Twist EndingWhile I'm recommending this game, I do want to point out the elephant in the room with the multiple endings (not just the ""Bad End"" where the school friend proposes to you out of nowhere). Without spoiling anything, I really didn't like them at all, and the game seemed to just end suddenly with them. It seemed unfinished, and really irked me considering how much time I had put into this game/the relationships involved. I've said my peace: I'm not a fan of it. There.But as for the rest of the game itself, I found it mainly decent. The part I liked best was the skill-building mechanic, where you can choose to build up your skill level in multiple areas with one activity per day, and lower Stress and Pressure areas in order to stay healthy. I questioned whether Feminitity and Beauty were really the most important things she should be focusing on, but I didn't find anything really offensive about it either. The item collection mechanic that's secondary in it could use some work - going to the bookstore doesn't allow you to read any of the new books you purchase? That seems like it was meant to contribute to skill building at some point, but the developers didn't have time to finish it. The characters, including our main, can be pretty one dimensional. Jisoo is the 'bad boy', Jihae is the pretty and shy older man, Jiyeon is the perpetual child, Jieun may be a literal child from how he looks and acts on first impression, and Jiwoo is the rich-boy a*hole. At least, that's all based on first impression, but the writers do try to develop them more depending on which relationship you pick. Some of the redeeming backstories work, while others seem out of place. Also, I didn't really like how Jisoo would often bully or try to intimidate Heejung if she didn't pick him, with pretty much every choice, and led to some awkward encounters. Even if it's in character for him, that made me uncomfortable and crosses the line from 'bad boy' to 'obsessive and abusive and borderline manipulative stalker who you should definitely stay the HELL away from'.Heejung is not a bad character, but at times it feels like she has no autonomy over her decisions. Her mother's abuse may have led to her crippling insecurity and this would explain this, but I'd really rather she grew to have more confidence in herself and not really let herself be led around by men or overwhelmingly shy around Jihae, for example. Again, it wasn't an offensive thing to me or stopped me from enjoying the game, but I'm kind of a bit sick of the insecure girl trope. It'd be fun to have a protagonist who's direct, has her own opinions and knows what she wants, but that's just my opinion.Overall, I really think the mechanics in this game hold up, but the long hours it takes to play, multiple character/writing problems, and the bad endings I know I'm gonna get even if I do everything right, really stop me from playing this all the time. I'd say it is a good sometimes-game, it's definitely good for a dating sim, and there are some cute moments with each of the characters. But the flaws are kind of too big to ignore.			"

												Dandelion is one of my favorite otome games. You play as Heejung, a college student who's dissatisfied with her daily routine and is trying to find her place in life. This routine is completely disrupted when two cats and three rabbits are mysteriously left in her home. Heejung slowly warms up to her new pets, who make her happy for the first time a long while. But lo and behold, Heejung is shocked to come home one day to find her pets have turned into humans! On top of their strange transformation, Heejung keep hearing mention of a ""game"" set up by an enigmatic Wizard. Who will be the winner?Heejung, the heroine of the game, is one of the standout characters of this game. In many other otome games, the main character is usually bland so the player is able to self-insert themselves into the story. That’s not the case with Heejung; she’s a fully realized character with her own fears and goals for the future. Her constant worry about needing to be the best to please her overbearing mother is something that really struck a chord with me. The 5 main guys are all very likeable in their own ways (although I will admit the jealously streak that one character showed throughout his route annoyed me.) Not everyone is who they appear to be on the surface, and as Heejung gets close to each boy, you begin to unravel their past and true personalities. The gameplay includes raising stats in Femininity, Beauty, and Art Skills by performing a number of different tasks around Heejung’s apartment and raising affection with her beau. Raising the stats can get tedious at times, but there’s enough variety in activities that it never truly gets boring.The art in this game is wonderful; each CG was a treat. The in-game music was nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. (I really like the Wizard's theme a lot though.) The opening song is also probably my favorite opening of any visual novel I've played.As of writing this review, I’ve completed 4 of the 5 routes in the game. (I’m saving Jiwoo for last because I know he’s going to be my favorite <3). Each route tugs at your heart strings, and the endings are bittersweet. When a game gets you so invested that you cry, you know it’s doing its job right. So in closing, I’d highly recommended this game for someone looking for a good story with lovable characters. Here’s hoping that Cheritz’s other game, Nameless, is also Greenlight on Steam! :)			"

												I usually wait until games are on sale to buy them. But this one I decided to get for the full price and I honestly feel like it was worth it. It is hard to get the perfect endings, which means a lot of time yelling at yourself and trying to figure out what you did wrong. So far I have only been able to get one romance, but it was worth it. The ending can be sad or bittersweet, which is a change from most other otome games. I can tell that the makers of this game put a LOT into it. How many games have an opening and ending theme like a show?			"

Posted: March 27
												The basic summary of the story: A wizard wants to play a game with the MC because he has fallen in love with her for being so selfless and mechanical in trying to please her mom. He wants to see her have some kind of emotion and becomes obsessed with meeting her face to face. So, he devises a game that will hopefully draw out those emotions and a wish that will allow them to meet. The five guys are characters from another realm (not earth) and have either cat or rabbit ears. Each one wants a wish fulfilled or start a new life. If they fail in winning her love, they stay in earth and lose memories of their wish or whatever caused them to want that wish and the MC. This is how the wizard grants wishes, by taking part of their memories, which gives him power. If the MC falls in love, the winner will return to their own world without warning, which causes her to want to make a wish so that they can see each other again. Thus, the wizard can meet the MC. This is pretty much the story. Pros:1. I guess the drawings are pretty good. Some of the characters look awkward (body proportion wise), but pretty good anyway.2. First MC I actually like from an otome game. She actually has a personality. 3. Some of the idea concept is interesting.  a sadistic wizard playing with people's emotions is always fun. Plus, there are high stakes from the guy characters in trying to win the game. Cons:1. The stat building is grueling, annoying, infuriating, and pointless in my opinion. Once you get the hang of it it is easy to do, but there is so damn much of it. It makes the game take forever just doing that part alone. 2. One feature I LIKE from otome games is dialogue options which can make other characters react or change their personality towards the MC in different ways. THERE IS BARELY ANY!!!! In fact, your success depends on stat building and interacting with other characters in the flow of rigid and set dialogue which you have little if any influence upon. 3. Due to those two above cons, combined, I feel as though there is really little story overall and rather misleading in fooling you that there is ample game play involved. Stat building is boring!4. There are some bugs in this game. I got all those dumb stamps for every character, but for some reason, even though finishing those routes and getting a good ending, those stamps disappeared and cannot unlock those boring bonus? extra feature drawings?5. I am not sure if I really like any of the characters to be honest. There are funny moments and boring moments.  Actually, I think Jieun is my favorite route simply because he was the only one that could successfully challenge the wizard on any real level. It is more of a friendship route though with the idea that that could change once the youngest male character grows up. In my opinion Jieun's route should be played last. 6. Ending is abrupt. I know that could be a technique, but after all that terrible stat raising, little story in truth, I would expected a little more effort. Instead, my overall opinion is more like ""meh"" okay, well that passed the time. If you like otome games and are bored waiting for more interesting ones to come out, sure. Now that I am finished I doubt I will play this game again. I just don't want to go through that click, click, click crap in the stat building.			"

												If you love otome games you shouldn't waste your time by reading this review- just buy it. Trust me it definitely worths it. I like Dandelion more than Nameless because It's a stat-raising otome. Which means you have to increase your stats to get hot guys. And that doesn't bore you- you're not sitting like a potato and read the script all day. At least I think that way.Artwork and storyline is awesome. Special arts and concept arts are also awesome. It's a must-have otome game. Only problem is translation. There are some mistakes but it's not making it hard to understand the script.			"

												I've always been a fan of Visual Novels/Otome games, but finding ones in English that I really liked was difficult, so when I heard about Cheritz's Dandelion, I didn't wait too long before buying it.This game is professionally done with Korean voice acting and the translations aren't bad either, there are only a few misses, but not enough to confuse the player/reader. The art is also gorgeous and the music is enjoyable as well. The stories for each of the guys are also nice and I enjoyed the events that happened around the apartment as time passed and Heejung interacted with the guys.This is a stat raising game so you have to make the right choices for the guy you're going after in order to raise affection points, which can become tedious for some people. The interactions between Heejung and each boy are very amusing and heartwarming though, so try different things out, some actions might be more worthwhile than others though.The themes of abandonment and then about coping with it afterwards are very nicely addressed in this games story. While we may not all have magical animals suddenly turning up in our real lives, it is still soothing to be able too follow and help Heejung through her struggles.I also really like that there is bonus unlockable content, the extras are really nice~ "

												It's a nice game, but with the redundant content, grammatical errors and disatissfying endings, I feel like I've wasted $30 on something over-priced. I'm not happy with the amount I've spent on it. My disatissfaction may also come from the cultural differences in the game, as I just cannot get into stories about guys who treat women poorly and are borderline abusive in the relationship. This is my first otome and apparantly this is a thing that's enjoyed? Not for me.  I wish the demo were attached to be able to try that out first, or I should have just watched walkthroughs instead.$10 would have been alright for this game, but $30 felt like a waste. I'm a bit 'meh' about this. Would be nice if the game creators added more story, and more content. Maybe an update for more characters or a FULL ENDING for each of the stories?			"

												Really enjoyed playing the demo (For about 10+hrs lol) and am happy to have the full game, there is so much more story to this then I first expected and defainly recomened this to anyone who wants a good story that is funny and charming. I thought this game would be pretty quick but I've found out that each route is going to take quite a long time if you want to get the ""good ending"" so it's a great time waster. This game is defaintly one of my favourites and I'm most likely going to play it again and agian :3Each charter has their own personality which means everyone's going to have their own favourite (Mines Jiwoo :3) and everyones story has it's on funny and sad moments. Not many games make me cry but I have to admit this one did but in a good way.And I really like the art style of this game, it's simple but complements the game style perfectly making it even better.

												I really do love this game. Even though I don't really play otome games made by korean, this game is really good! Especially the story, I couldn't believe that each characters hold such a tragic pasts that it could almost made you in tears (well I do) But one thing I love about this game is not the artwork, gameplay and storyline (that too but), its about the game that somewhat makes your heart pounds and clenched. True, the story is very touching, but I feel like somewhat I'm the protag and experienced what she does together with the other characters. When they're happy, funny really, I do too and when they're sad, I feel sad too. No, I don't think I'm what they called being so into the game because, all the past otome games I played (mobile ones) were not as heartwarming as Dandelion's. Thank you really Cheritz, for this wonderful experience you bless us with.			"

												This game is like playing the fic, ""Take It or Leave It"" in visual novel form, right up to the mysterious creeper who set the whole scenario up. If you don't know what that means, but have a desire to forge unhealthily codependent relationships with a bunch of really pretty guys while raising your stats, I highly recommend this game.There are typos galore, but the stories are still enjoyable; the meta-story kept me playing through every playthrough to try to figure out exactly what was going on.I was skipping the beginning text after the first playthrough, but there seems to be some sort of completion flag trigger that changes the antagonist's dialogue at the beginning, so if you're interested, you may want to pay attention to what he says to his ""Heroine"".

Posted: October 25, 2014
												Hello everyone!  This is my first time putting together a review, so bear with me.  I'll be dividing this post into 5 sections:  Plot, Individual Characters, Technical Features/Gameplay, Sound, and Art.  This will be a spoiler-free review.  If anyone wishes for my thoughts with spoilers on anyone else, I’d be happy to post that as well.PLOTThe overall plot is simply amazing.  I have to admit, I was preparing myself to be thrown into a ball of stereotypes and other redundant plot devices & themes.  Fortunately though, there are a bunch of surprises and twists, and the game does a good job of making use of the cliches it has, while avoiding many others.  Don’t let these lovely, cute-looking pets in the beginning of the game fool you - you’re in for some pain.    INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERSJiyeon:  Unfortunately, his route felt incredibly short (due to plot reasons), and because of this, I did not have the desired period of time to become attached to his character.  Not only that, but many of his actions weren’t really...appealing.  At all.  Overall, I felt he was the person who should least be with Heejung.Jieun:  I liked Jieun more than I thought I would.  At first, I had thought his plot was going down a cliche path, but it diverted from such and I’m very happy it did so.  The story in this route was unique, and there’s much more to him than meets the eye.  There was plenty of surprises for me, especially since I did this route before Jihae’s.  He goes though most character development, hands down.  As you might’ve guessed, you get to learn plenty about Jihae as well, which is why I actually suggest doing Jihae before Jieun if you would like to be surprised about his backstory.  Out of everyone, I felt that he was the healthiest for Heejung.Jisoo:  I expected to love this gluttonous dork.  Surprisingly...he was in the middle for me, due to a quality of his that you’ll run into...that isn’t healthy.  What I like about his path the most though, is that I feel that Heejung's own path in life was most recognized here, and she probably had the most personal growth here.  His route felt much longer than the others, with my personal favorite set of CG’s (besides the Wizard’s of course) in the game.  It also had some great, unexpected twists, so it was definitely a good route nonetheless, just not the best.  His ending was definitely top-notch though.  I feel that out of everyone, Jisoo had the largest motivation for winning the game.  My big tip for his route is that femininity does not matter nearly as much as your art skill and beauty, so definitely focus on raising those two up the most.  Jiwoo:  Being the biggest dork you encounter, this dude is hilarious.  It’s definitely a good route to play right in the middle of all the heaviness of the game.  This route had to be my personal favorite, and this ending was the only one that had me absolutely bawling.Jihae: First and foremost, if you want to be surprised by his backstory, do not play Jieun’s route first.  Jieun’s route will reveal a lot about Jihae, so I recommend playing Jihae’s route before Jieun’s.  With that being said, this route was good.  Although I felt Heejung's comments about how beautiful he is and etc., quite redundant, eventually I got used to it because hey - he IS pretty hot.  He probably had some of the most beautiful CG’s as well.Wizard:  I love this guy.  He’s just so interesting.  There’s really not much to say without completely spoiling his character, but personal story was probably my favorite - you won’t be disappointed.Heejung:  The heroine is actually my favorite part of this game.  I feel that anyone that has ever attended school, basically almost everyone, can relate to her - myself included.  The feeling of loneliness, of wanting to change, or the desire to know what it is you want to do in life, many of us have such wishes.  Especially the feeling of having to satisfy everyone else, forgetting you, yourself in the process.  In addition, her reactions to her situation, I believe, are realistic.  I could write an entire essay on how much I love her character.My recommended play order for each character would be Jiyeon > Jisoo > Jiwoo > Jihae > Jieun.  Although many people recommend doing Jieun first to get used to the gameplay mechanics, I believe that if you’re looking for gradual plot progression, his route is fantastic to leave last.My personal rankings for each route are Jiyeon <<<<< Jisoo <<< Jihae < Jieun < Jiwoo.TECHNICAL FEATURES/GAMEPLAY:First and foremost, I must mention the sprites.  I personally love how their mouths move, and how they actually blink.  Just small tidbits like this bring much more life to each character.  In addition, other little things such as the dandelions floating around the title screen, the leaves during fall, snowflakes during winter, etc. were all beautiful as well.  Secondly, I'd like to address the stat-raising aspect.  While it's cute and fun at first, it quickly becomes quite redundant.  Had it not been so repetitive, it would have been much more enjoyable.  It almost feels as if stat-raising takes up more of a route than the actual plot.  Other then that, the gameplay is pretty much standard visual novel gameplay - simply clicking.  The game possesses all the basic features you’d expect:  Auto, skip, CG gallery, etc.  In addition, (and I loved this) the game features a special section where you can use the stamps you find on the routes to unlock bonus art - basically some concept art of the character, and an image of them (presumably after each ending) as their future self, whether it be human or not.  I HIGHLY recommend you try and unlock these, as they are simply stunning.  AN IMPORTANT THING YOU MUST KNOW (that I sadly didn’t ;-;) is that every time you start a new route, you must start a new game, or else your stamps will not be there by the time you finished the route.  I’m one of those people that likes to make a save file right before the first choice (while you’re on the common route) and go from there for each route, but unfortunately if you want your stamps, don’t make the same mistake as me.  Another tip I’d like to add is that if you’re interested in looking for stamps, work EVERY weekend until you reach at least $1200, then buy at least 6 visual improvement medications, to get increased eyesight out of the way - trust me, if you don’t want to flip over a table, you’ll increase your eyesight to at least 8 so you don’t have keep quick-saving and loading on a date to find stamps.  SOUNDThe voice acting is wonderful, what else can I say?  And while most side characters wouldn't get voices or sprites, Cheritz put in the extra effort to include them as well - Heejung’s mom, Heejae, etc.  Even Heejung has a voice, and it’s rare for heroine’s to be voiced as well.  Extra props to Jiyeon’s voice actor, you’ll know why.ARTThe art in this game is simply gorgeous.  I think I stared at the title screen for a few solid minutes when I first purchased the game.  The chibi’s during the stat-raising activities are adorable.  The vibrant colors fit the hopeful, cheery atmosphere the game possesses.  In addition, the garments for each character are designed in amazing detail, respective to each of their positions in the society back in their world.  For example, while Jihae's clothing may appear fancy enough that he could be mistaken as a noble like Jiwoo, that is not the case:  The colors are more diluted, and it's much less bejeweled in comparison.  It is not too difficult to find a visual novel with good sprites, but most of the time, the CGs are disproportionate.  That is not the case with Dandelion.  Funnily enough, it's CGs are actually higher in quality overall, compared to its successor, Nameless, which had some wonky-looking images (beautiful but occasionally disproportionate).			"

												Do I recommend this game? A million times yes! This is definitely worth the price if you're willing to splurge a little on a dating sim/otome game.Characters and Story: 9.5/10The personalities of each character as well as their corresponding backstories touched me deeply and made me cry every time. Jisoo and Jieun's especially. Story is tied into my rating for the characters because they are practically inseparable. The stories paired up with the personalities of the cast clearly define who they are and turn them into a wonderful group of characters that you grow incredibly attached to. Heejung's backstory is painfully relateable to the point that you just naturally sympathize or empathize with her. Each one of the guys also has a way of making their way into your heart as you try to understand and comfort them through the player character, Heejung. Those 29 hours were very much well spent considering how the range of emotions I went through as I played through each story. If I could go into detail about how I felt about each story individually, then we'd be here forever (and you'd have the whole game spoiled for you). My only problem in this section would just be very minor translation mistakes. It's played upon quite a bit for Jiyeon, but at times, the mistakes are a little obvious and out of place (especially at times where there is a tiny inconsistency with the name being said and the name being read). Fortunately, they don't badly interfere with the storyline, so I have no complaints.Music+Voice Acting: 9.5/10Once again, the soundtrack for this game is amazing and calming as well. It helped me relax during this stressful time (since I was in the middle of midterms not too long ago) and I truly wish I could get the soundtrack if it were being sold. Also, my reasoning for giving this a 9.5 would simply be due to the fact that the drastic changes between an intense situation and a regular day were a bit too quick for me. It's not exactly bad, but I guess I didn't have time to calm my heart after crying for a little while. I do like that the music fit the situations in the storyline very nicely though which truly added to the experience. As for the voice acting, I may not know much Korean (other than stuff from manhwa and K-pop which isn't a lot obviously), but I loved that the message, despite being in a completely different language, was still getting through. There is so much heart in their voices that it almost felt like you were Heejung and the guys were all talking to you.Overall: 9.5/10Definitely buy this if you have the money. You won't be disappointed in the least. There is a bit of stat raising which can be tedious at times (as they are in many otome games/dating sims), but the effort put into it goes a long way once you get to truly delve into this beautiful piece of work. Will I continue to play this after finishing the game? I already am. If you have the time (since this does take a good 3-4 hours per route not counting the common route bad ending) and the money, I suggest you buy this game if it interests you even the tiniest bit. You will not be sorry.Oh. But on the downside, internet connection is a must. Be careful playing this in places with unstable wifi (like I did).			"

Dandelion is a visual novel in which you control a female protagonist, Heejung, and build stats to pursue one of five men, each of whom sport adorable cat or rabbit ears. The premise revolves around two cats and three rabbits mysteriously being brought into the protagonist's home, then taking on a human form. How did they find their way into Heejung's home? What is the ""game"" they keep talking about, and what is Heejung's role in it? These questions are answered throughout the game's multiple routes, encouraging replays until all are completed and all of the story's pieces come together.  Heejung is a very likeable and relateable protagonist. Unlike the majority of dating sim protagonists, who lack personality and backstory for the sake of ""immersion,"" Heejung has a life and personality all her own. Watching Heejung handle her conflicts, such as an overbearing mother and her uncertainty of what to do with her future, makes her an enjoyable and relateable character.  Dandelion's dateable candidates offer a variety of personalities and backstories. They all feature a level of complexity that can only be experienced by playing their route. Their diverse plots and reasonings for participating in the ""game"" results in wanting to know these characters beyond their initial introductions. The stories pull at your heart, with just the right amount of silliness sprinkled in with the sincerity. Each route is a fair length, and the voice acting is stellar, bringing life to each of the characters in conjunction with their bright, animated portraits.  Gameplay is simple point-and-click, doing various activities to raise your stats, and interacting with the men to boost their affinity for you. The Stats menu lets you know if your stats are high enough to keep going down the character's good route, and you are given ample time to raise them, making playthroughs fairly straightforward.  Features such as Auto, Skip, and Quick Save/Load make replaying the game for different routes convenient. Once you have viewed a specific scene, it becomes available for re-viewing in the Memory menu, making revisiting a previously-finished character's route hassle-free.  Ultimately, Dandelion is a touching, memorable experience. The characters are all unique, interesting, and multi-facetd, with appealing designs and engrossing stories. Fun, emotional, and heartwarming, I highly recommend this title to any fan of the otome genre.			"

												I do recommend this game, simply because it's hard enough to find an Otome game.However! The stats mechanics were annoying at times, when I just wanted to sit down and read the story. I didn't wanna worry about how much ""beauty"" my character had. Perhaps it was because I had just finished Amnesia, so I expected something similar. Anyway~ On to the good points.Jisoo's route was love, I recommend it for the end (if you don't like when guys get jealous, you have been warned).Jihae's route, he's too sweet and precious for this world.Jiwoo's route..he's a tsundere, so be warned. Hahaha.Jiyeon's route....I can't even hide my dissapointment for this one, left a sour taste in my mouth. I hated it!Jieun's route, he was literally 16!! SO, it was a bit weird for me a 24 year old woman. The ending fixes it though.My order was: Jieun, Jiwoo, Jihae, Jiyeon, and Jisoo. I hope others will play and enjoy this game as well!			"

												After touching all five of the good butts and one bad butt, I have to say this is an awesome otome game. Definitely worth the expense. Surprisingly, I really loved all the different character storylines and am excited to go back to do all the bad endings and extras. The game remains fun after multiple playthroughs, since there are so many cute interactions to unlock. In addition, be ready to come down with a real bad case of the feels, because you will, repeatedly. Some of the backstories/endings can be a little dark so be prepared. The pacing of the game is set up to get an emotional response from you, so you will feel frustrated, sad, excited, and happy at times that are appropriate for the story.  Overall, the heroine was very relatable, although sometimes pretty dense (in true romantic fashion).  Each guy brought out different sides of her personality, so I did feel like she was a different person in each playthrough.The whole game is colorful and fun to look at and the voice acting and sounds effects are really fun. There are a few translation errors, but nothing that breaks the dialogue. The sprites have a lot of personality and I found myself watching them just because they showed the thoughts of the characters so well. The mechanics of the game play were more focused on stat building with some choices to help you gain stats either with the guys or for your own character to advance in the game, but once you were on a guy's route (either good or bad), there isn't much branching decision making. You were able to interact with each guy in a variety of scenarios, which is a blast since you can get some really fun dialogue. I also had a lot of fun trolling them with gifts (island tickets and get a bikini ASAP ☺). Obviously the first few playthroughs should just be for fun, but for nice plot progression, I would recommend Jihae before Jieun and probably Jisoo or Jieun last (I went with Jisoo). Otherwise, play them anyway you want. I got a lot of bad endings on my first playthroughs since some of the play mechanics aren’t obvious (there is a status page so you can access inventory and your stats with each of the guys but it’s not obvious how to get to), but once you get a handle on it you’ll have some nice wiggle room to play with your characters. I really really really hope there will be some fan service DLC in the future, since I would love to just spend some fluff time with the guys. I need post ending cuteness. Btw – Doger and Cry have an absolutely hilarious walkthrough of the Jiwoo route if you want to get a sense of the game.  "

												I'm happy to see this getting on Steam. (: I've owned and finished the game quite some time ago before they even got on Greenlight, if you wonder why there's little time on my record; however, I'm playing it over and recalling all the reasons I loved it. The price may seem steep for what this genre is usually worth, but is it worth it in the long run? Totally. Is it a simple visual novel with sappy stories? No. It's a lot more than that. It consists of characters with realistic traits and feelings that we can all relate to one way or another. Even if their circumstances are mannered to fit the fantasy world more, the morals are there. There are several features along the gameplay that will require some careful planning and your attentive eyes. I don't want to spoil much, if at all, so I won't go into too much details about them. Play it for yourself and find out, you'll enjoy the ride.I will, however, mention a few keys you should know. Firstly, the quick save and load feature will be your best friend in this journey. It's crucial to take advantage of this to make progress with your guy and keep track of everything else. Of course, use the real save too when you need to. The game wants you to be devoted to whoever you wish to pursue, so don't be wishy-washy. The moment the prologue ends and you've entered the playable stage, you need to determine a route and stick with it. You'll be spending a few months in the game raising affection levels and stat meters before the real romance starts. It'll feel like you're playing house and raising a few cute animals. Simple, right? Or not. Pay attention to the animals' affection levels by hovering over their head icons under the room diagram and you'll notice that there are hearts and numbers, displaying things like 0/7 or 0/16, etc. This is very important, make sure you interact with the one you want and get that number maxed as soon as you can, then you can sit back and worry about your other meters until the required level goes up. And it will, so check often! If you goof on picking the right interaction or don't manage to encounter him, quick load until you succeed. You can use the same method for finding stickers when you go out (which you will want to do if you wish to collect their extra images), so work a lot and use the money to buy Eye Medicines at the shop. When Fall rolls around, which is September, the event with your guy will automatically trigger if you've done everything right. And you will know, because the loading screen will change and it'll be the image of that person. From there, you can still get bad endings if you slack off or pick the wrong choices, so watch out.The stories of each individual will tug at your heartstrings, and bit by bit, the bigger picture of the whole game will fit together. Be sure to check the extra/special stuff by the end if you wish to know more about the backstory, it'll also reveal things concerning a particular wizard. The whole process may prove to be tedious or frustrating at first if you're not experienced in the stat-raising scene, but it'll be worth it when you finally get to the end to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Don't give up!Overall, Cheritz has proven to me that they're capable professional creators of this game genre with their wonderful story-telling, clean + pretty graphics/designs, realistic character traits, and great voice acting. I look forward to continuing in supporting them and seeing more of their future releases. (Psst, check out their other game if you like this.)			"

												DO NOT MAKE A COMMON SAVE ROUTE. I saved at the exact moment you can finally start playing (so i didn't have to do the opening 5 times) and I played Jiwoo's entire route and half of Jiyeon's just to find out none of the stamps I collected count. At no point did the game ever stop me from collecting the stamps. now i have to go back and restart everything. I would have recomended the game before but this is such a stupid problem with the mechanics, it really makes the game a lot less enjoyable.			"

												I was very underwhelmed with the one route I played through, but I kept thinking I might--someday--go back to it. Well, I haven't and have come to terms with the fact that I probably won't. The voice acting is decent. It's nice to have a voiced protagonist.The translation is terrible--ridiculously so considering how expensive this game is.The main character was incredibly annoying to me. She is whiny and has the personality of a wet tissue.Stat raising is boring and super easy to spam.			"

												The game is a standard dating sim. There are a few problems with playing it. Mostly, it's just typos that throw me off on my reading when I play the game. The boys are amusing and you get attached to them very easily, which makes it saddening when you push the other animals away to spend more time for a play through. I wished that there were jealousy scenes in the game, otherwise the whole ""wish"" thing doesn't have the same amount of impact. It just seems like no one really cares enough about what they want and just spend their time fooling around.The pacing of the story gave me problems, since I usually optimize my stats for the story, it makes the game feel rather slow  at some parts. But I suppose if someone were to just play, it would be fine as long as you don't attempt to play the game in one day, which I did. There is a lot of content to explore, so it is best to take your time and not burn yourself out.The voice acting of the game gives a nice experiance.It has a nice, long story that makes you want to explore the other character some more. So, for a dating sim, it's very successful in getting attachment to the fun times of having 5 guys in your apartment. But on a professional writing view, the characters are pretty two dimensional, the story has a lot of holes, the characters lack active goals, and the sheer fact that typos happen is shameful, but I still enjoyed it. The character problem isn't too bad, since they are way more fleshed out than a standard dating sim.I suggest that people buy it when it is on sale about 5 or 10 dollars cheaper. It's worth a 20 dollar experiance more than a 30. But if you can afford it, buy it! It's still an amazing experiance.			"

												Really loved the music and voice acting in this one. I was a little surprised by some of the bad story endings but then became even more surprised by the one special unlocked ending. In some regards it does explain the story but I was left with more questions I found then I felt were answered. Some of the character side stories really got me thinking and I enjoyed feeling a connection to the characters. If you are pondering buying the game, try the demo! It is a pretty good demonstration of what the game is like.			"

												The game is a standard dating sim. There are a few problems with playing it. Mostly, it's just typos that throw me off on my reading when I play the game. The boys are amusing and you get attached to them very easily, which makes it saddening when you push the other animals away to spend more time for a play through. I wished that there were jealousy scenes in the game, otherwise the whole ""wish"" thing doesn't have the same amount of impact. It just seems like no one really cares enough about what they want and just spend their time fooling around.The pacing of the story gave me problems, since I usually optimize my stats for the story, it makes the game feel rather slow  at some parts. But I suppose if someone were to just play, it would be fine as long as you don't attempt to play the game in one day, which I did. There is a lot of content to explore, so it is best to take your time and not burn yourself out.The voice acting of the game gives a nice experiance.It has a nice, long story that makes you want to explore the other character some more. So, for a dating sim, it's very successful in getting attachment to the fun times of having 5 guys in your apartment. But on a professional writing view, the characters are pretty two dimensional, the story has a lot of holes, the characters lack active goals, and the sheer fact that typos happen is shameful, but I still enjoyed it. The character problem isn't too bad, since they are way more fleshed out than a standard dating sim.I suggest that people buy it when it is on sale about 5 or 10 dollars cheaper. It's worth a 20 dollar experiance more than a 30. But if you can afford it, buy it! It's still an amazing experiance.			"

												I'm happy to see this getting on Steam. (: I've owned and finished the game quite some time ago before they even got on Greenlight, if you wonder why there's little time on my record; however, I'm playing it over and recalling all the reasons I loved it. The price may seem steep for what this genre is usually worth, but is it worth it in the long run? Totally. Is it a simple visual novel with sappy stories? No. It's a lot more than that. It consists of characters with realistic traits and feelings that we can all relate to one way or another. Even if their circumstances are mannered to fit the fantasy world more, the morals are there. There are several features along the gameplay that will require some careful planning and your attentive eyes. I don't want to spoil much, if at all, so I won't go into too much details about them. Play it for yourself and find out, you'll enjoy the ride.I will, however, mention a few keys you should know. Firstly, the quick save and load feature will be your best friend in this journey. It's crucial to take advantage of this to make progress with your guy and keep track of everything else. Of course, use the real save too when you need to. The game wants you to be devoted to whoever you wish to pursue, so don't be wishy-washy. The moment the prologue ends and you've entered the playable stage, you need to determine a route and stick with it. You'll be spending a few months in the game raising affection levels and stat meters before the real romance starts. It'll feel like you're playing house and raising a few cute animals. Simple, right? Or not. Pay attention to the animals' affection levels by hovering over their head icons under the room diagram and you'll notice that there are hearts and numbers, displaying things like 0/7 or 0/16, etc. This is very important, make sure you interact with the one you want and get that number maxed as soon as you can, then you can sit back and worry about your other meters until the required level goes up. And it will, so check often! If you goof on picking the right interaction or don't manage to encounter him, quick load until you succeed. You can use the same method for finding stickers when you go out (which you will want to do if you wish to collect their extra images), so work a lot and use the money to buy Eye Medicines at the shop. When Fall rolls around, which is September, the event with your guy will automatically trigger if you've done everything right. And you will know, because the loading screen will change and it'll be the image of that person. From there, you can still get bad endings if you slack off or pick the wrong choices, so watch out.The stories of each individual will tug at your heartstrings, and bit by bit, the bigger picture of the whole game will fit together. Be sure to check the extra/special stuff by the end if you wish to know more about the backstory, it'll also reveal things concerning a particular wizard. The whole process may prove to be tedious or frustrating at first if you're not experienced in the stat-raising scene, but it'll be worth it when you finally get to the end to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Don't give up!Overall, Cheritz has proven to me that they're capable professional creators of this game genre with their wonderful story-telling, clean + pretty graphics/designs, realistic character traits, and great voice acting. I look forward to continuing in supporting them and seeing more of their future releases. (Psst, check out their other game if you like this.)			"

												Really loved the music and voice acting in this one. I was a little surprised by some of the bad story endings but then became even more surprised by the one special unlocked ending. In some regards it does explain the story but I was left with more questions I found then I felt were answered. Some of the character side stories really got me thinking and I enjoyed feeling a connection to the characters. If you are pondering buying the game, try the demo! It is a pretty good demonstration of what the game is like.			"

												I only have a couple hours in this one because I bought it from Cheritz directly about a year and a half ago, long before it was on Steam.This is a life sim, stat-raising otome game. The art is gorgeous, and the story is unique and beautiful, even if it does rely a bit on standard otome-game types (tsundere, yandere, shota, etc.) The voice acting is in Korean, but it's great, and the translation is consistently pretty good if a little odd at times.Dandelion is a bit more expensive than other English otome games, but it is definitely worth it. Each character's path is decently long, and has both good and bad ends. The stat-raising aspect actually requires a little strategizing (especially for some characters), and the MC is voice acted and has her own personality which varies a bit depending on whose path you're on.The game has a nice mix of serious feels and light-hearted comedy, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any otome or romantic VN fans. Tsundere bunny is my favorite. <3			"

												The apartment leveling & interaction system is a complete pain. There are VNs that came out 20 years ago that have better day planner systems than Dandelion.Fortunately, the music & stories are enjoyable. Even when it's very silly, Dandelion tries to be heartfelt. The voice actors just try so hard to make the player feel for the characters.Some of the characters good routes are still borderline abusive with how they treat the heroine, but nothing gory.Charming graphics, but major under use of CGs for such a long game.

												After touching all five of the good butts and one bad butt, I have to say this is an awesome otome game. Definitely worth the expense. Surprisingly, I really loved all the different character storylines and am excited to go back to do all the bad endings and extras. The game remains fun after multiple playthroughs, since there are so many cute interactions to unlock. In addition, be ready to come down with a real bad case of the feels, because you will, repeatedly. Some of the backstories/endings can be a little dark so be prepared. The pacing of the game is set up to get an emotional response from you, so you will feel frustrated, sad, excited, and happy at times that are appropriate for the story.  Overall, the heroine was very relatable, although sometimes pretty dense (in true romantic fashion).  Each guy brought out different sides of her personality, so I did feel like she was a different person in each playthrough.The whole game is colorful and fun to look at and the voice acting and sounds effects are really fun. There are a few translation errors, but nothing that breaks the dialogue. The sprites have a lot of personality and I found myself watching them just because they showed the thoughts of the characters so well. The mechanics of the game play were more focused on stat building with some choices to help you gain stats either with the guys or for your own character to advance in the game, but once you were on a guy's route (either good or bad), there isn't much branching decision making. You were able to interact with each guy in a variety of scenarios, which is a blast since you can get some really fun dialogue. I also had a lot of fun trolling them with gifts (island tickets and get a bikini ASAP ☺). Obviously the first few playthroughs should just be for fun, but for nice plot progression, I would recommend Jihae before Jieun and probably Jisoo or Jieun last (I went with Jisoo). Otherwise, play them anyway you want. I got a lot of bad endings on my first playthroughs since some of the play mechanics aren’t obvious (there is a status page so you can access inventory and your stats with each of the guys but it’s not obvious how to get to), but once you get a handle on it you’ll have some nice wiggle room to play with your characters. I really really really hope there will be some fan service DLC in the future, since I would love to just spend some fluff time with the guys. I need post ending cuteness. Btw – Doger and Cry have an absolutely hilarious walkthrough of the Jiwoo route if you want to get a sense of the game.  "

												DO NOT MAKE A COMMON SAVE ROUTE. I saved at the exact moment you can finally start playing (so i didn't have to do the opening 5 times) and I played Jiwoo's entire route and half of Jiyeon's just to find out none of the stamps I collected count. At no point did the game ever stop me from collecting the stamps. now i have to go back and restart everything. I would have recomended the game before but this is such a stupid problem with the mechanics, it really makes the game a lot less enjoyable.			"

												I was very underwhelmed with the one route I played through, but I kept thinking I might--someday--go back to it. Well, I haven't and have come to terms with the fact that I probably won't. The voice acting is decent. It's nice to have a voiced protagonist.The translation is terrible--ridiculously so considering how expensive this game is.The main character was incredibly annoying to me. She is whiny and has the personality of a wet tissue.Stat raising is boring and super easy to spam.			"

												The interactions with the characters is too random, could not find any help beyone ""try to find this thing, keep stats up, increase affinity and you might get a good ending"". When playing it seemed that their was only about a %50 chance of having an interaction with a character if they were in a given room, and woe be on to you if there was another character in the room because your odd just halved at having an interaction with the character you are trying to get. OH! and don't forget to keep all them stats up baby or you will wind up with dweeb boy or passing out and, maybe it's unclear, dying of pressure. And in addtion to all of that don't forget to increase you feminity (sexist much), your beauty (how shallow) and you artfulness. Your actions and your decisions make very little difference to the outcome of the game it is more random chance as to which ending you get and what you have to do to get the good ending in not clear in the slighest. I played through several times trying to get the good ending with a particular character and was unsucessful to the point that I was yelling at the screen ""COME ON!!! THAT SHOULD HAVE TRIGERED AN INTERACTION!!!"" It was extreemly frustrating and I did not feel like my choices mattered at all.			"

												Okay. This is a fantastic game. In fact, one of the couple of games that made me interested in getting a Steam account.This was my first dating sim, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. I love visual novels (even ones that are more novel than game, Zero...) and this just amazed me. The five boys felt really realistic (minus the bunny ears) and although - especially early game - it seemed like a lot of comic relief was going to be involved, they really got serious. I admit, some characters I was looking forwards more to than others (Jiwoo and Jihae if you're curious) but I really wasn't disappointed by any of the stories. Jiyeon gave a lot of entertainment to my gaming club when I brought this in and Jisoo and Jieun kept me entertained for a time when I was bedridden. And the one bad ending I have seen (the chicken ending) is just as amazing (though I think the others are going to be very different).But I feel like I'm rambling. The game is great. The characters are great. The stories are fantastic, each one making me cry for one reason or another. Until I found the bonus for getting all the good endings, it had the villain I loved to hate the most. Still love him after it, I just don't hate him as much now.Upsides... Like I said, great characters and great stories. The art and music is fantastic (I'm legitamately considering picking up the OST) and there are nice bonuses if you're diligent with the game. Stamps are easy to collect (I got 45 and 50 for Jisoo and Jieun, once I found out how good eye drops are). You get really good rewards that I can't sing enough praise about. A fantastic experience.Downsides of this game... It's a little pricey and there are some translation errors... A couple of times characters are misnamed and there are some spelling and grammatical errors... But it's easy enough to figure out what they mean and its pretty charming, but some people might find it a little off-putting. Oh, and there's a hint something at one small point with Jisoo I wish I could have found out more about (don't want to spoil anything, but alcohol was involved). But that's just something personal.

												Dandelion is an Outrageous game! Outrageously and hysterically funny and surprisingly deep once you get into it!You play as a senior student, Heejung Kim who has moved to Busan from her perfectionistic and nagging Mother.She hopes to find her own path in life in this new town and is a great student, but not knowing what she truly wants from life and not having much self-esteem from her past, she keeps stressing about being the perfect girl and being pushed down from pressure of korean society and the insane ideals of her Mother. So much that she has frequent flasbacks and nightmares, this being her trauma. One fateful morning the meowing of a cat wakes her up.Heejung lives alone, but now a basket of 5 animals is lying next to her bed! How did that happen? Who are these animals who occasionally seem to talk between themselves? Why do the animals you've taken care of as pets instead of sending to a shelter despite your stressful life suddenly transform to handsome men later on, but can't explain anything about this insanity? In order to find out, and in order to progress the story enough to reveal their humanforms and further, you as the player need to take action! You start out with 5 adoreable pets(2 Cats and 3 Rabbits). Even though they change from pets to a bunch of dudes(with animal ears), Heejung decides to let them stay on the condition that they wear hats or hoodies to hide their ears when necessary.Build up relationship points by interacting with them in your apartment, and occasionally by bringing them out for walks/dates. How you respond to events also affects your relationships, and the status of Heejung herself ofcourse.Your adoreable pets are as follows;*Jihae - The Silver RabbitThe beautiful, princely and mature one of the bunch, Heejung and Jihae seem to share an interest in art.He takes much care and responsibilty over Jihae and is stunning enough to be a model.*Jieun - The Pure White RabbitThe (shouta)youngest of the bunch, a quiet, gentle and closest to (Eddie..)Jihae.He loves apples to the point of being addicted and doesn't talk much at first, being very thoughtful.*Jiwoo - The Spotted(Cow) RabbitFrom the start he isn't the most social one of the bunch, nor the politest one.He is however perhaps the most intellectual one! Stuck-up and rude, but smart rabbit. Can you say Tsundere!*Jisoo - The Black CatThe badboy if you will. He seems rough at first, but clearly has a soft spot for food!He also likes to tease Heejung, but doesn't mean any harm. Just being a playful cat afterall...*Jiyeon - The Orange CatThe adoreable sweetheart of the bunch, rarely seen without a big smile on his face.He seems very pure and childish at first and even makes several small language mistakes.A charming heartbreaker!Try not to let stress or pressure take over completly, or you might end up collapsing like a squished pudding with Heejae, your classmate. He seems sweet and is certainly caring for you, but is sadly your BAD ENDING!So focus that doki doki on your pets! (wow, that sounds slightly wrong..)You'll quickly learn how quick save/load is your best friend through gameplay while balancing stress, pressure and raising ceratin stats for certain characters. Whenever you need to check your staus, wallet, items(some can raise stats) and relationship progress, just right click and well.. click status on the menu!Once you progress through the story it's easy to fall inlove with the personalities of the characters, the CG artwork is neat and sets the mood, and learning their stories I find myself wanting to play more and more and get to know each character. My personal favourite so far is without a doubt Jihae, but that might quickly change within the other routes as I've been focusing on this rare silver rabbitman's route. I enjoy seeing how the story progresses in a steady pace of growing feelings from being awkward at first to eventually blooming a romance to adoreable CG artwork.As for music, my opinion is mixed. Some of the looping music became quite annoying which made me hope for more variation(to my relief that the next season change had another loop), but some of the bgm was very enjoyable.I think music-wise it is more of a preference thing. However, the User Interface was absolutely to my taste!Well organized, easy and very practical to the game (quick save/load, how I love it!)All in all I'd say Dandelion is absolutely a game worth playing if you enjoy rich stories with colourful characters, and the fate of the protagonist lying in your hands! Enjoy your harem <3			"

												Dandelion is one of my all time favourite otome/dating sims available. Complex characters, good voice acting and beautiful artwork. The stat raising can get tedious, but it's one of the better versions of stat raising in this genre. I played every route when I first bought it (not on steam) and find every one enjoyable and interesting, (and occasionally extremely emotional) which is an unusual thing for me.Highly recommended for any fan of the genre and even for your first experience.

												As far as visual novels go, this was one of the better ones; beautiful character design, numerous still shots that add to the story, a realistic main character and a twist ending that brought the whole game together. I approached the game with a grain of salt, after all, animals turning into people is a rather fantastical. I figured it would be  a slapstic piece worth a few laughs. Pleasently mistaken, Dandelion offered an deeper underlying story that brought a more tought provoking level to an already enjoyable game.  The idea of having all the pathways sewn together in an overlying story arch is refreshing to say the least.The game has faults in its own right. In order to reach the ending on a given pathway, you have to repeditivly raise stats and keep your stress level down. One of the characters, in my opinion, becomes too possessive and dangerous without any option to counteract the behavior.Other than that, a very enjoyable game. I spent many nights unable to pull away from my computer screen, wanting to see what happens next. If you like this, I highly suggest purchasing Cheritz's other game Nameless. They remove the leveling/stats aspect making the focus more on the story.			"

												So far I really enjoy this game, but it IS a stat raising type of visual novel. I would have liked for there to be more choice making for me, but it's still fun to play.There are a few typos here and there, but it doesn't effect the gameplay in any way. This game is far from short as I've only finished one route (there was only a good ending for this character) and I already have a good amount of time on record.I'm excited to try the 4 other routes which have good AND bad endings .__. There wasn't too much of a lack of dialogue, but I did sometimes find myself becoming a little antsy for new scenes or decision making.Each character is fully voiced in Korean, but rarely there would be a moment where there was no voice clip.Overall, this game does have a few minor flaws but it is a visual novel that I can't wait to finish.

												Spoiler-free review based on four out of the five available routes - might be updated as more routes are played.From a production point of view, Dandelion is phenomenal. The opening video is great and the song catchy. The art is consistent and delivers; I'm not crazy about the art style in itself, with funky legs and necks, but wow the bishonen was strong. The music used is okay. Few tracks stayed in my mind, but I always consider a non intrusive soundtrack a good thing. Voice acting is truly amazing!There was no tutorial. There is no need for one, as I guess the only people who will play Dandelion are familiar with visual novels already, and there is a certain standard UI used in the genre. Nevertheless, I found out the player's inventory by accident. The location of it should have been mentioned, I think.The statistics you need to raise are Art, Beauty and Femininity. Each love interest has different requirements that you need to meet in order to continue the relationship. Do activities to raise statistics. You will meet the love interests in the house, and have the possibility to interact with them to raise the relationship points. As you swirl around interacting with your boyfriend and practicing the housewife life, you also need to keep low Stress and Pressure. I saw a problem in the stats. In the writing as well, in certain routes. Heejung can only act within the walls of her house. Heejung has the function to save the male interest from his painful past. She is unaware of her feelings, unaware of her needs, incapable of relating personal experience to the same romantic clichés she criticizes when she reads Harlequin novels or goes to the movies. True, Heejung overcomes her fear, but she does not accomplishes it by herself. Her knight on a white horse does the talking to the source of her nightmares. She needs her prince to save her. (Notable exception is Jieun's route, which favorably impressed me!) We're in the 21st century, and although I don't expect my games to be full on progressive, I also don't expect them to be so backlash-ish in their treatment of female characters - especially when I'm supposed to identify with said female character.…but I still recommend the game. Highly recommend the game! The fangirl in me loved the cutesy bishonen romance, while the feminist in me sighed at the problematic elements in the writing and gameplay. If you're a fan of otome games, this is a must!			"

												Okay, I thought this was going to be a really cute and romantic game. I was totally wrong. It takes WEEKS to get good relationships with at least one animal. I spent a lot of time working and getting the eye prescription stuff and bathing suit, and yet no one was pleased a lot except Jiyeon. Warning everyone, you have to CONSTANTLY save your game. If you mess up once, and don't quick save or save in general, you have to start all over. (Wow, they should really have a tutorial or something to mention about this in the game!! I didn't think there were any ""bad endings"") You have to hear the intro music and your MC talking again and again and again. It took me DAYS to get the ""bunnies"" and ""cats"" into humans. I finally did it with Jiyeon just now, but I really wanted Jisoo. And I got a bad ending. Again. With not even the main characters, but her school friend?? Why is he a bad ending? He should not be a part of the whole story.Another thing that makes me frustrated with this game is that we should have the option, once they turn into humans, it doesn't matter who you talked/played with when they were an animal, you should still be able to romanticize/interact with the others. I  just wanted to get to the point where they were finally HUMANS and when I did, they were all angry at me because apparently I spent a lot of time with Jiyeon, even though I talked A LOT to Jisoo? I also think the MC burns a lot of stress and you are forced to study and nap a lot. That gives me NO time to see the animals and manage to get them happy and into humans. Do not recommend this game at all. Needs a lot of help. "

												You play as a modern Korean who's buckling under the immense stress of her successful mother's high expectations.  At the beginning of the game, five men who before they come to you were of varying social status in their medieval-fantasy homeland end up as your roommates.  With their help you find your way in life.  Also you have to date one of them because this is that sort of game.Both the personalities and the backstories in this game go very deep.  I kept getting surprised by each new side of a character I found.  There are even a decent number of unexpected but nicely foreshadowed twists.  Whenever I heard a conversation between the current path's love interest and another character, I found myself anticipating playing the other character's path so that I could find things out from his perspective.  Each new perspective turns out to be very worthwhile to learn (the plot of each path is completely different, and you learn a different facet of the shared backstory).Also, the $30 pricetag seems kinda big, but it's totally worth it.  This game has a loooot of content.  There are five love interests, and within a given love interest's path, both the good (happy/bittersweet) ending and the bad ending (separate from just failing the relationship) have very different stories, depending on which one you're headed to.  As of writing this I've reached nearly three endings and have played over fifteen hours (and this includes skipping everything in the shared beginning part of the story).			"

												I'll start with this - ALWAYS have an internet connection up, or you could lose data. The game is barely worth $30, if not for all the extra interaction it gives the player. The depth of the story was impeccable, I was totally immersed as the game progressed. The art is beautiful, but not my taste. The male characters are shallow, and the main character has no presence. She may have a different personality from other heroines as she doesn't start with amnesia or the like, but her obsession got old. Their ""love"" was not exactly present, as they don't really get to know each other. The translation is far from what I could do, but sloppy as there are plenty of mistakes. The game requires an internet connection. I have much larger games on steam that I can play in offline mode, yet this game needs an internet connection for cutscenes. My game is extremely buggy as the sound glitched every 5 minutes and it never completely exits out of the game. The reason why I've clocked so many hours on this game is because it never fully exits until I restart my whole computer, exiting steam is not enough to shut the game down. Some music choices don't exactly match with the game, this isn't a huge deal, but a good soundtrack makes a tremendous difference. The skill levels take a lot of grinding, and I spent a few weeks without needing to level up anything. Although I was happily surprised to interact with the game unique from other visual novels, it takes away from the player getting to know the character, and expressing the player's individual personality. The only real times you as the player get to pick responses is on dates. I really enjoyed my time playing this game, and I look forward to finishing it completely. But I can't recommend the game. The story was completely unique and refreshing as I love the premise of the story, but it fell short of my expectations. It got to the point where after my first playthrough, I got bored as I felt that I, as the player was not involved in a visual novel game. This game was made with love, but there are better games to buy instead.			"

												What will you do if one day you wake up just to find 5 animals seated in a basket by your bed? You don't how they got in your arpartment, particular who brought them. Maybe it was a thief? But why would a thief break in just to leave some animals behind? You don't know. There's only one thing you know. For you these animals are your friends. They were the best thing that happend in your life. They are special. In more than one way, but you can't imagine in which ways yet. Dandelion impressed me with a lovely/dramatic/breathtaking/funny/sad story, awesome artwork and of course good music. As VNfan there's no way you should miss this story.			"

												I adore Cheritz and Nameless is my *favorite* game of all time. That said, I abhor this game.  I will tell you my personality: I want to unlock everything and play everyone's endings. This is not the game for that. I've played this for 11 hours and *still* cannot get an ending (even with all the walkthroughs, and it's not because i'm a bad player). The stat raising is disgustingly tedious. If you like stat raising for hours and hours with no reward - buy this game!  If this were 5 or 10 dollars - maybe. But after the masterpiece that was Nameless I am sick to my stomach that I paid 30 dollars for this game.BRING THE HATE, DANDELION FANS. I don't care how much you like the idea of humping a bunny or a cat - it would be easier and cheaper to do that IRL than in this game.			"

You level stuff up during the week and then go out on dates on the weekend. Although I would say that this game is much better. The CGs are nice and there is a tsudere bunny which is the best. <3 Jiwoo!It's also nice to be ""seduced and loved"" in Korean. It's different than Japanese but the voice acting is still good!

												Just finished my first playthrough of this game today, and I loved it.  It has a well-developed backstory for our protagonist and she's relatable and quite ordinary - in the best way possible.   It plunges you into the storyline quickly, so you don't get bored waiting for the game to ""start"".  The art is gorgeous.  Both animals and humans are insanely adorable visually, and (especially a certain spotted one that captured my heart immediately) insanely adorable emotionally/behaviorally.  :>  They all have their own personalities and quirks that add to their charm, and if the route I played through is any indication, they likely all have backstories worth learning.  I'm certainly satisfied with my choice of romance and experiencing his story.  Honestly, I rather fell in love with him and the protagonist as a pair - they had similar heartbreaks in their pasts and seemed a natural fit together, both able to empathize with and support the other.  I hope the other routes are as fulfilling (although secretly, in my experience the first romance is always the best, otome game or other, since you gravitate toward the one that speaks to you, not the protagonist per se).  That ending, though... ye olde heartstrings be pulled, aye.One thing I wasn't aware of when I first started playing was that various scenes have Korean voice acting!  Which was an interesting surprise for me, since I'm extremely familiar with Japanese, but extremely unfamiliar with Korean.  Had to train myself to pause a second before furthering the dialog in a voiced scene, just in case there was just a pause in the sentence and not a full stop.  XD  Word to the wise: save often and don't let the pressure get to you.  >:)  Have fun!  I'm sure you'll love it.  <3			"

												Pros:-	Strong overarching story-	Characters are interesting and more complex than they seem at first sight-	Nice artwork (not particularly innovative, but professionally done outside of a few awkward proportions)-	Expressive VA cast-	The protagonist has a defined character and her own deep-seated emotional issues (unlike the blank slates found in many other otome games)-	Evokes a wide range of emotionsCons:-	The writing/translation. It’s certainly a localization and not just a computer translation, but there are a lot of typos, mixed names, repetition, and awkward phrases.-	3/5 guys will do things that are off-putting; how you feel about them individually will depend on your personal tolerance levels and preferences-	Though the protagonist avoids one otome game cliché, she does fall into another: being really clueless about love After completing all the routes and the bonus story, the whole of Dandelion feels greater than the sum of its parts. Most people would be able to find at least one character they can connect with, and the story has more complexity and emotional weight than the premise suggests. I just wish more care had been taken with the prose and translation, which hold back what is otherwise an entertaining, professionally made visual novel. Nonetheless, it is one of the more ambitious and well-made otome games available in English, so I would recommend it if you are interested in the genre.			"

												Pros:- amazing artwork- great voice acting (even the MC was voiced!)- I personally felt the MC was very relateable. - Once you get all the good endings, you learn more about the wizard, which adds to the story Cons:- it's a stat-based otome (ugh)- grammatical errors everywhereMy main gripe about the game was the fact that it was a stat-based otome. I would much rather have a typical visual novel then spend my time grinding or wasting my time throughout the game. The characters were all likable enough for me to go through all of that though. WIth that being said, I'd like to point out that I think Heejung has to be the most fleshed out MC I've seen in an otome so far, which I absolutely loved. I really do wish the scripts were proof-read beforehand though. Not only are there many grammatical errors throughout the game, I've seen the game switch around the characters names (making some scenerios confusing at first), and even mispelling names at a few points.

												There may be spoilers. I will try to avoid it but I can't gaurantee it. So I will say from the start this is only a game you should buy if you don't mind getting a sad/happy ending. Now I know it got a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥from people about it but if we look at it honestly, can we really expect every single game to have a happy ending? Where would the creativity be? It's kind of similar to the ""good"" ending in Mass Effect 3 type thing.Another issue in the game is apparently the translation. I can understand from the viewpoint of someone that speaks another language fluently besides English how frustrating that can be sometimes but it is WELL translated for what it's worth.Which brings me to the next issue of the price. It *is* a little too high for the amount of content but I don't think that the price should be reduced too drastically. There's good art and good storyline to be had.Also another point is that this game took me WAY longer than I'd have liked to figure out. There's a great guide online for it I eventually had to follow because I just couldn't manage the stats well. It's a grinding game. There's a lot of specific things you have to do and for certain people you can't have any love points with any others or you can't progress etc.All in all I think it's a good game but maybe the price should be lowered a tad to be worth it.

												I highly recommend playing this fantastic otome/visual novel game! It's a must have for people who like these sort of games!!Although it wasn't perfect in a case where I encountered a few visual/interaction game bugs mostly because I was speeding through the game to get all the endings. I'll say my experience with this game has been very good none the less.With it being my first ever otome game, I can say that this is a very player friendly game to play when it comes down to getting good and bad endings compared to some other otome games. It's actually easier to get the good endings than the bad endings in this game... which is good imo! But I still think they should of made the good endings a little harder to get or at least have an achivement point system where you are actually bothered to get all the endings in the end to get a secret good ending when you have completed all of the good ending-routes.The characters are also quite interesting and unique (so-so on some such as Jiyoen and Jiuen). You can instantly notice that they have their own unique personality off the bat as animals, and once they turn into humans they get even better and easier to build relationship with them.Thankfully this game managed to gather and develop all the usual romance personalities a heroine can fall in love with (tsundere, yandere, outgoing, shy, inteligent). Although some of them did stray off a bit or it got too much of it, it usually all ended up being good near the ending of the game where you hear each character's backstory and their ending.When you know you are torn about chosing a spotted rabbit or a black cat, you know there's something going on here...To sum it up:PROS:* Characters* Beautiful Artstyle (some angles are a little weirdly drawn though)* Humor* Pro voice acting* Overall good storyCON:* Gameplay (it gets very repetetive - esp if you go for all routes + endings.)* Music is somewhat bland/repetetive* Minor visual bugs when quick speeding* Translation is sometimes off, but understandable anyway.* No achivementsOverall score: 7/10 - 8/10			"

												I posted this on my tumblr months ago, and it may be more of a conspiracy theory than a review, but here it is anyway.  ~*~*~*~SPOILER ALERT!~*~*~**~  (I probably wouldn't read this if you haven't played the game yet, but if you haven't, please know that I would definitely recommend it for all the feels.)SO I’ve been done with Dandelion - Wishes Brought to You - for a number of months.  Once I had finished all routes and unlocked the “true ending”, my mind was BLOWN.  For days and days afterward, my head was absolutely consumed with only thoughts of the Wizard, swimming with all sorts of thoughts, and it wasn’t until now that I think I have found a platform on which to share said thoughts.  So here goes….  (Sorry, it gets long-winded.)Alright, I’m going to come out and say it.  As mentally unstable the Wizard is, he is my favorite suitor, with dark horse* (note: not an actual horse) Jieun coming in at a close second.  That’s right.  Baby bunny FTW, you know, if the Wizard didn’t exist and all.In order to understand what a crazy puppetmaster and schemer the Wizard is, let’s first take a look at our suitors and their motivations for being in The Game.   Bossy, opinionated Jiwoo doesn’t give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about romancing your♥♥♥♥♥  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because he wants to run away from his old life.  I know, technically he wants revenge on his “family”, but eventually, he changes that to wanting a fresh start.  If he happens to lose his memories, painful as they are, so much the better.  As for serious contenders, Jiwoo is pretty down there on the bottom of the list.Much like Jiwoo, Jiyeon (that ♥♥♥♥ing heartbreaker…. all the tears I cried for him) wants revenge and/or a fresh start since his world no longer holds anything he cares about.  He’d be going home to an empty life.  If you don’t play his route, he seems perfectly happy; if you can take the abuse of chasing him down, then yeah, eventually he’ll be happy and all, but really I think he just wants to be left alone.Beautiful Jihae also doesn’t give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about romancing your♥♥♥♥♥  He’s too hung up on his past lady and being uber depressed about her to even notice you have boobs.  In fact, the only reason he’s playing The Game is because Jieun is making him!  Does he care if he wins the heart of a new lady love?  No.  He had already surrendered to his depressingly overwhelming need to be needed, dedicating (tenfold) his life to caring for Prince Jieun.  So, not a contender.The rabbit prince, while my darling, also has no desire to actually win your heart, or the game.  He wants Jihae (”Eddy”) to be happy, and so the two are each wishing the other would win, but never striving to win themselves. For all four of these characters, it isn’t until you start trying to win them over that they take notice of you.  But pay attention to the phrasing there: You win them over.  YOU.  WIN.  Not them.  They are still pretty much inactive players in The Game.Which brings us to Jisoo, the only player of The Game who is actually trying to win.  Even in routes outside of his own, Jisoo tries to appeal to Heejung, whether it’s as the big brother “please depend on me” type, a confidant, or an outright rival to the suitor in question, and this is because he is the ONLY ONE with something to lose if he does not win.  If he does not win, his sister will die.  End of story.  So yeah, he tries real hard, whether you notice him doing so or not because you’re making moony eyes over some other dude is irrelephant.  Even the Wizard himself had said that Jisoo had been his choice to win the game, but stick a pin in that and we’ll come back to it.As gorgeous and mostly dependable as he is, Jisoo is not without his flaws.  He has a violent jealous streak that is frightening under normal circumstances, and CRAZY TERRIFYING when he finally snaps (see the bad ending OMG).  Enter the Wizard.  (My husbando.)  So far we have 4 not-entirely-committed players, and one must-win player with a history of violence, who has been hand-picked as the prize-horse* (note: not actual horse) by the Game organizer.  Naturally, The Wizard must have known about Jisoo’s violent temper and jealousy, and therefore knew he was a ticking time bomb. He must have hoped that he would win so that Jisoo’s relationship with Heejung would eventually become so abusive that Heejung would have a desperate wish, and then, FINALLY, meet The Wizard (possibly again?), and he can step in and save her.  The Wizard is really such a tragic character, constantly being denied his own happiness, it’s no wonder why he’s so twisted.  I really wished that he had his own “after” route that we could play through.  He sacrificed everything he was just to be with Heejung, not even fully knowing if it would work.  Since he wished, he probably lost his memories, but you know what?  I think that’s okay.  He would wake up without the pain and bitterness that twisted his personality like it did, next to the one he loved so much.  Granted, he wouldn’t remember that either, but, this way they could start off and build a real, true, lasting love.  That’s a story I want to play.			"

												7/10Fantastic artwork and good voice acting, as expected from Cheritz, buuuuuuut...well. The endings aren't particularly satisfying, the gameplay is grinding at best, and the hidden character doesn't get his own route?? I got this game for its prettiness, and on that account I was not disappointed. And despite the repetitive gameplay I did manage to clear all of the happy endings... If all you're looking for is a pretty visual novel-type otome game, this is for you.			"

												I am a huge fan of Cheritz, so far I have loved all their games. This one seems to have it all, great story, lovable characters (even the ""villian""), beautiful art and music. This game will warm your heart one minute and break it the next. My only complaint is that it was very slow with story progression. I would often become bored with the stat raising in between scenes. Though in the end it was worth it for the overall experience!			"

												How in the world did I spent 82 hours playing a game about bunny and cat boys... The same way I'll make it to 100 hours! Must touch all the butts! I swear, it does get a but repetititve, but for the stat-grinder in me, I always get what I'm going for with plenty time to spare. A little more explanation could be better to help with the language gap, but overall its a lovely play. All the boys are more than just what they seem to be. I even thought the jokes about itself were rather entertaining! Good art, decent lines, though not overly romantic for 5 men trying to woo lady, and some great VO. Even if it's Korean, its lovely.  MANY, many thanks to the added english translations for the note and free talk bonuses as well. Can I say too much about how much I like this game? No, No I cannot. =^.^=			"

There are little things you have to max such as art skill beauty etc, but once you know what everything does its not really tedious at all - just takes a bit of getting used to.They have a quick save and load option which is a big plus.For me It was well worth the money I loved every minute of this game, it even made me want to review something for the first time!

												i really like the characters.  that alone enough to push me through this game. except the game. i don't like that much because stat raising is not the funnest thing after  stat raising wrongly , then using only one save file and having to restart the whole thing. BUT you♥♥♥♥♥♥it up like, 3 more times because you refuse to see any guides and still use one save file because you're dumb but after the 5th time you decide. ""FINE. I GIVE UP"" And realize to touch a certain long haired rabbits butt, you need to heart raise someone else that he cares about to 1 or 2 hearts AND I'M JUST SO♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ABOUT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE TELL ME ""DON'T TOUCH EVERYONE'S BUTT YOU'LL GET A BAD ENDING"" SO I DIDN'T AND I'M SO MAD AT MYSELF FOR NOT OBVIOUSLY SEEING I NEEDED TO BE FRIENDLY WITH 2 RABBITS DAMN IT. But.... i will finish this game. i admit. i am 14.4 hours in  (well, i also leave it on while i surf the web but..) and i have yet to finish a route, but I do not care.... i will finish the game because the characters are (well... seems to be so far....) worth it. so be warned... you may want to look up a walk through. or at least see what the guys like so you can stat raise properly unlike me.....also,super duper awesome art.nice music, all that stuff is good.

												There may be spoilers. I will try to avoid it but I can't gaurantee it. So I will say from the start this is only a game you should buy if you don't mind getting a sad/happy ending. Now I know it got a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥from people about it but if we look at it honestly, can we really expect every single game to have a happy ending? Where would the creativity be? It's kind of similar to the ""good"" ending in Mass Effect 3 type thing.Another issue in the game is apparently the translation. I can understand from the viewpoint of someone that speaks another language fluently besides English how frustrating that can be sometimes but it is WELL translated for what it's worth.Which brings me to the next issue of the price. It *is* a little too high for the amount of content but I don't think that the price should be reduced too drastically. There's good art and good storyline to be had.Also another point is that this game took me WAY longer than I'd have liked to figure out. There's a great guide online for it I eventually had to follow because I just couldn't manage the stats well. It's a grinding game. There's a lot of specific things you have to do and for certain people you can't have any love points with any others or you can't progress etc.All in all I think it's a good game but maybe the price should be lowered a tad to be worth it.

												Dandelion Wishes Brought to You..... What can I say about this game? Fluffy? Oh yeah it's got fluff. But it also has darker moments, sad moments, and the endings will tug at your heart making you want to cry with the MC. But those kind of things won't help ya understand what this game can be like. This game has so much to offer and a few things I wasn't too fond of. So let's get started.CONS: Honestly I really really dislike the stat raising. Don't get me wrong I have seen that others like it but for me it made avoiding the worst of the bad endings {I'm sorry but that nerd from art class getting the girl 4 times while I was chasing Jisoo drove me nsane.} Trying to avoid bad endings in this game is like trying to avoid a cold during winter, its damn near impossible. However the personal bad endings have much more to them than I could ever describe. I honestly only got one person's bad ending {twice.....} but it still made me cry and want to punch the person..... Yeah I am pretty mean.The Mc is one of my other problems. While she is what most would think of when playing a game like this, quiet and shy, she doesn't have much of a back bone against the guys. When Jisoo, or Jiwoo even, are rude she doesn't get defensive, doesn't stand up for herself.  Yes I understand that most people wanna see the shy cute girl win the man at the end but she takes a lot of verbal abuse in this game.Translation/spelling errors...... I saw a couple, not many worth noting, though I did have a glitch with Jiwoo that had him repeating the same thing three times and another with Jihae that did something similar. Not sure if it was a glitch or if that was translation errors. They didn't ruin the game really but it can mess up the flow if you don't expect it.PROS: The story line. Ok first, and this has to be said, play as many times as you can. Play everyone. Like seriously the more you play, the more you will see as you romance each of the guys. THE WIZARD! Seriously I love this dude. Like he is in the pro list even if no one else likes him. Watching the bonus story for him, which you do have to get all five good endings so good luck, is so touching yet so messed up. I adored him when I first saw him. I was crepped by his voice in the beginning but as each playthrough progressed I started to love his characters, his part in the game, so much more.The characters in general are so much fun to watch during the game. *Spoilers ahead*Jisoo I think has one of the most touching storylines yet also has a much darker personality.  His possessive streak can be a bit much for anyone who has dealt with abusive people who are that possessive but that actually fades away eventually. That fading away allows you to see the real him, the side that is sweet, caring, and just so damned adorable.  Even though I joke to friends he is a perv, which he really is, he is much more than that.Jihae..... oh what I can I say about this poor man. His story will make you wish you can just hug him tight. His bad ending will make you freak out while crying because of his abandonment. OUt of all of the guys I think he is the one I feel needs the character most.Jiyeon.... Just a warning this cat boy is not all he seems and you will find that out about mid way through the game. He and at least one other character leave for a time, though this allows you to get your meters raised as well as your stats. Jihae, Jiyeon and the other character{who I can not remember off the top of my head} have the best bet of raising stats to acceptable levels while you wait for days you can talk to them.Jiwoo ..... Seriously this bunny♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off at first. He is a typical tsundere with a chip on his shoulder and a superiority complex. But he has his own soft side and when it shows you might just forgive him for how often he calls you stupid.Oh the baby bunny Jieon....... This is why I put the spoilers..... This kid is amazing. FIrst he starts growing up enough to realize he can't keep letting Jihae baby him. Then he starts showing more and more amazing strength hidden under that cute visage. And finally the way he drops that bomb about the Wizard not getting the girl.... PRICELESS. I adored this kid after I finished his playthrough. I mean seriously the little bunny became a badass by his ending and actually grew up really handsome to boot. It was amazing. Honestly this game has more than I could tell without completely ruining the game for anyone reading this. You need to play it to see all of the touching moments, all the scary or painful ones, and all the ones that will make you cry.			"

												This game is absolutely worth its price. I love it and it honeslty like...kills me when the stories end. I would get so excited when the loading screens would appear to signal a new installment in the story. Well-rounded cahracters, including the protagonist! as a girl who's played games and dating sims my whole life it's refreshing to play as a girl who has her own personality, story, and background that's revealed to you. also dude I love jisoocomplaint though: definitely uhh romanticizes abusers? the jisoo bad ending is obviously meant to be scary as hell and you're not supposed to think it's a good thing, but jiyeon's good ending makes me uncomfortable. it definitely sends the message that abusers deserve a second chance, that if you just listen to their story and keep trying then they'll stop abusing you and start loving you. which is not how it works. I've got no beef with heejung because she behaved in a way that many abuse survivors do; I was dissappointed that the game allowed the option for a ""happy"" ending with jiyeon after he mentally and physically abused heejung			"

I've played quite a few games like this one, and it's definitely one of the best. I found myself really enjoying getting to learn more about all of the boys' pasts, and there were definitely a lot of things that surprised me, especially with a certain orange tabby. Although there were a few little typos here and there, the translations were pretty good from what I could tell.  I'd definitely recommend this game to people who like playing dating sims. :)			"

												Extremely well done! In writing, art, and voice acting, this game's got it all! A lot of work was put into this game and it's pretty easy to tell. Especially with how long it takes to get through a route, you definitely get your money's worth even just playing one of the five, but by playing each character's stories, some might say this game is underpriced! It's a steal!On another note:This game will have you at the edge of your seat, not going to lie. I'm an emotional person and let met tell you, if you are one, too, then be ready to cry. A lot. Each character has their unique personality so if you only like a certain type, there'd definitely be one just for you.  I personally perfer cutesy type characters like Jiyeon, but I have a friend who didn't like any of the characters, but once we started heading down Jisoo's bad route, she really started to like him.All I have to say is that if you like any type of otome game, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is a must-play game. Lots of heart-wretching stories, lots of variety in character, lots of tears. "

												I'm not too far into the game (One Character-Bad Ending done) but I really like it so far. The artwork is really good, the voice acting is really good and the story is decent (a bit mysterious, but again, I'm not too far in). I don't like that things aren't really explained, for example, I didn't know when the heart bar was filled, you can unlock different activities and I don't know the purpose of things (like the books you can buy). I also feel like there isn't truly much in the way of choices(besides picking one thing to do at home each day of the week and one thing on the weekends).But overall: A really good game for those that like Visual Novels.

												I bought this game a few months after it first came out and am thrilled that it is getting the attention it deserves on Steam! I knew very little of this game before I bought it and was blow away by it.The story deals with relatable, realistic problems; though there are some cliché elements. The story is completely character-driven, which is something I like. The narration is well done, though there are typos. There are five routes plus one Bad End for four of the routes, making a total of nine times you’ll have to play the game at least in order to complete everything. However if you mess up and don’t get enough stamps to unlock some of the extras, you may find yourself playing routes over. The good thing about this game is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously, yet can still make you sympathetic towards the characters.The art work is fantastic. The artist did a great job at keeping a theme with the coloring and style. There is a background in almost all the CGs –the ones that don’t seem fine without. Only critic is that some CGs would have looked better if drawn from a different angle.The background music does a good job at music setting the mood. I liked the soundtrack, however if you don’t you can simply set the BGM to off and still hear the characters beautiful voices. The voice actors are what bring the characters to life. All the voice actors are talented and display their characters perfectly.Each character has a different backstory and character development that is believable and well-written.Heejung makes a great main character because she is someone easy to relate to or at least one the player will be able to sympathize with. Cheritz did the right thing by not making her a blank-insert for the player. It’s better to have a relatable character than an insert for a story so character-driven. I have mixed feelings for Jisoo; I liked him in every route but his own. He is a “big-brother” type character. I have a similar opinion of Jihae; I liked him, but hated his route. Jiyeon was my least favorite; I found him to be rather selfish, didn’t enjoy his route either. Jiwoo was, to my surprise, my second favorite; he’s silly but also serious at times. I think he was the one best suited for Heejung. Jieun was my favorite; his route is the happiest one in my opinion.For the other characters there is not much to say: The wizard makes an interesting sort of “villain.” I can’t say more without spoilers. Other minor characters, such as classmates and Heejung’s mother, serve their purpose.Lastly there are a few things that should be mentioned: I’d recommend playing the demo first. It is a stat-based game, which I love but I know other otome gamers despise. Everyone has personal opinions, so you may hate or love most of the characters. Many people complain about the price of the game, however it is long and you are likely to replay it and it is nowhere near some of the prices of otome games from Japan. I enjoyed this game to its fullest and would/have recommend(ed) it.			"

												At first I was a little leery of purchasing this game, especially with the stat system. I had played Spirited Heart and was sorely disappointed with the system and how I couldn't romance a guy AND try to aim for the goal that was set out for me. So when I saw that there was a demo to Dandelion I decided to give it a try. Before I knew it the demo was over and I desperatly wanted to know what was next.That right there was a good sign that I would like the full version of the game. I didn't delay in purchasing it and pursuing Jihae (I did have to check a guide to make sure I was on the right track) and oh man. The feels. He was so sweet, kind, loving, and was a tiny bit jealous. The story line was good, I could relate to the heroine , the art and the music is FANTASTIC. And while raising your stats to try to woo your choice of bachelor you had a good chance in interacting with them if they were in the room. Yes, I had to quick save and quick load to get that to happen sometimes but the fact that I could was awesome.What I mostly love about this game though was how much I really grew to care about Jihae. I was nearly as heartbroken as the Heroine towards the end of the story line (trying not to spoil the ending). I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys these kind of games. I *do* recommend checking the guide available on steam if you want a decent idea what you should do without any spoilers. Some of these bachelors are *tough* to get. All in all? *Great* game. 10/10!			"

Personal Opinion - I bought this game a couple years ago when it first came out in English, and I do not regret it. It's a visual novel with a lot of emotional pull. There is something about each of the routes you can play that will elicit some sort of emotion from you, and they're not always happy ones. This game will twist your heart into knots.Technical Aspects - In the original non-Steam version, there were a few typos in the English subtitles, but nothing that hinders comprehension or gameplay. Saving and reloading is easy, the menu easy to navigate. There is also a 'skip read text' option for those who hate re-reading text found in multiple routes. You can tweak how fast the text appears on your screen, and how fast it auto scrolls for those that choose that option.Gameplay - The stat raising you need to do for each route is a little confusing and monotonous, but there are plenty of handy guides online to help you figure out witch stats you need for which routes and how to raise them. Like this[otomesweetheart.tumblr.com], which tell you things like you need to worry about your art stat the most with Jisoo and such. There are 'Bad Endings' in some of the routes. Whether you try to get them for completionists sake is up to you, though if you can handle disturbing scenes in your games you should, if for no other reason than to get all the CG's and to have a peak into the characters darker sides.Personal Rating  - 9/10: the monotanous stat raising and occasional typo detracts one star from an other wonderful game. =)			"

												I just started playing this game because I wanted to try checking out more Cheritz games since I've only played the last one they've created (Mystic Messenger) and so far it's really enjoyable!In the beginning I did get a couple bad endings because her pressure got too high or not enough hearts with one animal/man in the beginning but once you get the hang of everything it's really easy breezy.I've only finished Jiwoo and Jiyeons route but so far my favorite is Jiwoo ^^ I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of there stories!! (Jiwoo's really made me emotional, I got way too attached to him lolol)			"

												Dandelion-wishes brought to you, is what we in the otome world would call a ""Stat based otome game"". That means in order to get he boys to love you, you need to raise your stats. But don't go away yet! I myself am not a big stat based otome game fan! (mainly because I hate leveling since I'm lazy) The stat raising isn't all that boring, and actually quite fun! Not to mention ther are plenty of cut scenes inbetween leveling up! I love the quick save feature so I can see the different reactions! This game is both funny, and tear creating! It will probably take you a while to finish all the routes in order to get the final route, but I assure you it is completely worth it!			"

												Extremely well done! In writing, art, and voice acting, this game's got it all! A lot of work was put into this game and it's pretty easy to tell. Especially with how long it takes to get through a route, you definitely get your money's worth even just playing one of the five, but by playing each character's stories, some might say this game is underpriced! It's a steal!On another note:This game will have you at the edge of your seat, not going to lie. I'm an emotional person and let met tell you, if you are one, too, then be ready to cry. A lot. Each character has their unique personality so if you only like a certain type, there'd definitely be one just for you.  I personally perfer cutesy type characters like Jiyeon, but I have a friend who didn't like any of the characters, but once we started heading down Jisoo's bad route, she really started to like him.All I have to say is that if you like any type of otome game, Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is a must-play game. Lots of heart-wretching stories, lots of variety in character, lots of tears. "

												I was a bit doubtful of this game at first because I didn't know how I felt about dating my pets but the otome game seemed popular so I gave it a go. I'm glad I gave this game a chance, the graphics are beautiful and the protagonist's back story is very relateable and realistic.Furthermore, the character development is very enjoyable. The only thing that frustrates me is how hard it is to get a good ending but that might just be me. There are also minor spelling mistakes but that's not such a big deal. It's also really hard to find good otome games in English, atleast for me since I enjoy quality animation so this was a great find.			"

												Repeatedly crashes at loading screens, making it almost unplayable at times. As well, to get the good endings, it's quite difficult to raise all the stats required, and it almost feels like cheats should be implimented for those whom cannot. That, or first timers should get better instructions, because it's almost too vague on what you need to do in order to get those good endings with the guys.As much as there are issues, this is a damn good game. Amazing art, very well done voice acting, excellent translation into English, funny, cute, enjoyable to spend time on. However, unless those loading screens are done, cheats are implimented, or good endings are easier to achieve through the use of knowledgeable insight to players, I can't whole heartedly recommend it on anything other than ""it looks good"".

												Compelling story and voice acting with mostly attractive artwork (Jiyeon looks a bit derpy to me outside of the special CG). I like the way you build relationships with many actions, so you don't miss out on the guy you choose by simply saying the wrong thing. The main character is tolerable and cute, compared to how annoying the heroines can be in this genre. Highly recommended to people who want to experience a great romance.			"

												Dandelion Wishes Brought to You..... What can I say about this game? Fluffy? Oh yeah it's got fluff. But it also has darker moments, sad moments, and the endings will tug at your heart making you want to cry with the MC. But those kind of things won't help ya understand what this game can be like. This game has so much to offer and a few things I wasn't too fond of. So let's get started.CONS: Honestly I really really dislike the stat raising. Don't get me wrong I have seen that others like it but for me it made avoiding the worst of the bad endings {I'm sorry but that nerd from art class getting the girl 4 times while I was chasing Jisoo drove me nsane.} Trying to avoid bad endings in this game is like trying to avoid a cold during winter, its damn near impossible. However the personal bad endings have much more to them than I could ever describe. I honestly only got one person's bad ending {twice.....} but it still made me cry and want to punch the person..... Yeah I am pretty mean.The Mc is one of my other problems. While she is what most would think of when playing a game like this, quiet and shy, she doesn't have much of a back bone against the guys. When Jisoo, or Jiwoo even, are rude she doesn't get defensive, doesn't stand up for herself.  Yes I understand that most people wanna see the shy cute girl win the man at the end but she takes a lot of verbal abuse in this game.Translation/spelling errors...... I saw a couple, not many worth noting, though I did have a glitch with Jiwoo that had him repeating the same thing three times and another with Jihae that did something similar. Not sure if it was a glitch or if that was translation errors. They didn't ruin the game really but it can mess up the flow if you don't expect it.PROS: The story line. Ok first, and this has to be said, play as many times as you can. Play everyone. Like seriously the more you play, the more you will see as you romance each of the guys. THE WIZARD! Seriously I love this dude. Like he is in the pro list even if no one else likes him. Watching the bonus story for him, which you do have to get all five good endings so good luck, is so touching yet so messed up. I adored him when I first saw him. I was crepped by his voice in the beginning but as each playthrough progressed I started to love his characters, his part in the game, so much more.The characters in general are so much fun to watch during the game. *Spoilers ahead*Jisoo I think has one of the most touching storylines yet also has a much darker personality.  His possessive streak can be a bit much for anyone who has dealt with abusive people who are that possessive but that actually fades away eventually. That fading away allows you to see the real him, the side that is sweet, caring, and just so damned adorable.  Even though I joke to friends he is a perv, which he really is, he is much more than that.Jihae..... oh what I can I say about this poor man. His story will make you wish you can just hug him tight. His bad ending will make you freak out while crying because of his abandonment. OUt of all of the guys I think he is the one I feel needs the character most.Jiyeon.... Just a warning this cat boy is not all he seems and you will find that out about mid way through the game. He and at least one other character leave for a time, though this allows you to get your meters raised as well as your stats. Jihae, Jiyeon and the other character{who I can not remember off the top of my head} have the best bet of raising stats to acceptable levels while you wait for days you can talk to them.Jiwoo ..... Seriously this bunny♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off at first. He is a typical tsundere with a chip on his shoulder and a superiority complex. But he has his own soft side and when it shows you might just forgive him for how often he calls you stupid.Oh the baby bunny Jieon....... This is why I put the spoilers..... This kid is amazing. FIrst he starts growing up enough to realize he can't keep letting Jihae baby him. Then he starts showing more and more amazing strength hidden under that cute visage. And finally the way he drops that bomb about the Wizard not getting the girl.... PRICELESS. I adored this kid after I finished his playthrough. I mean seriously the little bunny became a badass by his ending and actually grew up really handsome to boot. It was amazing. Honestly this game has more than I could tell without completely ruining the game for anyone reading this. You need to play it to see all of the touching moments, all the scary or painful ones, and all the ones that will make you cry.			"

												I usually hold off on writing reviews on games until I've played them all the way through, but I'm honestly not sure how long that will take me with Dandelion, and I wanted to go ahead and post up my review. There's a stat system in the game. The stats that you're trying to increase are Beauty, Femininity, and Artistic Skill, while the stats you're trying to decrease are Pressure and Stress. I don't know what purpose these stats serve, but I'm sure that they serve some sort of purpose. Maybe in the places you can visit on your weekends out, or in the way you interact with certain of your lovers, maybe your stats influence the end of the game, dunno and couldn't tell you. I definitely don't mind stat systems in games, and certainly it's not a bad thing to have one, in fact having a stat system can take a dull game and make it decent, however your stats need to have a visible effect on the game, otherwise it just seems kinda pointless to have them at all. You have five choices of lovers, all of whom are introduced within the first three minutes of game play, depending on how fast you read, and who, for the first little while are rather unique in the way you're forced to interact with them. However, it can sometimes be difficult to interact with the one you want. If more than one of your lovers is in a particular room, you have to go to that room and select the right activity to trigger the scene with your desired lover to raise your relationship meter. Sometimes this is impossible, as a large number of the activities that you can perform are locked at the beginning of the game, and sometimes they don't become available to be unlocked until much, much later, and by that point it can be too late, since failure to raise your relationship with your lover leads to game over, or at least it seems to from my experience, so it's entirely possible, and in my case it seems to be common, that you can get forced into pursuing a character you have no interest in just to stop yourself from getting the bad end. There are ""cutscenes"" of a type as well. They run on a scripted course and you have little or no control over the outcome, sometimes these cutscenes trigger for seemingly no reason and can end up undoing a whole lot of work you've done to raise your relationship meter, and other times they trigger because you're about to lose the game, or because you've done something right, for once. However, the cutscenes don't differ much from the rest of the game, so they're not terrible. The story line is trite and cliched, about a young woman out on her own struggling to overcome the burdens of being useless and indecisive until a man, or a group of men, give meaning to her life, so if you're looking for a game with a strong female protaganist this game is not it. There are many ways in which the main character could have been improved, but I think that giving her a brain would have been the best one. I would have found her a much more relateable and believeable character if she hadn't been completely clueless about absolutely everything she encounters in the game. After this long and seemingly negative review, I'm sure you're wondering why I recommend this game. Well, it's for the most basic reason of all. The game is fun. It has a lot of replayability, what with having five romance options and a rotating string of activities, and gives you plenty of options for things to do on subsequent playthroughs. While the price point is a little high, if you have the disposable income and like dating sims this game will be worth your money, if you don't have any kind of a disposable income I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere, since this game doesn't really offer you anything you can't find for cheaper elsewhere.

												Allow me to preface this with a confession. Dating sims are my one true guilty pleasure, and when I say guilty, I mean lock the door, wear headphones, how do I keep people from seeing how many hours I've clocked in with this, it's time to make a salt circle amounts of guilt. That said, most of my enjoyment for the genre comes from a purely cynical place -- I play them because the one dimensional characters, insufferably girly and dense main protagonists, cliche plots and belittling premise of the vast majority of dating sims is utterly hilarious to me. I have a good time of playing them, either with a friend or by myself, and tearing into the faults or pointing out the ridiculousness of them. And I thought I was going to get that here, too. At first glance, this game appears to be a completely unorthodox concept -- touch the butts of your cats and rabbits that are actually hunky guys. I really looked forward to getting a laugh out this -- play it for a bit, then drop it when I couldn't stand it anymore.That was not the case. 'Dandelion, Wishes Brought to You;, is a game with an unorthodox premise that is, without a doubt, one of the most unique and intriguing twists to the dating sim genre that I have ever seen. I immediately became engrossed with the story and characters, who unlike the ilk featured in other products, are well thought out, well rounded, and diverse. I fell in love with every character after only a short time, even the main protagonist (who I believe to be the hardest thing for dating sims to get right). I caught myself on the edge of my seat numerous times, waiting for the next piece of the story to fall into place, and damned if my anticipation wasn't rewarded with every small unveiling to a character's back story, or the plot itself (which has such a shocking climax and reveal that my head is still whirling). For that alone, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Not cynically, either. I recommend this game because its story and characters make it stand out as a masterpiece among other dating sims. I've completed several different routes, seen some amazing endings, and know that I haven't even scratched the surface yet.That said, the game does have its faults. The fact that the game must always be online is a particular fault that's been beaten to death by other reviewers, so I won't go too in depth on the subject, other than to say that I understand why it's necessary. Cheritz it's a small company (with only two games currently under its belt, I believe) based out of South Korea, where the problem with internet piracy is extremely severe. I want this company to succeed, after seeing what they're capable of, and if that means I have to play the game with a decent internet connection, that's fine with me. I support the decision, as difficult as that is to say (Error: 37, never forget), but here it isn't just some dumb move by some CEO that doesn't understand how games or gamers' work. Cheritz has this in place because they need to make sure they can make money off their game, and not be ruined by internet piracy. Even if it's a bit frustrating.Other complaints range between repeating yourself quite a bit while you play -- the utter monotony is divided well between interactions with the boys and cut scenes, I think, and once you're in the flow of things, bouncing between your choice of animal boy, doing laundry, drawing, and taking a bubble bath (to name a few) becomes so second nature you don't really get bothered by it. I can see how this could be a major problem to some players -- the 'you get to do one thing today, because logically it'll take you the whole day to talk to the plants or arrange your 'meaties and veggies' thing is a bit frustrating, but a familiar mechanic in this sort of game. You also have to maintain levels of femininity, beauty and art skill (with the intention of being suitable for your suiter, which I've always found to be a bit of BS) along with balancing your stress and pressure. Personally, I enjoyed having to monitor stress and pressure -- it added an appreciated level of difficulty, as having these stats go too high has consequence (from the dreaded chicken to watching ""boring normal guy"" desperately try to get some booty), but if you didn't come here to juggle stats, you may be less than thrilled.Aaaaand the translation errors. I thought them pretty endearing a first, but as the game went on, I found myself more and more annoyed by the grammatical, html and other text errors, especially when they dare show up during a scene that was meant to have some emotional weight. However, all and all, my experience was never flat out ruined by this -- I merely wished there was more polish at times, especially during serious or somber moments.Oh, the somber moments. Those are what sold this to me, to be honest. This isn't a game where you pick a guy to touch butts with and then go to prom. There's a dark dark cloud lingering over ever interaction. I won't spoil anything, but needless to say, you'll reach a point while playing where you'll get hit, and hit hard. If you prepare to die in Dark Souls, than be prepared to cry in Dandelion. It's a simple interface, with simple design, but damn it if it doesn't know how to tell a story that will get you right in the feels.			"

												Dandelion is a p cute wee dating simulator. It's got quirky characters, a rather odd story line, and overall it's p fun / funny to play. Fricked the bunboy. Bunboy is bae.The only PROBLEM with it that I've had: I can't play the game offline. There's no reason that it should require an internet connection--it's a dating sim that you download to your computer, yet for some odd reason you need to get to an internet connection to play.It's still a great game though, and I definitely recommend.

												This is my first foray into a pure dating sim game to my knowledge and let me say it is a very good jump into the otome pool for me. I watched Dodger and Cry play through one route and decided to buy the game once they took a break between their last route and their new route and I am so glad I did!Basic plot: You play as a girl who is bogged down in schoolwork and constantly overachieves in her studies since she believes it is her only staple of life and she doesn't really -live- or know how to live any other way besides getting the best grades to make her angry mother happy. She wakes up one day to a basket of cats and rabbits in her room and through interacting with them, she realizes just how hollow her life truly is. And then you date one of them.Pros:+Interesting choices for dating partners in the animals.+Backstories for all characters are interesting.+Beautiful artwork.+Multiple routes to go down with each boy (some have bad endings)Cons:-Some grammatical errors.-No English voice acting if you wanted to hear such.-Heejung can come across as really dumb in certain scenarios (whether it is from a translating error or just her own self is unknown)-Heejae (need I say more?)-Lot of micromanaging certain stats that can get a bit tedious over time.

												This game is very good and totally recommend it to fans of THIS kind of visual novels that focus heavily on romance, but I don't feel like it was for me. I much more prefer dating sim games where you can make your own choices, build your own character instead of playing as one that already has a personality (if you can call it that) written in and overall have a story tailored especially for you AS you play the game. Don't get me wrong, the story is pretty good and the artwork is fabulous, but for me, it's just your standard grind love points to get the good ending. If that's what you like, then I totally recommend this game, though it is quite pricey. But, it does have a demo version you can try to see if it's something you'd enjoy. Though I try to stay away from games with prices like this, I can really understand that they had to pay the artist of the gorgeous artwork and the voice actors with something. And the music too. So don't judge by the price. Judge by how much beautiful art and hard work was put into this game and try the demon to see if it's for you.			"

												I’ve got… mixed feelings about this game, to say the least. Wish there was a yellow ""~"" option along with the up and down votes. If you like VNs and Dating Sims, and want to play a decent length game (8ish hours per line) with a lot of interesting types to choose from, then yes, it's a reccomend. We don't get nearly enough of these lengthy foreign titles, and I love to see more of this.If you’re into chicks or just plain not up for a binge of cute, hot guys, then this title is not going to wow you. Finally... If you're also a fan of romance novels, or follow Hanako Games and enjoy the quality writing some local titles have to offer... then I suggest you keep reading.All the characters in Dandelion are fully realized. They’re all typical “types,” bad boy, classy gentleman, dreamy prince, peppy neko ball, and tsundere, stuff that you can hear a couple lines from and say ""yep. I like that one."" The designs are excellent and enticing. They’re supposed to be otherworldly, and they certainly come off that way! And the situations they get into sometimes are hilarious! When all these personalities get together, the banter between them is quick and witty. I wish I could play the whole game with them playfully bickering.But it’s strange. I wonder if I should bemoan the writing, or the translation. I’m not talking about the spelling errors here, I’m talking about the small, personal, and private moments. The moments where your heart is supposed to flutter, and your eyes are glued to the screen, on your gorgeous male moe blob as he finally comes in closer... and closer...! Yeah. Those moments… fall soooooooooo flat in English.I’m trying to understand why… and I wonder, more than any other part of the game, is that a place that needs solid writing. Not just solid scenarios or solid characters. It’s a place where you breach into the sensual realm, of touch and smell. Where word choice is powerful. “He put his arm around me” is worlds away from “His arm slid around my shoulders, cupping me gently.” Readers of VN’s and Romance… People who have enjoyed games like Katawa Shojou, Royal Trap, and Magical Diary, or hell, the brief little tastes of Persona 3&4's romantic moments. you know what I’m talking about, right? There's a kind of writing that can make you melt into a gooey puddle of YES, even if the guy/gal isnt your prepackaged ""type"". There's some powerful stuff in Dandelion's plot that can reduce you to a quivering pile. But the smaller the scene, and the further from the main plot it is, the higher chance the entire moment will be ruined by the flat and simple text.Besides that, it’s easy to get knocked of the cute moeness by Bad Relationship Flags. Oh, it’s not a game mechanic. It’s occasional character moments that are played up as desirable or adorable, but in the real world are indicators of some SERIOUS bad juju, run from that relationship right now! The biggest problems I had were with ""bad boy"" Jisoo... I dont care what kind of situation you're in, man! Getting instant ragegasms for STANDING next to another guy is NOT. COOL.All in all, this is a solid game with solid art, solid characters, solid scenarios… Pandery, cutesy moe pap, sure. But some serious story and writing flaws really get in the way of really enjoying that pap for all it could be.			"

												I highly recommend this game for people who likes otome games or who just like an engaging story with great characters and astounding artwork, and with a main character that is actually above 20 years old, I don't know about you but to me it is a nice change. There are some suggested themes throughout the game but nothing explicit or mature ever happens however. This is a visual novel though and except the stat rising you are mostly reading, so if you crave action then this game might not be for you though.The story seems pretty simple, Hee-jung finds a basket with animals in her room one morning and ends up taking care of them, and after some time it turns out the animals are really humans, or well humans with adorable cat and rabbit ears, and you get to choose which guy she will end up with. But the story is quite dark despite how it appears at first glance, the main character Hee-jung has a very real and relatable background and each of the guys have their own story that are all heartbreaking in their own right that has shaped them into what they are in the game and it makes it hard to settle for just one favourite.The game often had me laughing out loud, especially the guys interractions with or without Hee-jung nearby, only to take a 180 turn and give you a sad or straight out heartbreaking scene. The art work really complements the game well, the character models, the adorable chibis and the locations are all very well done and I eagerly awaited the scenes that would give me a CG.There are five routes to play through, with each guy having a different personality and a captivating story but if you play through all the routes you get to see that there is a bigger story behind it all and there is even sixth route available that gives some interesting insight in the plot of the game.Almost every character also have a bad ending, most are not too bad but I recommend trying to get Jisoo's good ending before his bad end, seriously it's for the best. If you are worried about getting a bad ending then I recommend playing Jieun's route first since he has no bad ending. However it is still good to play Jihae's route before Jieun's since they are connected and the story really plays out better when doing Jihae first.The text is in English or Korean and the audio is Korean, and the person that picked out the actors did an amazing job. Every character has a perfect voice in my opinion and it really makes it easier to relate and get immersed in the game, I especially like that even Hee-jung gets a voice, it's rare to have the female lead in an otome game to have a voice but in my opinion that makes everything better. The music is really good and fits the mood, there's not too much variation but it's always good music, not too much but just enough for you to notice it.There are a lot of spelling mistakes though, even places where character names is switched by mistake and some might get thrown off by it, personally I didn't find it too distracting but for almost 30€ some proofreading before release would have been appreciated.Overall this game was funny, heartbreaking, embarassing and filled with relatable feelings and moments that really makes it hard to pick out a favourite character, my favourite is Jisoo but I can not rank the remaining five so they share a second place. I generally don't play otome games or dating games but this one I really recommend.			"

I probably played 6-8 hours of my first time through going for Jisoo. After that I spent almost 4 hours to complete Jiwoo. Just try to notice the status menu at first (which I did not know about at all until I checked a guide) as it will be very necessary for getting the right ending!But ya, 10/10 <3<3<3			"

												Dandelion was my first Otome game and remains one of my favorites. Very well written with 5 different arch-type personalities to choose from. Different personalities with different motives and different story-arcs, sometimes unexpected. and cute CGs that focus on the guys and male anime eye-candy for players rather than generously proportioned female CGs.Stat building could get a little tedious at times, but I did use different stat routes for each character, giving me some variability. I've only seen one dark ending, which was a little unexpected and off-putting (first time with bad endings), but then went to the walkthrough for the ""good"" endings and loved how they interacted and how different facets of the characters were revealed. For the amount of time I've played it, I consider it well worth the money and it did lead me to buy Nameless which I felt was even more refined and with great storylines as well (not to mention even darker/creepier).There were some mix-ups of names or translation grammer errors, but I knew what they meant and am not that picky. Not to mention some actually gave me a good laugh.Can't wait to see Cheritz's next game!			"

												I wasn't going to buy it because of how much money it was. But it is totally worth it. Every character's background story takes hours to complete. And there's 5 of them, and there's also cards and little things to find. This game is totally worth the $$. So if you're looking for a game where you don't have to do much and you want a good plot line that doesn't get boring even after playing the game so many times, this is the game for you. It's cute and it will ruin your emotions. It's not all sunshine and rainbows. Everyone has problems in this game. But no spoilers. You will easily find yourself missing hours out of your life because of this game so look at the clock every now and again.			"

												This is hands down one of the best Otome games in my opinion.Overall my review on this is 8.5/10Visuals/Graphics: The character artwork is phenomenal. As I've come to expect in Cheritz' games, the artwork in this game is beautiful in regards to the characters. All of the CGI's were well done, and the stories are dynamic and engaging. The bonus content is a great system and gave the MC a bonus on dates with the guy/s of her choice and gives the player a goal to collect the stamps for each of the boys. Gameplay: This is where my 1.5 negative comes down off of the overall score of the game. My reasoning for this is that some of the negative paths are unbearably difficult and specific, namely Jiwoo's path. His bad ending is extremely difficult to enact, and I won't spoil it as there are really good walkthroughs that explain how to get it, but yes. Also It is difficult at times to actually find the character you're trying to engage in the house, so quick saving is a must for certain characters, especially Jiyeon, and Jiwoo. It isn't unbearable by any means but it does require a lot of time to engage specific characters when others may also be triggered by doing said action.That said, the actual stat building in this game is remarkably easy to do, although getting stress and pressure down is hard in the beginning of the game, towards the end assuming you don't wish to unlock activities it makes the game a cakewalk. I loved the story in this game and that there was no real NEED to buy the characters gifts although it does add some extra text options, it made it optional. It was also very easy to make money, and I found it nice that I didn't need to build a huge schedule around going to work or school in order to achieve something. I loved actually sitting down and getting the paths fully completed and I also love that Cheritz was generous enough to offer free steam keys to patrons that paid for the game pre-move to steam. The steam client works wonderfully as long as the game is updated and you're not in ""sharing"" mode on your account. Music/Voice/Audio: This was really well acted. I loved Jisoo's voice acting. I will say though that the fake meows were annoying as hell, but aside from that the music and voices were beautiful and I didn't get sick of listening to either. I also really love the opening song and video for this game. It's really well done. Also I liked that each character has a specific ending song and movie. It added a bit more depth to the game, and it really is worth it.If you don't like stat building Otome games, this isn't for you, however If you do enjoy stat building you'll enjoy it quite a bit. The UI can be a bit ""ugly"" at times and the text could use a bit of work, however - it all runs smoothly and there were no bugs that I noticed which is more than I can say for some VN's/Stat builders out there. It's in my opinion very much worth the expense and The bonus content again is hilarious and awesome. Also I loved the individualized Christmas cards which you can read in the extra's as well. It's a really good purchase, and I don't regret getting this at all. If you like VN's, Otome games, Usagimimi's/Nekomimi's/Catboys/Bunnyboys you'll enjoy this quite a bit. It's got many cute things in it and moments that made me smile.  This was the first game I purchased from Cheritz' that made me a loyal customer in the future. I hope that they make many more games and add them to steam in the future. I really enjoyed this game and Nameless as well. Both are great. :) Thank you Cheritz' and the translation team for translating the game into English for those of us that only understand Hangul or English. :D			"

												Pretty boys in cat / rabbit ears... What else could you ask for?This game offers fairly in-depth characters that actually develop as the story progresses. They're not just quickly drawn pretty boys, they have reasons for how they act and why. For men in animal ears, they're pretty realistic in terms of behaviour. (except falling for this clueless MC, ofc) The music is beautiful, art's well made. The GC's are quite breathtaking.The game takes you along for an emotional ride, and you'll notice yourself getting attached to the characters. Each new playthrough with a new guy felt like a betrayal every time. Until I accepted the fact I just need to touch all of their butts or I won't be happy! The game play gets repetitive quite fast though, with the stat raising and waiting for the days to pass to get to the good parts. For a completionist like me, who needs to get all the bad endings, good endings and extras, after a couple playthroughs it's not that fun anymore. The character dialogue and GC's are deffo worth it though, and skip function for the heavy story parts ftw.Them speaking Korean caught me off guard first as it was the first time I ever heard the language, but you get used to it! So don't let that be the reason you'll miss out on this game. The voice acting is actually really good once you get used to the new language (although I admit, I still think they'd sound better in japanese) and their voices suit them well! It's worth the money, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in dating sims.			"

												Raising stats can get a bit tedious, even so this is an amazing game! The over-all plot to the story is good and the character you play is relatable, the designs are amazing. The only thing I wish was different are the ""good endings""! The Jieun ending is my favorite, and I think it was the easiest to play through too:D			"

												[internally screaming]This game is the most infuriating, typo filled disgusting game I've ever played and I hate myself for wanting more.I honestly could care less about the typos/horrible translations. This game stole my heart and tore me to shreds - and I feel like a masochist for wanting more.I honestly wish for break to be here already so I can marathon the rest of the playthroughs, but for now, I shall continue to sob over Jihea.I recommend this game to anyone with any small interest to dating sims at all, and I swear you will not regret it.

And JiHae in the end was just -not gonna spoil- but JiHae is essentially my dream guy. This is pretty fun but I wish it had more than one ending.			"

												Main character heroine is very relatable and all the routes were fabulous. It gets to be feeling like a grind raising your stats especially if you do all the routes like myself. However, i enjoyed many of the routes so much that i was willing to endure the grind. Definitely gives you the feels(I love Jiwoo's the most).

												I’ve got… mixed feelings about this game, to say the least. Wish there was a yellow ""~"" option along with the up and down votes. If you like VNs and Dating Sims, and want to play a decent length game (8ish hours per line) with a lot of interesting types to choose from, then yes, it's a reccomend. We don't get nearly enough of these lengthy foreign titles, and I love to see more of this.If you’re into chicks or just plain not up for a binge of cute, hot guys, then this title is not going to wow you. Finally... If you're also a fan of romance novels, or follow Hanako Games and enjoy the quality writing some local titles have to offer... then I suggest you keep reading.All the characters in Dandelion are fully realized. They’re all typical “types,” bad boy, classy gentleman, dreamy prince, peppy neko ball, and tsundere, stuff that you can hear a couple lines from and say ""yep. I like that one."" The designs are excellent and enticing. They’re supposed to be otherworldly, and they certainly come off that way! And the situations they get into sometimes are hilarious! When all these personalities get together, the banter between them is quick and witty. I wish I could play the whole game with them playfully bickering.But it’s strange. I wonder if I should bemoan the writing, or the translation. I’m not talking about the spelling errors here, I’m talking about the small, personal, and private moments. The moments where your heart is supposed to flutter, and your eyes are glued to the screen, on your gorgeous male moe blob as he finally comes in closer... and closer...! Yeah. Those moments… fall soooooooooo flat in English.I’m trying to understand why… and I wonder, more than any other part of the game, is that a place that needs solid writing. Not just solid scenarios or solid characters. It’s a place where you breach into the sensual realm, of touch and smell. Where word choice is powerful. “He put his arm around me” is worlds away from “His arm slid around my shoulders, cupping me gently.” Readers of VN’s and Romance… People who have enjoyed games like Katawa Shojou, Royal Trap, and Magical Diary, or hell, the brief little tastes of Persona 3&4's romantic moments. you know what I’m talking about, right? There's a kind of writing that can make you melt into a gooey puddle of YES, even if the guy/gal isnt your prepackaged ""type"". There's some powerful stuff in Dandelion's plot that can reduce you to a quivering pile. But the smaller the scene, and the further from the main plot it is, the higher chance the entire moment will be ruined by the flat and simple text.Besides that, it’s easy to get knocked of the cute moeness by Bad Relationship Flags. Oh, it’s not a game mechanic. It’s occasional character moments that are played up as desirable or adorable, but in the real world are indicators of some SERIOUS bad juju, run from that relationship right now! The biggest problems I had were with ""bad boy"" Jisoo... I dont care what kind of situation you're in, man! Getting instant ragegasms for STANDING next to another guy is NOT. COOL.All in all, this is a solid game with solid art, solid characters, solid scenarios… Pandery, cutesy moe pap, sure. But some serious story and writing flaws really get in the way of really enjoying that pap for all it could be.			"

												This is my first foray into a pure dating sim game to my knowledge and let me say it is a very good jump into the otome pool for me. I watched Dodger and Cry play through one route and decided to buy the game once they took a break between their last route and their new route and I am so glad I did!Basic plot: You play as a girl who is bogged down in schoolwork and constantly overachieves in her studies since she believes it is her only staple of life and she doesn't really -live- or know how to live any other way besides getting the best grades to make her angry mother happy. She wakes up one day to a basket of cats and rabbits in her room and through interacting with them, she realizes just how hollow her life truly is. And then you date one of them.Pros:+Interesting choices for dating partners in the animals.+Backstories for all characters are interesting.+Beautiful artwork.+Multiple routes to go down with each boy (some have bad endings)Cons:-Some grammatical errors.-No English voice acting if you wanted to hear such.-Heejung can come across as really dumb in certain scenarios (whether it is from a translating error or just her own self is unknown)-Heejae (need I say more?)-Lot of micromanaging certain stats that can get a bit tedious over time.

												I bought this game shortly after it came out and I became obsessed with it. It's emotionally wrenching and you become invested in the characters. Sometimes the things to boost your stats gets tedious, but at least the story makes up for it. Make sure that you complete all the routes so that you can get the true route - it's worth it. I really hope that there's a sequel for this game eventually, and that Cheritz keeps up the amazing work/			"

												This is the first game I've ever purchased on Steam and I'm so glad that I did. The CG is gorgeous and the game is challenging yet rewarding. What makes this even better as an otome game, is that they had cute little animals in it! I wish they made a route for Chronos/Wizard...otherwise, my favorite route so far is Jiwoo! I highly recommend this game!!My only complaint is that sometimes, this game might feel like a grind - especially because there's an awkward transition between the activity and night time (it tends to ""lag""/""trip"" there). Use your saves wisely so that you don't have to restart from the very beginning and use the quick save often!			"

												I highly recommend this game for people who likes otome games or who just like an engaging story with great characters and astounding artwork, and with a main character that is actually above 20 years old, I don't know about you but to me it is a nice change. There are some suggested themes throughout the game but nothing explicit or mature ever happens however. This is a visual novel though and except the stat rising you are mostly reading, so if you crave action then this game might not be for you though.The story seems pretty simple, Hee-jung finds a basket with animals in her room one morning and ends up taking care of them, and after some time it turns out the animals are really humans, or well humans with adorable cat and rabbit ears, and you get to choose which guy she will end up with. But the story is quite dark despite how it appears at first glance, the main character Hee-jung has a very real and relatable background and each of the guys have their own story that are all heartbreaking in their own right that has shaped them into what they are in the game and it makes it hard to settle for just one favourite.The game often had me laughing out loud, especially the guys interractions with or without Hee-jung nearby, only to take a 180 turn and give you a sad or straight out heartbreaking scene. The art work really complements the game well, the character models, the adorable chibis and the locations are all very well done and I eagerly awaited the scenes that would give me a CG.There are five routes to play through, with each guy having a different personality and a captivating story but if you play through all the routes you get to see that there is a bigger story behind it all and there is even sixth route available that gives some interesting insight in the plot of the game.Almost every character also have a bad ending, most are not too bad but I recommend trying to get Jisoo's good ending before his bad end, seriously it's for the best. If you are worried about getting a bad ending then I recommend playing Jieun's route first since he has no bad ending. However it is still good to play Jihae's route before Jieun's since they are connected and the story really plays out better when doing Jihae first.The text is in English or Korean and the audio is Korean, and the person that picked out the actors did an amazing job. Every character has a perfect voice in my opinion and it really makes it easier to relate and get immersed in the game, I especially like that even Hee-jung gets a voice, it's rare to have the female lead in an otome game to have a voice but in my opinion that makes everything better. The music is really good and fits the mood, there's not too much variation but it's always good music, not too much but just enough for you to notice it.There are a lot of spelling mistakes though, even places where character names is switched by mistake and some might get thrown off by it, personally I didn't find it too distracting but for almost 30€ some proofreading before release would have been appreciated.Overall this game was funny, heartbreaking, embarassing and filled with relatable feelings and moments that really makes it hard to pick out a favourite character, my favourite is Jisoo but I can not rank the remaining five so they share a second place. I generally don't play otome games or dating games but this one I really recommend.			"

												Let me start off by saying that if you hate cliffhangers, then this game might not be the game for you, because this game will leave you with wanting more. This is because the creator wanted a more realistic senario for the endings. But even if you hate cliffhangers, this game will probably be a favorite for the Buzums...With an amazing story, outstanding art style, and sexy Korean voice actors... ;) You will be playing Dandelion for hours-NO!!! DAYS!!!(ok maybe not days) BUT STILL!!! By the way this game is very anime esc. From the openig theme song to the funny CGs you get from playing through the sexy pets. (That's for all you otakus out there)Speaking of pets and art, you're going to love all the guys from the Cutie Kitties to the Bunny Buzums.All I can say is watch out for your stress and pressure, and try to invest your heart gaudge to builing that up, so you dont get a bad ending, its not as hard as everyone thinks.And I know every one who hasnt played this probably loves the orange cat, Jiyeon, and are deciding to go for him first, but don't put too much hope into this character. (not going to spoill it... just don't judge a book by its cover...)All-in-all, Dandelion- Wishes Broght to you is such a wonderful game. I have never cried, laughed, or smiled this much when playing a dating simulation. Even if you hate games that are all about stat-raising, you will probably get over it soon. The game might be $30 but everything else in the game is just priceless. To you, the game might seem too expensive, but with all of the effort put in this game, the game is worth a mesly $30. At the end of the day, you should buy the game to judge for yourself. I give Dandelion- Wishes brought to you  a 9.5 Bunny Buzums out of 10 Bunny Buzums for my final score.Now excuse me because I hear the cops coming to my house for talking bout the Bunny buzums. Gotta go to jail now but I hope that you do buy this game.			"

												This was my first ever otome game and I was not disappointed. The music is great, the Korean voice acting is great to listen to and the game play is addictive. The story and characters are engaging and it makes you want to keep playing to get to see more artwork. My only criticism would be that some of the dialogue is repetitive; but it is hard to fault the game as it is a direct translation from Korean.  Definitely worth the price I paid imho.			"

It's better than a lot of dating sims I have played as it has a good amount of romance, without getting extremely sexual. Instead, the characters are focused on as well as the reasons for their actions. Jiyeon was my absolute favourite! Though Jieun came close.			"

												I got into this game after watching a let's play video, and I'm so glad that I decided to buy it. While I disliked the busy work they put into the game - they couldn't just let it be a visual novel - the stories themselves were compelling. I will point out that at least one route is very creepy and abusive, though, so word of warning there. All in all, though, I enjoyed it immensely. What makes it extra special is the extra chapter that unlocks after you finish all the endings.			"

												Repeatedly crashes at loading screens, making it almost unplayable at times. As well, to get the good endings, it's quite difficult to raise all the stats required, and it almost feels like cheats should be implimented for those whom cannot. That, or first timers should get better instructions, because it's almost too vague on what you need to do in order to get those good endings with the guys.As much as there are issues, this is a damn good game. Amazing art, very well done voice acting, excellent translation into English, funny, cute, enjoyable to spend time on. However, unless those loading screens are done, cheats are implimented, or good endings are easier to achieve through the use of knowledgeable insight to players, I can't whole heartedly recommend it on anything other than ""it looks good"".

												Just finished my first playthrough of this game today, and I loved it.  It has a well-developed backstory for our protagonist and she's relatable and quite ordinary - in the best way possible.   It plunges you into the storyline quickly, so you don't get bored waiting for the game to ""start"".  The art is gorgeous.  Both animals and humans are insanely adorable visually, and (especially a certain spotted one that captured my heart immediately) insanely adorable emotionally/behaviorally.  :>  They all have their own personalities and quirks that add to their charm, and if the route I played through is any indication, they likely all have backstories worth learning.  I'm certainly satisfied with my choice of romance and experiencing his story.  Honestly, I rather fell in love with him and the protagonist as a pair - they had similar heartbreaks in their pasts and seemed a natural fit together, both able to empathize with and support the other.  I hope the other routes are as fulfilling (although secretly, in my experience the first romance is always the best, otome game or other, since you gravitate toward the one that speaks to you, not the protagonist per se).  That ending, though... ye olde heartstrings be pulled, aye.One thing I wasn't aware of when I first started playing was that various scenes have Korean voice acting!  Which was an interesting surprise for me, since I'm extremely familiar with Japanese, but extremely unfamiliar with Korean.  Had to train myself to pause a second before furthering the dialog in a voiced scene, just in case there was just a pause in the sentence and not a full stop.  XD  Word to the wise: save often and don't let the pressure get to you.  >:)  Have fun!  I'm sure you'll love it.  <3			"

												This is hands down one of the best Otome games in my opinion.Overall my review on this is 8.5/10Visuals/Graphics: The character artwork is phenomenal. As I've come to expect in Cheritz' games, the artwork in this game is beautiful in regards to the characters. All of the CGI's were well done, and the stories are dynamic and engaging. The bonus content is a great system and gave the MC a bonus on dates with the guy/s of her choice and gives the player a goal to collect the stamps for each of the boys. Gameplay: This is where my 1.5 negative comes down off of the overall score of the game. My reasoning for this is that some of the negative paths are unbearably difficult and specific, namely Jiwoo's path. His bad ending is extremely difficult to enact, and I won't spoil it as there are really good walkthroughs that explain how to get it, but yes. Also It is difficult at times to actually find the character you're trying to engage in the house, so quick saving is a must for certain characters, especially Jiyeon, and Jiwoo. It isn't unbearable by any means but it does require a lot of time to engage specific characters when others may also be triggered by doing said action.That said, the actual stat building in this game is remarkably easy to do, although getting stress and pressure down is hard in the beginning of the game, towards the end assuming you don't wish to unlock activities it makes the game a cakewalk. I loved the story in this game and that there was no real NEED to buy the characters gifts although it does add some extra text options, it made it optional. It was also very easy to make money, and I found it nice that I didn't need to build a huge schedule around going to work or school in order to achieve something. I loved actually sitting down and getting the paths fully completed and I also love that Cheritz was generous enough to offer free steam keys to patrons that paid for the game pre-move to steam. The steam client works wonderfully as long as the game is updated and you're not in ""sharing"" mode on your account. Music/Voice/Audio: This was really well acted. I loved Jisoo's voice acting. I will say though that the fake meows were annoying as hell, but aside from that the music and voices were beautiful and I didn't get sick of listening to either. I also really love the opening song and video for this game. It's really well done. Also I liked that each character has a specific ending song and movie. It added a bit more depth to the game, and it really is worth it.If you don't like stat building Otome games, this isn't for you, however If you do enjoy stat building you'll enjoy it quite a bit. The UI can be a bit ""ugly"" at times and the text could use a bit of work, however - it all runs smoothly and there were no bugs that I noticed which is more than I can say for some VN's/Stat builders out there. It's in my opinion very much worth the expense and The bonus content again is hilarious and awesome. Also I loved the individualized Christmas cards which you can read in the extra's as well. It's a really good purchase, and I don't regret getting this at all. If you like VN's, Otome games, Usagimimi's/Nekomimi's/Catboys/Bunnyboys you'll enjoy this quite a bit. It's got many cute things in it and moments that made me smile.  This was the first game I purchased from Cheritz' that made me a loyal customer in the future. I hope that they make many more games and add them to steam in the future. I really enjoyed this game and Nameless as well. Both are great. :) Thank you Cheritz' and the translation team for translating the game into English for those of us that only understand Hangul or English. :D			"

												Allow me to preface this with a confession. Dating sims are my one true guilty pleasure, and when I say guilty, I mean lock the door, wear headphones, how do I keep people from seeing how many hours I've clocked in with this, it's time to make a salt circle amounts of guilt. That said, most of my enjoyment for the genre comes from a purely cynical place -- I play them because the one dimensional characters, insufferably girly and dense main protagonists, cliche plots and belittling premise of the vast majority of dating sims is utterly hilarious to me. I have a good time of playing them, either with a friend or by myself, and tearing into the faults or pointing out the ridiculousness of them. And I thought I was going to get that here, too. At first glance, this game appears to be a completely unorthodox concept -- touch the butts of your cats and rabbits that are actually hunky guys. I really looked forward to getting a laugh out this -- play it for a bit, then drop it when I couldn't stand it anymore.That was not the case. 'Dandelion, Wishes Brought to You;, is a game with an unorthodox premise that is, without a doubt, one of the most unique and intriguing twists to the dating sim genre that I have ever seen. I immediately became engrossed with the story and characters, who unlike the ilk featured in other products, are well thought out, well rounded, and diverse. I fell in love with every character after only a short time, even the main protagonist (who I believe to be the hardest thing for dating sims to get right). I caught myself on the edge of my seat numerous times, waiting for the next piece of the story to fall into place, and damned if my anticipation wasn't rewarded with every small unveiling to a character's back story, or the plot itself (which has such a shocking climax and reveal that my head is still whirling). For that alone, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Not cynically, either. I recommend this game because its story and characters make it stand out as a masterpiece among other dating sims. I've completed several different routes, seen some amazing endings, and know that I haven't even scratched the surface yet.That said, the game does have its faults. The fact that the game must always be online is a particular fault that's been beaten to death by other reviewers, so I won't go too in depth on the subject, other than to say that I understand why it's necessary. Cheritz it's a small company (with only two games currently under its belt, I believe) based out of South Korea, where the problem with internet piracy is extremely severe. I want this company to succeed, after seeing what they're capable of, and if that means I have to play the game with a decent internet connection, that's fine with me. I support the decision, as difficult as that is to say (Error: 37, never forget), but here it isn't just some dumb move by some CEO that doesn't understand how games or gamers' work. Cheritz has this in place because they need to make sure they can make money off their game, and not be ruined by internet piracy. Even if it's a bit frustrating.Other complaints range between repeating yourself quite a bit while you play -- the utter monotony is divided well between interactions with the boys and cut scenes, I think, and once you're in the flow of things, bouncing between your choice of animal boy, doing laundry, drawing, and taking a bubble bath (to name a few) becomes so second nature you don't really get bothered by it. I can see how this could be a major problem to some players -- the 'you get to do one thing today, because logically it'll take you the whole day to talk to the plants or arrange your 'meaties and veggies' thing is a bit frustrating, but a familiar mechanic in this sort of game. You also have to maintain levels of femininity, beauty and art skill (with the intention of being suitable for your suiter, which I've always found to be a bit of BS) along with balancing your stress and pressure. Personally, I enjoyed having to monitor stress and pressure -- it added an appreciated level of difficulty, as having these stats go too high has consequence (from the dreaded chicken to watching ""boring normal guy"" desperately try to get some booty), but if you didn't come here to juggle stats, you may be less than thrilled.Aaaaand the translation errors. I thought them pretty endearing a first, but as the game went on, I found myself more and more annoyed by the grammatical, html and other text errors, especially when they dare show up during a scene that was meant to have some emotional weight. However, all and all, my experience was never flat out ruined by this -- I merely wished there was more polish at times, especially during serious or somber moments.Oh, the somber moments. Those are what sold this to me, to be honest. This isn't a game where you pick a guy to touch butts with and then go to prom. There's a dark dark cloud lingering over ever interaction. I won't spoil anything, but needless to say, you'll reach a point while playing where you'll get hit, and hit hard. If you prepare to die in Dark Souls, than be prepared to cry in Dandelion. It's a simple interface, with simple design, but damn it if it doesn't know how to tell a story that will get you right in the feels.			"

												I usually love stat-raisers (see: Tokimeki Memorial) but Dandelion was pretty mediocre about it. It became a chore, especially for five routes.Two good routes, one ok route, the other two were meh.  ""True ending"" really interesting.Amazing art and voice acting A++Definitely a good start for Cheritz and a great game for people getting into Otome games. It's an awesome game for an Indie company, no less. Definitely reccommend! I got to touch a little boy's♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Dandelion is a wonderful game.  It deals a lot with depression and loneliness.  The story is well thought out and well written and allows for a great deal of play time.The gameplay it's self is not my favorite, I find the ""choosing what you do for the day"" mechanic to be kind of boring and a waste of time.The story has a lot of mysteries to it that slowly unfold as you play through, dealing both with the main character's personal problems that she needs to work through, and the guy's stories.Something I don't care for is that have to choose who you want to pursue fairly early in the game before you've actually had much time to get and know them.  You do not get to interact with them as humans until you've decided, which is a little annoying.  It doesn't matter much on secondary playthroughs, but on the first playthrough it feels like you just have to guess as to who you're going to like.			"

												Pros:+ Voice acting is great+ Music is ♥+ MC is relatable. I liked her a lot.+ The routes are varied and interesting in their own ways.+ Plot is fairly unique and emotional.Cons:+ I actually didn't like that the only result with the mother was a negative one. Was there absolutely no way to work things out? Was the mom really that far gone unreasonable? <-- Not really a con just a personal feather ruffle.+ I feel like grinding stats made the game unnecessarily long.+ Seriously, find a walkthrough to figure out which guys need which stats grinded out. Otherwise you'll just get bad endings.+ Have I mentioned how much I hate raising stats in otome games?There aren't many cons to the game, really. It's well done and I'm looking forward to seeing what Cheritz does in the future.			"

												This game is definitely worth the price, it's now one of my favorite dating visual novels, in the top five for me I'd say(and I've played a lot of this type of game) The characters made really cute animals at the start of the game, kinda felt like a pet simulation game but that was fun too(though I'm a dog person and it would've been even more awesome to have a dog in the mix)-probably one of the reasons I liked Jisoo so much, he was kinda dog-like for a cat.All in all I really enjoyed the story and the characters (well not Jiyeon so much, I have mixed feelings when it comes to his character) anyways Jisoo and Jiwoo ended up being my fave after playing through all the characters stories, and while I'd like to talk about them and other characters(like Jieun-who is just adorable) in this review I'm trying to avoid spoilers. I have to say I did feel the wizard and his character/plot didn't really get that developed but he was cool/creepy enough either way.Right after finishing this I bought their game 'Nameless' and I can't wait to start playing it as I'm sure it's just as good if not better than this which is hard to imagine.

												FYI: The reason my play hours is coming up as so little on steam is because I purchased the game directly from the Cheritz website right when it was released (back in November 2013) and played the whole game then. Don't let the initial synopsis fool you into thinking this will be a ""fun silly game where you date animals"". Sure Dandelion can be fun to play, but it's also SO much more than that. Dandelion's an immersive story that feels like it’s from another world. Yet, at the same time, it’s incredibly realistic. It addresses many themes such as self-worth, acceptance and sacrifice. Cheritz handles these themes with utmost care and it delivers to the audience.ART:The art is absolutely stunning. The colours are bright and vibrant. The characters all stand out and are very diverse in their appearances. I must admit, the visuals were the first thing that caught my attention. Both the sprites and CGs were very well done. STAT RAISING:While at first, the stat raising in the game was fun and cute. Over time, it became repetitive and tiring to do for all the routes. Although, the pain of it all will be worth it for the characters and story. VOICE ACTING:All the voice actors portrayed each character amazingly. They displayed a wide variety of emotions for every scene. I really felt the character’s personalities shone through their voices. I also really liked how Heejung was voiced too. MUSIC:I really have to praise Cheritz on their music. The different character songs suit their respective characters and some made me laugh too.CHARACTERS:Heejung was a fantastic heroine. She is kind and caring, but has a teasing snarky side to her at the same time. I also really liked how relateable she was. It's nice to see how she develops throughout the game and how she comes to terms with her inner battles.Each guy was vastly different from each other and I ended up falling in love with them all. Though, I must admit, Jiwoo ended up being my personal bias from the game. The interactions between the guys themselves was very fun to watch as well.OVERALL:Dandelion is a wonderful visual novel and I highly recommend it.			"

I'm driven to go through every route, and every character is so unique it's a blast to try and get through each ending. (Nevermind some of the hilarious nonsense the characters get up to...) It's cliche in the sense where I laughed, I cried, and I want more. Recommended for anybody who really loves story development and doesn't mind the occasional heartache.			"

												You know your boyfriend knows and loves you when...he buys you an otome game you've wanted forever for Christmas. Weeee!!! Otome games are my version of romance novels. I can't say how well this game works for folks who like to roleplay as the MC, since I don't play them that way, but I found it very enjoyable. I've only plalyed Jisoo's route so far, but the story is interesting, characters likable, and artwork is beautiful. I had wanted to play this game for a long time now. When I want a quick otome fix I'll jump into a fluffy Voltage mobile game, but it can be hard to find an English voiced/subtitled well-developed otome at times when I want more depth. It has a different feel, but I think in quality and development of this game is on par with Queen of Darkness: The Second Reproduction. That's saying a lot, considering that otome is my all time favorite. Jisoo's route was entertaining, though he's not typically the character archeype I go for I was surprised by the layers beneath his gruff, and a bit posessive, exterior. I won't say more for spoilers. I have enjoyed this game so far and am looking forward to the other routes, which should be easier/less micro-managy and even plan on checking out Jisoo's bad route. About the only thing I would say detracted from the game is the stats system. I kind of knew from the demo, and based on its existence in general, that the game would be a bit grindy, but as a person who seriously dislikes grindy games  it was the only thing that truly bugged me. To be fair, I also have never played a stats otome, favoring decision based story progression otomes in comparison. That said, would still give this game an 8/10. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a very long, stat raising/gift giving type dating sim for girls. The production values are sky high and the (Korean) voice acting is amazing.Some endings are pretty hard to get and you'll be doing a lot of save scumming, but the game seems designed for that, almost.The endings are all bittersweet at best, so don't expect traditional happy ever afters, even in the ""secret"" final ending.

												I was really excited when I came across this game online and played the demo, after that I was pretty hooked and I waited for it to be released on the offical webstie. I quickly bought it after it was released and I have to say, it was definitely more than I expected. The characters are all very different and thorough, they each have very interesting stories and while there is always more that can be done, I'm pleased with it. I feel like it was a very challenging game as well at some points with controlling the main characters pressure and raising different points for different characters and their routes. It's a very good time consumer and I'm glad to have unlocked it on steam as well. The art is very beautiful and the voice acting is absolutely crispy, I definitely recommend it and it's a total tear jerker as well. The bad ends are quite good as well as the good ends and all around, I love all of the characters and it's such a unique game. As someone who plays a lot of dating sims, it's easily become one of my favorites.			"

												So... the best otome game over? Honestly, yes.It's really got everything, and I have absolutely no complaints. I love the art. As for audio, its got great voice acting and music. But really, it's the characters that make the game for me. Maybe I love cas, bunnies, and animals too much, or maybe I just have a thing for animal ears, but this game is adorable! I personally like Jisoo the most, but that's just one woman's opinion (plus, I still have yet to play the routes of all the characters).If there were anything to complain about at all, it might be the price, but that being said, there's sales on Steam all the time. Keep any eye on it, and you never know, it might have a nice, fat discount! But well, even if it's only a few dollars off, I'd recommend buying it. With how high quality this game is, I think it's worth the money.So the bottom line is... awesome game, and I'd totally recommend buying it.			"

												Been a lady of the video game world since I was about 6 years old. I've always been easy-going and tend to give any game/any genre a try. Otomes are fun because of how relaxing they feel compared to say....playing through a Silent Hill. It's a nice game I can kick back and chill through.That said, Dandelion definitely exceeds those standards for Otome. This game is so damn cute it's almost overwhelming. Admittedly, I went the Jisoo route to start (duh, he resembles my husband wayyy to much, so it was like gravity really choosing him).But, I even found myself liking the character (poor little Jieun) who I thought would be the most uninteresting out of the group. All the story lines have classic ""K-drama"" style sad back stories. The main character is also sweet and honest, which makes her much more enjoyable than other female leads in other Otomes. But, I wanted her to stand up for herself a little more! But, it wouldn't have worked for the story...so I have to give her more credit. Admittedly, I liked Hakouki's female lead much more. BUT, this game gets +1000000 brownie points for the OUTstanding Korean voice acting! Yay Korean! As woman married into a Korean family, I feel COMPELLED to support a game like this.It's totally worth your time. It had me laughing out loud and crying at points too.Only down side, is on repeat play-throughs to get the other character's storylines, the stat raising can get really repetitive. But, I think you know that going into a game like this. . .Still totally worth it to see Jiwoo get annoyed every time I touch his paws or Jisoo randomly get distracted by informercials mid-conversation.

												This, most certainly, has to be my favorite Sim Date game.Originally, I played the demo version of this game. The startup is very confusing because the events are not explained right away, and it's a routine that you have to grow used to. Once you're situated on how everything works and what decreases/increases your stats, it's a pretty easy game experience.Each of the character's endings take a few hours, so it's something you'd play if you have extra time to spare. The game has many unique scenes and endings, and some really hit the feels. I'd recommend trying to get all the character's good endings and maybe the bad ones to expand your horizion. ;) So far, my favorite Jisoo. But, personally, I think Jieun's ending is the best one. I hate to spoil anything, but I'd definitely recommend trying to go down his path. May be expensive, but it's worth it. I saved up for this game and, so far, no regrets.			"

												I was initially hesitant to buy this game because of the price. I didn't really want to spend so much, but I was on a school break and impulsively purchased it anyway. Wow, am I glad that I did. It really is a very high quality game. The voice acting  and characterization were believable and the endings are unique yet well connected. If you play perfectly, you'll need to play through 10 times to get all endings. I haven't yet...it can get slightly repetitive once you know what you're doing, through the story is worth it. It's so nice to have a dating sim have unique characters that you really do care for. I was surprised by how well the stories blended together but added new cut scenes and evolved the personalities of characters based on the track you chose. The only issue I have is that I felt like I needed more of a walkthrough. It's possible I clicked out of one at the beginning and don't remember, but I didn't figure out how to use items, save, or check statuses (right click) until I looked up a walkthrough online after getting a bad ending twice.

												Dandelion was my first Otome game and remains one of my favorites. Very well written with 5 different arch-type personalities to choose from. Different personalities with different motives and different story-arcs, sometimes unexpected. and cute CGs that focus on the guys and male anime eye-candy for players rather than generously proportioned female CGs.Stat building could get a little tedious at times, but I did use different stat routes for each character, giving me some variability. I've only seen one dark ending, which was a little unexpected and off-putting (first time with bad endings), but then went to the walkthrough for the ""good"" endings and loved how they interacted and how different facets of the characters were revealed. For the amount of time I've played it, I consider it well worth the money and it did lead me to buy Nameless which I felt was even more refined and with great storylines as well (not to mention even darker/creepier).There were some mix-ups of names or translation grammer errors, but I knew what they meant and am not that picky. Not to mention some actually gave me a good laugh.Can't wait to see Cheritz's next game!			"

												I highly recommend this game for people who likes otome games or who just like an engaging story with great characters and astounding artwork, and with a main character that is actually above 20 years old, I don't know about you but to me it is a nice change. There are some suggested themes throughout the game but nothing explicit or mature ever happens however. This is a visual novel though and except the stat rising you are mostly reading, so if you crave action then this game might not be for you though.The story seems pretty simple, Hee-jung finds a basket with animals in her room one morning and ends up taking care of them, and after some time it turns out the animals are really humans, or well humans with adorable cat and rabbit ears, and you get to choose which guy she will end up with. But the story is quite dark despite how it appears at first glance, the main character Hee-jung has a very real and relatable background and each of the guys have their own story that are all heartbreaking in their own right that has shaped them into what they are in the game and it makes it hard to settle for just one favourite.The game often had me laughing out loud, especially the guys interractions with or without Hee-jung nearby, only to take a 180 turn and give you a sad or straight out heartbreaking scene. The art work really complements the game well, the character models, the adorable chibis and the locations are all very well done and I eagerly awaited the scenes that would give me a CG.There are five routes to play through, with each guy having a different personality and a captivating story but if you play through all the routes you get to see that there is a bigger story behind it all and there is even sixth route available that gives some interesting insight in the plot of the game.Almost every character also have a bad ending, most are not too bad but I recommend trying to get Jisoo's good ending before his bad end, seriously it's for the best. If you are worried about getting a bad ending then I recommend playing Jieun's route first since he has no bad ending. However it is still good to play Jihae's route before Jieun's since they are connected and the story really plays out better when doing Jihae first.The text is in English or Korean and the audio is Korean, and the person that picked out the actors did an amazing job. Every character has a perfect voice in my opinion and it really makes it easier to relate and get immersed in the game, I especially like that even Hee-jung gets a voice, it's rare to have the female lead in an otome game to have a voice but in my opinion that makes everything better. The music is really good and fits the mood, there's not too much variation but it's always good music, not too much but just enough for you to notice it.There are a lot of spelling mistakes though, even places where character names is switched by mistake and some might get thrown off by it, personally I didn't find it too distracting but for almost 30€ some proofreading before release would have been appreciated.Overall this game was funny, heartbreaking, embarassing and filled with relatable feelings and moments that really makes it hard to pick out a favourite character, my favourite is Jisoo but I can not rank the remaining five so they share a second place. I generally don't play otome games or dating games but this one I really recommend.			"

The art work attached with each character is well thought out to match their personality and the situation they are thrown into. Each character has it's own emotional story which will tug at your heart strings and pull you into the sim more. Ideally, the typos would need to be fixed but otherwise a very enjoyable game.			"

												I haven't completed the entire game yet, but after finishing three characters I can say I absolutely adore this game. The art is gorgeous and the story was fantastic. My computer and my phone are full of Otome games/Visual Novels/ Dating sims, I highly HIGHLY recommend this one. To me, the cost was well worth it!			"

												I bought this game shortly after it came out and I became obsessed with it. It's emotionally wrenching and you become invested in the characters. Sometimes the things to boost your stats gets tedious, but at least the story makes up for it. Make sure that you complete all the routes so that you can get the true route - it's worth it. I really hope that there's a sequel for this game eventually, and that Cheritz keeps up the amazing work/			"

												Just finished my first playthrough of this game today, and I loved it.  It has a well-developed backstory for our protagonist and she's relatable and quite ordinary - in the best way possible.   It plunges you into the storyline quickly, so you don't get bored waiting for the game to ""start"".  The art is gorgeous.  Both animals and humans are insanely adorable visually, and (especially a certain spotted one that captured my heart immediately) insanely adorable emotionally/behaviorally.  :>  They all have their own personalities and quirks that add to their charm, and if the route I played through is any indication, they likely all have backstories worth learning.  I'm certainly satisfied with my choice of romance and experiencing his story.  Honestly, I rather fell in love with him and the protagonist as a pair - they had similar heartbreaks in their pasts and seemed a natural fit together, both able to empathize with and support the other.  I hope the other routes are as fulfilling (although secretly, in my experience the first romance is always the best, otome game or other, since you gravitate toward the one that speaks to you, not the protagonist per se).  That ending, though... ye olde heartstrings be pulled, aye.One thing I wasn't aware of when I first started playing was that various scenes have Korean voice acting!  Which was an interesting surprise for me, since I'm extremely familiar with Japanese, but extremely unfamiliar with Korean.  Had to train myself to pause a second before furthering the dialog in a voiced scene, just in case there was just a pause in the sentence and not a full stop.  XD  Word to the wise: save often and don't let the pressure get to you.  >:)  Have fun!  I'm sure you'll love it.  <3			"

												i really like the characters.  that alone enough to push me through this game. except the game. i don't like that much because stat raising is not the funnest thing after  stat raising wrongly , then using only one save file and having to restart the whole thing. BUT you♥♥♥♥♥♥it up like, 3 more times because you refuse to see any guides and still use one save file because you're dumb but after the 5th time you decide. ""FINE. I GIVE UP"" And realize to touch a certain long haired rabbits butt, you need to heart raise someone else that he cares about to 1 or 2 hearts AND I'M JUST SO♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ABOUT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE TELL ME ""DON'T TOUCH EVERYONE'S BUTT YOU'LL GET A BAD ENDING"" SO I DIDN'T AND I'M SO MAD AT MYSELF FOR NOT OBVIOUSLY SEEING I NEEDED TO BE FRIENDLY WITH 2 RABBITS DAMN IT. But.... i will finish this game. i admit. i am 14.4 hours in  (well, i also leave it on while i surf the web but..) and i have yet to finish a route, but I do not care.... i will finish the game because the characters are (well... seems to be so far....) worth it. so be warned... you may want to look up a walk through. or at least see what the guys like so you can stat raise properly unlike me.....also,super duper awesome art.nice music, all that stuff is good.

												This game is pretty amazing. I love the character growth! All the characters are just wonderful! For a visual novel this is one of the best that I've played. Sure there are a few translation errors here and there but it was easy to get past that and enjoy the game! The only issue I had really with the game is the ""Bonus"" content but they have since translated it and now I can fully enjoy the game!			"

												Absolutely worth the price tag. Enjoyable and thoughtful from finish to start. The voice acting, art, music and story were above my expectations. Highly recommend to any otome fan. The statistics/having to constantly quick save + load for certian routes were the most annoying things and I am willing to overlook them. Just google a guide if you need to get an idea of what needs to be done, but I think it's self-explanitory as you go along. I will be revisitng the Jiwoo route more than a few times- I don't think I have smiled that much while playing a game in a long time.			"

												This is a very fun game! All the stories are great and it's addicting. I would suggest that you save every single morning in case you don't get to interact with your animal of choice so you can quick load. The stories are great the characters are cute and the soundtrack is wonderful! ^^			"
