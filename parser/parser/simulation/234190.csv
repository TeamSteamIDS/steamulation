												I'd call it roguelike RPG-less first-person shooter with no blood but *lots* of scary moments. Permadeath and full pistol mechanic implementation turn the game in survival-horror at first, but as you progress and learn to reload your gun properly the game rewards you with the warm feeling of protection granted by the gun you hold. I'd give this game 10/10 if you look for a game to play a session every now and then. And if you don't, then just give it a try. No blood, no monsters and a lot of survival has made the game perfect in my eyes.			"

												Straightforward game, Complex gunplay.Receiver is a new kind of FPS with a mix of a rogue-like RPG game. The great first person shooter takes the handling of your guns unto a whole new level. This very realistic gunplay requires you to know how to handle your pistol knowing each and every step to perform an action. From changing the safety lock, emptying shells, and removing and reloading you magazine, all have their steps that wipes all the realistic shooters into the dust.Because of this complex use of guns you will die a lot, pretty often actually. It takes time and effort to put to this game in order to complete. Everytime you die you’ll restart in the beginning of this randomly generated world. If you're not a person of patience then this is not the game for you. As you might start in different places on the map don’t expect to receive the same guns, same ammo, and other equipment like a flashlight. Those and as well as placed items are randomly generated. The foes you face in this game are only robots, two kinds stationary sentries, and airborne ones which are equipped with a taser. The lack of variety of enemies can make this came quite boring for some. Knowing how to approach a corner when you hear the beep on a turret or the lights of a flying saucer can make fighting these guys very repetitive.   The dark, mostly enclosed setting in a tower gives this game a fighting like theme that fits the unknown exploration well. Learning how to conserve your bullets, finding a working flashlight, and collect these tapes that hold a mystery that involves all of mankind really makes it fun for me to play. As playing a easy game is never fun.  "

												Okay, so this game is a ""How-To-Suck-With-Guns-And-Die-Horribly"" simulator. Gun physics are AWESOME, the backstory is told through tapes which you risk your life to obtain, and the enemies scare the crap out of you, even though they really shouldn't. I love the aspect of the non-automatic reload systems, which this game does quite well. Want to reload your gun? Press at the very least 2 buttons multiple times to do so! Want to have enough magazines so that you don't die from having to reload the same one over and over again? Get the whole ""remove mag, place in pouch, take out spare mag, place  in gun, release slide(if needed)"" maneuver down! If you wanna play this game, beware that you will die. A lot. The two enemies do well in covering the randomly generated map, and when you encounter your first one, your trigger finger and aiming arm better be accurate! Locational damage plays a big part with your survival, hit a vital system on one of the two enemies and you'll be a happy camper. Er, Receiver. But hit some useless bit of metal, and you're gonna find yourself out of ammunition real soon. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys shooters where you can actually appreciate the parts of a firearm.			"

												Receiver is one heck of a free game (was a giveaway). You are placed into a randomly generated texture-less world. Your objective is to collect tapes. You need to shoot or avoid sentry guns (there is only ground and air). It is a one hit kill’s type of FPS game, so it can be challenging.The title of the game is somewhat of a pun and has no relation to weapon mechanics. As you collect tapes you hear a recording of a guy’s voice (sounds like Lone Wolf). He tells you the situation of what is going on. The story is freakish in the way that it gives meaning to the texture-less level with basic 3D models that you are strolling through. Each time you die and have to start again, the recordings are played in random order, which means eventually you may have a great understanding of the story even though you have not even made it halfway through the game.I’ll also quickly mention that the soundtrack also is very fitting and gives an atmosphere to the levels. It reminds me of Islamic prayer type of music sounds like in the film Black Hawk Down.The most interesting part of the game is undoubtedly the weapon reload mechanics. The learning curve is not too steep in my opinion. It will help to just crouch down somewhere upon first play and fiddle with the buttons on your keyboard to understand how to reload your gun. There are two different reload mechanics to learn … the semi-automatic pistol (Glock and 1911 if I remember correctly) and the dirty harry revolver.It is just cool. I find myself pulling back on the slide to eject the bullets which all go onto the ground. You pick up all the bullets which goes into a reserve (like your pocket). Then you need to put the bullets back into the magazine one by one, but you cannot do that before holstering your weapon (because you need two hands to fill a magazine). Then you need to draw and put the magazine back into the weapon. The first time you pull on the trigger, it may not shoot anything because you need to pull back on the slide again to load a bullet into the chamber. All this is an OCD persons dream come true.The magnum revolver is a little simpler. Although you start to notice a difference when running low on bullets, you need to make sure you spin the cylinder to align the bullet filled chambers with the barrel. And because there is less bullets you are always having to pull on the ejector rod.With all weapons you have a safety switch which is useless and you can pull back on the hammer for extra readiness. You can also turn on smart tooltips which highlight what you can and cannot do with button presses.I find the randomly generated levels made more sense compared to say Hellgate: London which did not make sense to me and felt more like a selling point gimmick. There are sections that you will familiarize yourself with. So even if the level is randomly generated, you know what to expect in each section anyways. So that is definitely a positive for a game that could have just been based on a single static level design.One thing that I find stupid (and I am not 100% sure about this) is there may be a random luck factor when disabling sentries. It is actually the one thing that has really put me off the game. All sentries supposedly have these weak points. But if you shoot a sentry exactly at a weak point that disables it in one round and then try it again in another round, it will not work. And you can tell because when you get close to the sentry you can see where your bullets have hit exactly. Sometimes you can disable a sentry from a distance that looks like a pea on your screen with one bullet … sometimes you have to fire three shots at a sentry that fills up a quarter of your screen just to disable it. It makes no sense to me. I really hate luck factors in games.The last thing I would like to mention is this game could have been great. I mean really big. But it is clearly unfinished and from what I heard was part of a competition in designing a game within a week. The thing this game lacks is arms, hands and textures applied to everything including the weapons. But seriously this game could have been amazing! I can actually visualise many FPS games that could utilize this mechanic. Tom Clancy type of games in particular, but even the Battlefield series. The reason why I mention this is because it is one of those revolutionary ideas that gets put out too quickly and is drowned by games with too common typical boring one button reload mechanics and nothing new (albeit finished). I really do hope to see something better made in the future with this idea … not everyone in the world just wants to gun down stuff on the screen senselessly. This is a needed option!			"

												Receiver is a strange little title. I think if you've even heard of the game you know that it was the result of a game jam and was put together in a very short period of time (7 days I believe). These game jams have a knack for putting out some very intriguing concept pieces but understandably lack substance.In a nutshell, this game is a rogue-like first person shooter with absurdly detailed gun mechanics. There is no “Press R to Reload”. First you must eject the magazine or spent casings, you need to reload with fresh ammunition bullet by bullet. Once you reinsert the clip, you can’t pull the trigger and expect a bang without loading one in the chamber and pulling back the hammer.While I would be outright lying if I tried to argue that Receiver had no lack of substance, the mechanics that are in place are undeniably engaging. My first few runs were rather frustrating but when I finally got a hang of the key mappings and how the different guns operate it was inexplicably rewarding. I felt extremely in touch with whatever gun I had been bestowed and more aware of my use of ammunition than I had ever been with any other FPS.There is certainly no jaw dropping narrative or deep philosophical thesis on the blight of war buried within Receiver, but the depth in which the mechanics of firearms are explored here really shows the possibility of a seriously strategic and skill based first person shooter.

												The game that depicts guns at their most accurate. At the beginning you'll do everything games and films has taught you, assuming that everytime you insert a mag, you have to pull the slide back (Which is a good way to eject your bullets from a magazine without firing them). With practise you'll be handling guns like a pro, reloading swiftly and with ease whilst feeling awesome.It's cheap, It's fun, it's very immersive. Get it. Only issue I could bring up is poor optimisation, whether they plan to release updates to combat this, remains to be seen.			"

												The game takes a realistic approach to weapons handling, and while initially the controls seem overwhelming and overcomplicated at first, you'll quickly fall into the groove.What follows is a genuinely challenging game, one that rewards preperation, caution and planning. One single slip up will cost you your life and you'll have to start from the beginning.It's a true testament to thinking outside the box in game design, and much like Mount & Blade dared to attempt realistic melee combat using very rudimentary systems and controls, that game attempts to do the same with firearms.Interesting and very tense, would recommend if you're up for a challenge			"

												If you're a fan of guns or want to learn how a gun works, how to eject a bullet out of a pistol, How the ballistic's of a pistol bullet works, and so fourth, you may like this game.Story: Well, when I started out on this game, I had no idea what I was doing, but there are cassets that you can find that will give you the backstory, I found two. So far it has too do with some kind of.. war that will happen.Gameplay: Simple and bare with mechanics hardly found anywhere else.  You start in a abandoned building with a pistols which ranges from a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and a Glock 10 with full auto mod. Everything is random, your ammo count, placement of ammo, and enemies. I should mention that ALL enemies make a sound and lights when they spot you. These are only two enemies in the game that I have seen.Enemy types:Sentries: are stationary, but once they spot you, they fire at you as you would expect.Drones: These little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chase after you once they spot you, choosing to close in at close range to taser you, I have yet to see with with a gun mounted on it.. or destory one.Challange: Think Dark Souls, but First Person Shooter with mechanics that fit more in a military sim. (Roughly)Replay ability: This one is a hard one for me, but it does get a bit tedious after a few tries. So it's doesn't have much replay value.Verdict: 8/10 With deep mechanics with the weapon types and detail of how it works. The Enemy types is dissapointing and the variety of weapons is quite lacking. The reply value is a bit hard for me to say due to the fact you spawn with different weapons at the start of every game and the enemy placement appears to change.			"

												I really wish I could recommend Receiver.The base weapon-manipulation mechanics are complex, and fun, once you get the hang of them. Problem is, that's not what the game is about. Most of my time in-game is spent wandering around, only to get killed very quickly by a robot.And then there's the random aspects, my biggest gripe. One game I started with no ammunition - at all - and in a hallway guarded by a sentry gun. I couldn't run past it, and I couldn't shoot it - I had no ammo. It brought a quick death. I'm not against random aspects to a game, but there has to be boundaries. Randomly give me between five and fifty bullets. But at least give me one.Personally, I don't think the game is worth $5 - I bought it on sale for $2, and I don't think it's worth that. SUPERHOT released a much more exciting proof of concept, and that was free.			"

												Receiver is an experiment with realistic gun handling in a game setting that hasn't really been done before (to my knowledge). It gives you full control over weapon operations - you can release the magazine, insert/remove bullets, release the slide lock, toggle the safety, and even use full auto - and it lets you see real gun mechanics at work. It may seem mundane to some but you'll soon find that reloading and operating a virtual firearm becomes mechanical as you play through and is quite satisfying - and it's a lot more interesting than simply pressing R to reload.The game itself is surprisingly tense and suspenseful. Because your opposition (turrets and flying stun-drones) can kill you in one hit, you are forced to be practical and careful in your movements and actions. And, as you DO have a task in the game - of collecting 11 cassette tapes that are lying around in various places in the randomly generated world - it's a lot more challenging than you might think! All in all - it's an interesting experiment in realism and definitely worth checking out.			"

												The random number generator rolled 31... and 31, was Receiver.""What is this guy talking about?"" I assume you ask. Well I'm talking about the ""unplayed games"" month. You know, like every Steam user out there, he buys a game and never plays it ever™? Yeah, true stories. I recommend you do that too: choose a month(emphasis on ""month"" and not ""day"" since be honest with yourself, you're never gonna do it ""one day"", are ye?), google random number generator and go ham! Every day a new game.And quite frankly, I like this game. I like it a lot.Why though?Well here's why:It's a proper handgun simulation quite unlike any other ones out there. And I mean it, from ejecting shells from a plain revolver, to loading bullets in a magazine, and even experiencing the recoil that a full-auto Glock has to give! I'm no Hickok45 when I'm talking about guns, but I still know the basics and rules for handling one, and since my country is no America(cuz muh europe) it's rather difficult getting ahold of one(quote difficult, not impossible), so fooling around in a virtual environment with all the right tools is a blessing.And let's say you're not willingly to either A. get a gun or B. visit America anytime soon.That's ok, since if those two options aren't on your list, then these shall do:-You are a civilian and just want to experience a handgun without actually going out of your way of actually touching one(believe me, from where I come, people avoid guns like the plague)-You are about to and/or will attend in the future either the Police or Military academy. Now remember, just because one will teach you to run after bandits and one will teach you advanced military stuff, that doesn't exclude basic training in handgun usage. For example the police in Sweden uses Walters and I'm pretty sure the rest of Europe(and America) has the Glock17 or later models. And for the military, keep in mind that not every country has the possibility of giving each soldier a ♥♥♥♥ing Desert Eagle, so they'll have to make do with what they're given.Additionally, there is a mod for extra guns. That's right! Extra. BIGGER. GUNS! As of making this review I haven't tried it out yet, so expect a lil' edit here sometime soon.Now I've given my point for the purpose of this game in the world. How about the game itself now?It's an action packed rogue-like in a futuristic funky world.The rogue-like part is essentially what gun you are starting with, the amount of ammo you carry right off, the starting spawn point and the spawns of enemies.  Your main objective in the game is to collect 11 tapes that are scattered around the level, and I'm not gonna lie, it can be pretty infuriating as one time I found 2 tapes in the spam of a minute, and another time I've spent 20 minutes looking for one to no avail.There are two enemies in the game. *ahem*. TWO ENEMIES. That's gotta be a new record for the least hostilities in a rogue-like, period! I guess you can count the third one as fall damage kek. Anyway, there is a turret and there is... Clifford's lost freesbie idfk, it's a flying drone, or that's what I think it is. Both of these guys will one shot you, as the player has only one health. The turrets are usually not a problem as long as you spot them first and keep out of sight, and the flying freesbies are the survival horror aspect of your whole life, as they will charge you like a god damn Apache helicopter, John Cena style, and sap the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of your entire existence. These things will be the #1 thing which will kill you, and don't even dare try to contradict me.The guns require a lot of your concentration in order to progress. Albeit the revolver is the easiest to pick on, the Glock and M1911 sure aren't, and will take some time getting used to(when in doubt, press |?|). And even then, it requires a lot of button operations: one opens the cylinder/ejects the mag, one is used to point the gun when needed, other is for holster, yet another to add bullets, and so forth and so forth. This is the beauty of this game, since even if there are only 2 enemies, your main one is... yourself! YOU ARE WHAT HOLDS YOU BACK! To understand the gun, you must be one with the gun. A quote which no liberal will ever say since they haven't shot a gun in their lifes LMAOOOOO amirite lads or amiriteThat's some political humor right there.You haven't asked for it, but you sure got it anyway.tl;dr So what's the conclusion on this? The conclusion is that I want a sequel, and I want it now. The foundation is here, and doesn't need to be changed in any way. It just needs adding: more enemies, more guns and gun types, more diversity in level generation, more of everything, and let me tell you, if it ever happens, it's going to be one of the greatest rogue-like simulations of the century. Receiver is without a doubt, a special little gem. Everyone should own it, it's gun education afterall, unlike... gulp... religious games...This has been your anonymous reviewer, signing off.Have a swell day. "

...please take a moment to confirm that the firearm you have been issued is in working order and has one full magazine.Receiver is an experimental First Person Shooter, developed in just 7 days to partake in a Game Jam challenge.The plot is told via cassette tapes, that you must collect 11 of in a single playthrough. Almost every surface is untextured and there's minimal, if any, post processing. Surprisingly good lighting effects. The most detailed models in the game are the firearms, conspicuously floating in front of your invisible player avatar as part of the developers' conscious decision to not obstruct the weapon models with your mortal except not arms.The soundtrack is only one dynamic, tense and somewhat electro track which changes in intensity depending on your proximity to enemies and certain items. Weapons sound distinct and accurate to life. You'll quickly learn to dread that BEEP.It has elements of the roguelike genre: the levels are generated by stringing together rooms in a random order and randomly placing enemies, items and even leaving your firearm in a random condition every time - means you are just as likely to spawn with two full mags as you are to spawn with nothing but a single round in your magazine. Death is swift, taking just one bullet or one zap from any enemy to start generating a new level.It stands out from other games through its incredibly detailed portrayal of the firearms. Every weapon has keys associated with different functions that are part of an intricate reloading and readying process. The standard M1911A1 handgun has you: ejecting the magazine, holstering the pistol, loading live rounds into the magazine, drawing back out the pistol, loading the magazine, then, if necessary, racking the slide to chamber a round from the magazine. The two other handguns in the standard game, the Glock 17 with a fire selector and the S&W Model 10 revolver, have their own unique functions as well: the G17 foregoes an external hammer and traditional safety toggle in exchange for a larger magazine capacity, reduced individual shot power, and a full auto toggle that should really only be used in emergencies. The Model 10 revolver, meanwhile, lacks a traditional magazine; you must open the cylinder, eject all rounds that may or may not be spent from the cylinder, insert up to 6 fresh bullets, then close it back and optionally pull back the hammer for the fastest trigger response. Ballistics overall are highly detailed, with bullet drop-off over distance, muzzle velocity, impact penetration and even ricochet chance depending on surface and angle of firing - be careful of shooting yourself in the foot!The gameplay is part first person shooter, part horror (limited resources all around, and attacking poses a significant risk of wasting precious ammunition; running is a risky option) and part stealth (the two enemies featured require line of sight to engage and can be detected early by an attentive player via their projected lights and buzzing/droning sounds). The stationary turrets spin in a 360 degree angle and are easier, relatively speaking, to avoid or to disable, while the hoverbots... are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. A huge part of their bodies are not vulnerable to being disabled, while the weak points are much more difficult to hit on a small, constantly moving and especially zipping-towards-you target. The control scheme is such that you will fumble with it the first dozen or so lives, but an in-game help menu can provide guidance on quickly getting your gun ready to fire at a moment's notice, so it becomes a matter of muscle memory - just like real life reloading, in fact.It's a $5 game but it's most likely worth your investment if you're any shade of gun nut or if you enjoy first person shooters. For anyone else, you should grab it as part of a bundle.			"

												So, yeah, it's difficult.How difficult?The game spawned me with a 1911 that had no bullets or magazines, and the nearest two rounds available were sitting under the stairs in a room guarded by a hovering taser drone.Literally, this game can be more evil than all of Hitler's incarnations, up to and including Keith Lemon.It's great.

												Horribly optimized for even high end systems. Go check the discussions page, I'm not the only one with this problem.

This is basicly the ultimate shooter trainer with mechanics that no ohter shooter will ever use. It's just 5 euro's and that's why it's good for some fun.If you don't like games that are difficult, don't buy it.Don't like having to git gud to play for fun??

												Receiver is a detailed pistol simulator with procedurally generated levels.  Shoot and dodge drones and turrets while collecting tape cassettes and ammo. You will spawn with one of three guns: an M1911A1, a Model 10 revolver, or a selective fire Glock 18, and a random assortment of ammo, magazines, and flashlight. The game has a short cyberpunk/dystopia narrative told over eleven tape cassettes. Receiver is challenging and addictive, definitely worth it in a sale for shooting or action fans.			"

												Receiver is more or less a proof of concept that actually comes off being a reasonable game. The primary focus is on mastering gun control. This includes ejecting the magazine, filling it with bullets, replacing the magazine, engaging the slide, and turning off the safety so it's ready to fire. It takes some getting used to, but it's not that difficult after a little practice.The game part ends up being a permadeath environment where you search for and collect audio tapes while trying to avoid being shot by randomly placed turrets and flying drones. The player spawns with one of three guns that may or may not be ready to fire, a random number of bullets and magazines, and sometimes a flashlight. The one aspect that makes this game engaging is that you always have to be aware of your gun state, especially how many bullets you have in your magazine before you decide to engage a target. Ammunition is scarce making shots that much more valuable. The turrets and drones are quite tough which, combined with the weapon control elements, makes for some very cautious gameplay.Make no mistake, Receiver is certainly rough around the edges. The environment isn't randomized; only the enemies and audio tape locations. The graphics are not interesting, nor optimized. It feels laggy at times. It can even unfairly spawn you with no gear or in a bad spot. However, it does master the element of weapon handling. It can become quite intense if your magazine runs dry while a drone is hunting you down and you need to pull off a precision reload in the moment. And for that aspect, I give it a thumbs up.			"

Receiver certainly is an interesting take on the FPS genre, but this time, the ""S"" stands for simulation.  Rather than your standard run and gun gameplay most FPS features, Receiver is much more deliberate where the focus isn't just on the shooting, but also on the gun itself. In Receiver you must manage every part of the gun, the slider, the hammer, the magazine, it's chamber, etc. If you don't take care of your gun, or understand how each part functions you will die... a lot. The game does a good job at simulating what it takes to handle a real gun. Due to it's vast amount of controls there is a definite learning curve with this game. It will not play like other FPSs you've played previously.The game is only $5usd, which isn't asking for a lot, but do know there are limited amounts of options, features, and content. There is only one play mode, only 2 types of enemies, and not much in the way of customization. Although the game does it's best to incentivize reply with it's procedurally generated maps, enemies, and load out, and each play through will be different from the last, but it will be ""different"" with a lot of very familiar assets.Certainly the game is challenging, and at first may even be frustrating to some, but it's also very rewarding. Once you manage to get over the difficulty and control hump, the game will feel like none other you've played. Each kill feels like a huge victory, and the game does a good job at instilling a legitimate sense of tension and danger around every corner.Overall Receiver is a quality product at a low price point. The content might be limited, but through the creativity of it's mechanics, there are also endless possibilities to play through.Pros:- Procedurally generated maps and load out offers endless play potential- Very unique mechanics and concept- Best gun simulation I've played (only gun simulation I've played?)- Challenging- Very fair priceCons:- Limited content- Moderate visuals- Large learning curve			"

												On the technical aspect, it really requires something with some power to run it, and that's suprising considering it has very few polygons, no textures, and not much that really would require a physics engine besides some things that kinda float around.That said, the more realistic take on firearms operation brings something new to the table for shooters, and the realistic take on your ability to not get shot and walk it off like nothing happened makes it hard, but I still keep wanting to try again, and that's something coming from me who easily gets bored/frustrated and walks off.

												The main selling point of Receiver is to ""explore gun mechanics"". This would be fine and all, if exploring mechanics did not mean having a horrible atmosphere, incredibly strange controls, and a very unpolished feel.Don't get me wrong, the guns are good. But there's only 2 of them. I understand that this was originally created for a 7-day game challenge, but I believe Wolfire could have worked on this a bit more to make it complete (oh, and updates are halted indefinately until Overgrowth, which has been in development for 4+ years, is out).The environments are randomly generated but you will see the same rooms put carelessly next to eachother over and over again. And I know that there are some things that can be considered the ""art style"" but almost every room has the same bland, unfinished texture for both the floor and walls. What gives?Finally there are the controls. It would be nice to really explore gun mechanics if I was able to use them easily. For Christ's sake, there are 2 different buttons to take out the magazine and put it back in. If you get back in the game after a break, you're going to have no clue what in the world you're doing, so you'll mercilessly slap your keyboard and memorize controls that should just be common sense.There are also 2 types of enemies. One is a turret and the other is some sort of flying robot that doesn't detect half of your shots and sometimes gives the impression that it is disabled when it really isn't.It's bland, it's boring, it's unresponsive, it makes no sense, and it won't change for a while.

In Short:This game... is very unique.Don't try it if you don't like trying new gimmic-esque things.If you do enjoy things like that, get Receiver on sale.  To startI first got this game a while back after remembering the gameplay from a random youtube video.I thought it was pretty basic ingameplay, in graphics, and story. I went in with fairly standard thoughts, ones you'd make yourself if you just took a couple minutes too look at this very storepage of the game.In Depth; GameplayEver play QWOP?You know, that weird relay racing game that was severely hard to control? Receiver is that, ""With guns"". Guns are very tricky and keybinding to use- that's the point of the game- to be very close to the real life counterparts. Press V to load bullets, holding a flashlight under your gun, turning off the safety, aiming down your sights, sprinting, all of that. Each key press feels impactfull and refreshing, and this game has a lot of keypressing - the good kind.You start with one gun, such as a Glock-18, Colt 1911, and a revolver, with a random selection of equipment. Such as extra magazines, bullets, and a flashlight. Using these guns, you must find more bullets, to fight more enemies (which I'll delve into later) which makes finding cassette tapes easier which are needed to finish the game.Each gun behaves differently. The revolver is a single cylinder based pistol, forcing you to reload every bullet (in total of 6)  that shoots fairly slowly. Enemies only take a few shots to kill making this weapon completely inferior to the others. The revolver still behaves differently with how it fires, and the keys you need to press to use it, which makes it fun to use.  The Glock-18 can be used in automatic fire mode as-well as single fire, has a big magazineYou'll find yourself emptying a entire magazine into one enemy that scared you.The Colt 1911 is the standard point 'n shoot, no gimmicks here. Great to use when you start with it.The enemies are 2 types of robots throw about in the fairly big map (The only map) you are on.Turrets and Drones. Each has their own unique sounds and lines of sight. The line of sight the two robots share add an element of stealth. Don't have ammo but see a turret perched up on a ledge?Try to sneak past it when it's not looking.Turrets are exactly as they seem. A rotating sentry that has an ammunition box that feeds bullets into a barrel, that goes straight into your body. Spawning in bathtubs, on stairs, sitting on a dinning room table, you know one is near due to it's very specific beeping, and sounds of the turret's motors rotating.Shooting it on the tripod it is on, immobilizes it. The turret can still shoot you if you are in line of sight but it can't rotate.Shooting the sensor will turn off the turret completely.The drones are much different. They are high up in the area, either in the sky or banging around near the ceiling. These bots will follow you in-till you successfully escape their line of sight. they are equipped with a tazing rod that forces the drone to charge at you from the sky. You'll either be running away hastily or pumping bullets into the poor machine hoping it will fall. Shooting the fans that power it's flight will result in the drone falling, though still being  able to taze your ankles, killing you. Shooting the light sensor (the line of sight) will make it blind and fall instantly.This robot however, if shot enough will eventually fall. It does have some significant armor though.You will find more ammo, (maybe another gun or flashlight too if you're lucky.) magazines and most importantly, cassete tapes while exploring. Each cassette tape enables a voice over explaining a part of the games overall story. Getting the required amount of these will take you a few times, either dying by a robot our clumsily falling off a ledge. Getting closer and closer to finding all the cassettes is very fun and rewarding. The Story Story is the standard ""Ooh, reflect on yourself!"" type story. pretty much all I can say without spoiling. I'll be hiding the story behind the spoilers. You are a ""receiver"", or a person who can listen to a few cassette tapes, literally hundreds of times, and then discover a hidden message in them. These cassettes are the ones found in-game, each one explains more and more about media, government, companies, etc all being corrupt and controlling the average consumer. Nothing special. The ending adds some decent closure, and a nice real life picture or two. It's not rememorable in any way, and doesn't make you think about a real life scenarios of the same thing.  Graphics and AestheticThis game has a basic polygon shader-esque aesthetic and art-style.It makes clear on whats happening but leaves out small details and designs. Which is fine.Games such as Grow up and Grow Home have similar art-styles. It's just player preference. Nothing noteworthy. Final ThoughtsAlthough the game has ~5 hours of content ~2.5 if you know exactly what your doing and dont screw around. I had quite some fun with it, some heart racing moments with some encoutners. 15 hours for 2.50 is a pretty good deal.Receiver doesn't have many bugs but it doesn't have much content either. Overall, it's a pretty well rounded game for it's price-point on sale.It's definitely worth to get on sale for 2.50 or below, but only if you are up for gimmicks and controls like QWOP or similar games. It's pretty unnoticed and considered a ""tech Demo""Regardless-It's a great pick from me, one of the games I'm most fond off.			"

												Receiver is hard to rate, because it's an example of very abstract, unordered storytelling. I personally enjoyed it and enjoy doing run throughs of it occasionally, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone who either doesn't appreciate realistic gun mechanics or OHD (one-hit-death) games. Receiver is a game that was programmed from scratch in a mere 7 days for an FPS challenge, and it shows. Level geometry has nearly zero detail, levels are simple, and there's essentially no post-processing. However, the game works surprisingly well; everything is (weirdly) easy to tell apart, including enemies, and weapons make satisfying firing, chambering, and reloading sounds. The game's emphasis on survival and conserving bullet by bullet makes every miss on enemies all the more punishing, and by the end of a playthrough you'll wind up being a crack shot.The story isn't much to explain because it's unordered, on audio tapes, and abstract. It's a neat concept and it meshes well with the abstract nature the game exemplifies.The drawback to Receiver, which is less so a flaw and more a mechanic, are OHDs. Getting hit by any enemy in any form will instantly kill your character, and there's no kind of saving or checkpoints; you either gun it and get all 13 tapes, or you die. This isn't a big deal on its own, but falling a certain distance will also instantly kill your character, and unfortunately there are tons of chances for this to happen on accident.This isn't really a flaw since lots of games do this (like rogue-style games) but because of its fickle nature and difficulty, those looking for a stroll in the park won't find it.Ultimately, Receiver is a cool project that any shooter fan would probably enjoy experiencing. It's only real drawback, its simplicity, is also its greatest strength, and as a result I can't really recommend paying full price for it unless you seriously need to play it or you want to help the dev. Otherwise, goodluck beating the Mindkill. You'll need it.			"

You can't just press R to do a reload animation. You have to conserve ammo and fire accurately, while learning to reload the gun manually. That's the beauty of this game.The point of this review is, it's an amazing game for its price, and considering it was made for a challenge the length of a WEEK.			"

 Recieiver Games rarely consider the details of ammunition. The amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface, and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button. Actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task, however. Receiver, an first-person shooter (FPS) from Wolfire Games, wants to remind us of that fact. Unfortunately, it never makes it clear why we should care.Receiver drops the player into a randomly-generated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration (without subtitles) and that explain the game's story. The player begins with an unpredictable loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition. The player may also start with a flashlight or, if his gun is semi-automatic, a spare magazine or two. He must then move through the multi-tiered linear world looking for the tapes, which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one. I myself haven't managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dying.The game only has two kinds of enemies: a stationary gun turret and a flying drone, both of which can kill the player with a single hit. Each has some associated visual cues, but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when he's been spotted and when it's safe to move. The distribution of enemies changes, and on rare occasions they can be avoided. Because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see, however, killing everything in a room is generally the only option.Receiver started as a response to a seven-day FPS challenge and definitely feels like it, from its spare graphics to its room-entry stutter. The hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail. The HUD has no ammo count, and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath. Rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand, with the gun safely tucked away. If there's no spare magazine, the player has to eject the empty, refill it, then shove it back home again. The only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eye.Receiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters. The detailed reloading scheme doesn't speak to the story, the aesthetic, or the other mechanics. Receiver doesn't treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading, and doesn't fiddle much with the basics of movement, yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game. By making the world randomly generated, the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters. As a consequence, becoming more skilled with the game's most intricate systems doesn't make a player any more likely to succeed. Receiver's complex gun-handling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger design.That's a shame, because the larger design has nothing to recommend it. The perfunctory story and low-poly world of Receiver aren't interesting to explore in their own right, much less when one must overcome the game's unforgiving difficulty. The choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value, but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics. Receiver has a neat idea at its core, but that didn't translate into an interesting game.Final Score:  3.5   4 /10  "

												Reciever is a realistic FPS designed for players who want to get the most out of gun games and realism. It gives you the ability to really understand how guns work which games such as ""Call Of Duty and ""Counter Strike"" don't provide to you.The game has suspense so you do not know what is around the corner so you must make sure that your gun is fully loaded and ready to go.Some things I would recommend added is machine guns and smgs of some kind instead of stinking to pistol classed weapons. I sometimes find the help A.I to be annoying because it is telling me to put the gun to automatic, etc. I highly recommend this game for people who like the way guns work or a looking for a gun game full of suspense.

												This game has a fantastic concept. The mechanic adds a tension to first person shooting that I've never felt before. If you're into analyzing games, it's worth checking out, even in its current alpha state.I would love to see this kind of mechanic worked into a survival horror game. It would make shooting in a horror game finally add tension, rather than take it away. Even with the graphics as basic as can be at this stage, and even though you're just shooting turrets and little flying robots, the game makes me feel more tense than many of the horror games I've played.I can't wait to see where this goes.

												Since I noticed many of the people who are reviewing this title have less than 10 hours played, I will write from the perspective of my hours playing it. The good? -The main attraction to this game is the ability to do everything like engaging the safety, racking the slide, an extra round in the chamber, and other stuff. -While the base game only has 3 guns(m1911, glock, model 10 revolver) there is a mod on the wolfire forum that adds new guns like a shotgun, Thompson, C96, and more.-VR. Not built-in though. On the Receiver steam forum someone just added a VR mod that works with oculus and vive. As of writing this review, the extra weapons mod doesn't work with VR just the base 3 guns.The bad stuff?-The main thing that this game suffers from is the lack of different rooms/environments. Even though they are generated, the game chooses from a list of different rooms and puts them together.-Lack of guns. If your not into modding then this is a deal-breaker.-Gets repetitive. This relates to the two points above.-Complex controls. I noticed that many of the people who wrote negative reviews are ones that didn't like the controls. Plus, they have low hours. But if you have played for a while , they become second nature. -When entering rooms it always freezes for a couple frames to load them up. This has gotten me killed plenty of times!Extra thoughts:I think that if your willing to mod it, get it on sale($1.50), and don't expect to play for hours at a time, this title will be a pretty fun game to come back to every once in a while. This is one of those games that is good to play for 10-20 minute bursts. It's easy to jump in and jump out of.   "

												One thing that should be noted is this game was made for a contest in a week so I am going to ignore most of the problems other people may have already said and I think this game should not be judged on those at all. This is more concept demo then a game with very realistic gun management and bullet physics I find it fun and actually quite addicting especially cause it is quite difficult. I only have two problems with the game the main one is I would like to be able to choose my gun istead of it being random and I really don't like is the voice of the guy on the recordings, if he reads this I hope he is not offended but somthing about the voice annoyed me it also sounds like it was recorded on bad tape recorder but you can easily turn the voice sound off so not a big deal. I think this is a very viable concept for a full game and I hope someone makes one some day and I would say that and the fact that it was made in 7 days allows me to ignore the problems I would usually judge a full retail game on, so it gets an 8/10. Pros:Unique conceptDetailed gun managementDecent replayability from random map and enemy placementGood controlsMakes you feel like a badass when you have the commands memorizedCons:can't choose pistolbad voice audiogenerally is not polished and has bugs(overlooked because it was made in 7 days)GOD DAMN DRONES(play it you'll know what I'm talking about)			"

												I've spent over 50 hours playing receiver and I still have mixed feelings about it. The reloading mechanics are fantastic and I hope to one day see the same mechanics in a more fleshed out game.  Sadly past the reloading mechanics receiver is quite a shallow game. You only ever come across 2 types of enemy; turrets and drones, neither are practically fun to fight. There is only a small number of possible rooms so after you've played for a few hours the level design becomes very repetitive. The only objective is to find the tapes which can either be very tedious or ridiculously easy depending on the random level generator. Most of receivers problems come from the fact the bulk of the game was made in 7 days with only one real update after it's release, It's just a shame no more content was added afterwards. I hope one day a game developer will notice Receiver and make a properly fleshed out game built around It's gun mechanics.  but until that game comes out I'll just have to keep playing reciever and you will.

												I personally feel that this is one of the best firearm simulations available on steam, while the ""story"" is weird it is still fun to play. I also feel that this game deserves some credit due to the little amount of time it was issued for it to be produced, there a re three weapons including a colt m.1911, some form of the automatic glock series (i'm gonna guess a G17) and finally the classic colt revolver (I cant put a finger on the exact model). I personally also feel that a full game would be downright awesome, hopefully including something else than just pistols (assault rifles, shotgun etc.) This game actually ends to give a sort of tactical feel as well as a form of rage inducing. The ""rage"" (more annoying) is the F***ING flying tasers are incredibly hard to hit however not impossible (i personally think that they fit perfectly into the game). The other understandable point that is still annoying is that whenever you die, you start all over. Once again, I feel that this an understandable piece of the game and is completely rational, however it is still annoying.All in all I feel that this would be an amazing full game and is still a great game as the ""competition edition"" (the thing that it is right now)9/10			"

												Awesome game!It sure is hard at the beginning, you have to read the help bar and learn how to reload your gun.There's tension during all your playthrough, you will have to listen carefully for turrets around, you die with a single shot.But there are some things that I didn't like-When you die you lose all your progress and all your found tapes, and that's allright, when you find a tape that you already listened you can't skip it, you have to listen everytime what the tape says, and that's annoying.-Sometimes you spawn in bad places, for example in front of a flying turret that will kill you instantly.-If you find multiple flashlights they will remain in your inventory, and can't drop them.Apart from these things (they are pretty much small details) the game gave me a lot of fun, it's a really hard challenge and only those with fast reflexes can make it.

												This game is tense like no other. By creating a shooter based solely on realistically simulating a gun you're forced to start treating it like a gun. Ammo is precious, reloading requires you to concentrate on a process and aiming is delicate and precise. The controls may seem clunky and weird at first but once muscle memory kicks in it becomes a game about knowing your limits. You're not a run and gun badass, you're just a dude with a gun. You have to know when to kill the robots and when to walk away. In short, fantastic for the asking price.			"

												I hate this game with a burning passion, one hotter than the final breath that escapes you after you've been plastered with bullets from a stationary turret in the most ridiculous and unsuspecting spawn. If you don't prefer your blood being painted on the canvas on a wall then you can enjoy making your art on any ground surface as you find yourself making an incorrect leap or looking over the edge a bit too much. Otherwise, expect terror from a faint beep and the silent buzz, the robotic humming that will inch ever closer and even terrify you as to whimper as you knew not what would happen to you. The challenge the drives you to a point of insanity but forces you to keep returning only to repeat what you've tried contless times. I've, at long last, finally beat this game. ♥♥♥♥ You Receiver.

												How does one describe Receiver? Tis a weird little game with a bunch of cool features. Aight, we're gonna hafta split this up into pieces. STORY: The story of Receiver is similar to the first Hotline Miami in that the exposition is delivered in cutscenes in the form of various cassette tapes you find and have to play to finish the game. The story is that you are a Receiver, a survivor of the Mindkill event, an event that wipes the life off of the world you're on. Done by machines who had begun controlling the world, you are tasked to find all 11 cassette tapes and ascent to The World Not Filled With Turrets and Flying Tasers all the while dealing with the fact said machines are dropping in sentry guns and taser drones that can both drop your ♥♥♥ in 1 hit. GAMEPLAY: Gameplay in Receiver is the most interesting. It is similar to realistic shooters such as say Red Orchestra 2, Project Reality and so on. You get one of three guns, a Colt M1911A1, A S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver and a modified Glock 17 each with their own specialties, the Glock can fire in full auto, the Model 10 can be fired in single and double action and so on and so forth. Also different in Receiver is that you have to do many things via key presses, ranging from loading individual rounds into gun magazines, releasing slides, using the ejector rod in the Model 10 and so on. It seems complex at the beginning but become almost instictive after an hour or two.ENEMIES: As I said earlier, the enemies in the game are very basic, one is a sentry turret, the other a drone with a taser, or the ATF Special. Both of these are different as if you shoot specific parts of them, they do more damage. You can disable sentries by either shooting the CPU off to break it, disable it's battery or break the camera. As for the tazer bots, shoot it repeatedly, cause they're more annoying than the tazers in PAYDAY 2.IS IT WORTH IT?: The gameplay is rather solid and the gunplay is fun as well as realistic, and it sits at a nice $5 dollars. If you feel like spending $5 dollars on a small FPS then go ahead, if not, wait for a sale and nab it for cheaper.			"

												Long story short: This is what deus ex would have been if it was done by the director of fight club. Minimalist, beautiful, hard, mesmeric. Utterly recommended.----Now more detail: Receiver is a minimalist and realistic FPS. The game features 3 different models of guns: a S&W Model 10, a Colt M1911, or a Glock 17. It also features procedural levels (generated from patterns), and randomized placement for enemies (of which I've seen two different types, so far), items and objectives. That way, you never get the same experience twice. In addition, you spawn with a random selection of items, which can make the game difficulty range from moderately easy to very hard, depending on what you get.The idea behind the game is to be as close to a realistic gun handling experience as it is possible with a keyboard and mouse. It means that the game maps to the keyboard/mouse a lot more interactions with the gun than existing titles, and also, does so with much greater details than usual FPSes. In addition, the difference in the power of each gun is very noticable, making the experience feel even more authentic.A must have.			"

												as a firearms collector, the only downside of this game is it's difficult controls.  But all I can say is ""GET THIS GAME""now as for the firearms, stated earlier I am a firearms collector and had some pretty interesting addition ideas.1: Polish P63 MakarovThe P63 is a polish knock off makarov that fires the standard Makarov 9x18mm cartrage, it's slightly less powerful then a glock, but it's very slim, has an excellent sight picture, and is not prone to jamming.   It can make for an excellent concieled carry firearm and is readily available on the market for 150 dollars.2: Hi-Point .40 S&WHi-Point is another company for people on a budget, but what they build really hits a mark.  The .40 S&W cartrage is a mix between a .45 and 10mm, giving you the power of a .45 and the accuricy/mag count of a 10mm.  Why a high point?  Because we should all give some oddball guns some love.3:  Mauser C96 Broomhandle This would be a good fully/semi automatic model to add to the game for a few reasons: 1: it's gorgous2: It's full auto and semi auto3:It uses a stripper clip, and I feel you should add some of the more awkward loading mechanisms to the game4: It's gorgous... need I say more?Please consider these firearms.  They are all very easy to use and maintain, making it less of a pain on the user to fire them.  That and these would all be excellent additions to your game			"

												I got this game for free on https://www.humblebundle.com/storeGet it while you still can,anyway...The game takes a realistic approach to weapons handling,the controls seem complicated at first but you'll get used to them after 5 or 10 minutes or so.The game itself is surprisingly tense and suspenseful,it forces you to be tactical about your actions,one mistake will cost you your life and you have to start from the beginning of the game.What i don't like about this game is the collecting tapes thing,it's sorta cliché in my opinion.Challenging and super fun.This game deserves my 8/10.

												There's a reason they were giving this game away for free. Cool gun mechanics don't make up for crappy and repetitive design and unfinished, empty gameplay. This isn't a finished title, it's an experimental pistol simulator that doesn't make any sense and is confusing and ugly to look at.Gun nuts might enjoy it for its realism, every one else is better off giving it a miss.Full video review:

												Awesome shooter. The game give some feeling that you can't reach plaing COD or same shooters.Your gun here is not only a TV remote where you just press one button to fire and another for reloading. Here you should control each mechanism of a gun independently and learn how to do it faster. It's very cool at the beginning and it is still cool after hours plaing, because you always feel how you raise your mastery.Here every hit is fatal. You cannot heal your wounds just sitting in a cover. If you injured you can't survive. It give another nice feeling when you don't want to die and trying to survive as harder as it possible.Random generation is very good. Every play is something new. You cannot predict where should be a turret and where will be bullets. Every time you should search each corner and be ready to use your gun.			"

												Receiver is an INCREDIBLY challenging game. You will hate it and love it at the same time.You play an unnamed protagonist navigating through various indoor and outdoor areas in a structure located in an unnamed city. Many of the rooms are guarded by randomly-placed sentry turrets that shot you on sight, or helicopter/taser sentries that fly at you when you are detected. You come armed with one of three different handguns, all of which are nicely-rendered. Each one is operated in a realistic-manner that may be off--putting to the gamer used to relading by simply pressing the R key. In this game, reloading could involve five distinctly-different operations, depending on the gun you happen to have on you at the time.  The sound effects of the guns are nice, and have an authentic feel to them.The environments you travel around in are randomly assembled, and comprised of flat-shaded textures and occasional lights. The assembly of the rooms means that you occasionally find passages to nowhere, but that doesn't really detract from gameplay. Repetition is high, and some of the rooms/areas are confusing, but since you are just passing through, it's not really a big deal. Your goal is to locate ammo and tapes, and the threats are there to stop you.Audio is pretty good, with a couple of notable exceptions:1: the helicopter sentries are loud enough to be heard from one room over, but it becomes difficult to pin down their locations based on the audio alone. 2: The sentry turrets also make sounds while they rotate, but you can't hear them until you're almost right on top of them. Their sounds, as well as the helicopters,  also pass through walls/floors at the same volume level. This aspect of the game is bothersome if you are searching a room. I prefer to play the game with the music silenced so I can try to hear the threats before they spot me, and often I find that I am shot dead before ever hearing the servo motor of the turret that nailed me. 3: The audio tapes are well-voiced, but remind me a lot of the sort of thing you might find on a webiste run by fringe-science/conspiracy theorists. After playing for a few hours, I completly silenced the tapes because I became bothered at having to hear them over and over again. Kudos to the devs for allowing this option in the settings. The main goal of the game is to find all 11 tapes, and ""absorb"" them by listening. Listening occurs while you continue exploring, so that's a good thing. I did find a couple of small problems with the exploration/survival aspect:1: Sometimes the game allows you to access an area that does not have an exit. The only option is to exit and restart. 2: You are assigned a random firearm and random loadout upon starting. Rarely, you will find yourself without enough ammo to eliminate enough of the threats to be able to find more. 3: (Extremely rare) you begin the game in the direct line of site of a threat, and get killed immediately.For a game created in a week as part of a contest, the developers have done an admirable job! The simplicity of the design and the addictiveness of the concept keeps me coming back over and over again. I've only managed to get as high as 4 tapes before being mowed down by a threat in a moment of complacency. The game forces you to be on high-alert at all times, and punishes relaxed attitudes brutally. You will learn to use expletives effectively, I guarantee.Worth every bit of the 5 bucks it currently is. Get it. You'll be glad you did.			"

												Aside from it being a labor intensive shooter, it's pretty good.By labor intensive, i mean, you have countless buttons to reload a gun. You actually have to take your time, rather than just pressing R.Also, i'm not a fan of the story. It feels like a Youtube tutorial or something. I'm not a fan of listening to tapes of a droning 50 year old about a story somebody thought up during a night at the bar.While i'm here, a tip (If you get it): Check your gun on each spawn.

												First be warned that Receiver is more of a short demo than a full game. Personally, i love its concepts, and i would love it to become a full game. Here is why.It mixes in two of my favourite things in gaming: survival horror and attention to detail.You start off with either of the three handguns: M1911 Colt, a double action revolver, or a Glock, and random amount of ammo with you. The point of the game is to wander around in search of the cassette tapes, and there are eight of them. The levels are random generated, and have enemies, ammo and/or cassette tapes scattered inside.The trick is that you can manipulate your gun. You can manipulate the slide, the hammer, take the magazine out, safety switch, and each gun works differently. For the colt and the glock, you have to check whether the bullet is in the chamber. Or for example, the colt requires you to pull the hammer to be able to shoot it. The revolver also has a hammer, but it is a double action, so it does not require you to pull it back, but you can still do it and it makes it more accurate that way.I also want to mention the enemies in this game - turrets and flying drones. The turret is stationary and it rotates. It has a camera and if it spots you, it starts shooting from its machine gun. The flying drone is a mobile version, with a tazer. One hit from either of them takes you down. Each enemy is made up of some parts: motor, battery, camera, weapon, and depending on where you shoot, you can either partially or fully take them down.You shoot a turret or a drone in the motor, it will stop spinning or flying, but its camera and weapon are still active, and if you get into its line of sight (turret) or close enough (drone), it will kill you.If you shoot its camera off, it will still fly around or spin, but it will be harmless.Also, the turret's machine gun has an ammo box, which you can shoot preventing its machine gun from shooting, but there is still one round in the chamber.Here is for the visual representation:

A Guide for Receiver
By: Maxwell218

			  Greetings   Hi there receivers, In your training formation, we forgot to teach you something essential for your mission's completion: enemy weakpoints!		


As for the survival horror part, i think you have already guessed it. You start off with a pretty low ammo count. You must carefully use what you have, and try to actively find more ammo.The game is pretty hard to complete though, but what matters is not the ending, but the experience. That said, there are cheats to provide unlimited ammo, invulnerability and slow motion. I highly suggest using the slow motion cheat - just type ""slowmo"" and use to tab to switch back and forth in speed.			"

												Fun game.Gets real boring when you realize it's the same old same old thing over and over and over again, though, and once you get all tapes, that's it, you're gonna be pretty done. Enemies are the same two over and over again. Flying sentry robots, and turrets.Operating the handguns in Receiver is the only part of the game what will keep you engaged. If you don't have a weird hardon for guns then you're not gonna be into this game.One thing I find weird - I've been shot a bunch by a turret before, then had time to duck into cover, only dying a couple seconds later. Just peculiar.I still recommend it, because, hey, a weeks work resulted in this? Eh, fair enough. It is what it is.			"

												Surprising indie gem. One of the tightest FPS experiences I've everplayed. Premise of the game is simple--you're dumped into a kind of 'dream world', and you need to recover a series of tapes to 'wake up' (think The Matrix meets Videodrome meets Vanilla Sky. Or something.)You're moving through a series of what are, apparently, interconnected apartment buildings, each with multiple floors that connect across. There are enemies scattered throughout, but only two types: flying kill drones, and turrets. Kill drones will fly straight for you and electrocute you at close range, turrets will shoot a spray of bullets at you from afar.So far, so generic, and a lot less content than most FPS. So why play?Well, what makes the game work so well are the detailed mechanics.First off, if you're struck even once, or fall, that's it--you're dead. Going gun blazing into a room is pretty much game over.Second, you control every mechanic of your gun with a separate keyboard key. Just arming and firing your weapon will take you a few playthroughs to learn, but when you do--it's amazing how rewarding your actions feel.Third, running requires that you 'tap' the forward key, lending a neat kinetic element to the game.Fourth, ammo is scarce, and you'll have to selectively choose which fights you want to engage in... and which to bypass or run for it.Despite the sparse world and somewhat rudimentary graphics, sound design and aesthetics are brilliant, and I haven't been so kinetically into a game since the days of Atari 2600. Bravo!It's hard to explain the culmination of all of the above elements; you'll simply have to try it out for yourself. It's unlike any oher FPS and revolutionary at what it does. I guess I would call Receiver the 'thinking man's shooter'. It's terrific; buy it, then go yell at the devs to show it a little love and update it rather than spending all their time making rabbit-fighting games.			"

												Receiver is a Procedural Death Labyrinth originally developed as part of a 2012 ""7 Day FPS Challenge"" by Wolfire Games, who've gone on since to develop Overgrowth forever. Right off the bat, it's more tech demo than game - everything about Receiver is incredibly barebones in every aspect. There are three different weapons you start with, randomly decided on startup. There are two enemy types and only one is a real threat. Aside from collecting 11 short tapes that detail the world, over and over again, your only real pickups are bullets for your one gun with the occasional moderately useless flashlight. But despite its barebones nature, Receiver is an incredibly fun tech demo. You control each and every minute aspect of the weapon. From manually ejecting the magazine and inserting each bullet, to inspecting the chamber and messing with the slide lock, your firearm is a precise instrument of beauty when being handled. This has the side of effect of slowing the gameplay down to a crawl, which when provided with the mostly stationary enemies and emphasis on not being seen, and especially that each enemy has five or six weak points that mandate precise aiming, Receiver is the essence of a survival game. Perhaps even survival horror, given the stress.It's not difficult to explain why Receiver has captured the interest of so many. It is an incredibly engrossing game. It's far from a perfect or even polished game, however.All of the art in the game is incredibly simple - apart from the looming cityscape, it's all very simple geometric shapes with no textures and no complexity. It is, therefore, such a surprise that the game runs so badly. Even running at the lowest resolution with the fastest graphics option enabled and no other programs or windows up, I was still experiencing slowdown. Whether or not this is a side effect of developing for Unity is for someone else to decide.As mentioned before, the procedural generation is incredibly vapid. There's also only about two dozen room types, and whether or not you succeed at the game very quickly becomes a question of if you can avoid an encounter of a room packed with flying killdrones long enough to gather all the tapes to hear the story and end the game, which just ends the process. There's not even a save function.For the story itself - there's a sense of enlightenment that you can experience regularly on the internet. It's when you're viewing a perfectly normal image, and then it dawns on you that you're actually flicking through pornography. This is like that, except with somebody's paranoid fantasy. The ""Mindkill"" and the media being instruments of mass destruction is a hilariously tinfoil to say the least.However, with all this in mind and that the biggest disappointment is the lack of content, the gameplay itself is ultimately fun enough to override all concerns. It's fun enough that despite being one of the most shallow ""rogue-lites"" yet, it's also one of the best.If you're in the market for a ""one of a kind"" survival game set in a Cyberpunk Dreamscape, then I couldn't recommend Receiver more. Just don't expect an overwhelming amount of actual stuff in it.			"

												Got this game for free from Humble Bundle and my first thought was ""how lame does this look?""  Upon giving it a chance and playing it...wow.  Sure, it's very bare-bones and has a simple premise, but it's much more complicated then it looks.  Gone are the days of auto-reloads and clicking fire until your enemy is dead.  This game relies on knowing your ammo levels, actually pulling the magazine out of the gun, reloading it by hand, and then re-inserting the magazine before you can fire at your next target.You are set in a housing complex of sorts that is spotted with machine gun turrets and roving, flying taser-bots.  It's a lot harder than you'd think!  Would love to see this game flesh out some more (also to add some arms to relieve the creepy ""invisible man"" effect.Worth a shot to play!			"

												I really wish I could reccommend this game. I really do. The gun mechanics are amazing and satisfying, but just not enough happens. I understand it was made in 7 days, but allow me to sum up the gameplay.You spawn. You ♥♥♥♥ around with your gun until it makes bullets come out the end. The sounds are satisfying and the buttons intuitive. You are content. You walk down a hallway, pick up a tape recorder. The most unhyped guy ever starts droning the controls you have already learned at you. Fair enough, voice acting is hard. You walk through a door, a flying drone comes out of nowhere , acts like you are firing cusions at medium velocity at him, then zaps you to death.You spawn. Rinse and repeat.Thats it. I wish there was more, there is so much potential here, but for this, its not worth it. Instead, I would reccommend Papers Please for the money, or SUPERHOT for a free demo of a game with a much more interesting concept. Stay clear at least until more is added.			"

												More of a concept / tech demo than a game, but this is really cool.  This is less about what you are shooting and more about how to mechanically work a handgun.  There are 3 types of handguns you can randomly spawn with each time you start, and each operates differently.  There doesn't seem to be much to this game, but after 2 hours I am still interested.  If you want to actually 'beat' the game, I imagine it is very challenging.  Definitely worth picking up, especially if on sale.			"

												Alright kiddies, lets talk about Receiver.  This is a gun porn game. You get bullets, you get a gun.  That's it. One hit, and you die.  You've got two enemies, stationary turrets and flying tazers. You're dropped in this tower complex and have to find eleven cassettes to unleash your mind powers and finish the game.The plot doesn't matter.  This is a gun porn roguelite with gunporn and swat gameplay.  Its simple and low overhead, but high concept.  You're going to check corners, sprint erratically (none of that 360 no scope ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), and will start praying that the next set of rooms you encounter will have more bullets or clips. You can die from fall damage, you will risk falling to make a running leap for those bullets. You will crouch around corners to kill those turrets with three shots to their base. You will dip around corners to try and take out their sensors to save those precious rounds for later.  Those bullets are all that stand between you and oblivion at the hands of the enemy. Your psychic powers will make them glow like manna from heaven. You will take every spare second to load every spare bullet into a clip. After every engagement, you will check your gun and your ammo and make sure you don't spend the last free moments of your miserable existence frantically trying to load bullets in a clip while a hovedrone closes in for the kill on your enormous head.You are also going to fail, a lot.  But many of you like that, and it can be very satisfying to clear half a level only to fail in a hail of gun fire or miss that ledge for those precious shiny bullets.This game was developed for the 7 day FPS challenge and is the most streamlined experience for the FPS genre I have ever played. I have never beaten it, and I will never care. It is the thrill of dropping a hover drone from beyond its range, the joy in disabling a turret in a single shot, the chill of creeping into a new area and seeing the blue grid shine out from its sensors.This is a gameplay experienced refined to its purity.  I would enjoy an open world survival game based on these gunporn mechanics, if it played as smooth as this.			"

												To be honest, at the first look this game doesn`t attract you at all, you may even think that it`s easy, but when you get into it, when you play at least 30 minutes, you will see how difficult this game is. I like challenges. I recommend this.			"

												Ok, I admit this game is not for everyone... for instance, a couple of friends who I recommended it to didn't really like it.Receiver is not a common FPS. It can get a bit repetitive with its enemies and and locations, it is the gun mechanics what make it so special; you got to go through all the steps in order to get your gun working, and the turrets having different hit spots is a nice touch...the tapes and music give the game a cyberpunk vibe, wich is really cool.I got it for free from the Humble Bundle store so I don't know if I would have paid for it, get it on an offer, the replayability value is not that high			"

												Best gun simulator out there.Seriously now, this game is all about knowing how to pistols realistically so expect to be really confused at first. Your first impression will most likely be that this is just a bad project made on Unity but if you keep playing it for at least 10 minutes you really get into the mood of the game. Although I will not spoil the game, be prepared to study how each pistol works and learning how to manage bullets is essential. This game really shows how wrong modern shooters are about how guns actually behave like in real life and gives you an idea of how really hard it is like to use one.			"

												An excellent concept game. If you have never handled a firearm before, Receiver can teach you a couple of things about them. Sure, you wont learn trigger discipline or real recoil control, but you WILL learn some of the steps needed to re-lode a gun. The first time you perform a re-load using nothing more than motor memory is massively satisfying. The bad news is that every time you see an unnecessary pullback on a slider or charging arm in a game from now on, it will annoy you.Full disclosure: I have never fired or reloaded a gun in my life.

Since then, there have been over 50 school shootings in the United States alone.Coincidence?

												Receiver can be classified as a first-person roguelike-like, or as a better name, a procedural death labyrinth. In Receiver you play as... well a Receiver, who is someone who has survived what is known as the ""Mind Kill"" and must collect eleven tapes hidden in the world armed only with a pistol and some bullets.The game is procedurally generated, almost fully it seems, the world, what pistol and how much ammo you start with, what is placed where, is all generated on the fly, the layout of levels seem to be the same but not the placement, sort of like the game takes these block shaped rooms and places them in whatever order it feels like.The core concept of this game is simple, you start with a random gun picked out of a pool of three types, there are two kinds of robots, turrets and drones, you die in one shot, you must collect eleven tapes, as you gain more tapes, the rooms get harder as there will be more and more robots.Where the unique part of this game comes in is the weapon mechanics, this is not a normal first-person shooter, you can't just aim the gun and expect it to fire, the game simulates to some degree actual pistol mechanics using keyboard shortcuts, so to fire your gun you need to make sure you have bullets in the magazine, make sure the safety is off, pull back the hammer, and so on and so forth.Each action is done rather easily as the controls are very natural and intuitive as well as customizable, once you start playing more and remember the controls you can actually reload and fire faster, much like in real life where speed could be everything, all the guns have a real tactile feel to them, and there is nothing more satisfying then dropping a magazine onto the floor and slamming in a new one that you hand loaded before, pulling back the slide and taking down a robot as it flies toward you.Overall I love this game, despite how simple it is the gameplay is incredibly fun and replayable and is challenging but never seems to be frustrating, having very snappy gameplay and tight controls.

												Receiver is... very interesting.In a good way, of course. When you first jump into the game you'll find yourself armed with one of three different handguns, a variety of bullets and/or magazines, and, if you're lucky, a flashlight. This is one of the key features of Receiver - everything is random. Your loadout, the layout of the world, items in the world - just about everything is random in every playthrough (and trust me, you'll be playing through a lot). There's also perma-death - when you're shot (or tazed) by the automated turrets and shock-drones, you're down for the count and thrown into a new world with a new loadout head-first.But even with these different mechanics, what makes Receiver all that interesting if you just get three guns and a flashlight? That would be the five or so different buttons needed to reload. In Receiver, you don't just hit 'R' to slap another mag in, you manually pull the empty magazine out with 'E', holster your gun with '~', slot any spare bullets you have into the magazine with 'Z', draw your gun again, hit 'Z' again to slam the magazine in, and hold 'R' for a second to chamber a round. There are a couple other buttons to do a few extra things, too, and each gun has it's own reloading mechanics (these controls being for the Colt 1911. There's a simpler S&W Revolver and Glock 17 available).While these controls sound unnecessarily clunky, and I can't say they're realistic, it adds a new horror to your gun going 'click' while an enemy is charging you. You don't wait a couple seconds for the gun to auto-reload - you have to keep a clear head and go through each step of the process. Which is why you end up respawning a lot, unless you pause for a minute and drill yourself in the reloading process. This is the key feature of the game, and much more interesting (not to mention satisfying) than it sounds. And, come on, the game's only five bucks without a sale, and if you pre-order Overgrowth (which is a great game) you get this for absolutely free. You (hopefully) won't regret it :P			"

												Receiver is an odd mix of brilliant idea and incomplete design. Essentially, it's more of a proof of concept than a finished game. Reloading, managing bullets, switching switches and all the various bits of micromanagement that we take for granted when playing most FPS games all add up to making for a fun experience that give an awesome feeling of knowing you've done the whole process yourself. It's thoroughly satisfying when you first figure out how to unload, drop mag, reload new mag and unlock the slider all in a second. That's the game's main selling point and it does it well. What you might not expect is that this is a very tense, almost horror game that gives off a creepy, lonely atmosphere. I've not felt like that since playing Amnesia.All this creates a great game but there are major problems that mean I simply cannot recommend it (but only just). Firstly, it's buggy, unoptimized, void of any real detail, has dull scenery, there's no choice which gun you start with, there are only two enemies and it often feels very unfair when you spend ages looking for cassettes without finding a single one or start with only 3 bullets and finding no more around. As I said, it's a great proof of concept but it's not a finished game. For that reason, I can't recommend it. If you happen to have it free then give it a go and feel like a champ in a cardboard world.			"

												The game is perfect for what it was designed to do. The only thing that is a complete shame is that it was made as an experiment and therefore is not being developed for anymore. If there was an additional few maps and an armory of weapons, then my 9.7 hours would most likely turn into 30-40 hrs easily. I became really good at the game and the only reason that I stopped playing was because there was nothing for me to move onto. A phenominal game considering what it is.			"

												A game of concepts, and it works.In this game, you are allegedly a 'Receiver', who has to find about and stop the 'Mindkill'. This is no easy task, as you spawn randomly, sometimes with mags and ammo, and other times now. Speaking of mags/ammoo, you must manually reload your mags with ammo found scattered throughout while finding the casette tapes. Makes for some tense action if you are being chased by flying robots. It's $5 so why not? It's good, the soundtrack is good, (albeit limited to one track, that i've heard at least, which is fine considering how it was made in a week.)The game can be very frustrating sometimes until you get a handle on the reloading mechanics.Overall an 8/10.

												Got it for free when I bought Overgrowth. Basically, it's handgun porn. It's repetitive, but once you learn the controls, you keep coming back despite the Dark Souls-like punishment for screwing up. Sometimes I've flicked the game on, promising to spend only a few minutes, and then I look at the clock later and discover that an entire hour has gone by. It's pretty good, with two exceptions.1: This guy is the weakest person alive. I mean, okay, getting shot once and you go down, that's fine, but I've jumped out of trees higher than the distance this guy will break his legs upon landing from.2: It runs very poorly. I'm not sure whether that's due to inefficient coding or whatnot, because we all know the circumstances by which this game came about, but I can hear my computer chugging away even on the lowest graphics settings, and the game stutters like a chipmunk on crack. Meanwhile, I can run The Witcher on its highest settings without so much as a drop in the framerate.Had this been pitched to me on paper, I would've said, ""Go back and finish it, then we'll talk."" However, now that I've spent some time with it, and gotten addicted enough to find all the tapes, I must say that had I known it was this much fun, I would have paid full price.			"

												If you thought there were no challenges left for FPSs, think again, because this game is a huge challenge itself. You will most likely assume that this guy is just like your typical shooters, but no. Sadly, it's not. Receiver is truly a gun simulator that will kick your ♥♥♥ so many times that you will get frustrated beyond belief. I sat hitting almost every single key on my keyboard only because I didn't know how to reload/switch magazine. It almost made me forget how to shoot. It requires a lot of memorizing, because you will need to know what each button does. When you have started to get a hold of the commands, there will be a lot of practicing. This game doesn't perform on easy mode, if anything, it is ""realism mode"". The Glock and M1911 are the most complex guns so far. If anything, you should start out with the revolver. The easiest gun to get used to (that is until I found out how to reload...).Was this easy? F*** no! Was it fun? Surprisingly, yes. Mainly because of the challenge.9/10			"

												Terrifying in it's technicality.While this is not a horror game, it really plays like one. With the constant fear of turrets and flying drones ready to kill you in a single shot, and the multitude of keys required to handle and operate your firearm, this game will have your palms sweating after a few seconds.One hit, one kill, is what you'll learn all of the ""bad guys"" in this game deal. If you get hit by a bullet, or tazed by the drones, you're down for the count. Which is great, you have to be much more tactful in your efforts to solve the puzzle of this game. But ammo is often scarce, and danger looms around every corner. Match that with the creepily monotone voice of the man on the recordings guiding you through this Mind Kill event, and you have yourself a very intense journey through an every changing maze.This game is awesome, but be prepared to lose your mind when you forget how to reload, or unknowingly step into the sights of a turret. I suggest playing with the help menu open :).			"

												You are the Receiver. Don't let the title of the game lead you to think this game is a redneck's wetdream. Receiver is an FPS (First Person Shooter) based around the idea of an apocalyptic setting where are reality is a realm of shadows, our media (as we call it) controls us, feeds off of us, studies us and kills us. The story and the soundboard for this game is eerie beyond belief. The Dev team that created Recevier is one of the more caring teams, while small, they provide good products in due time. For five dollars or for free with a copy of Overgrowth, this game has by far earned my respect and satisfaction. If you're looking for a difficult game with a great underlying theme for cheap, Receiver is for you.Good luck, and steady yourself, Receiver.			"

												Keep in mind that this game was made on a game jam, in only two 2 days, don't expect the world here.It's a reandomly generated ""dungeon"" game, whereyou objective is to find all the 11 audio tapes trough the map. Your weapon and ammo is also random, sometimes you can have a 9mm pistoll with 3 full clips, other times you can have a revolver with 5 bullets.Each piece of the gun has its own button, so if you want to reload your revolveryou need to open it, then shake it down to take out the bullets, reload it bullet bullet by bullet and then closing it. Pistols in the other hand are faster to reload, but you need to reload the mags before using them, and to make it you have to put your gun out of your hands. This makes reloading be a pain in the ♥♥♥, rewarding and very tense at the same time, depends on the person.Also, enemies which are only 2, can be damage in multiple ways, like the turrets which keeping scanning the map, you can shoot the camera and make it blind, you can shoot it's base and lock it facing one direction, or you can shoot the support of it and make it be facing the ground.It's a fun litle game, if you want an fps with doesn't hold your hand in any way and make your bullets really count, you can take a few hours of enjoying out of it ^_^.

												Edit: Just to clearify, I bought the game directly from the developers, and have not played it after it was released on steam, which is why I have 0 hours on Steam.It's a very hard game.You won't be able to get to ""the end"" within your first day of playing, unless you learn motorics extremely fast.Due to the difficulty it is also a very rewarding game. Not in a materialistic way, but in a mental way.When you manage to take down your first trio of flyers you'll feel like a boss.That feeling doesn't get old very fast - since you will probably die within the next few rooms since you inevitably wasted a lot of bullets by fighting three enemies at the same time :PIt's pretty rinse/repeat when it comes to gameplay mechanics, but luckily the rooms, enemies, tapes and weapons are randomized so that adds more replayability to it.If you are interested I suggest getting it in the Overgrowth preorder bundle directly from wolfire.com.You'll get access to both the Overgrowth alpha, Receiver full game AND Low Light Combat.

Two, the drones are ♥♥♥♥ing hard to stop. Please, change this a bit. It's hard to kill one drone chasing you, let alone three.

												This game is really an unpolished proof of concept, and not an actual developed game, though it is somewhat playable. I love the gun handling mechanics and its absolutely worth playing just for that. Once you've begun to master the mechanics of handling and reloading the different guns, it really is enjoyable. It feels rewarding to get proficient with each weapon. I wish someone would take this concept (of micromanaging reloads and gun handling) into a more playable more polished concept. As for Receiver, yes you can put a few hours into it, but ultimately it's too frustrating. There are only 2 types of enemies, some are too easy and some are nearly impossible. The stationary drones just spin in place, telgraphing their movements and give you plenty of time to shoot them with well timed and aimed shots. The aerial drones, which I refer to as ""Flying F!@#s"" are impossible. There is just no way to see them (all) in time and they are just too fast, some rooms will spawn 4 or 5 of them. Your field of view is too small to see them and they are just way too fast and maneuverable. I think they were supposed to be an enemy who would force you to rapid reload under pressure, but in practice they either don't detect you and drop with one shot, or you empty your mag on one while the other one zaps you from behind. I really do like playing this, but its not developed to a stage where you'd really want to try and ""play through"" to the end (believe me I've tried). From the enthusiasm of the ""tapes"" I can't imagine the ending being very rewarding anyway.			"

Modern devs think that to make a good game, you need lots and lots of mechanics helping the player, whereas I think that its the other way around. The simplicity of the concept, yet the stress of reloading, ammo conservation and punishment for minor mistakes makes this game so very very satisfying, far more than a game with bosses that you get bored fighting and your only concern is how much all these shotgun shells are gonna cost. *cough* fallout 4 *cough*			"

												I've only spent a small amount of time playing this. The mechanics are exciting, the Killdrones definitely live up to their names, and one singular mod has made this game better than base. I highly recommend that you mod this game with the mod that adds guns like the Mauser C96, the Tokarev TT33, and the Remington 870.Now, the game dips quite a bit on optimization; you can only run it smoothly on fastest/640x480 video settings, but it still is good enough. As the game generates nearby rooms, it also can lag up and make it troublesome to kill that one drone that saw you enter but you can't see hurtling towards you. It also dips in vanilla choices and the game seems very incomplete without textures to cover the blank walls and only 3 guns.The story behind the game is what you take from it, but I'll let you in on what I took from it.You have survived a great cataclysm called the Mindkill, which was an attempt at shutting down your brain with propaganda and media corruption. A receiver is a person who can turn around the negative effects of the Mindkill, with the help of a set of Cassettes called ""Clear Tapes"" to jog your mental capacity and remain on point. The killdrones and sentry drones are dreamed in to stop you from collecting all the tapes, to become awakened, and to stride carefree and conscious. While one can dream endlessly on, it takes one with true enlightenment to break free from the tyranny and claim their mind as their own.Heheh, I probably botched that up hardcore.This game gets a 8/10, with a WHOLE lotta room for improvement and even more potential. It's style is addicting and very enjoyable. Absolutely worth the price.			"

												This is more a tech demo than a real game.  Even so, the game aspect is so difficult, I haven't been able to beat a level once.  It uses randomly created levels, in which you have to find 11 objects.  Scattered in the levels are stationary enemy gun turrets, and flying ones as well.  You are provided with 1 of 3 weapons and some ammo, maybe a flashlight.  You can find more ammo in the level, and a few flashlights scattered around as well.Where this ""game"" shines is in it realistic weapon mechanics.  Guns are treated more as the tools they are than the violent weapons they can be used as.

												in Receiver you'll 'receive' a gun (there are different guns) and your main goal is to find audio cassettes (a bit like Slender Man if u will). Automated Turrets and Flying robots are trying to stop you from finding all audio cassettes.Using the gun is pretty realistic, you will have to reload your ammo and check if you got a bullet in the chamber. Also ammo is very scarce and hitting targets is difficult. Failing to take out the turrets and/or robots quickly will result in a quick death, they will attack you with precision and you will die after one or two hits. Everytime you start a new game the map (and audio cassettes) are randomised so that adds to the replay value. For a game that has been made in just 7 days, Receiver is a really good game. Obviously you should not expect a game that will enjoy you for many hours, but the time you spend with this game is well worth it. "

												This is Receiver, a game made by Wolfire Games in 7 days for the 7DFPS competition.You are a Receiver.""What do you mean by that?"" You might think.Okay. You are part of many more other Receivers that dead-dropped cassette tapes all over the place  and you have to pick them up because save the trees.  and you are tasked to listen to the tapes in an unordered fashion to uncover the truth of what happened.The gameplay mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. You are given 1 of 3 guns.The guns in the game are:-Glock 18-Colt 1911-S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" The tapes were NOT updated when the Glock and the S&W were added, so one of the tapes still considers your weapon to ALWAYS be the 1911. All weapons have realistic ballistics. (AKA bullets fly and ricochet like IRL)Again, you might be thinking ""So what?""Well, I'll tell you what. You have to operate specific parts of the gun to be able to even fire a single bullet.Okay, it's not that complicated.For example, the slide, slide release and hammer are different buttons that you have to press to use the gun.You heard that right, kids. The old days of pressing 'R' to reload are over.After a while of figuring out the controls  and dropping all of your magazines  you then have to pick up tapes.Yes, remember back at the start of the guide? TAPES. But to do that, you have to overcome...ENEMIESThere are 2 enemy types in the game.  Both are referred to as 'killdrones' on the tapes. -Turret (Your ordinary stationary turret that swivels and shoots many bullets into you)-Stun Drone (Basically an automated helicopter with a very painful stun gun on it)The catch is that the enemies all have very similar parts, in which way you are able to destroy them.For example, you can put one bullet into the battery and have it dead, or shoot it's main weapon and risk missing and then getting shocked or/and shot.After you recover all of the tapes, you awaken. From what? When did you fall 'asleep'? Play the game and find out.8/10 Great storyline, great gameplay, OK visuals.			"

												This game is a very entertaining puzzle-shooter that is challenging as hell and insanely intuitive in it's reloading. You actually manually cycle through the entire reloading process and start out with one of three different pistols including an M1911, a revolver and a Glock (I think). You must find ammunition and other equipment yourself, as well as a series of tapes that reveal the story of the game while avoiding security sentries and flying drones. No respawns, no retries for any given scenario. When you die, the scenario changes and everything is relocated. Sometimes you start with multiple full clips and a flash light, others you start with nothing but your gun. Ultimately, this is a fun game to play. Definitely comes highly recommended.

												This game, man. This game.So, it's an Indie ♥♥♥♥ing-great game.Let's get it over for a few seconds...The particularity is about, except the gameplay, the fact that the controls are hard, but you'll get over them after some deaths.Dying in this game doesn't mean, as most people think, dying. It means that you must improve yourself, here. Dying because you get shooted by a turret or because you get stunned by a drone doesn't mean that's your fault, it just means that this game is hard and you must play for some time to get over these deaths. You can use walls as an advantage, I mean, all these particularities help the game, alot.One of the best indie games out there, buy it if you like challenging games and even if you don't mind some weird controls configuration.

												One word easily describes this game: thrilling.It's easy enough to imagine what you think you would do a situation Receiver puts you in.  But, for those who have never used a gun, it comes across stressful, dreadful and filled with panic.  And that is was makes this game absolutely fantastic!The idea is simple - you have a gun and off you go.  But it is more a gun simulator than a rouge-like.  Every part of a gun is modelled and must be manipulated to ensure you survive the levels.So most of your time is spent asking questions like, ""Is my magazine loaded? Safety off? Is there a round in the chamber? Will it jam? Is there a round in the chamber?"".  And by the time you think you've answered those questions you've forgotten to aim and actually shoot the enemy in front.			"

												This game isn't about flashy or fancy graphics, it's about drilling the player on handguns mechanics in the context of a barebones tactical simulator.  As such, the visually bare environment really suits it.  Much more would be less--the game is a work of art in its own right.  The premises and specifics of the storyline are New-Agey (and therefore pretentious, if not ridiculous), but they do provide a context for playing and winning the game.  The ending kinda sucks, but it's really about the journey.The game is challenging.  Ammunition tends to be very limited, especially for the Colt 1911.  It only takes one shot to take you down, but depending upon your shot placement, several rounds may be required to take down a drone or turret.  Player character seems to have brittle bones disease.  If you fall or jump more than a few feet down, you will die. There are no checkpoints or saves. When you die, you have to start all over again in a new, ""randomly"" generated map, with a ""random"" loadout of equipment.   You will probably die numerous times before you actually finish the game.   Most of those times, you will probably feel stupid.  Other times, you will be completely out of ammunition, having started with little, having found little, having used what you had efficiently, and having died trying to get more.Game actually succeeded tricked me into listening to recordings of the same  of asinine drivel over and over again, while I thought I was having fun.  Would-be cult leaders and New-Age charlatans take note!I died once because I couldn't make the last step up a flight of stairs.  I tried to run-jump it, bounced backwards, landed at the bottom of the stairs, and died. -4 points for the stair bug.  +3 points for not making me feel like a ninja superhero.For a cheap indie title: 9/10.

												The game's rather... Well I can't say it sucks or isn't worth your time.Due to it's 5 dollar price, I personally think that it's mostly irrelevant if it's any good or not, unlike Gnomoria.The game is listed as an Experimental shooter with drones and turrets and it would be right about that, but just remember, even if the game acts a bit like Slender, The Eight Pages, there is no penalty for picking up the tape recorders.Also nothing will seek you out and kill you, well okay the drones will if they spot you.The game seems to rather accurately mimic how guns actually work, and you get to literally see every bit of most of the basics in how to work a gun, Atleast I would imagine so.There's about 3 guns and they all work differently actually, and each tape you pick up gives a bit of story into the game, and let me tell you, it's honestly rather sweet, almost Matrix-levels of awesome in my opinion. I won't give it away honestly.Coming from a guy who rage quits MOBAs because he sucks at most of them, and does so for weeks at a time, I haven't gotten past 1 tape (which you absorb apparently, atleast according to the game) and have died about 6 times, mostly due to turrets, and once due to a wierd drone that dryhumped my face and apparently shocked me.It is not hard to die in this game. Fall damage will usually always kill you, and I think if shot you will eventually die, even if you get away intact. The game's difficult and would benefit from Razer Hydra control support greatly in my opinion, maybe even some oculus Rift support too, though the difficulty at that point would only increase honestly.Play this game like you would play Dark Souls. Use your brain, observe the patterns of enemies and be stupidly cautious, and I'm sure you won't die as much.It's pretty fun. I've only played 12 minutes but it's still pretty fun.8/10 for a cool and originally executed concept, gun simulation... even if that REALLY needs to exist in alot of other places.Oh, did I mention it works like a Rogue-like game? Nope, I also didn't tell you about fake tapes in the level, or how the tapes don't play the first one, even if it is your first one until the game is reset completely.			"

												For such a simple game, this one's done a great job of keeping my heart pumping quickly. Pros: - The gun mechanics are much more complicated in this game than most, which makes it very unique. Instead of simply pressing ""R"" to reload a weapon, there is a specific key that is pressed for every step of the reloading process (Removing mag, adding bullets to mag, inserting mag, cocking weapon, etc.). - Your two enemies, Bots and Turrets, both have various hit boxes that, when shot, provide different effects. Turrets, For example, spin around in a circle scanning for the player, and if you fall inside of their sweeping scanner's view, they will fire on you. So shooting a turret in a certian spot may prevent it from spinning, but leave its gun fully operational, and able to shoot you if you walk in front of it; while shooting another location may leave the scanner untouched but render the gun itself useless.- 3 or 4 different guns to choose from that all have different mechanics, strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.- Maps are randomly generated.Cons:- The game is very repetitive. As your goal is always the same: gather the tapes. - Graphics are awkwardly ugly- Lack of enemies/weapons- Slight learning curve for gun mechanics.Overall, keeping the $5 price tag in mind, I give this a 8/10. Honestly I would say it's worth grabbing for the $5 tag if you can get it.			"

												If you're looking for an alternative fps, get Receiver!Unfortunately I played this game while being offline, thus the overall hours haven't been properly registered, I have many hours of pure fun and anxiety spent here.Even reloading your gun is a challenge itself, you may need to look for tutorials and tips for that.It's hard to survive in this peculiar, yet addictive universe, you need to watch where you step because the enemy can be waiting for you around the corner, and there will be no health bar to save you.The enemies (AI machines) can easily track you and sense your presence if you're too close to them and they will hardly miss a shot!It's a great challenge and it's definitely, highly recommended!

This game goes where no other First-Person shooter has gone and actually requires you to manually complete every step in the reloading process of a handgun; whether it be revolver or pistol. You might think it's tedious, and it is. But once you get the hang of it, you are going to have a lot of fun.7/10.

												Receiver, in my opinion, is quite an underrated game.I am, unfortunately, a gun nut, so maybe this game is a bit more enjoyable for me. But this game is underrated imo.When you get put into the game, you'll start off with one of three possible handguns. The Glock, 1911 or a revolver. Initially, you'll realise the controls are a bit hard to get used to. Several different controls for different functions, such as pulling the slide back or checking the chamber.In an hour or two's time, you'll find that you will barely need the help (which you can get by pressing '?', advanced help is holding '?') anymore. You'll also find yourself carefully treading through the map, taking out each bot that you come across quite easily, until one of those damned flying bots get you.There is also a backstory to this game; you pick up tapes and you listen to tips and stories behind the bots and what is real and what isn't. Then, there is also the thing about ammo. I have seen several reviews complaining about ammo; except I never found myself, not even once, in a situation where I have no ammo and am surrounded by enemies. There are many bullets lying about; you just have to look really carefully in corners and under, on top or inside objects. You'll also find yourself properly conserving ammo and knowing which part of the bots to shoot in order to deactivate them.Unfortunately, you die if you get hit even once by anything at all.The realism this game brings is quite astounding, and eventually I became a gunslinger against bots. On record it shows 1.9 hours, but I played more than that. My computer had a meltdown while I was playing it (because I have a not-so-good laptop) and the game accounted to me only 9 minutes of playtime, which, of course, is incorrect.This game is pretty good in general, however, the price is a little bit high. I got it for free on Humble Bundle (also the way I found out about the game). Might not be worth your time if you are into fast-paced action shooting games like Call of Duty.Every. Shot. Counts.

												FPS with two gimmicks. One, it uses the roguelike paradigm of repeated deaths in a randomized environment. Two, reloading firearms is made much more involved. Rather than the usual r to reload, you have a whole set of actions: remove the magazine, holster your gun, put a bullet in the magazine, take your gun back out, put the magazine back in the gun, undo the slide lock, switch out of automatic.Together these combine in an interesting way. At first, to get anywhere you have to use the help feature, a set of most of your keybindings that highlights what you probably want to do at any given time - especially, what actions you'll have to take to get your gun ready to fire. However after a few hours of play this isn't really needed any more, you've figured it out. Dozens of short plays ending in death tend to do that. It's a nice manual quality; it feels like I've learned to fire a gun in the usual way, practice with my hands.This was almost certainly intended by the game makers. The scarce plot serves as justification for the main goal, finding tapes to listen to in order for your character to become ""awakened"" to the true Gnostic reality, which has been obscured from humanity at large by the ""Threat"". One tape in particular tells the character that they have been mentally weakened by popular media for years, and that the tapes are only a small step. The only way to escape the destructive Threat influence is by finding all the tapes, _and listening to them repeatedly_ (a million times is the suggestion).There's a minor suggestion that the player is themselves in a deeper layer of the Gnostic heap, only able to get these messages from true reality through fiction. Considering the gun learning process, and that you will listen to the tapes repeatedly over your playthroughs, the intent is I think clear.So that's neat. Of course all games do this learning to some extent, but it's interesting to see it more or less explicitly mentioned, and applying to something more ""real world"" than laying out character stats or something. (At least, I think real guns work mostly like in Receiver? I haven't touched one in years...) Of course I'd prefer if the skills taught were something other than firearms but what can you do.The game does have problems. The graphics are primitive and glitches are apparent; for example you can jump through the ceiling in a few areas. More importantly I think, the game is pretty small. It was made in a week or such like and the lack of content shows. There are a limited number of room layouts that are spliced together to form your environment and it gets repetitive, and there are only two types of enemies. There's a load time between some rooms, that freezes the game for a few seconds; the resulting disorientation has gotten me killed many times.It's definitely worth the less-than-ten-bucks however.

												How would you do if you had to control your weapon the same way as you do in real life? Would you be able to reload in time to shoot what is coming at you? Would you even be able to remember how to put the magazine back in without scattering precious unspent bullets all over the floor?Excellent for shooter mechanics. Unparalleled, actually. Because of this game, I want all shooters to have a mod that brings this game's gun mechanics in.Not much else to keep you playing though. Oh, there's a mod that adds some more guns.

These do all have different mechanics to them.This game is so original, and you aren't believing me right now I get that, but just hear me out.Instead of just pushing ""R"" for reloading, you have to: Press one key to detach the mag..Another key to load the mag with bullets.. (AND YOU NEED TO FIND THOSE SEPARATELY) Another key to put the mag in the gun..And yet another one to drag the slide and load the first bullet into the chamber..And trust me when I say this.. This is some real butt clenching stuff when you realize you're out of bullets and a ♥♥♥♥ing flying taser gun are chasing you. (I'm not making this up..)Oh.. and the gun can also jam on you.			"

												Receiver manages to create a dark sci-fi setting with the use of a few short tape recordings. The game itself focuses on detailed gun manipulation that turn the automated actions of reloading, swapping mags or just checking how much ammo you got left, into detailed keystrokes that can end in disaster if used wrong in a combat situation. This is a great basis to give the game a lot of replayability even though it only features 3 weapons and two types of enemies as, like in a good action puzzler, your precise timing and situational awarness are tested over and over again even if you played through it before. The randomized layout and placement of enemies and pickups further adds to the replaybility of the title.If you are not turned down by perma-death and the inability to safe or load a gamestate and you have a soft spot for punishing first-person action combined with a fresh look at gun play, this might be the title for you.

Of course all games do this learning to some extent, but it's interesting to see it more or less explicitly mentioned, and applying to something more ""real world"" than laying out character stats or something. (At least, I think real guns work mostly like in Receiver? I haven't touched one in years...) Of course I'd prefer if the skills taught were something other than firearms but what can you do.The game does have problems. The graphics are primitive and glitches are apparent; for example you can jump through the ceiling in a few areas. More importantly I think, the game is pretty small. It was made in a week or such like and the lack of content shows. There are a limited number of room layouts that are spliced together to form your environment and it gets repetitive, and there are only two types of enemies. There's a load time between some rooms, that freezes the game for a few seconds; the resulting disorientation has gotten me killed many times.It's definitely worth the less-than-ten-bucks however.

												Highly visceral and deep gun handling and creepy distopian vibe are the two primary positive elements that this game has to offer. Nothing beats the feeling of learning the gun mechanics and successfully using them against the (sadly) 2 types of enemies you'll face during the game.The map is randomly generated for each playthrough and each time you die but things will definitely start to look familiar the more you play. Your mission is to locate 11 tapes that are scattered around the map and listen to their dialogue while staying alive. Be very careful while turning each corner in this game because a single enemy shot will kill you and send you back to the beginning. Oh and did I mention the guns are also randomized? There are 3 guns total but how many bullets they have and whether they're loaded, cocked or with the safety on can vary between each start.On the negative side, there are framerate hitches whenever you walk into new areas and the levels can get really dark. The flashlight proved more of a nuisance than help because it only lights up a few feet in front of you. This could mean life or death in this game. There are no gamma settings in the game. Also, as I mentioned previously, the levels can get a bit repetitive at times because they are seemingly different pre-made areas which are stitched together in different ways because of the level generator.All in all, a very entertaining game. Definitely get this on a sale. The adrenaline rush and realistic gun handling are definitely worth quite a few hours of random fun.			"

												Receiver manages to create a dark sci-fi setting with the use of a few short tape recordings. The game itself focuses on detailed gun manipulation that turn the automated actions of reloading, swapping mags or just checking how much ammo you got left, into detailed keystrokes that can end in disaster if used wrong in a combat situation. This is a great basis to give the game a lot of replayability even though it only features 3 weapons and two types of enemies as, like in a good action puzzler, your precise timing and situational awarness are tested over and over again even if you played through it before. The randomized layout and placement of enemies and pickups further adds to the replaybility of the title.If you are not turned down by perma-death and the inability to safe or load a gamestate and you have a soft spot for punishing first-person action combined with a fresh look at gun play, this might be the title for you.

												There isn't much game here, but what's here is great. I'm a sucker for atmosphere, and the realistic gunplay only adds intensity to miscounted timings. Choose your fights as carefully as you can, and make every bullet count. Don't forget your Clear Tape.I have a short list of suggestions:1. Making the eject magazine button the same as the insert magazine button would be nice. A general ""drop"" button seems more complex.2. The safety doesn't really seem to affect gameplay. Why not make the gun randomly go off if you don't safety properly?3. give the player a more clear indication of where the bullet went. when you can walk up to it, it's very clear where you hit a turret, but wobblers have been a lot of hassle for me, because it's more difficult to figure out where i hit them.

												This game is set in a very empty empty building where you are all alone, fighting robots with guns.

												It's free on the Humble Store right now if you feel like grabbing it.Otherwise I can't recommend buying it. Basically, you walk around getting casette tapes where then a man narrates some gibberish, giving context to the scenario, a la Bioshock. But the difference here is that Receiver is trying to simulate using a gun via keyboard and mouse by forcing you to press something like four different keys just to eject the forking ammo. And while trying to listen to the tapes while walking around the single, randomly generated level, you'll probably get shot by a turret and die.Speaking of the randomly generated level, it's aesthetically awkward. It' one kind of big level where you randomly respawn after dying so many times and you don't retain your tapes. So when the motion and visual detecting turrets gun you down over and over again, don't blame yourself.6.0/10			"

												Well holy sheeeet. That was a damn good game.The core concept of the game is, ""What if using a gun in an FPS was as complicated a process as it is in real life?"" and that boils down to each little part of the gun having it's own button associated with it. You don't just tap the R button and watch a cool little animation and then be on your way, you have to do all the little things required and in the right order as your situation dictates. At the start you will fumble around with the gun functions and may not even figure out how to shoot for quite a while. Then after a few minutes you may start to get the hang of it, albeit taking your time between shots. After a few hours of playing you will really get the hang of things and reloading will be like clockwork.Even the enemies, which are little robots, have a similar complexity to them. They don't just have an HP bar that empties out after a few shots. You have to hit them in very specific parts to disable certain functions of them until you can safely pass by. It's up to you to learn where your shots count the most for disabling them.The world is rather bland, however, and consists of a bunch of randomly generated rooms in sequence. You will get very used to these room as there is very little variety between them. You will figure out pretty quickly where the ammo drops can be and where the robots can be placed in certain rooms. It's the only real flaw in the game.The music is decent and gives a proper mood to the whole thing.One odd thing to note about the game is that you have to go to a separate website to patch the game. Specifically here[forums.wolfire.com]. Otherwise the game run's very poorly I've heard. I've only played the game patched and it is recommended.If you are someone who want's a score then I give the game 5 cassette tapes out 5. Nothing significantly hinders the enjoyment of the game and the core concept is pulled of splendidly.			"

Not a bad time killer for less than 2$ but it does get boring after awhile. Fun for a bit but no long term value unless you're into that kind of thing.

												Receiver is a game about shooting....Oh, were you looking for something else? That pretty much sums up what this game is, from it's concept, of course. Now, let's start the real review:Graphics: Made in Unity 3D, the game has simple graphics and places that seems to be missing textures. But it's all part of the game's visual art style and concept. Enemies desing are also pretty simple and you can spot then on sight (Witch is essential in this game IMO). I guess the gun model is okay, since it gives player a good vision of what he's doing with it and where he's REALLY poiting at. Skybox is dead, but you really don't need it in this game.Gameplay: This is the jackpot in this game. The realism put into shooting, reloading, carrying and using your gun is something so nice to see in a FPS and that even most AAA studios keep forgetting that it exists. Playing this game using the device that simulates a pistol is even better. All the controls, from the keyboard/mouse/device responds pretty well and always keeps the game fluid and dinamic.Even tough gunplay is the biggest part of this game, it also haves an objective: Collecting all your self recordings so you can finish the game. But finding then is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Not only you don't have a radar, but you will die a ♥♥♥♥ING lot in this game. It IS hard. And i mean it. The enemies were created with the intetion of making the game hard in this way, and the AI woks pretty well to make sure that this is happening. Don't mess with the enemies. It's not because the game is realistic that the enemies will also be. 2-3 shoots and you are dead. Make sure of always keeping your ammo at count, or else, you are ♥♥♥♥ed.Soundtrack: Missing. Even tough the self recording are pretty neat to hear, i just can't like this monotunus atmosphere. They could've put some songs like The Stanley Parable did (Or SuperHot) to don't let the player attention go away of the game. Mostly because that if you are not paying attention, you are dead.Story: Most of it is explained through recordings. It's not a gigantic plot, but it does it job of keeping the player guessing. Going through uncovering the secrets of the protagonist organization and himself is quite awesome and it has a nice progression...When you find then in order, that's because the only bad thing is: If you die, your found recording count will reset, so, if you want to find a new one that you haven't heard yet/don't want to hear the same thing again from a past one, good luck with that.This game is more considered a ""project"" than a game itself. It had a nice proporsal and the idea of this game can be explored in other games (Indie or AAA). If you are looking to experience something new and a neat challenge, Receiver is a ""game"" for you.

												I have to voice how impressed I am with this one. I thought this was going to be a quick pick-up-and-play novelty, but instead I found a game with an extremely complex and deep gun mechanic.Good:The main catch of Receiver is that it has some seriously detailed and realistic gun mechanics. You randomly start with one of three pistols, either a magnum pistol, a revolver, or an automatic handgun, in a random state with a random amount of bullets. The term 'check your weapon' seriously applies here. How many bullets are in the magazine? Is there a bullet in the chamber? Do I need to pull the slide back? Is the safety on? Is it in automatic? Each of these questions comes up each time you spawn and pick up your gun, and each function and action has a key you have to memorize.But what really keeps getting me about this game is how creepy it is. You are, in essence, the only living thing in a randomly generated complex filled with cold robots. it is dark and almost eerie. I kept thinking to myself that this game would make an incredible horror game. This is what F.E.A.R. should have been. But, as is, it is overall very tense and does a good job of leaving a lasting impression despite being so simple in story and graphics.I should also mention this game is very difficult in a lot of ways. You will likely die fumbling around with your pistol and trying to remember the controls. You'll curse yourself for accidentally dropping your magazine when you are trying to reload it, or while you scramble for that perfectly good bullet you ejected from your gun on accident. But the feeling of mastering your pistol is truly a reward on its own. And that doesn't even include shooting things.Enemies are tough on that note. Robots don't die from just being shot a lot. Enemy bots have four vitals you can hit to kill or disable them: weapon, motor, battery, and camera. Precision is everything. One aimed pistol shot can render a robot useless, but madly firing at the main body will do nothing. Turrets will unleash a flurry of machinegun fire if they catch glimpse of you, and those shock drones are a whole lot faster than they look. And finally, you die in one hit, and must start over every time you are killed.But its all good challenge, and while the complex appears to be nearly infinite, it is possible to learn the game, recognize certain consistent features, and fight off your attackers with deadly skill while you explore and search for tapes.So, overall for the good, it has a deep gun mechanic with lots of nuances and details (which is rare that I actually like something like this), its a lot more challenging than it looks, and somehow manages to master the art of simple elegance and proficent story telling while still being very simplistic.Bad:I really don't like some of the randomization. One time I started within easy view of a hover drone, and prompty got zapped before I could even check my gun out. Another time I started with only two bullets in my gun and nothing else. Often times I found myself going on forever; searching out the complex without finding any of the tapes for long periods of time. A little consistency and a safe zone to start with would have been nice.Also, I have to say while this game is fun, I feel like it is also a game I will never be able to beat. The complex is absolutely huge. I sometimes would spend several minutes gunning down robots and trying to survive; only to die with not even one tape. A radar for the little things would have been nice. Or something more than just a shiny spot. Its fun to be able to just explore blindly and figure things out on your own, but only to an extent. This goes well past that extent and into the frustrating ""I can't figure out how to beat this"" zone.Maybe that's part of the challenge for some, but that's not really my thing as a casual gamer.Also, you'll learn to hate the hover drones because of how derpy their movements are. It really looks like they are being held up by a string. They bob and wobble in the air like a balloon in the wind, and will bounce and flop all over the floors and walls whenever they try to charge you. Again, maybe that's part of the challenge, but those things really test the aim in a bad way.Finally, the game does tend to lag a bit in certain areas, which for a game where victory depends on quick reflexes and sharp aim, that is really just a killer. I hate to walk through a door, only to have a lag spike that leads me to getting shot by an enemy I couldn't see around the corner.So, while the game is fun, I do feel like there were a few flaws in execution. The randomness would be fine if your task wasn't so tedious and the level so massive. Aspects that I felt like should be there to legitimately challenge me just kept rubbing off on me the wrong way.Finally, I will say that a way to choose which gun you start with would have been a fun feature, and I can't figure any reason why this had to be excluded.But, overall, I don't think any of that dampened the experience I had enough for me to not recommend this.Its a good challenge and a bit of a mind teaser as far as the controls go. There's a lot of detail that is sure to please any gun enthusiast out there, or just anyone who wants a break from the usual FPS crazies out there. It may not be the most realistic gun simulator, but it does an excellent job at simulating the feel of real combat. It teaches you how precious a bullet really is, why aiming is so important, and how ridiculous all the other action games like Call of Duty really are when it comes to their gunplay. Its immersive, its intense, and its a whole lot of fun.Its a bit of an experiment that I'm sure won't please everyone, but the idea is solid and the feelings it established really caught me by surprise. At the very least, this game is sure to teach you why weapons training is so much more important than learning to pull the trigger. And for this price? I couldn't recommend it more.			"

												Do I suck at it; Yes. Does that make it bad; No.I found this game really interesting, as it was much harder than it looked and depite looking rather cartoony,is actually pretty immersive.Just to point out two things I like that are the immersive stuff.1. when it's ""randomly generated"" your gun is what's actually random,not only in make/model but in wether or not it's loaded and how much ammo you have.And sometimes you have a flashlight,sometimes you don't,have fun2. You need to physically check your gun,wether it's loaded to be specific, or you will be made into swiss cheese on stumps by the robots when your gun fails to fire (And it will,trust me).I'll give it a good play when my new mouse gets here (For the love of god,don't use a track pad.It's one hit death) but from what I've seen, it's very,very good for a game made in a week.8/10, go buy it,or get the free copy with Overgrowth.(You have no Idea how much I just wanted to put ""Like slender with guns (and robots)"")			"

												Receiver is for those people who like a fast adventure thats different every time and/or people who love gun mechanics. The game is very basic on graphics, but its honestly a good game.Replayability is high as item spawns, enemies and the entire map are random each time. The story is very basic and once you've heard all the tapes the story is not exactly always refreshing.Even though there are only 3 weapons they cover all the basic means of handguns. The Revolver, the medium handgun, the light handgun and even the automatic (On the glock). it allows you to make strategies based on what you like the most, being that all guns have their own ups and downs. This is both in rate of fire, capacity and power. Accuracy and range aren't issues at all thay you'll deal with as the environments you'll be fighting in usually force you to be within 100 yards away from enemies.The enemies are very basic, but they cover conventional standards; one can move and attack while the other one can shoot but not move.(and if your wondering why I only have 0.3 hours its because I took it off of my computer and played it at work)Overall rating: 8/10 Well worth the price.

I've had a few moments that were generally tense or made me jump as well, due to your characters inability to take a single bullet and survive.If you search for it, Receiver has a cool meta story that is revealed by listening to the tapes you collecting while dodging flying tazer drones and turrets.I would definitely recommend receiver at any price, especially since the proceeds go to a small indie team that made the game in 7 days.

Up to the point were even the  chambers in your revolver are randomly filled.Gameplay itself reminds of a James Bond Simulator.Bugs Bugs Bugs ... getting stuck on stairs, falling through pipes and behind stairs.Would be one of the better simple games if they managed to get those bugs fixed but i'm sure this won't happen.

												Receiver is not a game that everyone will like. It takes the FPS genre to a much higher level of realism. It has no difficulty settings, checkpoints, game save or HUD for that matter.You start the game in a random room inside of a building. You don´t know who you are or why you´re there. Equipped with a 1 of 3 diferent firearms (a Glock 18, a Revolver or a 1911 45. cal Pistol), a flashlight(that you may not get on spawn but be able to find later), and nothing else than that you must find out what is going on.When walking around the building you will find  turrets or flying robots that will try to kill you. You can fight or run, but in some areas you will just have to go trough them to progress. You will eventually find orange sound tapes that will tell you why you´re there, how to get out, and how to effectively fight the robots and turrets. In order to finish the game you must find all 11 tapes scattered around the building.The game mechanics will be hard to understand at 1st, but in time you will get better at it. And if you don´t like some of the controls you can change them from the Launch Menu.You don´t have sights in the screen so you must aim to shoot properly, there are many commands for what you can do with your weapon, and the reload process must be done manually.Ammo is in pretty short supply, so you got to look around in the building and find bullets, equip it in your magazine (or barrel) and put in your inventory(in case you are using a pistol), then have it ready to reload in combat.Also this game is made with the Unity engine, so don´t expect anything fancy here.

												Quaint little shooter. A 'real life shooting sim' as you work the finer points of a gun killing turrents and drones searching for cassete tapes. Not a bad time killer for less than 2$ but it does get boring after awhile. Fun for a bit but no long term value unless you're into that kind of thing.

												This game is extremely fun and challenging little game that will put your memory and mouse handling skills to the test!Not only does this game have a very eerie atmosphere and creepy story but the realism around the guns are very well done. The shooting feels nice and feels very rewarding when you hear that *dink* and *crash* that means you succesfully took out an enemy. I learn quickly so the controls were not a problem. But without the little ""Help"" tap on the left I would have been hopeless. Which is also very well done!The one thing I really love is also that you can disable your enemies without destroying them. Like shooting the gun on the automatic turret and stading infront of it to check if it really is disabled is really nerveracking because a shot to the foot and you're dead. I also love the ""OH ♥♥♥♥"" feeling you get when the gyrocopter spots you and you're out of ammo.All in all 8/10 could do with some optimization and a nerf to the flying bots! By the way, check out the developers other game; Overgrowth which is also fantastic!			"

												Sort of an FPS roguelike, you basically just wander and wander and wander looking for tapes and ammo, with no maps or any other clues to help you at all.I enjoyed the realistc gun operation, even though it got me killed many many times.There's basically 2 kinds of enemies, turrets and flybots, and both can 1-shot you, which can lead to some frustration. On top of that, there's barely enough ammo to get by, and if you wander into the wrong spot and get spotted by a flybot and waste your last few bullets on it, its almost a guaranteed GG.I eventually got bored of just randering around an RNG building, and fortunately there were some cheats available.Even with invincibility and unlimited ammo, the game was STILL a hassle to complete. I'd spin around and empty 3-4 magazines trying to shoot 1 little drone buzzing around my head.Eventually the game just started trolling and put 3 tapes and 5 turrets in a very small space. I have NO idea how I would have gotten past that without infinite ammo.I don't know if I would pay $5 for this, but it's definitely an interesting little time waster. "

												The thing that surprised me most about this game is that after playing a few hours worth it feels more like a FPS roguelike than anything else I've played - there's permadeath, a randomly generated maze & enemies, and a somewhat steep learning curve. Shooting feels extremely solid and the reload mechanics are very satisfying once you get the hang of them, and deaths rarely feel cheap but are usually the result of rushing in or not checking the area properly. Could use more content, but what's here keeps me coming back anyway.			"

												Receiver is probably the hardest games I've ever played. Smart, hard to hit, fast enemies, incredibly demanding controls, insta-kills without respawn and a long search for audio tapes. Just trying to survive long enough to find more tapes than last time is challenging enough to get you hooked.			"

												This is a handgun simulator. The game is not much to look at and the levels are barren and dull, but if you've ever wanted to fire a handgun or learn about real gun mechanics this the most realistic and cheapest simulator. Learning to reload a Glock using only muscle memory was one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had playing a game. Worth $5. A must buy for less.			"

												Awsome game. The big boys could learn a lot from this gem. Every time I play Battlefied, Cod, whatever, and just mash R to reload I just sit and watch an amination for 2 seconds before continuing the midless spraying of bullets. Receiver doesn't just make you care about operating your weapon, It makes you care about every single bullet you fire and the target your shooting at. I would love to see main stream games taking this aproch, but sadly they are all now slaves to the consoles and their 10 to 15 button controlers. Anyway, rant over, buy this game its fun and real challange for any FPS player.A thinking man's FPS			"

												This is an FPS that's so real that it makes other so-called realistic games look really bad. You can carry only one weapon. The ammunition is so slim that you have to make economic choices. I find myself constantly thinking (and not enduring level after level like every other FPS) throughout the gameplay because it requires you to observe, and act carefully. Otherwise you'll just die drooling on the floor with a bullet in your back.The mechanics of the guns are definitely top of the nudge. If you are a gun lover you probably would love this game because it not only features the classic pistols Glock 17, Colt 1911 and a S&W Model 10 revolver, but also precise emulation of operations of guns. You need to co-ck the hammer, pull the slide, fill the magazine, release the safe. That is, like everything you need to do with a real gun.With some luck I beat the game, And I feel we need more games like this in the industry.For its fun I give it 7 out of 10. If there are more guns, better graphics, more sinister story, I'll probably give it a 9.			"

												Retriever the Game reviewRetriever the Game ris a game where you shoot guns... are you guns lover? you'll like this game. it's a game where you hold the gun machine and then you shoot it. what is your favorite gun?  Its in this game I guaranteed it. I counted the guns in this game and Boy there is a lot, Theres Revulver machine gun with wheel turner, the square gun machine with a block door and two hammer locks and a slider tube, the gray gun that holds the block back you cannot shoot with it, the shooter gun with three switch and a pin on the front, the black gun with a gray brown handle that shoots a bigger bullet, the small gun machine with a wooden piece on it and a light switch pumper on the back of the gun, a gun that has two finger holes onto it and there's two blocks one top one bottom and a tube, the gun with a round pin ball switch onto it which stomps the gun from turning around, the gun machine with a circalar lock on the back of the big block and there's a tube onto the front of the gun machine, and the gun that shoots a bullet.I counted theres about 3 guns in this video game.The ravolutionary part of this game is the bullets system. You can take a bullet one out at a time and put it into your pocket for later storrage.The down side is you only find 1 bullet at a time instead of a whole box thats 16 bullets like in the other game.And the ravolutionary part of this video game is the abbility to be a peace ful citizen. if you dont want to use a gun you can put it into the corner of your face and dont shoot any thing.The objective of the video game is to collect 20 video tapes VHS from the ground. When you get the tapes you can hear a nerd talk about the world peace or something stupid. I only found 1 tape and I died and  I went back there the next time it was not there so you better win the game the first time. Sorry "

												Receiver is a game about shooting....Oh, were you looking for something else? That pretty much sums up what this game is, from it's concept, of course. Now, let's start the real review:Graphics: Made in Unity 3D, the game has simple graphics and places that seems to be missing textures. But it's all part of the game's visual art style and concept. Enemies desing are also pretty simple and you can spot then on sight (Witch is essential in this game IMO). I guess the gun model is okay, since it gives player a good vision of what he's doing with it and where he's REALLY poiting at. Skybox is dead, but you really don't need it in this game.Gameplay: This is the jackpot in this game. The realism put into shooting, reloading, carrying and using your gun is something so nice to see in a FPS and that even most AAA studios keep forgetting that it exists. Playing this game using the device that simulates a pistol is even better. All the controls, from the keyboard/mouse/device responds pretty well and always keeps the game fluid and dinamic.Even tough gunplay is the biggest part of this game, it also haves an objective: Collecting all your self recordings so you can finish the game. But finding then is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Not only you don't have a radar, but you will die a ♥♥♥♥ING lot in this game. It IS hard. And i mean it. The enemies were created with the intetion of making the game hard in this way, and the AI woks pretty well to make sure that this is happening. Don't mess with the enemies. It's not because the game is realistic that the enemies will also be. 2-3 shoots and you are dead. Make sure of always keeping your ammo at count, or else, you are ♥♥♥♥ed.Soundtrack: Missing. Even tough the self recording are pretty neat to hear, i just can't like this monotunus atmosphere. They could've put some songs like The Stanley Parable did (Or SuperHot) to don't let the player attention go away of the game. Mostly because that if you are not paying attention, you are dead.Story: Most of it is explained through recordings. It's not a gigantic plot, but it does it job of keeping the player guessing. Going through uncovering the secrets of the protagonist organization and himself is quite awesome and it has a nice progression...When you find then in order, that's because the only bad thing is: If you die, your found recording count will reset, so, if you want to find a new one that you haven't heard yet/don't want to hear the same thing again from a past one, good luck with that.This game is more considered a ""project"" than a game itself. It had a nice proporsal and the idea of this game can be explored in other games (Indie or AAA). If you are looking to experience something new and a neat challenge, Receiver is a ""game"" for you.

												I found this game to be both interesting and challenging.The game consists primarily of traversing randomly generated building complex filled with randomly generated enemies and items. As far as I can tell, the goal seems to be to find 11 cassette tapes scattered around the complex. While doing this this, you must protect yourself from enemies using one of three firearms: the Colt 1911A1, a Glock 18C, or a Revolver (not sure what make or model, as I'm not a gun expert).The weapon mechanics as unique in that you have control over the slide, saftey, fire rate, magazine eject and loading, magizine refilling, and other various aspects.While that can seem daunting, you have a helpful guide available at all times to help you with each mechanic. I personally found it quite satisfiying when I was able to refill a magazine, replace my empty one and pull back the slide all from memory while franticlly running from a drone bent on chasing me down.The enemies themselves are simple and limited in terms of variety, but that doesn't make the any less deadly.You have stationary turrets which will rotate 360 degrees around them, capable of looking both up and down, and have a pretty far range of detection.The second and final enemy are flying drones that typically will hover in place, slowly rotating around untill they see you. Once they do, they then blindly charge at you, ready to hit you with a extremly (thankfully) short range taser.If that doesn't seem to difficult, the fact that a single touch from either a bullet, or the taser will kill you imediately.Oh, and there's fall damage. That'll kill you too.The upside to everything being randomly generated is that it keeps the game fresh and challenging. You can't memorize where everything is or exploit the map. The downside is that the difficultly can fluctuate extremely. Your weapon is randomly given to you, as well as starting ammo and other equipment. Where you start is random, as well as the number and location of enemies.You could spawn in a room with maybe seven bullets, have no items to collect anywhere near you, and have four turrets and five flying drones in the next room.Or you could have a moderate amount ammo, plenty more around you, and few enemies to deal with.Or you could spawn directly in front of a turret. That happens too.Put simply:Pros:-Fun weapon mechanics-Challenging yet simple enemies-Player only has two hands, and thus can't do things that require them having more than two hands.-Small file size-Limited supplies and high vunerability require decision making and planning-Randomly generated map keeps gameplay unique and challengeingCons:-Randomly generated map leads to massive spikes in difficulty-Player can die extremely easy. Possibly could have had something to make them slightly more durable, even temporarily- Game tends to freeze momentarily when loading more of the mapTL;DRI shot a drone seven times only to run out of ammo and have it chase me back across the map while I screamed like a girl8/10 Would ♥♥♥♥ myself again			"

												This is a roguelike, with a complicated weapon interface that feeds my Steel Battalion need. It takes five button presses to successfully reload your pistol. It’s complicated enough to replicate the feeling that I would have when attempting to refill a magazine under duress.

												Omg where do i begin. i Love this game. I suck at this game. the gimick of mechanical deatail to how to operate your gun is extremely sastifying although confusing and difficult to get use to but the smart help system really eases that difficultly curve. Shotting enemies in different places all have different effects and learning these on your own can be excited although it is explained in one of the 11 tapes you need to find. Lacking areas would be the voice over for the tape dialog and the lack of really interesting text but looking for the tape is whats fun and you probably arent looking at this game for a gripping story. also the aim sensitivty just never seems perfect for me i can't get the pinpoint accuracy i want even with all the dpi settings on my mouse.overall i say that this game is worth the $5  and will last quite a few hours			"

												If you want the short n' quick of my review, here it is: It's an incredibly challenging game with an extremely well-made gun mechanic and great immersion, but it's poorly optimized and variety is limited.When I first picked up this game I had no idea what I was doing, and I think I quite enjoyed that at first, the first few deaths were absolutely laughable as I fumbled around with the controls manually looking up which button does what every time I needed to load another bullet or try to pick up a tape. The first thing you notice are that the graphics are mediocre at best, but in a game like this it really doesn't hurt the immersion factor one bit. The immersion is amazing, by the way. This game is an unintentional survival horror game. Enemies can and WILL scare the ♥♥♥♥ outta you.But then after a little while I got a hang of the controls, and that's where things really picked up. After you start to get proficient at controlling the gun and even the more advanced mechanics of switching out whole mags quickly instead of just reloading a few bullets, the game gets immensely more involved. You're no longer concerned with just getting one or two tapes, you want them all. You want them bad, you've already spent several hours on this thing... So you start to learn the very well-implemented mechanics of localized damaging, where you need to hit a specific part of an enemy to take it out, and with as few bullets as possible. No CoD-style shooting at someones hands or legs to damage them.The voice acting is not great, he fumbles around with words a bit and sometimes the sound clips a bit, but it doesn't matter because given the story it's totally reasonable for this. Story-wise: They might not have had enough time to record a super-fancy nice message. Development wise, they only had a week. Cut em' some slack.Eventually, you get to the point where you've heard every tape a dozen times and seen every enemy almost every time, and you still may not have beaten the game because there are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tapes. At this point, there's a very real possibility that you could get tired of the game due to the lack of variety and extreme difficulty. But, if you persevere, and there's a good chance that you'll beat it, and oh boy... When you beat it, it's so satisfying. INCREDIBLY satisfying.On top of all that there's actually a good bit of replay value thanks to the randomization of all the maps (Though it admittedly can ♥♥♥♥ you up someimtes and it's entirely possible to have an impossible-to-beat map) and even the modding community that has managed to add in a bunch of different stuff to make the game play better.So to recap!Pros:+ Great gun mechanics+ Accurate gun and bullet physics+ Randomization of structures item locations+ Reasonable learning curve+ Amazing immersion+ Very satisfying to finally beat+ Good replay value+ Great modding communityCons:- Very poor textures even on highest settings- Poor optimization due to engine limitations- Only 2 gun types by default- Only 2 types of enemies- Borderline extreme difficulty to get all 11 tapes (At least for me),  meaning it can take a long time to beat with a lot of potential frustration.- Randomization can ♥♥♥♥ you overOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It's an impressive and fun to play twist on the FPS genre made in only a week.			"

												Most games assign you a single button to reload your gun. Most games provide you enough ammo to get the job done. Most games start you with the same equipment, in the same location on the map. Receiver is not most games.You start with one of three weapons at a random location on the single, large map. The amount of ammo you have appears to be random, as does whether or not you have a flashlight or spare magazines. In a normal FPS, you'd start with a full clip and pressing ""fire"" would do just that. With Receiver, that would make you extremely lucky. The first thing to do is examine your weapon. Is it a revolver, a semi-automatic, or a machine pistol? Is it loaded? How full is the magazine? Is the safety on? Is it set to full auto? All of this matters.While this can sound tedious, the surprising thing about Receiver is that it works. The graphics are terrible, the sound and story are nothing to write home about, but the gameplay more than makes up for everything else. As frustrating as the first few rounds can be, it's extremely rewarding when you finally start to pick things up. You'll quickly learn to count your shots because you don't have an ammo counter. You'll quickly learn to take cover and look around corners because the enemies are lethal. Pretty soon checking your gun, loading your magazines when you get ammo and checking every corner for turrets will be second nature.			"

This game is intensely satisfying once you figure out all the controls, difficult even knowing how to fight the enemies (the drones are evil), and interesting from an FPS game perspective simply because I haven't played anything like it.

Story-wise: They might not have had enough time to record a super-fancy nice message. Development wise, they only had a week. Cut em' some slack.Eventually, you get to the point where you've heard every tape a dozen times and seen every enemy almost every time, and you still may not have beaten the game because there are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tapes. At this point, there's a very real possibility that you could get tired of the game due to the lack of variety and extreme difficulty. But, if you persevere, and there's a good chance that you'll beat it, and oh boy... When you beat it, it's so satisfying. INCREDIBLY satisfying.On top of all that there's actually a good bit of replay value thanks to the randomization of all the maps (Though it admittedly can ♥♥♥♥ you up someimtes and it's entirely possible to have an impossible-to-beat map) and even the modding community that has managed to add in a bunch of different stuff to make the game play better.So to recap!Pros:+ Great gun mechanics+ Accurate gun and bullet physics+ Randomization of structures item locations+ Reasonable learning curve+ Amazing immersion+ Very satisfying to finally beat+ Good replay value+ Great modding communityCons:- Very poor textures even on highest settings- Poor optimization due to engine limitations- Only 2 gun types by default- Only 2 types of enemies- Borderline extreme difficulty to get all 11 tapes (At least for me),  meaning it can take a long time to beat with a lot of potential frustration.- Randomization can ♥♥♥♥ you overOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It's an impressive and fun to play twist on the FPS genre made in only a week.			"

												[Pros]-Interesting sci-fi story. You are a ""Receiver"", one of the very few people who are able to hear a voice inside different mysterious cassettes you find. You must find enough cassettes to ""escape"" MindKill.This sound a lot like Matrix, and yes, it is something like that.-The unique gameplay mechanic of the game: It simulate a more realistic way to control a pistol. Specifically a Colt 1911 pistol, a S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and a Glock 17.At first it is VERY complicate to remember every single button to control succesfully a pistol, but with enough practice, you can master it.-The game offer you a very helpful guide which show you the action of each button. A huge plus in my opinion.-The whole game take place in one huge level. However all the rooms/places, bullets, cassettes, enemies and the pistol you using is random generated every single time. Something like a Rogue game in other words.-The feeling controlling successfully a gun by pushing the keys in the rights order, is unbelievable! Me neither believed it at first, but it is true!!!-The A.I of the enemies is very interesting, specifically the flying drone. One time a flying drone hit a wall while I was running to avoid it. The result was to get disfunctioning and the drone started flying around like a drunk! Hilarious!!!!One another time I shoot a drone and fall down just only to discover when I approached it was still functioning and killed me!!! MotherF*cker!!!!The same goes of course for the gun turrets you fight/avoid in the game.[Cons]-The whole game is only one level. That it. Nothing new to add or a New Game Plus mode.-Only two enemies types: The flying drones and the gun turrets. More enemies would made the game even better.-Very difficult start. Even if I said it is very enjoyable to master the pistols, you will ""suffer"" a little to play the game properly.-My main reason why I gave the game 9/10 stars:If you enter a new room/place, suddenly the game freeze a little for an unknown reason. For this many times I died because gun turrets shot me while I was lagged entering a room....[Final Thought]Being very Cheap on Steam right now, it is a must play just only for the unique experience is offer.It have some problems, but I forgive them very easily.I hope for a better and bigger sequel in the future.9/10			"

												The gun moving around the screen reminds me of the one armed mechanics in Trespasser- but without the absurd fun. And as far as the ""realism"" of being able to learn how to reload a gun modeled after a real gun to fire bullets modeled after real bullets from a real gun, at the end of the day, you're just learning a combination of keys to press. There's a reason no other shooter has realistic reloading, and it's not the fault of the games, it's the limitations of the keyboard/controller. It's the same reason flight sims can be tedious when played on a keyboard. For a game made in a short amount of time, sure, it's not bad. But that's about it.			"

												I would recommend this game to just about anybody who is a fan of the first-person shooter genre or has any kind of interest in guns. This well crafted gun simulator is, like they say, easy to learn but hard to master. Learning each weapon and how it is operated by muscle memory is fluid and satisfying; I never tired of loading and charging a weapon.The minimalistic presentation of the game environment allows the gun to be the focus of the game, as it should be, but each section in the procedurally generated world has its own challenges and secrets. After some practice you will grow well versed in traversing these environments and scanning them for threats and loot, which brings its own satisfaction.Perhaps the most satisfying of all the game's elements is its actual combat. Enemies come in two types: hovering taser drones and static turrets, both of which can deliver instant and fatal damage to the player. The gameplay here is challenging, but never unfair, and the quick restarts allow you to dive straight back into the game and apply what you've learned from past mistakes. The trial-and-error nature of Receiver's gameplay gives it a visceral and ephemeral feel comparable to that of Hotline Miami, although with a vastly different tone.Like the rest of the game, Receiver's story is delivered in a minimalistic and really quite interpretive style. You are tasked with exploring the world and collecting all eleven casette tapes, which contain a wealth of esoteric knowledge, accessible only to the specially mentally conditioned, known of course as 'receivers'. Despite their monotone delivery, I never really became bored with the tapes even after repeated listens. By the time you have heard all eleven, you will have memorised a great deal of background story information, which gives the feeling that you are a receiver. The casettes mention important story threads such as 'the Threat', 'the Mindkill' and multiple realities with such passing apathy that one is forced to imagine what exactly they entail, making the story that much more interesting. Without so much being left to the imagination, the game's story could not have had nearly the same effect.All told, Receiver is a simple but beautiful game. Its developers set out to create in seven days an engaging and accurate gun simulator with minimalist storytelling and they have succeeded by all measures. Receiver is a cheap buy and well worth a look from a fan of the shooting genre.			"

												This game is very crafty and all of the spawns, from rooms to what you spawn with, are randomized. The game very quickly teaches you to be cautious, ranging from punishing you for running into a room without looking into it first, to immediately being rammed in the side with a drone with no way to counter against it.How enemies spawn is randomized, and sometimes a bunch of turrets will be spawned in such a way that you'll need to tactfully take out each one before you can move on, and sometimes it'll cluster 5 turrets in one room.To keep you on your toes, how quickly you can react to turrets seeing you varies, ranging from being able to be seen by a turret for a full second and not die, to being shot the instant you enter their field of vision.Additionally, it seems how durable the robots are is also randomized. For example, sometime's you'll take out 4 enemies with one shot each, and sometimes you'll have to dump 10 bullets into a turret's weakpoint before it stops moving.What you spawn with is randomized, which means sometimes you can spawn with a revolver and 30 bullets, and sometimes you'll spawn with a M1911A1 and 4 bullets.Where you spawn is also randomized. Sometimes you'll spawn in a room full of ammo and maybe a tape and/or flashlight, and sometimes you'll spawn in direct view of a turret.Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, it's just that if you're purchasing this, prepare for RNGesus to kick you in the butt. A lot.			"

												Receiver can only be described as a gun simulator. The combat is nothing special; right-click to aim with a small deadzone and left-click to fire. But what makes it a notable experiment in video gaming is the act of reloading. It's nothing so simple as pressing R and waiting for an animation to play out; you have to press a button for almost every action involved.When you first spawn in, you need to check your firearm. There are buttons to pull back (and then lock) the slide, toggle the safety, (de-)♥♥♥♥ the hammer, remove the magazine, place the magazine in a specific inventory slot, remove a magazine from a specific inventory slot, holster the firearm, and load individual rounds into magazines.If you can master the art of firing a shot, dropping the mag, holstering the firearm, reloading the magazine, redrawing the firearm, replacing the magazine, and (just for good measure) hitting the bolt release, you'll more than likely get a tingly sensation after doing it. This is hands-on gun porn.The rest of the game is pretty basic; textures are a luxury, geometry is flat and neutral, the atmosphere is eerie in a Deus-Ex way, and the lore behind the recordings is rather interesting. Combat is tense and calculated, much more akin to chess than boxing, but sometimes the rules aren't clear enough to ease your frustration every time you die.In the end, I'd love to see more games like this for more firearms, if only as an instruction tool for people wanting to learn how to use firearms without access to any or proper instruction.7/10 - I came 9mm.

												Have I been waiting for a game like this for the last 10 years of my life?Yes.Does this game make you feel bad ♥♥♥?Yes.Can you complete it?Yes.As a resident of a ""no-gunz"" country, this game fulfills my desires for handling a powder based shooting device. If the developer could add the smell of gun powder and lubricant oil the game would be complete.The game:All the variables are randomized at each start. You will spawn with either of the 3 weapons available and the amount of magazines and bullets you spawn with is also randomized. Most of the stages offer more than 4 routes to get past and all of the enemies are spawned randomized.The one thing to bare in mind though is that: The more bullets you find and carry, the more enemies will spawn in the next area. As a kind of progressive difficulty I guess.The story is not that important as you are the receiver of audio tapes carrying an audio tape player. The tapes you find will progress the game and when you have collected 11 tapes, the game is complete. But don't expect to complete the game in the first playthrough.The gun handling is the main concept of the game as each action bound to a button manipulates the gun in one specific way. There's no ""R"" to reload automatically and watch a prerecorded animation play that lasts 4 seconds, you are the one doing the heavy work.You press one button to: Pull the slide back, eject the magazine, pull the slide catch down or up, activate safety, grab a magazine from your harness, etc.The first hour of the game is probably a learning process but after that, the game is a lovely charming experience of gun porn. It will be satisfactory when you manage to do a speed reload in 2 seconds and shoot a bot coming towards you.Are there ways this game could be better?Absolutely. It could use more textures, mipmapping, bumpmapping, atmospheric soundscapes and more stages and weapons but as a concept of gaming it is complete. I would love to see moouse gestures implemented as a means for the actions that have longer motions. Buttons like safety, slide catch, mag release and cylinder spin can still be button specific, but actions like pulling the slide and manipulating magazines and bullets could be mouse gestures. Hold CTRL to make the mouse button appear and start clicking and dragging.But I'm not afraid that this is the last game with this concept as other games inspired by this is slowly appearing on Steam Greenlight as well as on the web.

You're not completely helpless, but you're not some badass dudebro space marine manly man who has everything under control. The pressure is on you--if you get hit even once, you're dead no matter what progress you've made. If you don't make your bullets count, you'll be hard-pressed to find more ammo.

												Easily one of the most unsuspectingly eeery games i have ever played because of: the completely silent moments that can be instantly broken, the interesting vague storyline given in 15 second clips from the tapes, and the jumpscares from rooms filled with turrets. just learning the controlls is difficult definately worth £4			"

												Receiver's an odd game - a rougelike loot-n-shoot with generated levels, but I like it. As a gun nerd myself, the game does a very good job of modeling all the various real-life functions of the Colt M1911A1, Glock 17 w/ full auto mod, and S&W Model 10 pistols. Slides can be manually racked, and held open. You can ♥♥♥♥ the hammer on pistols that have them, and lower them as well. Magazines have to be loaded with individual rounds. You can even engage the safety on the M1911A1 if you really want to!It's also a great way to learn about how to properly handle and operate real life pistols and revolvers, as well.			"

												Warning: This is an addicting game. The gameplay is not unlike the '-Shock' series, where you're looking for audio tapes whilst trying to avoid and/or get-the-drop-on drones and turrets. The real difference in Reciever is in the shooting/gun mechanics. The gun you have in 'shooter' games is usually little more than a fancy finger that goes 'pew pew' wherever you're pointing it. In Reciever, your weapon is a very realistic *system* with which you must learn to interact, both successfully and quickly, in order to survive combat scenarios. This means knowing how many bullets you have in your clip, replacing a clip when you need to, not dropping bullets by accident as you're trying to refill a clip on the fly. All of this is in your direct control. No random dice-rolls... if you get caught with your pants down, it's on you. It's that direct relation of personal skill and performance that really draws you in. You will die quickly, and often. But each time you load up the game, or 'respawn', the environment is shuffled randomly. Even the equipment you start with is randomized. No two games are the same. And with almost zero load time. Just get killed by a drone that you didn't know was there until it was too late? It's okay, you immediately find yourself in a totally different place with a new weapon(1 of 3 , that I've seen) to familiarize yourself with and the lessons you learned from your previous life still fresh in your memory... now go see how long you live this time!This is a great game and I honestly think every person who's ever played a FPS before should play it. If for no other reason than to gain a little more respect for the weaponry that so many of us have grown to take for granted. It's cheap. It's great. I recommend it.			"

												I would recommend this game to just about anybody who is a fan of the first-person shooter genre or has any kind of interest in guns. This well crafted gun simulator is, like they say, easy to learn but hard to master. Learning each weapon and how it is operated by muscle memory is fluid and satisfying; I never tired of loading and charging a weapon.The minimalistic presentation of the game environment allows the gun to be the focus of the game, as it should be, but each section in the procedurally generated world has its own challenges and secrets. After some practice you will grow well versed in traversing these environments and scanning them for threats and loot, which brings its own satisfaction.Perhaps the most satisfying of all the game's elements is its actual combat. Enemies come in two types: hovering taser drones and static turrets, both of which can deliver instant and fatal damage to the player. The gameplay here is challenging, but never unfair, and the quick restarts allow you to dive straight back into the game and apply what you've learned from past mistakes. The trial-and-error nature of Receiver's gameplay gives it a visceral and ephemeral feel comparable to that of Hotline Miami, although with a vastly different tone.Like the rest of the game, Receiver's story is delivered in a minimalistic and really quite interpretive style. You are tasked with exploring the world and collecting all eleven casette tapes, which contain a wealth of esoteric knowledge, accessible only to the specially mentally conditioned, known of course as 'receivers'. Despite their monotone delivery, I never really became bored with the tapes even after repeated listens. By the time you have heard all eleven, you will have memorised a great deal of background story information, which gives the feeling that you are a receiver. The casettes mention important story threads such as 'the Threat', 'the Mindkill' and multiple realities with such passing apathy that one is forced to imagine what exactly they entail, making the story that much more interesting. Without so much being left to the imagination, the game's story could not have had nearly the same effect.All told, Receiver is a simple but beautiful game. Its developers set out to create in seven days an engaging and accurate gun simulator with minimalist storytelling and they have succeeded by all measures. Receiver is a cheap buy and well worth a look from a fan of the shooting genre.			"

												I like the idea of it. I like the idea of a game where you actually have to go through all the motions of maintaining your weapon, e.g. opening the chamber, extracting the empty casings, loading the new bullets, closing the chamber, pulling the hammer, etc. There is something tactile about it that is very satisfying.The thing that really kills it for me, though, is that the different styles of gun lead to completely different control schemes. Sometimes equipping the flashlight is the 2 key, but sometimes it is the 1 key. In one round, tapping Z causes you to load more bullets into the empty chambers you're examining, but in the next round, pressing Z will make you drop the clip you're examining onto the ground (even if it's full). There are too many buttons doing too many things as it is, but then when the game shifts them around on you every round, it only compounds the problem. Those who are patient enough to go through the pain of memorizing all this may not have a bad time, but it is a major hurdle to the enjoyment of the game.The point at which I quit the game though was when I loaded a new round and the randomization placed me inside a room with a flying turret directly behind me. Literally, the round started, I heard a gunshot, and the round was over. I know roguelikes are super into busting the player's balls with randomization, but that seemed a bit steep.In short, I love the idea, but I don't think I like the execution.			"

												Receiver is a fun little title that is held back by a system of pure luck.Upon first getting this game, it is a fairly confusing first romp, fiddling with your pistrol as you try to understand how it works before venturing out to find your first sentry and HOPEFULLY killing it, or at least hittng a vital part and breaking it in some way that allows you to either get away alive or make things unwinnable. The gun system is by the most interesting part of this game, and the main selling point of it: There is no ""Press R to reload"" in this game, ammo doesn't magicly appear in your clip.. Heck, you might not even have an extra mag, meaning reloading requires you to go through the effort of putting in each bullet into the mag, provided you even have some bullets stored away.Really, I wish more games had such a deep gun system, where you have to manually reload the realistic way instead of just pressing R and making a new magazine poof into the gun. however, it is a shame that such a system is wasted here...While it is fun to fiddle with a gun in this game, what holds it back is how the game is played.. The goal of the game is to collect a certain number of tapes while fighting off robotic sentries in a randomly generated series of buildings. However, what this quickly boils into is a game that is nothing but pure luck if you win or not. The world is so randomly generated that it is possible that it could spawn an impossible situation that makes the game unwinnable.. Other times, however, it might just give you all the tapes right near the start, although this is rare.. From what I heard, it isn't worth it, though.So what about the combat? Surely it must be fun. And it is, provided you only are fighting ground-based sentries. But the moment you come across a flyer, kiss your progress goodbye because the blimy little robotic dinks will kill you so fast it baffles the mind. You will tremble in fear the moment you hear their buzzing down the hallway, maybe even try and find another way around, because no matter how hard you try, you can't beat them.. Not without either getting insanely lucky or throwing half your ammo at it.This is because of how crazed their movement is, the flyers flying in such a wobbly way that it makes it hard to hit them, let alone once they start charging you.. They shake so hard that it is like staring at a very angry blur. This makes it very hard to hit weakpoints, and the fact that they are melee based makes it worse, since you have no way of protecting yourself against the speedy hunks of junk unless you run like a bat out of hell and get lucky enough to avoid them. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the one-hit death system.Combine random generation with such unfair enemies and you get a game that oftentime, no matter how hard you may try, you will never be able to beat. Not because it is hard, but because the game tends to play unfair, sometimes going the extra mile to make sure you suffer your fair share of cheap deaths. A shame, really.. Were it not for the bullish systems in place, this game woulda been great.. But alas it is held back by some real unfun flaws.			"

												This game is an interesting concept piece, but falls utterly flat on it's face. Everything about the game is in need of polish, from an awful UI (for such an extremely sparse UI as it is), to intentionally poor control layout, to the combination of these factors exacerbating its brutal difficulty. It's impressive how such a simple game can fail on so many levels.The game is brutal in it's difficulty. Not because the enemies can kill you with a single hit, or that they greatly outnumber you, or that you have very limited ammo, or that it's intentionally difficult to aim your weapon properly, or that some enemies appear to be able to absorb prodigious amounts of ammo for little to no good reason. No, the biggest difficulty creator is the fact that there is no rhyme or reason to the control layout beyond the normal movement and aiming and firing controls. Yes, the game is supposed to have a difficult mechanic of maintaining your weapon. But the button placements make no sense - they neither emulate the firearm that you are using, nor are they set up in a way that encourages a logical pattern. They're just generally clustered around the WASD keys like the developer just slapped them down whenever he thought of a new feature that guns have that he had yet to implement.The only hook into the plot (what little plot there appears be) is from audio tapes that have a poor voice over that you may or may not find near the beginning of your adventure. There is nothing that will make you feel like you have a need to complete the plot, other than any intrinsic desire you may still harbor for completing the game for the sake of completion alone.Also, a very special frustration that I managed to encounter is the fact that the game offers no way to reset one's controls to the defaults, but the UI that gives you control hints entirely works on having the default controls. So if you change your controls you'll either need to give up on using the tutorial UI, or find them online (at the time I write this I was incapable of finding them listed), or delete your registry keys from Windows so the game is forced into returning your defaults to you. The only people who should buy this game are the heedlessly masochistic and the curious game developers who want to explore the concept and how not to approach it. Even then, wait until it's on sale.			"

												As a gun nut from Indiana I really wanted to love this game. I can't remember how I ended up getting it on Steam--I had it before I had a Steam account and I didn't like it then either. But I decided after reinstalling it that I would try playing it to see if I could get good at it.It was made in like 24 hours so it's perfectly excusable that I can't recommend it. But things like rendering shouldn't be a problem for most players of a game. I don't have much trouble with other, more complex games with textures and stuff that my computer actually has to load as it goes. Unless I reduce the resolution to like 560x480 or something ludicrously tiny like that, this game is completely unplayable because of the lag (a common complaint, it seems).Aside from that, this game is not intuitive in the slightest. It looks like I'm definitely not the only person who has had incredible amounts of trouble just figuring out how to load my handgun. Again, this is excusable because it was made in so little time. If you're a diehard fan of guns and roguelikes, have uncanny powers of patience and fantastic eyesight, maybe watch a trailer or something and see if you think you would like it. Personally, I would not pay anything for a sequel unless it was a fully-developed and crafted game.			"

												I give this about a 3.4 raiting. It has potential and I was giving it a serious chance before falling to the side of some stairs and getting stuck. As well as falling 5 maybe 7 feet and dieing.  Everything! And there are only two things to fight... Is a one hit kill to you. Then at times you can one shot things and others a whole mag wont touch them. If you like things that are super hard then GO FOR IT! But otherwise the controls are over done. That is both neat and annoying. Maybe if there was the ability to lean around corners it be an ok game. Then as well maybe a difficulty setting would be nice. For an original idea I give mad props but in my own opinion this game has a long way to go before I put any serious time into it.			"

												I can't really recommend Receiver for the price of $5.00. The storyline is short and not compelling, the game doesn't run or look particularly well at all, and the gunplay is unique, but not enough to hold my interest. The story is told through audiotapes found randomly throughout the game. I found it rather uninteresting, which in part is to be expected as the primary objective of the developer was to experiment with gunplay mechanics. As a result we have a storyline that just gives you a reason to collect audiotapes and shoot guns at robots.The game did not run particularly well for me, and I doubt it’s a problem with my hardware. Clipping and pop-ins are fairly common. The environment is not textured so anything other than the guns you use look bland. The backdrop of a metropolis was a nice touch but overall the game was unimpressive graphically and technically.The gameplay is centered on the gunplay. You are given a random gun in a random condition with a random amount of ammo. You can manipulate nearly any aspect of the gun including pulling the hammer back or loading bullets individually into a magazine, and each action requires a different key. It takes time to learn, but once you start to figure it out it becomes increasingly satisfying to quickly empty the casings out of a revolver and reload it. You fight two types of enemies, a flying taser robot and a turret. Different parts of the enemies react in different ways when shot, so accuracy is rewarded over speed. For example the strategy I usually attempted to employ was to shoot the camera on the turrets as ideally it would take one bullet, and they would no longer be able to detect me. Admittedly the gunplay is interesting, but in the end I don't think it’s capable of holding up the whole package.Without a worthwhile story and weak graphics, the gameplay fails to make this game worth the $5.00 price tag. I'm glad someone experimented with gunplay to make this game, and if you can pick it up for a cheaper price or free, it is worth trying. Gun enthusiasts should also reconsider what I have said, because this game might be something you will find quite enjoyable. "

-Quick Review-Receiver is a first person shooter that takes on the challenge of bringing in realistic gun mechanics, and an environment that looks like it was made by a student in his/her first few years using 3Ds Max.

Receiver isn't a game that will be enjoyed or appreciated by most people; that is why I'm giving it the down vote, to be honest I don't recommend or recommend-against playing this game, I simply didn't find it enjoyable.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You there! collect all the tapes! ""who me? Why do I want to do that?"" That's what I want to ask, but I'm not given that luxury. I collected only a couple tapes before getting tired of being murdered by the turrets 10+ times. Presumably you are collecting these tapes to uncover a mystery within the game and to understand what's going on inside the game.Game Play: First thing you do: Press ? on your keyboard so you can see what to doSecond thing you do: go through an acurete and realistic weapon arming proccessthird thing you do: run around and collect stuff on the floorfourth thing you do: run into your first enemy and get yourself killedGoal: To collect 11 tapesThe highlight for this game are the gun handling mechanics, you don't simply press ""R"" to reload, depending on the weapon you're using you need to press a button to change the cartage and then press a button to load a new one.For the revolver, you actually need to open the revolver, take out the old bullets, and put in new ones. While very interesting, and highly realistic, the game is not very easy to learn and will require learning new tricks if you want to actually survive the game play.I took down several of the auto turrets, there seem to be two kinds: Flying, and stationary. Both of them are really annoying if they spot you. If you get seen, you have a second to dodge around the corner. My instincts to shoot back usually ended up getting me killed. Achievements: No achievements (thankfully), unless you want to make them for yourself, I think collecting 11 tapes would be quite the accomplishment. Price:  This game just ended up in my steam game library, so free is free, but the price is $4.99 on the steam page. Probably not worth it for most people. Conclusion: I realize this game was made for the ""7-day FPS challenge"" which is why the graphics and the environment is very basic. But I just didn't really enjoy the game play, if there was more story, or just something to keep me interested I'd probably enjoy it more.This game would appeal to people who want to see what a game would be like with more realistic gun mechanics, however after playing it, I see why these types of mechanics aren't implemented in traditional shooters; because it breaks up the action within the game.

												This game is garbage, do not waste your time.  There is no difficulty setting, you have to restart over and over to get a decent starting potential, and hours upon hours of work can be lost because you were unlucky or a game glitch.  A single hit from anything will kill you and force a restart, falling 2 feet will kill you and force a restart, enemies off screen so far away you can't see them will kill you instantly, enmies not even existance will kill you.  Save your money, buy a good game.			"

												I played this a lot considering how not-good it is. It's refreshingly low-stimulus. You engage at your own pace* taking short bursts of high risk. ""High risk"" can be as mundane as turning a corner. If you don't see the telltale spotlights, robots shoot you and you die instantly. Situational awareness is sacrosanct and there are no non-diegetic distractions. It manages to be tense, and then routine, which causes laziness and then death. The high lethality, immobile enemies, and detailed gun manipulation emphasize readiness. To get ready, there's lots to do. There's nothing like being ready to go with a robot around the corner, magazines topped off, safety off, ironsights up, and dying because you forgot to chamber a round. The game does suspense very well.You start completely over when you die. You collect random pickups for your random gun around randomly placed enemies in random structures**. There are ""plot"" tapes to collect but you won't realistically collect them all ever. Some are blank. It's neat how nakedly cultlike they are. Like a real-life cult, not videogame-standard delusional idiots. Mystical ideas have materialist labels. The speaker in the tapes is a gun-and-apocalypse obsessed cult leader. He says they're magical superpower-granting tapes. You have to listen to all of them a ridiculous number of times (it's meta, you will hear the same ones over and over.) Your gun holster and pouch and loose ammo is standard kit. It's almost what the Branch Davidians would sound like if they did their propaganda mail-order.Ultimately though, it's not very good. It's kind of ugly. It's badly optimized, and lags when generating a new area. There's hardly any content. The lighting is obviously wrong in places. Some of the procedural areas don't ""line up"" and connect right. One map area has stairs with an invisible ledge you have to jump over. If you jump on a bed your head clips through the ceiling. The environment can clip through your inventory. It's possible to get physically stuck where it's impossible to get out or die. There are a ton of tapes and sometimes the random number generator is just unfair. The game has a lot of problems. It's an extremely unrefined version of a neat idea***, so I wouldn't recommend it to most people. It's only five bucks and I'm not most people, so it worked out for me.*I died at spawn once because a robot spawned in an adjacent area in line of sight.**Technically procedurally random but who cares.***Because it literally is, it took a week to make.

												I got this one with overgrowth, and this is terrible, you have to keep a control screen u[ while you wander around looking for whatever you supposed to get, it just plops you in there telling you to get the tapes,like its slender or something, but if youet hit once you die, and around any corner could be a turret waiting to just once shot you, meanwhile you have to put clips into the things.

												Although it's an early access game, this company has had a past of keeping their games in Alpha forever. There are keys for each individual part of your weapons - and it take 10 button presses in order to reload a gun.

												A game meant for guns nuts above all else. This is essentially a pistol simulator, i.e. there is a key for every step of reloading a pistol, like taking the magazine out or putting it back in. It was a cool concept at first, but it wore out fast. What is a gun sim without fun things to shoot at? The only things to shoot are turrets and flying drones.  It is actually more beneficial to avoid most of the enemies than to actually shoot at them with your gun. This ""game"" gives off a deeper tactical impression with its focus on gun realism, only for it to boil down to a silly minigame where you avoid turrets and drones whilst simultaneously collecting nonsensical tape recordings.

												This game is hardcore. You will DIE a lot.  I could see that if this were some sort of training VR where you were in an actual room, it would be legit.  The controls are difficult to get the hang of, and you will die a lot until you get the hang of it.  Ammo runs out quickly and good luck finding more, so get used to dying because of it. I died when I took it slow and I died trying to run and gun so I wouldn't waste anymore time with this. Did I mention you die a lot?			"

												WOW... major dissapointment. I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but there is a major problem with it. This game is sooooooo poorly optimized it is nearly unplayable. According to the store page, my PC not only met the Minimum requirements, but the Recommended requrements (barely but still) yet the game had UNBEARABLE framerate and mouse lag. I  mean it takes almost 2 seconds for the gun to move after you move the mouse. Sure, what's 2 seconds? Well in a game where you have enemies that are flying quickly, turrets that can kill you almost immediately after spotting you and limited ammo to hit small targets on previously stated enemies... yeah the mouse lag can really be a problem. It wouldn't bother me if the requirements of my PC aren't powerful enough, but I have read the requirements and they match (so don't blame my crappy Computer that [supposedly] meets the requirements). Now onto the actual game... there isn't much. The game is very simple. Collect all the Cassette Tapes around the level, while killing off all enemies and trying to survive. The main feature is the realistic gun unloading/reloading mechanics. Everytime you need to reload or whatever, you need to manually pull back slide, take out magazine, store in inventory, take new magazine out of inventory, load new magazine, unlock slide, and pull back hammer before being able to fire your gun. Each step has its own corresponding key to hit and it overall is annoying. It loses its novelty very quickly and just makes reloading a chore. It also makes it impossible in a firefight. Also each of the three different weapons has different reloading sequences... great.Also levels are randomly generated after death. So once you die, cassete location, enemy location and type, bullet count, flashlight batterey life, and gun type all change. This gives the challenge and overall is annoying since enemies (who instakill I should add) can be right around any corner. Also bullets are in random spots so good luck finding them when you have ran out and are now running from your life against flying guys in a hallway that has a turret around the corner at the end of it. What should happen is instead of the levels randomize after death, have a randomize button so you can know the layout and actually finish a level.Overall, the game has a cool idea but the poor optimization and annoying instakill enemies with tiny weakpoints ruin a game that could have had some really tense atmosphere.

												While the gun handling is really good, everything else is iffy to bad. The story in the tapes you collect ingame is mildly interesting, but not great. There's very little music, and it's nothing special. The level is really basic, boring, and overly minimalistic. Visuals are generally kinda ugly, without much style too. There's only two types of enemies, and while the idea of hitting them in specific locations is a cool idea, it's really tough in practice. The turrets aren't too hard to hit (there's a bit of a challenge, but not too much) or in some cases just to avoid, but the flying drones are nearly impossible to hit in the critical spots, and can require more than one hit, despite them flying extremely erratically. Combat can be frustrating, and not in a way that made me feel skilled for dispatching an enemy, so much as glad I wasn't hit myself. After almost two hours of trying to enjoy this game, I realized my hope was futile. The idea and core gunplay of a game is there, but nothing else of substance. Oh! I almost forgot the worst offence! It's buggy and laggy to high hell! I thought it might have just been my so-so laptop I had played it on, but numerous other reviewers had the same issues. 3.5/10 could have been something cool (and lag free) if the devs spent more time on it.

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)It's not a good game, but that's not what you should buy it for. It's about the gun handling. Once you have gotten the hang of it and played a while, you'll want mechanics like these in other games, too, and I'm not aware if there are any so far. I do not feel like these mechanics must be the focus of a game (And they indeed aren't in this game, they'll only seem like that to a beginner for whom they'll be the main obstacle.), they could just be a nice element of realism, but the game would of course have to be balanced accordingly.At first, I had real trouble getting the hang of the gun mechanics, even though there's on-screen help in the game (that you can toggle). But then I did this, and it helped a lot:In the game's launcher, I edited the keyboard configuration to a set of keys that I could easily remember and that made logical sense to me. This plus the key function texts in the configuration window made it easy for me to start handling the guns in a routine way. Downside: The in-game help does not adapt to the changed keyboard config. :(So, the gun handling and mechanics are fun. What about the game itself? Well, it has very limited gameplay. You sneak through a (procedurally assembled, so somewhat different play-through each time) facility, trying to obtain bullets, magazines, guns, a flashlight, and a few audio tapes. You'll encounter flying turrets that you have to fend off, and there are floor-mounted turrets. It's interesting that both consist of various parts, and shooting those has varying effect depending on what you hit.Is it fun? Yes, for a few hours, and it's mostly interesting because of the gun mechanics. It's not a full game, rather a prototype. Worth the purchase? Definitely when discounted, but €5 isn't all that much, either.The FOV is not low but can not[pcgamingwiki.com] be changed!			"

												One Sentence Summary - If you like pressing 15 buttons to shoot a gun, buy this game... otherwise, buy something else...--REVIEW--I simply cannot say that I recommend this game. It seems that this game was more of a tech demo than anything. Other than the ""Tron"" sounding background music, this game really doesn't provide any emotional connection with the player. The game simply starts... there is no story provided, other than the players having some sort of idea that they are running along some rooftops looking for cassette tapes. I assume these tapes give some sort of minimalistic story. I get the point that this was made for some 7-day FPS challenge, but they could have at least given the player some sort of story or motivation to find these tapes. The graphics are incredibly minimalistic, yet it runs poorly on my laptop, even on the ""fastest"" setting. I get much better performance playing something like Dragon Age or FInal Fantasy 13 than I would on this game. When I turned the resolution down to the lowest setting (like 600x800 or so), I got decent performance. You might as well do this, because you won't lose any graphical details... because there are none to lose. I believe this to be either a hardware compatability problem or simply not programmed well to run efficiently.---PROS---+Minimalistic/Non-existent story (if you like that sort of thing)+Tron music+Very ""realistic"" process of having to load and reload a gun.---CONS----Minimalistic/Non-existent story-No Tron motorcycles or discs-You have to press way too many buttons to load a gun. There is no tutorial or simple explanation other than pressing the ""?"" button for help, and blindly pressing the buttons until your gun is ready to shoot.-Graphics are very minimalistic (AKA- Didn't have time to add detail)-The game runs extremely poor on a dual core laptop with 8GB ram.-For the average game player, I think the gun loading process is extremely cumbersome... At least make a tutorial or arrange the buttons in a streamlined order.---CONCLUSION---If you like randomly generated worlds in games with no story, as well as tron music and hard to load guns, this is the game for you.

												In the beginning of a game of Receiver, you'll start off with a gun, and random amount of magazines and bullets, and a random position the gun is locked in, then depending on your skill you'll spend 5 mins or 30 seconds trying to load it. There's something so brilliant about that fact. I just love not pressing R and the game automatically doing all of the 10 movements required to load a gun, and having to instead press E, `, 1, 2, R five times, 2, 1, Z five times, 3 and then Z to load a gun. Yes.			"

												I love this game. For being made in a single week, and only having ONE content update, this game manages to create so much tension, and feeling, and amazing, it could put some big-name games to shame. And the mechanics are super fun to learn and use. Randomized level generation keeps things interesting, and the one hit death keeps a certain tension in the air that keeps you on your toes. The only two issues I have are as follows; no sprinting, and performance. No sprinting simply because if you happen to be crossing a large room or bridge with nothing around, navigation can be tedious. The performance thing is only an issue if you play full-screened. Just keep it in a window, with the appropriate level of detail, and you should be able to run it just fine.			"

												Receiver is a fun ""gun simulator"". The gun mechanics are very in depth. You can't reload just by tapping ""R"". You have to eject the magazine, load each bullet into the magazine individually, then put the magazine back in. Each of these actions has its own key. While somewhat confusing at first, you can eventually memorize the keystrokes for reloading and other gun mechanics.The objective of the game is simply to collect 11 cassette tapes, unlocking somewhat vague pieces of the game's story, and not getting killed by the two types of enemies. Enemies will kill you in one hit. If you die, you have to start completely over. It is far from an easy game.There are also 3 types of guns, but I downloaded a mod that adds even more. For a 5 dollar game, it kept me entertained for quite a while, and I'd say it's definitely worth a try.			"

												Receiver is a First Person Shooter about guns. Like, really about guns. The main attraction of this game is how it handles gunplay so realistically. Rather than have you automatically reload, you have to manually do each step to reload. If you miss up, there's just more time for flying sentries or turrets to get you. The point of the game is to traverse a randomly generated maze of bleak colors to find cassette tapes that provide background to the universe.The game's atmosphere is wonderfully dark and creepy. It does a great job of making you feel alone, and the dark colors combined with the low-quality models and textures create a sense of dread and otherness that makes you really feel like you're out of your element, running through a maze you have no map of that's filled with enemies that are more location-savvy than you.The gameplay is fun and rewarding. When you first start, you're probably gonna be really slow at handling your gun. You'll die a lot, and you'll forget certain steps, completely halting any progress in loading a new magazine into your weapon, typically under enemy fire. You won't have much ammo, and will have to conserve your bullets, though eventually you will run out right before entering a room full of enemies. As you get better at the game, you'll be able to load your gun faster and be more precise with your shots, wasting less ammo. This game does a good job of making you feel like you are progressing at the game because it is solely skill-based.I'd buy it.			"

												This game is like Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades for people who don't have VR.Also for people who don't like textures.And for people who like having no clue as to where they're supposed to go.And for pople who like audio logs.And for people who like cassette tapes.And people who like going through giant strings of empty rooms.And for people who like having all their progress rendered moot when they die because RNG levels.And for people who like finding a spare magazine, only to find it has no bullets in it.And for people who like not being able to see anything until they find a flashlight, only to lose said flashlight on death.And for people who like wasting their precious few bullets on hordes of one hit kill robots only to find they were guarding literally nothing.And for people who like getting shot once by a turret, thinking ""naw ain't no biggie dawg iss all good"", only to die five seconds later because you die in one hit and OH COME ON REALLY?!?If you fall into any of these categories, I would suggest that you go crazy, but you clearly already have.

												I really liked the design at first, and the gameplay and weapon mechanics were new to me and interesting so it seemed like such a great experience.The long lines of uninteresting, empty rooms made me wince a little, being very boring, and the gun gameplay was weird and the firing was patchy.The guns went from being different play styles to being just different difficulties, with only three guns;Easy: Glock. Full auto or semi, lots of ammunition when you find it.Decently Easy: M1911. Same as glock, but less ammo and no rapid fire.Hard: Revolver. Six shots, manual, buggy reloads, and a lot less ammo.So basically, restart until you get the glock, since all the guns do the same damage.I had high hopes for this game and couldn't wait for more content.I forgot it wasn't early-access.Ok, well maybe they'll update new content in?No updates since.... ever?Not worth it.I got so bored with it, I played 1.4 hours in a sitting, and then told myself I'd come back later.I never did.

												A very fun game once you understand the mechanics. I enjoyed learning all the key bindings and becoming effiecient with each weapon. Unforuntely the game isn't a smooth experience, I was hoping it could run at a solid 120 fps, but even with my GT770 the game lags each time I enter a new room. Can't even count the number of times I was killed because I would enter a room and the game would drop to sub-10 frames per second, then a turret would kill me as I stood there unable to move. Wish I could play more but I feel I can't really progress because of those gameplay issues.			"

												Some quality gaming. The most high quality gaming I've had the pleasure to game in quite some time. To game on this game you have to press a lot of buttons, gaming that only a real gamer can game in a game. I went into this game expecting a quick gaming session, but in all my years of gaming I have never misjudged a game's gaming potential so badly. The game itself is simple to game, you are a simple gamer and the game is to find 11 game tapes for the game. You game with a gun and you find ammo, and if you game hard enough you might collect all 11 tapes. I have not gamed hard enough for such a game as this, and I have disgraced my gamer family. But I haven't heard of anybody gaming hard enough to give this game the business (game business, of course), so perhaps I will be allowed back into my game family. Quality game for any gamer to game when they feel like a casual game or a serious game this game can go either way.

												The gun reloading mechanics are neat, but the iron sighting to aim is terrible making the game not fun to actually play. If you were to aim an actual gun, you would keep the gun lined up to the target with your vision. When you aim in this game, however, moving the mouse moves the gun around a certain amount before turning the character. This means aiming is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and very unrealistic to actual gun aiming. I also had to massively reduce my mouse speed in order to actually aim, though it was still hard to aim as the gun jumps around for every pixel you would have moved with your mouse.			"

												This game is, well, strange,I'm not sure what the story is, but all I know is that you are a in somekind of dream machine and you need to find tapes to unvail the truthGraphics/Art style- I like the art style in this game. It's very blocky, but this game shows that you don't need graphics to have a good game. This also reminds me of those retro days where the first 3D games were all blocky and sometimes pixely. Although I like the are style, there are some bugs that I found that make giant block spawn in my way and completely blocks of the only entrance to the last tape. 8/10 for retro score, 5/10 for score against games with good graphics. (the 5/10 score will not be put into the final score)Gameplay- For gameplay I would say that it's ok. It's actually quite spooky if you get randomly attacked by one of the flying turrets, but searching for the tapes is quite boring most of the time. Sure, you might say that you will run into a lot of turrets, but I spawned in once with no turrets.  7.8/10Price- 5.49 is the price in Canada, but is it worth it? YES! For the price, this game is great, and you will receive lots for the five bucks, besides IT IS 5 FREAKIN DOLLARS!!!!! 9.3/10Final verdict- If you like Indie games, then sure go ahead!

												I lied in my last review, or at least looking back now i was, because i started playing more games and got a better idea of what a video game should be and this is not it. Now one could make the argument that ""it is better than cod"" while it might be better in the long run, it is just a sloppy game that had a very short time window. If it had more time then i could see this game being more playable but i seem to be going on nothing so i'll start the real review now. First off, guns are few to none and tiny little robots that want to turn your chest cavity into swiss cheese are every where, you may spawn with a gun or a flashlight or simply nothing. Finding a gun isn't very easy because you die pretty fast because you have as much bullet resistance as President Lincoln and when you finally get a gun, the magazine is shorter than a Japanese midget.  Objectives are not marked, there is no way to find your way around and there are no checkpoints. If you find these complaints stupid and like COD, then you have COD on your mind, because listing all the FPS's with those 3 things would take longer than i care for. This game does need navigations though, because every time you die the world gets randomized leaving you lost. Marked objectives are a must have because the only objective is to collect these little VHS tapes or what the hell ever, and they are small as a Chinese elf and some times blend into the enviroment.  Overall this game is just not worth playing, not only is it filled to the brim with bugs it is only fun for 20 minuets AND you die from 5 feet falls, i sh!t you not. Maybe if they made a Receiver 2 and put more behind it than ""OH LOOK WE HAVE RANDOM GENERATED WORLD N' ROBOTS N' GUNS"" then i would consider playing it. 3/10			"

												The game when a gun is a gun. Its fun to play and discover the story and this game will also scare you with enemies making noises out of the blue and killing you. You can spawn with three weapons, the first is a colt which is basic and just good around. The second one is a revolver which can make waste or conserve ammo if you not careful. The last one is a glock which is like a colt but with a burst mode that gets ride of any ammo in the clip witch can waste all your ammo fast and should only be used in a desperate emergency. It is a randomly generated map with a secret around every corner. I give Receiver a 7.5/10			"

												From what I have played so far, the game is fun, but very very challenging at first. I am starting to get some of the gun mechanics now, and things are getting a little easier. Definitely a very different experience than many shooter actiony type games I have played. I have some issues with framerate due to the dynamic lighting.

These guns add more depth to the game, operating a bit differently than the ones the game comes with. The framerate boost is extremely helpful. With the mod the player can get a lot more out of this game. Good job to whoever made it.			"

												What I really want, after playing this, is a similar game with the same gun-handling mechanics, in another genre, or what I really want to say is an actual game. Dealing with actual opponents of some kind rather than flying/mounted hazards of some kind, but still dealing with the excellent and complex gun mechanics. Want to see someone do a jam-clear on their weapon while a zombie is rushing at them, or ducking behind a wall to insert bullets back into their magazine while an opponent is tapping suppressive fire at them. That mechanic alone is impressive enough, but there's just not enough variety and substance to this game to be enjoyable on its own, in my opinion.			"

												Pros:-Realistic firearms simulation. It feels like you actually control the gun-Interesting story-Quite a lot of stuff put into it, considering it was made in seven daysCons:-Takes more processing power than all of my other games. I have a decent computer and even on the fastest setting it was slow. I tried it on my other computers to the same effect. This caused my character to jerk around unpredictably and made it hard to aim my gun; I died frequently.-Graphics are from 1998-I kept encountering this glitch where the gun shakes back and forth rapidly and when I fire the gun I shoot myself instead.-Gun mechanics are frustrating at first, with a lot of buttons to memorize.-Randomized, sometimes requires lots of moving back and forth and can be frustrating.Go for it, but make sure you have a powerful PC first.

I'd love to see these sort of gun mechanics in a multiplayer FPS or a horror game.

												Pretty difficult to run with a reasonable framerate (I'm currently doing so by playing with a lower resolution), but it's definitely worth it. The gun mechanics are a massive breath of fresh air, the story is really compelling, and the atmosphere is just ridiculously tense. I have no problem with admitting that I'm afraid of the dark, but that normally doesn't affect me in games. However, Receiver somehow manages to hit the part of my brain that real darkness does. Truly a phenomenal piece.			"

The controls are simple in the game as you progress through the barren city not much is known about the story apart from you just need to collect 11 tapes and not die, as the game does focus more on the gun and the enemies it can give you a few jumps at times.

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the Randomness of the game makes it so terrible, you can turn a corner to find a sentry gun that makes no noise and will fire at you instantly. I spawn in dark areas that lead to straight to a drop that kills you, this is made even worse by the fact that your flash light has a very small distance it will show you. I kept spawning right infront of enemies or I would round the first corner only to see a sentry or a flying blade machine that would instantly kill me. The flying machines travel way to fast and sparaticaly to even aim at till they kill you. To be honest this game is very good for being made in 7 days, just it should not have been sold on steam for $5, because overall it's terrible from a gameplay standpoint.			"

This game in its own way is one of the most immersive and impressive FPS ever to be made. Each of the 3 firearms has its own quirks such as having to manually eject the shells wit the revolver or the Colt M1911A1 that on ocassion is given to you uncocked or with the saftey on. Most of the time you realise that when a drone s flying at your head :P. Definatley worth the 4 quid you pay for. But be warned patience is required for learning the mechanics. Enjoy!			"

Then entire time I played this I felt it would lend itself perfectly to a detective noir type game, something like LA Noire, using the shooting only once in a while to build tension and realism to the police procedural style; probably wont ever happen but hey, maybe this one random review will convince somebody to do this, and if that happened I would say Reciever is a great game for inspiring somebody!

												First and foremost BUYER BEWARE:You WILL NEED an AMERICAN STANDARD compatible keyboard or else this game's controls WILL NEVER WORK FOR YOU.This game is small- luckily.Every moving part of your guns have a button attached to them- That's big.Do you know how much you take for granted when playing a first person shooter?Like aiming without your gun and arms in the way of your field of view? Reciever has your field of view covered.What about not having to deal with safties and pulling the hammer/slide back for your first shot? There's 3 buttons to do just that.Imagine a First-Person shooter where not just 'R' is reload, but it's v to eject your clip, then z to holster your gun, then tilde to load your bullets 1 by one in to the clip, then z to unholster your gun and finally v to reinsert the clip. Dont forget to pull back the slide and release your safety.That's Reciever. The game where you can disassemble a gun key by key.			"

												Before you chew me out for only playing an hour and a half of this game first let me tell you about it. This game is great. The idea is fantastic and the sense of survival it goes for is achieved. Does it look like it could have been made in Google SketchUp? YES (at least on my computer it does). But it goes surprisingly deep for what it is. You spawn in a random part of what appears to be a huge house, or apartment bulidings, or neither I'm really not sure. You are then given one of three handguns, a Glock, a revolver, and a Colt 1911. This is where the game get's really interesting. The controls focus around the gun. There is a key set to open the reciever, a key set to take out the magazine, a key set to pull the hammer back. Everything you would actually do with a gun, and magazine for that matter, there's a key for it in this game. To me that is fantastic. It's new to me, and I tend to doubt there have been many if any games that follow that same idea. The second interesting point of this game are the audiotapes you pick up. They give a wonderful backstory to the game, telling you why you are there, and hinting at something sinister. In that way, it's like the Matrix, only voiced by Microsoft Sam. If you see this game for 50%, heck 33% off or more buy it. You will not regret it. This game get's my 7/10. The idea is great, but I wish the game was more replayable.			"

												Well, the graphics aren't that great, but that doesnt make the game bad. This game is AMAZING. This game is about the gunplay, and currently has 3 different weapons: Colt M1911, Glock and a revolver. Colt and Glock are kinda the same, except the Glock has a larger magazine, and it can auto-fire. The revolver is alot different than the Colt and the Glock, because it has a cylinder that holds the bullets.(6 bullets) The controls are a bit complicated, but you will get the hang of it. I would recommend this game to people that are tired of Call of Duty, Battlefield, all that kind of games, to people that want something fresh. This is the game for those people. 10/10 The Flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying			"

												Receiver is a very interesting little experiment that bases its gameplay around the mechanic that you have to manually reload your weapon like a puzzle, essentially a on the fly FPS puzzel game.It doesn't take too long to figure out how to properly reload everything and very soon you will be reloading faster than ever, so in the end it becomes a interesting little survival game to keep you distracted.I honestly wish this game would continue to be updated because there is a huge realm of possibilities to add in terms of weapons that could be used. Like shotguns, crossbows, bolt action rifles, all of these things would bring fantastic variety to this game, adding onto the list of different weapons you need to remember how to reload in different ways.But alas, it remains as it is, with only 3 weapons to use and toy with. Although the product itself is good, it's a shame when you imagine all that it could of had.			"

												For a game made in a week, it's pretty great. It's inherently satisfying to manually reload your weapon as quickly as you can, once you have a grasp on the mechanics. It's tense and fun when you hear a drone around a corner, look out for its camera light, and time it just right to shoot and disable it unscathed. There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.However, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.It's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift.			"

												Receiver is one of those rare games that feels entirely new and fresh.While it is your standard survival-adventure shooter in terms of action, it is so much more than that. Receiver is one of those rare games that actually makes you work to succeed. You have to memorize the steps to get your gun working or you will die quickly and repeatedly, you have to learn your enemy's weak spots, you have to learn how to safely enter a room or hallway. Receiver is near impossible difficulty, but I always find myself picking it back up.It's not a game about completion, but rather a game about mechanics.

Warning:This is not a complete game, consider this a tech demo since this game was done in a week!Now that we got that out of the way, onto the game.Receiver is a first person shooter rogue-like. Everytime you spawn, you get a random weapon with a random inventory on a randomly generated world.The objective is simple, obtain 11 tapes around the map and you win. But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.The main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet. While the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.While there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.But lets review the features of this game.FeaturesDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto modWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.Taser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage modelsAs said above before the features. This is true.Ballistic modeling of ricochets and bullet dropAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill eventThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.Become literate in how guns actually operateI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.While the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.I belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once. Now for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?For 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability.			"

												Very well done realistic FPS. Made me panic a few times as a drone came whizzing past my skull, or I heard the beep of a turret behind me. I'm astounded at what this game accomplished despite only taking a week to create. the complexities behind your firearm become second nature after a few playthroughs, and you get immersed in the games subtle and somewhat errie cyber environment as you go to collect disks before you run out of ammo or are filled with the sensation of a sharp electric buzz to the head or dozens of pieces of metal rebounding throughout your ribcage.

While in this game hitting a few buttons in the right order will reach your goal the real world lets you do this without thought unless you gun jams. All in all it is a good game but you will eventually curse the muscle memory games like COD, BF and even Arma created until you create your own.10/10  would use revolver again.

												This game is, well, strange,I'm not sure what the story is, but all I know is that you are a in somekind of dream machine and you need to find tapes to unvail the truthGraphics/Art style- I like the art style in this game. It's very blocky, but this game shows that you don't need graphics to have a good game. This also reminds me of those retro days where the first 3D games were all blocky and sometimes pixely. Although I like the are style, there are some bugs that I found that make giant block spawn in my way and completely blocks of the only entrance to the last tape. 8/10 for retro score, 5/10 for score against games with good graphics. (the 5/10 score will not be put into the final score)Gameplay- For gameplay I would say that it's ok. It's actually quite spooky if you get randomly attacked by one of the flying turrets, but searching for the tapes is quite boring most of the time. Sure, you might say that you will run into a lot of turrets, but I spawned in once with no turrets.  7.8/10Price- 5.49 is the price in Canada, but is it worth it? YES! For the price, this game is great, and you will receive lots for the five bucks, besides IT IS 5 FREAKIN DOLLARS!!!!! 9.3/10Final verdict- If you like Indie games, then sure go ahead! This games will be a great buy, but if you don't like waiting and looking for things, than you might want to pass on this. Final Score: 83/100			"

												I lied in my last review, or at least looking back now i was, because i started playing more games and got a better idea of what a video game should be and this is not it. Now one could make the argument that ""it is better than cod"" while it might be better in the long run, it is just a sloppy game that had a very short time window. If it had more time then i could see this game being more playable but i seem to be going on nothing so i'll start the real review now. First off, guns are few to none and tiny little robots that want to turn your chest cavity into swiss cheese are every where, you may spawn with a gun or a flashlight or simply nothing. Finding a gun isn't very easy because you die pretty fast because you have as much bullet resistance as President Lincoln and when you finally get a gun, the magazine is shorter than a Japanese midget.  Objectives are not marked, there is no way to find your way around and there are no checkpoints. If you find these complaints stupid and like COD, then you have COD on your mind, because listing all the FPS's with those 3 things would take longer than i care for. This game does need navigations though, because every time you die the world gets randomized leaving you lost. Marked objectives are a must have because the only objective is to collect these little VHS tapes or what the hell ever, and they are small as a Chinese elf and some times blend into the enviroment.  Overall this game is just not worth playing, not only is it filled to the brim with bugs it is only fun for 20 minuets AND you die from 5 feet falls, i sh!t you not. Maybe if they made a Receiver 2 and put more behind it than ""OH LOOK WE HAVE RANDOM GENERATED WORLD N' ROBOTS N' GUNS"" then i would consider playing it. 3/10			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the Randomness of the game makes it so terrible, you can turn a corner to find a sentry gun that makes no noise and will fire at you instantly. I spawn in dark areas that lead to straight to a drop that kills you, this is made even worse by the fact that your flash light has a very small distance it will show you. I kept spawning right infront of enemies or I would round the first corner only to see a sentry or a flying blade machine that would instantly kill me. The flying machines travel way to fast and sparaticaly to even aim at till they kill you. To be honest this game is very good for being made in 7 days, just it should not have been sold on steam for $5, because overall it's terrible from a gameplay standpoint.			"

												Some times you start with a flashlight. Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have a lot of ammo, sometimes you don't. This game in its own way is one of the most immersive and impressive FPS ever to be made. Each of the 3 firearms has its own quirks such as having to manually eject the shells wit the revolver or the Colt M1911A1 that on ocassion is given to you uncocked or with the saftey on. Most of the time you realise that when a drone s flying at your head :P. Definatley worth the 4 quid you pay for. But be warned patience is required for learning the mechanics. Enjoy!			"

												The gun reloading mechanics are neat, but the iron sighting to aim is terrible making the game not fun to actually play. If you were to aim an actual gun, you would keep the gun lined up to the target with your vision. When you aim in this game, however, moving the mouse moves the gun around a certain amount before turning the character. This means aiming is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and very unrealistic to actual gun aiming. I also had to massively reduce my mouse speed in order to actually aim, though it was still hard to aim as the gun jumps around for every pixel you would have moved with your mouse.			"

												This is a very immersive game. You just have to give it time and get used to it. The story and visuals are minimal but effective. The heart of the immersion are the mechanics: they're daunting at first, but satisfying to master. Quck-moving helicopter drones will keep you dependent on your weapon, and the five-button reload will keep you handicapped by it, no matter your experience. Great game to spend a few minutes on if you aren't looking to settle down for something more in-depth.			"

												This game, I like it. You are dropped in to a seemingly randomly generated world, and you have a gun, with varying bullets, and magazines. The only weird thing is, it's not a normal FPS. You control everything about the gun. From the slide, to a slide lock, you can even put it on safety. However, that doesnt mean all these cool mechanics mean this game is flawless. The story, from what I've seen, is non-existant in the beginning. You need to progress through the RNG-based world to get more and more of the lore. That... makes me feel weird. I want to know what I'm supposed to do. Just dropping me off in a room/hallway/on a rooftop with no explanation doesnt really grip me. That's my only gripe with the game. It is really, really fun to just siut down and play for like 10 or 20 minutes, or in my case, 2 hours. You should get it, but do like I did, and get it while it's cheap. It's not for everyone, and that's ok. Thanks for reading, <3 Glad you could Receive this information well. It gud gaem.			"

Unfortunately, that's the only thing it has going for it. It's an interesting concept that is trapped in a half-baked, Slendermanish shell. Random weapon loadout, random level design, search for the mcguffin objectives (with embarassing voice work), and frustrating enemies that have locational damage models that mean that it's pretty much random if your shots do any good. Basically, the game is designed as youtube scarecam fodder, with all that entails. As a proof of concept, it does a magnifcent job in demonstrating more immersive gun mechanics.

												There's really no game here. The reload stuff is cool, but it is ABYSMALLY explained. The enemies are just not fun to interact with in any way. The rooms in the enviroment look so similar that it's impossible to find your way around. The tapes work terribly as a reward mechanic, because the guy voicing them does an awful, droning, painfully monotone reading of some really pretentious ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" monologues.			"

												Some people will take this game very boring and uninteresting and some people will find this game very very fun. It's a quite unique game in my opinion.First thing: the way you handle the gun is very realistic, so the button layout is very different than normal games, especially when you reload. You have to press each button for certain actions; for example, with a revolver, you must 1) open the chamber 2) drop all the empty cartridges (some may get stuck sometimes, so you gotta shake em/hit the key repeatedly) 3) reload each bullets 4) close the chamber. <<so there are 4 different buttons to press to reload as for other games, reload is just 'r'. There are three different types of guns: Glock, Colt 1191, and S&W revolver. They all have different ways to reload, but the same action = same keys. You will feel SOOOOOOOOO achieved if you get used to reloading well that you can reload smoothly and fast without even thinking.There are only two types of enemies in this game: automatic sentry gun & flying taser robot, which is kinda scary when you actually face them because they **cking fly at you like a tsunami. They have limited sight (so sneak when you're out of their sight and ambush? I guess. That's not a very good word for this kind of situation but I suck at English so... Yeah..) but they if they detect you, good night man (unless you have an Asian reflexes on mice or consol that you can hit certain part of robot when it's flying the **ck at you). And damaging certain parts will either break (different parts) or kill the machine.Anyways, the goal of this game is to find 11 recorded tapes and I think it's game over then. HOWEVER! I bet not a person among 1000 players can finish this game as fast as they thought it would end. As you can see, I played 10.4 hours of this game and still wasn't able to finish the game and I consider myself not THAT bad of a FPS shooter... I'M ASIAN FOR GOD'S SAKE!Uhh.... I wanna explain more but I gotta go to sleep so.... maybe if someone asks to write more about this game I'll write it in Korean and English both detailed. Oh and also, are there any games out there like this? Because I'd love to see this kind of game actually developed well. I mean... This game was made in less than a week so great respect for that.

												Some quality gaming. The most high quality gaming I've had the pleasure to game in quite some time. To game on this game you have to press a lot of buttons, gaming that only a real gamer can game in a game. I went into this game expecting a quick gaming session, but in all my years of gaming I have never misjudged a game's gaming potential so badly. The game itself is simple to game, you are a simple gamer and the game is to find 11 game tapes for the game. You game with a gun and you find ammo, and if you game hard enough you might collect all 11 tapes. I have not gamed hard enough for such a game as this, and I have disgraced my gamer family. But I haven't heard of anybody gaming hard enough to give this game the business (game business, of course), so perhaps I will be allowed back into my game family. Quality game for any gamer to game when they feel like a casual game or a serious game this game can go either way. I'd rate this game pretty well but, being a simple gamer, I am compelled to meme.10/10 would game again			"

												Reciever is one of the most involving FPS i played. Story isn't very important: You have to find 11 cassetes, and stay alive. Your enemies? Drones, sentry guns and fall damage. The biggest diffrence between reciever and any other FPS is, that you need to do everything with your weapon by yourself. You have to fill ammo clip before loading it to your gun, prepare it to fire, remove ammo clip, and fill it again. A bit challenging at the beggining, but enojyable after understanding. You encounter 3 types of guns:-Revolver- 6 rounds in barrel, you have to remove shells after firing-Colt 1911 A1- regular gun, normal mag, can be turned into safe mode (unable to fire)-Glock - Basicly the same as Colt, but safe mode has been replaced with full auto modYou start game with one of them, random amount of ammo, and sometimes with a flashlight. And remember to be carefull! If bullets won't kill you instantly, they can kill you even in a seconds after leaving fire zone.This game is totally worth it's price, and good for short game sessions.			"

												There's really no game here. The reload stuff is cool, but it is ABYSMALLY explained. The enemies are just not fun to interact with in any way. The rooms in the enviroment look so similar that it's impossible to find your way around. The tapes work terribly as a reward mechanic, because the guy voicing them does an awful, droning, painfully monotone reading of some really pretentious ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" monologues.			"

												You are armed with a gun and some bullets. You can explore and find extra bullets laying around in the environment and inside buildings but the goal is to collect 11 tapes which are randomly scattered around the game, all the while avoiding being seen and shot or tasered by enemy dronesDespite the simple premise it is not an easy game to finish. No matter how well you know the enemy is it quite easy to turn the corner at the wrong time and be spotted by a drone. One shot equals death.The challenge lies in the fact that the gun you get (a 1911, a revolver or a automatic/semi auto 9 mil) operates like a real gun, in which you can't simply fire to shoot, or press one button to reload with a magical supply of filled magazines.To reload you must eject the magazine, load it with bullets individually, slide the magazine back into the gun, chamber a round and then fire. It is the most realistic representation of gun I have seen in a gameIt sounds complicated but after a few games the controls become second nature and the focus becomes survival. This comes by making sure your gun is loaded before every encounter, because it's about impossible to reload on the run. Not running blindly into an unknown area, because one shot will kill you. The levels and location and numbers of enemies are randomly generated as well as your starting loadout so it's never the same game twice,I recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge			"

												This game is terrible! It was thrown in for free when I bought Overgrowth, and even that was too high a price.It feels like Probably Archery, or similar simulator-type game, however there is zero instruction and sense of humour. I can usually get the point of games, however silly, but this one just makes me feel angry when trying to play it. I wonder if this game was even finished. How did it get onto Steam in such a poor state of gameplay? Perhaps the developers hated working on it and just published it to get rid of it?			"

												i have seen many a review for this game and most of them are true such as the way that MMS'S are taking a dark turn towards these looking more like nerf toys than actualy firearms. The thing i love about this game is the fact they make it a challenge no beating around the bush just trial and error. The other thing is that they made this game IN ONE WEEK. 7 days to creat such a beautiful game and a great one at that. Wolfire games you have truly dazzled me not alone with Overgrowth but with Receiver and i myself am sad to only now get to know these developers. You have some real talent Wolfire i expect great things and hopefully so does the community.			"

												I guess if youre from Texas shooting deer with your AK every morning or something this ""game"" (experiment actually) might not be of much interest. For anybody else this could offer an interesting insight into what gun use entails besides point and click and pressing r.It would really be interesting to see those mechanics implemented in a ""proper"" FPS. Heck it could practically breathe new life in the Zombie/Survial Horror subgenre.Beware, once one gets the hang of the controls and can switch mags, ♥♥♥♥ hammers, put bullets in and out of magazines and all that jazz its great fun but unfortunately there isnt much game to put that to use in. Theres 2 enemy types one of which is annoying to deal with due to sluggish movement, the style and graphics look nice (i was abit reminded of Mirrors Edge) but the performance is comically bad for what basically amounts to rendering gouraud shaded objects and some lights.If you ever played some realismo fps and wished the gun handling to be more complex, give this a spin and wonder what could be.

												Let's get it straight from the get-go. This game won't win awards for graphics, plot or sound design even if I think the guns sound meaty enough. This game is basically a quicky roguelike involving a gun and I strongly suggest tapping the ? button followed by holding it down while handling different things so you can quickly learn how to take your gun apart and reload it. That right there is why you're playing this game. You're vulnerable, the gun is barely a comfort and you're constantly worried you're going to take one step too far and find yourself dead and starting over. The three guns all feel a bit different and funny enough, just like real life, I can't stand the Glock. Points for involving a revolver and the 1911 though. It's five bucks, if you're a fan of shooters or if you actually shoot, this game is at least worth a look at some point. I wouldn't mind seeing a proper game made of this concept. I like it.			"

												This game is pretty damn awesome. It's a basic, relatively simple game that doesn't look amazing, but what's actually there is great. Each level is procedurally generated so the map is never the same, you always have randomized ammo/equipment, and one bullet from a turret or shock from a flying drone will kill you. It makes piecing together the 2spooky story that's told across 11 tapes randomly placed on the map very difficult, but wonderfully tense. And of course, there's the game's real star - three guns that operate the same way actual firearms do. There's no crosshair, no ammo counter, and your mags don't magically refill themselves - assuming you have more than one, anyway. Doing a brass check and topping off magazines with loose rounds are actually things you'll find yourself doing in this game, as are other gun-specific actions like releasing the slide, dropping empty brass from a revolver, and spinning a cylinder to a loaded chamber, all of which require multiple button presses to accomplish. Sometimes, you'll even find it necessary to holster your weapon to complete an action such as filling a magazine, or pull the weapon down from the ""aimed"" position into a low ready to sprint away from danger. It's not the prettiest or most action-packed game out there, but Receiver is the closest a game has ever come to recreating the sensation of using an actual firearm. Very, very much worth the $5 purchase price.			"

												This game is a FPS with elements that allow the user to load and reload their gun manually; although this concept sounded intriguing at first, the gimmick soon wore off and becomes annoying and makes the game a lot more difficult. This game has fairly poor graphics quality but it is on the Unity engine. It has ok gameplay in generated worlds but it is very very difficult to complete. The game pins you against robot enemies in a creepy empty setting where you have to find 11 tapes to complete the one level game.There isn't much to say about this game due to it's lack of content but it isn't very good.6/15 ""Gimmick wears off""			"

The games biggest draw is the fact that it has a very relaistic and unique gun system which although cklever I found quite annoying as the controls seemed to change for ech gun when they needn't for example to insert a magizene for one pistol is z while to insert a barrel into a magnum its r, which simply gets confusing. I often found the enmies, of which there are only two types of too be annoying as well as despite the fact I shoot them with obvious sparks coming off them it still often takes a lot of bullets to take them out, this is very annoying seeing as sometimes you are spawned with one bullet... meaning that you will often spend your time in Receiver walking around its dull landscape, getting shot and starting all over again...

												I came to steam to find a futuristic, exciting, next gen first person shooter. What I was met with was this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Steaming- pardon the pun. I started up the game which promised to fit my criteria to find this poorly made pile of junk that was obviously designed by a dead parrot or some ♥♥♥♥ as that is the only explaination for a game of this high caliber of awfulness. The ""gameplay"" was disgustingly designed and felt as though I could do better coding with my left bollock. Half of the entire map is mother♥♥♥♥ing green and I am now blind in my right eye as a result of these graphics that looked as though they were designed with a blunt crayon. I have never come across a game that is this ♥♥♥♥ since 'Intergalactic Cage Match' on the ZS Spectrum. This game ruined my life and I feel as if this was the worst waste of £60 I have ever come across during all my years of black market trading and scams in cheap casinos. This is a dispicable excuse for a steam game and I would like it to be obliterated from the face of the Earth for I wish for it never to prey on another poor sod's once valued retinas. Also, It has the most ♥♥♥♥ed up controls sytem since Tony Hawk: Skate and its ♥♥♥♥ed up skateboard controller and we all know how utterly ♥♥♥♥ that was. If anyone in their right mind would ever play this game, I will find you and be administering you to the nearest mental institution. On the other hand, it has a half decent title screen.			"

												Back when I was in prison, I ra-ped a man. Up his as-s. He cried a little bit, but he was a trooper for the most part. Tightest manp-ussy I ever fuc-ked, best on the yard. He was really friendly the first day in stir, didn't really know how things worked. Talked about his girlfriend Jessica. Two days later I was fu-cking him raw, asking what Jessica would think of him if she could see him getting my ♥♥♥♥ up his as-s. That made him cry, but a couple of light punches to the back of his head shut him up. I reminded him Jessica wouldn't want him, that he wasn't a real man any more. Sometimes I called him Jessica and forced him to call me ""Big Meat"". ""You like that filthy AIDS ♥♥♥♥, Jessica?"" ""Yes, Big Meat"" he'd cry. Which goes to show you that every man is just a Jessica waiting for a Big Meat to come into his life and ♥♥♥♥ him with an AIDS p-enis. You learn a lot of things in prison.3/10 gameplay2/10 deliverydo not buy this unless it's like 2.50			"

												In General: Receiver is basically game for potato computers(like my laptop). It heat it so well so I don't worry about next winter/any cold season and without problems I can count on my hands fps this game produce. Might Receiver's RNG is online 24/7 so this game always ""answer"" to my commands. Gameplay:[Manual reload ur guns in survival mode] Tried to collect at least 1 of the tapes and in a few seconds get murdered by flying insect with shocker on it. One of hardest part is find weak spots with potato graphics also aiming on those flying zappers. I thought one of tapes was porn recordings, kinda. Is it worth it? Indeed. If u have problems with low temperature in ur room when buy it now!(make sure u have launched it on potato or it'll not work)8/10, still cold in my room...			"

												For a game that was created in a single week, it runs exceptionally well and is quite addictive.  This game, unlike other FPS's, take the approuch of being as real as possible: Every single thing you do with the gun is another step for you to take.  Unloading a clip?  Reloading?  Safty?  All of those need to be done one at a time.  Although this may seem risky, this game does it to a whole new level and makes it interesting.  Mechanics are a bit awkward to get a handle of at first, but after about a half hour of play-time, you begin to get the hang of it, gaining some progress in the game.  I can almost memorize all the buttons required for reloading.Enemies are nothing special, though: they basically boil down to stationary turrets and flying robot helicopers from SpyGear with tazers that go *zap*.  Nothing unique, but far from being easy.This game does a good job of making it a challange without making it either laughably easy or insanly hard.  At first, the game is difficult, but then you get a hang of things and it begins to get easier.  It's well paced.Randomly generated areas also help the game's overall success.This game is fantastic for what it is.  The best part is that I didn't even need to pay for it: They announced that if you pre-order their other game, ""Overgrowth"" (which is an excellent game as well; I highly recomend it) you get a free copy of ""Reciever"" as a thank you gift.Thanks, Wolfire games!  ~Ohyoupokedme			"

												Got this for free on the Humble Store End of Summer Sale, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I'm sure there are those who will enjoy this game, but for me I couldn't really get started to even begin enjoying it.Lots of gun controls that forced me to have to have the help open on the right constantly. Then times when I wasn't sure if the gun was loaded or not. As soon as an enemy shoots you, you die as you have just the tiniest amount of health.So, spending time wandering around some weird building and dying, whilst not knowing how to use the complicated guns (and often having next to no ammo to begin with), just frustrated me and made me want to go play something else instead. But your mileage may vary, of course. It's just not for me.			"

												I thought about writing a positive review for this game, but then I realized I was going off half-cocked. Now, I'm not exactly gun-shy, but I think I really shot myself in the foot after shelling out 5 dollars for this.Now, let me put a bead on the issue--This game had me chewing the rag for a bit. It didn't exactly feel as if the developers had kept their powder dry.  I fell for the ""gun-lover niche"" lock, stock, and barrel. I actually enjoyed the game for a bit--but then I realized the experience was just a flash in the pan. The game wasn't exactly loaded for bear--its arsenal wasn't the most varied. I'm not just shooting blanks here--there are only 3 guns in this game that absolutely focuses on firearm-realism. I know the developers made this in 7 days, but it feels like they went off on a hair-trigger.TL;DR meme game get it on sale for 3.99 or less.			"

The sentries hitbox doesn't seem to get hit after multiple shots taken to the body, the movement and view control doesn't feel fluid at all.

												""Why don't you review a game?"" Said nobody ever. Reciever takes weapon handeling to a whole new level. The game has a fine art on making you learn how to use a gun from scratch. No PRESS X TO RELOAD title that gets shoved up your eyes, just learn by trial and error which is a nice change of pace. The idea seems cool and I wish they did that in more games. I only wish there was a bit more content in the game but it was made in only seven days so in my books thats an impressive feat. Give me a level editor in a game and in seven days and I can show you why you wasted your time on me. My level would be a mess of red barrels and AI that just stand in their place doing nothing.Overall Reciever gets a 6.5/10 A decent idea and fun to dabble around in for a small while. Just don't get your hopes up for Battlefield 5: No Glitch Edition.			"

												I don't remember how much I spent on this game, but if it was even 10 cents, I want my dime back.I'm all for a challenge, I'm all for dungeon diving through hoards of ♥♥♥♥ to find random lore that may or may not be important. I actually liked the system they implemented in having realistic magazines and weapon mechanics, but for all that, ♥♥♥♥ THIS game.Your character holds and shoots, whatever weapon you have, in a way that makes Call of Duty sniping, without steadying your scope, look like a good idea. This, being your only real method of survival against the flying enemies pretty much ensures that if there is more than one near you at any given time, you will die. Even if you're keen enough to deduce a way around enemies to get where you want to go, your character takes 6 foot falls like a toddler and you will probably end up dieing due to your apparent brittle bone disease.TLDR: Good ideas, poor execution.2/10			"

												This is a brilliant game, I have to say. It only has three guns, and it only has two types of enemies, and it isn't full random generation (Like games such as Starbound), more on that later. However, the game is so much fine. If you think you can come into this and hit R to reload and see your ammo in the bottomright corner, then NO. This game is much more than that. You have to move every individual piece of the gun by either holding or tapping a button, and if you get ONE thing wrong, by the time you go around a corner and attempt to fire the gun and you realise a drone is flying towards you with its taser on the ready, you're basically dead unless you're me.The game features permanent death. If you die, that's it, all of it is erased, but if you get hit by something ONCE, and that includes your own rebounded bullets (Or bullets you accidentally shot yourself in the foot with), you die. The game generates the world via procedural generation. It basically takes a load of giant buildings, adds some custom things to that giant building (Bullets, enemies, etc.) and then connects it to another giant building. All of the giant buildings have three floors. The game then spawns you in with a random weapon, a random amount of magazines, a random amount of loose ammunition, a random amount of ammunition in magazines, and a random state of your weapon, also it decides whether or not you will spawn with a flashlight and decides whether or not there is an enemy looking at you just as you spawn in to challenge you. You then tuck into a corner and get your weapon all ready. If you find yourself ejecting live rounds out of the side of the gun and then pulling the magazine out of the gun and dropping it off a building or similar, you should press the ? key to bring up a context-sensitive help menu. What this means is that it will show all the things you can do, however things recommended to get your weapon into recommended operation (As in, full auto off, ready to fire, safety off etc.) will be coloured white, and things not recommended will be a dull grey.The enemies in the game consist of only two types. There are actually four types, however two of them were cut for time restriction reasons (Or I assume), as this game was made in a 7 day FPS challenge. The two enemies in the game are the immobile machinegun turrets, which will now be called turrets, which spin around slowly with a blue light on them, and when they see you, the blue light turns yellow, it makes a beeping sound, it tracks you, and very shortly after the light turns red (to indicate ""THREAT DETECTED"") and then it opens fire. You have to either sneak past it or kill it if you want to advance in that direction most of the time, and the way you kill it is not just ""fire until it has no more HP"", you actually have to aim and shoot at something and if you shoot, for example, the camera, it will not be able to track you, or shoot at the magazine and it will not be able to chamber any more rounds, but that still means it can still fire one bullet, and I've heard that it tends to trick you, as in hold fire for a few moments to indicate you probably shot out the firing control, and then fire that one bullet straight into you, though no confirmation. There is a small chance for you to be able to hit a nonvital area on an enemy and shut it down, however most of the time absolutely NOTHING will occur when you do this.There is also these shock drones, which most of the community tends to call them taser bots, or just drones (However don't get into that habit - there is another type of drone that isn't in the game but may be in the game sometime in the future), however I will just be calling them shock drones from now on. They fly around, they find you, they then have the same lights on them as the turret, but then they engage, they rush at you, they try to taser you. These are flying death if you don't deal with them shortly after they spot you, they will even hide above or to the side of doorways and wait for you to come out so it has a tactical advantage, they are VERY intelligent but they have no fear of you, keep that in mind.The two unreleased types of enemies are: The mobile turret, which is basically a turret on wheels, it looks like it'd go quite slowly and would obviously have the inability to go up stairs, but it'd be terrifying. The other type is a drone with (what I assume is) a gun on it, which would be one of the most deadly enemies to ever exist if I think I know how they'd work, however they probably wouldn't fire nearly as fast as an immobile turret (Nor would the mobile turret) or be as accurate, the turrets are deadly accurate and will one shot kill you if you aren't moving, and even if you are moving and not running they still have a high chance of shooting you in one shot.I've told you alot of the game mechanics, you should get a basic idea of it, however I haven't told you about the story or the objective.The objective of the game relates to the story, therefor I have to give you a basic understanding of the story for you to fully understand the objective. I will try not to go into detail at all, the story will probably be much more advanced than I describe. Here we go: The story is basically an unknown force called ""the threat"" wants to neutralise humanity because of their ability to gain an ""awake"" status. There are two realities. Reality B (which is basically actual life) and reality A (Which is basically dreaming). An ""awake"" status is where you can exist fully in both realities, if so much as a single human achieves an Awake status, they would see beyond the horizon. The threat weakens the resistance to The Mindkill through media. Once they were sufficiently weak, The Threat striked and initiated the Mindkill (I forgot what it actually does, listen to the tapes in the game to figure it all out (I'm not good enough to listen to them all yet!)). The Receivers are able to resist the Mindkill, and as such have to be neutralised specially, so they are placed in this universe (The universe where Receiver takes place). There are supplies aswell as casette tapes around the area (Placed by I don't know! I haven't listened to the tapes in a long time). To achieve an awake status, Receivers must listen to the tapes repeatedly. The maximum amount of tapes required to achieve an Awake status is around 100, however the minimum is 11. There are 11 tapes. One of them is a Cleartape, which, to most people has nothing on it, however if you are close to the Awake status, you will hear things on it.To stop the Receivers from reaching the Awake status, the Threat ""Dreams"" killdrones (the enemies) to the Receivers' location, which then activate. Alot of this is not implemented such as the cleartape things or the repeatedly listening to tapes, but it will give you an idea of the storyline. You have to collect the 11 tapes before being killed.The game has mod support, and it has a quite popular mod which adds a firing range aswell as a few new weapons. There is something you should do with this mod to get you started, it's an exercise I created: Basically, you go to the firing range, activate the weapon selection, and then choose the first weapon in the list, and then hold L to reset your game. You then need to put the weapon into full operation order without making a single wrong action, this does not include pressing a button that does nothing, however it includes things like dropping the magazine. You have to repeatedly do this correctly and discharge the weapon a few times without making a single true mistake and as fast as possible, you have to set the amount of times you want to do a weapon, I recommend 3 to start out with, however after a while move it up to 6. If you perform one error, you need to hold L, reset your score, and then try again.Once you get to the limit, you then select the next weapon in the list- I'm out of space.			"

												More of a tech demo than a game. But the basic gameplay elements, controls, are rarely if never before seen. I have not encountered a game that makes you actually manipulate a firearm in the ways this game makes you. You are forced to load a magazine manually, load the mag into the gun, turn the safety off, rack the slide, then you can commence the shooting. Which is unweildy and hard to remember during high stress situations just like with real guns. Its a shame the gameplay is crap and it runs so poorly on my machine. Framerate bogs down for no reason for me and the enemys that fly are often going to kill you out of nowhere. Its all randomly generated, but more often than not those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will be in a ridiculous spot that its either easy to shoot them or you are dead before you could even know you were being attacked.That said these elements need to be taken and put into a survival horror game. Chance the controls for firearm manipulation to the mouse maybe or not, this game needs to be made.But unless you really like to see diffrent games and this ""game"" is on sale than don't buy it. Its not worth the price they have asked for it because its very very basic to the point of being a demo of gameplay for a much larger game. A larger game that dousn't exist.			"

												Receiver is a Rougelike gun handling simulator. You start out with 1 of 3 guns, a Glock (Don't know which one), a 1911, and a revolver (Again, no idea what kind.) And you shoot drones while collecting audio tapes. This game is good for those who want a challenge.			"

												The features list including ""ballistic modeling of ricochets"" isn't just hot air. I just fired a shot that caromed off a drone, a wall, and subsequently my skull.It's a really nifty and unique experiment in realistic gun operation; that said, it runs like crap, and the actual gameplay is about as balanced and varied as you'd expect of something made in 7 days where 6 days of that were probably spent on the mechanics of reloading your gun.

												Fascinating concept for a game. You actually have to manually operate your weapon. The game is procedurally generated with regards to the placement of enemies, ammunition, and the objective collectibles. Your success can depend on what weapons, equipment and however much ammo you start with, all of which are random. You can start with anything from a .44 with a dozen rounds, or a 9mm with three measley bullets. The gunplay is satisfying and tactile, and the game is arranged such that you won't need to do the dozen things involved with operating a gun in a hurry. The pace is slow, and you have as much time as you like to get ready. It's possible to get up a list of keyboard commands on screen to help you know what to press and what does what. In all, a great concept, very well designed. Hopefully we see more like this in the future, with more scenarios perhaps, or some sort of multiplayer deathmatch. Very good price for a couple of hours fun. Definitely pick it up, especially if you catch it on sale.			"

												More of a tech demo than a game. But the basic gameplay elements, controls, are rarely if never before seen. I have not encountered a game that makes you actually manipulate a firearm in the ways this game makes you. You are forced to load a magazine manually, load the mag into the gun, turn the safety off, rack the slide, then you can commence the shooting. Which is unweildy and hard to remember during high stress situations just like with real guns. Its a shame the gameplay is crap and it runs so poorly on my machine. Framerate bogs down for no reason for me and the enemys that fly are often going to kill you out of nowhere. Its all randomly generated, but more often than not those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will be in a ridiculous spot that its either easy to shoot them or you are dead before you could even know you were being attacked.That said these elements need to be taken and put into a survival horror game. Chance the controls for firearm manipulation to the mouse maybe or not, this game needs to be made.But unless you really like to see diffrent games and this ""game"" is on sale than don't buy it. Its not worth the price they have asked for it because its very very basic to the point of being a demo of gameplay for a much larger game. A larger game that dousn't exist.			"

												Very interesting game. Moderately difficult gun mechanics. Interesting grim and cyberpunkish ambiance despite it's low-budget nature. Rogue-like, enemies hitting you means instant-death, hence very challenging, I couldn't beat the game yet. Things often go smoothly for some while, where knowing the buttons halfway through is enough to know. More often than not you'll find yourself facing multiple enemies at once - hovering shock drones that hunt you down, and stationary sentry turrets - with only a few bullets left in your magazine, choosing to either fight or run. This can put you under some stress and make you panic. It's where the wheat is probably seperated from the chaff in this game. As it would work in real-life I assume when you not know your gun inside out.			"

												Receiver is a very intresting game. Although the world lacks color, and dispite it's limitations, it's got plenty of action. The game has an unusual feature that you don't see in most FPS's. There's no push-button reloading. You literally have to do each step manually to load your weapon, be it a 1911, a Glock, or a good old fasioned revolver. Dispite how much work it sounds to be, it really adds to the experince.It also includes a small help feature, which gives suggestions to new players on what the need to do to prep the gun.This game is well worth the money you spend on it.

												Very interesting concept for a video game. The player is in control of ever piece of the gun and needs to quickly prepare to fire in case of attack by the many turrets hidden around the randomly generated map's corners. It is a very difficult game that will truly make you think of when is the best time to fire your weapon. A good 20-30 minutes of fun.			"

												8/10This game has a few great elements in it:The requirement for accuracy, no rambo heroics with an M60! There is very limited ammo. The game is focused around handguns, I always think it seems soo much cooler to be a spy rather than a soldier (slip that shooter under the trenchcoat and blend in. Lastly the technical focus and 'expressive' mechanics a few more buttons to press to fiddle with the guns.World of guns disassembly, has better models and more detail, but is useful if you want to play with the colt more [and the simulation is free :) ]. BUT Reciever seems a better game. "

												Created by a team of 4 in a week for a FPS game design challenge, Receiver revolves around realistic gun mechanics in a (very) randomly generated world. Despite being an FPS game, the gameplay focuses more on actually controlling and preparing your firearm and stealth rather than on modern ""realistic"" cover shooting concepts. Reloading magazines manually,  emptying revolver chambers, and juggling your inventory are actually all very enjoyable, even more so when you manage to learn the controls. The randomization is very strong, starting you off with one of three random handguns, a random amount of ammo, and occasionally a mag light. Room objects, enemies, pickups, and lighting all are randomized, making you want to explore. However, the randomization also causes issues; one game I spawned right next to a taser drone with 3 bullets. Overall, I think this is worth picking up just to experience it, especially with the low asking price.			"
