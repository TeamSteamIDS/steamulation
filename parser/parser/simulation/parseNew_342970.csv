Early Access Review
								Since I bought Survivors I have seen so much work done to it that it is not even the same game. The developer is so hands on with updates, balancing, fixes, adding content and news of whats to come. I have played enough hours now to say that I am happy to be part of this early access game. Not to mention the addition of cards the other day, and achievments coming soon. It makes me a bit sad to see someone playing this game for five minutes and giving it a bad review. Survivors doesn't deserve that, it deserves better. It is fun to look forward to new buildings, and play changes week after week. There are issues sometimes, but it is always worked on fast.			"

								In its current state I'd say avoid it if you're looking for an in-depth ""survival god-game"".  You place a few structures and then let the game play itself, or try to as the AI seems extremely random and if it tends to bump into something then it'll interact with it.  The finished product may be more refined and polished, and the developer is relatively active with frequent (and major) updates, so keep an eye on it.I'd personally like to see the villagers have more freedom in building, where you can designate areas for types of buildings  to build, and they sort of construct their own little town based on population and demand, a sort of low-scale Sim City with more resource management.  and I'm sure at some point the game will offer a step-by-step simple tutorial for first time players to learn the basics of needed resources, but I imagine that'll come along later when more features are added so it doesn't have to be constantly revised.

								This is a very light ""god-game"" that will task you with growing a civilization.  The play style and overall theme is similar to ""Retro-Pixel Castles"", albeit a more simplistic version. You don't actually control your subjects, but you can construct houses, build wheat fields, and so on.  My biggest gripe is the lack of a zoom feature...from what I told, such a feature would require the developer to recode the game.  I admittedly know little about programming, so I don't know how much of an undertaking that really is. Time controls would be welcome too as most of your time will be spent watching and waiting for your subjects to collect the resources they need for you to keep expanding.  It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's not a bad diversion for its current price tag.

								**Key was donated from the developer to review**   Introduction            I would like to start off by saying Survivors isn’t for everyone and needs some polish to it, but I enjoyed the time I played it. Survivors basically a god game. When you start playing the game, the main menu only has three options (Start game, Load Game, and Exit Game). There is no option for a tutorial, or options. Once you start a game, there are tons of buttons and options, but no explanation on what you are exactly supposed to do. Once you figure out what everything does and how to play the game is fun, yet extremely unforgiving. I believe this game would be a 100% recommendation if it had a tutorial. Without one this game isn’t for everyone. 	-HiPFiRED   Pros                 Fun gameplay Completely Customization  Cool Artistic Style Awesome Dev Support   Cons               No Tutorial  Limited Menu Limited Options Menu No Animations, or Polish   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Basic InformationTitle:  Pixel SurvivorsDevelopers:  Sachonski, Renamilanesi & Sith Publisher:  Patagoniart Gaming Studio Genre:  2D strategyGeneral ImpressionThe combined efforts of three individual developers has brought forth a compelling indie title (with the help of the Steam community, successfully Greenlit as well). It shares some similarities with a game I previously reviewed, Retro-Pixel Castles. They are both reminiscent of old school god games, focusing on the survival and prosperity of a small community over which you have full control. Resource management is as vital as the initial defense of the settlement, since your planning skills shall be put to the test by both the natural and supernatural occurrences. I found it lacking in the visual effects department though the sounds had enough diversity to them. Still, I could not overlook the dim-witted villager AI which forced me to stop focusing on the future building planification, just to babysit them and make sure they don’t starve to death before the zombies get them. Apparently even out of Early Access, there are still some pathfinding issues lingering on. While Pixel Survivors is not more expensive than the other title I mentioned above, it does have slightly less assets and gameplay mechanics to it which in my eyes at least, doesn’t seem to warrant the 10 dollar price tag it has outside of Steam Sales. Most of the problems I stated previously can be fixed with a patch or two. It’s up to you, the potential buyer and player, if the game is worth your money and time. As a subgenre, god games in general can be lots of fun provided you have the pacience to learn all the ropes.Strong Points+ Customization options aplenty.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Slightly overpriced.- Micromanagement is crucial because of the shoddy AI.- Lack of an in-depth tutorial will deter new players to this subgenre.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

Early Access Review
								* The game i played was supplied by developer* well what to say what to say? ----- pros - surprisingly deep- a lot of creative freedom_charming graphics -------- cons - not very noob friendly - unforgiving- no real animation Well when you first start the game you are presented with a blank patch of sea, what you do from here is shape your island. To shape your island you use mana, this mana replenishes over time (or as far as i can tell it does it seems very inconsistent). But i will return to mana later in the review.Starting with the good, the game offers you complete creative freedom in how your island is shaped where things are placed,and how big your population can get.  But mana is depleted with every tile of land you add. On every tile there will randomly be coal iron trees or a chicken. These are but a few of the resources you will use. Over all i think the mana for land situation is pretty good because as your population grows,and your production power as does your land mass. Because of this creativity steam sharing to share islands would be amazing.When you first start the game you really don't have much control, and this is jarring. In all honesty for the first 20  minutes it felt like i could do nothing to affect my creation. But after discovering the other mana ability aura, which allows you to lead your people for 10 seconds at the cost of 10 mana. When i first started playing i hated this but now i see that it does add strategy and depth of resource management, but i still am not a fan of having the cost be that high. The graphics are cute and simplistic, very minimalist. Over all i like them they fit the situation. But animation is pretty much non existent. When you collect any resources you just walk by i would like at least a pick up animation. But even without it will suffice.There is no tutorial in this game. There are not any hints on how to acquire materials or what order is recommended. To add to this to increase or resupply your population you need a male and female if all of one gender dies there is currently no way to get that gender back, So that is a literal death sentence for that save. Even placing your buildings in the wrong order can cause restart after restart. over all 7/10 i will be coming back to this one			"

								I'll start off by saying that I am glad I only spent $1 on this game. It's not that the game is bad, but it's also not good. As it sits, the game is a nice little time waster. There is still plenty of work to be done, but the developer(s) seem to be very involved in the game and listen to the community. In fact, when I first started playing the game there were a few serious bugs that were fixed within 15-20 minutes after someone posted about them on the forums.In the game you create tiles of land that each generate a random basic resource: Stone, Lumber, and Food. Your only limit to creating more land is your mana; which is currently disabled, so you have an infinite amount of mana to work with for the time being. You start off the game with two villagers who spawn on one of the tiles you place. The villagers than gather these resources and you put down plots for buildings which the villagers than build. However, the erratic movement of your villagers reminds me of the ball from 'Pong'. They bounce around the map, collecting the resources they happen to pass through, and only work on a building if they touch it. So having a small map in the beginning means your villagers will actually do the tasks you want them to do, but also give you access to less resources. There is also a feature called Aura which allows you to direct your villagers to a single point at the cost of some mana. It can be frustrating at time to use and when mana is turned back on you'll end up spending more mana on moving your villagers around than on expanding the map.And even if you do everything correctly, be prepared for your villagers to die frequently. I've built houses for my villagers, farms so they can have food, and a tailor shop so they can have warm clothes; yet my villagers always seem to freeze and starve to death. The penalty for a villager dying is a good idea on paper, but it doesn't seem to work out very well in practice. Whenever a villager dies the number of zombies goes up by one. At night, that many zombies will spawn in and attack your villagers. The reason that it doesn't work out to well, is because the zombies move just as erratically as your villagers and they end up walking right past one another. Once the sun rises, the remaining zombies disapear and the number resets to zero.Would I recommend this game? If it were still $1 and someone I knew was really interested in it, I would recommend it. But that's not the case; there is plenty of potential and the game can only get better. As it sits right now, I would not recommend it. I'll continue to play it from time to time, especially when new updates come out for it.			"

								I have over 90 hours on this game and I want to state that the DEV/S have been doing a fantastic job with tracking down and fixing bugs when they are reported.  It is a sweet little building game that doesn't require being a hardcore gamer to enjoy.  Most people that complain are people that try to build too fast expecting the little people/planks to rush around getting everything done right away.    DEV/S are rewriting the tutorial and will have that ready soon enough. #1 You need tools to keep the planks doing their jobs.#2 You need mines and a forge to make tools.#3 You need livestock (chickens atm) to gather food and to be butchered to make fabric.#4 You need tailor shops where they will go to make cloth from the fabric.#5 To make seeds and food you plant wheat fields, then your planks gather extra seeds so you can make barley and trees for extra food.#6 If your stoage for some items is at max your planks will not be able to gather that item.It is an easy game to learn if you go slow enough and let the planks do their jobs.Just remember the DEV/S here actually do listen and are trying to fix the bugs, just give them a chance.

												Did the whole Tutorial but failed to stay alive on Normal dificulty after 5 tries... I did like the game and my suggestions would be to improve the mana visualization, maybe incluse it around the resources UI and give quicker acces to the spells. Turn the ""aura"" spell into a placeable beacon that make your settlers favor the designated area for exploration and gathering. Add a progress bar on the chicken pens, crops, mine, etc to be able to see when resources will be produced (even if it's only visible when hovering over the resource).Stone and food were my problems, maybe add more stone to the land generation or lower the stone needed in the most basic buildings.Again, nice game and keep up the good work~			"

								So far I really like this game. It's a simple game, but it's not pretending to be more than it is. If you normally need a tutorial it can be difficult to figure out at first but once you learn it, it's not bad. The hardest part is figuring the ratio of certain buildings and such to the number of villagers you have, and the best places to put them. there was just an update that changes the way it plays a little, But from what I've seen the developer is very active in his(?) community. I've seen there posts and replies on many screenshots and forum discusions. i don't know what their plans are for the future of the game is, but I believe they try their best to please their players. The game as is is a decent, casual, time waster. I got it on sale, but I feel like the full price is worth it for the kind of game it is. 9/10 -for tricking me into playing it for 4 hours straight when I only meant to play it for an hour.			"

								Very fun game.  I really enjoyed it.  I will say, the tutorial, is meh...it kind of gives you the basics, but at first I completely lost my first few colonies.  Kind of hard to find information, so pretty much figured it out myself...which in itself was fun when I finally got it...and have established a colony of 50+ ppl, on my way to 100.Of course I do have a few complaints, and hopefully they get taken care of in beta:1.  Slows down.  I put it in the fastest speed, and I find that it slows then picks up, and repeats.  I was playing it for a couple of hours in a row though, so, haven't tried to see if it goes away after a load, but hopefully that whole issue gets fixed.2. Placement of objects...I found for putting down most items you had to click the UI, then click where you want to put it, then if you wanted a 2nd, you had to click the ui again then place it again.  Wish I could select, and just pop as many down as I want until i cancel it (would be nice if right mouse button would deselect current building item...kind of how some other games do it).3. In some respects I wish I could assign colonists to wood/stone/coal/iron/etc gathering.  Because it's annoying seeing your guys gathering more than the current limit you have of say wood, when you are severly low on rocks or something else.  The guide tool helps a bit, but would like to either have a smarter AI, or some way to actually assign a certain number of colonists to certain tasks.Really great game.			"

			#pixelsurvivors http://store.steampowered.com/app/342970/ Add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/ + The gameplay is quite addictive. Very similar to the game ""Banished"".		

+ The gameplay is quite addictive. Very similar to the game ""Banished"". Essentially you are building up a village. You control what the villagers build, and must strike a balance between population, resources, and food. You must also deal with other obstacles like the changing seasons, and must provide everything your villagers may need. + One thing I found really interesting is that you are actually expanding your islands landmass as you grow your village which is a very interesting concept and makes you want to continue to grow larger.+ It's very entertaining to watch all of your peasants scury around all over doing a ton of different tasks that all play important rolls in the survival of your town.+ Challenging... it's very easy to let your population get out of hand. Before you know it everyone will starve to death, and if you don't have gravestones they will all turn into zombies and eat the remaining villagers.- The graphics are a bit too minimal. The UI is pretty small, and you mainly just watch your villagers go from place to place, and never really get to see them do much of anything. - For some reason just a slight increase in population can make your food stock plummet causing your entire village to go hungry and possibly even die out without enough time to even start building anything to help.

								This could be interesting, but I really have no clue what I'm doing here. Too many options, too little intro/tutorial/help (there isn't any). My village keeps dying. For example: It's not clear how chickens work; I assumed I should keep them around, and butcher them when I need more food or when there's too many, but apparently I should just butcher them all at once? And setting a level determines how fast they're killed, not how many to keep?			"

Early Access Review
								Very retro game, but a bit unstable, and it doesn't quite do justice to its name and what it implies.It is a very simple drawn god sim, where you first create land in an infinate oceanic environment, where then 2 survivors are added. Then its just a matter of building houses, farms, mines and whatnot to facilitate the production of resources needed to feed the inhabitants and the expansion of your settlement.Like I said, the graphics are very simple, as is the sound / music. As is the interface, but I would even go further than just calling it simple, as it is lacking as well; Some resources are simply not shown and others are insufficiently elaborated.The help gives you some idea, but a lot of functionality simply doesn't seem to be in the game, such as the upgrading of buildings. I got 1 building to try to upgrade, followed by a game crash...so...ya...there's that...Might be something for the collectors out there that want a simple island editor, which is all it seems to be (again, you need to actually create the island yourself), for a 5 minute break at work or something, because that is really all it is good for...It seems like a project for a beginning developer (and one that has a LOOONG way to go), which is in itself not a bad thing. But maybe it could use some more work, or not be made available to the public, or at least not Steam. This may not be the right platform to publish this early work on. There are a lot of communities and platforms out there that this sort of thing is great for, but Steam users generally expect a little bit...more...			"

EDIT3: This is a real positive- Game has a nice design, music, etc.- Has potential.Cons:- Unreliable AI, especially path-finding and movement. They get stuck in every possible corner.- Bugs. Big, fat bugs.EDIT3: I cleared everything (problem list) after pros and cons. Game's really made progress! I now recommend it, give it a try, but don't expect perfection!			"

								I was a little reluctant at first to purchase this game, but for the price I decided why not. After loading the game up it was a bit difficuly understanding how things functioned and what tasks you need to do in order to keep your colony alive. Once I found a routine the game then crashed here and there. The developers did patch this which I loved seeing. For the price of this game I would recommend getting it as long as the developers keep advancing it. I do have to say that once you get a self sustaning community which took me about 25 min then the game runs on auto-pilot.			"

Early Access Review
								WARNING NOW: This game is in early access and is incredibly raw, but the developer releases a lot of patches and has been updating it rather quickly. Nevertheless, this game is still in very early beta.As far as world builder games go, there are various games to choose from, from Populous to Dwarf Fortress, and as far as city builder games go, there are a ton of those, from SimCity to Banished, very rarely do games try to do both.Survivors is a game in which you play as a god type figure and build an island and start a village on said island. You start with a couple of small homes and slowly build a giant society, with chickens, barley fields, knights and so on. As far as difficulty goes, this is decent for a city builder. It starts out relatively forgiving and kind, but by the time you have a couple of little pixelated soldiers ready to defend their village, the game starts giving you enemies to attack you and gradually gets harder and harder the bigger your village gets. It's pretty tame and shouldn't really mess up anyone.Graphics are kinda meh, simple and small, made to not eat up RAM. The in-game music is also pretty good, similar to Banished style of music and not too annoying, a bit loud yes, but not sandpaper rubbed on chalkboard annoying.As for cons, there are some pretty obnoxious cons to the game. The main one is the fact this game is in early access. The game is raw, like fresh meat raw, it's glitchy, underfinished, and crashes at random. It's raw. However, the developer is working a lot harder than other early access title devs. While some devs just dump their games onto early access so they can rake in as much money as possible before getting shut down, the dev for Survivors has been putting out updates very frequently, which is good. Also, the price for this game is a lot nicer than other Early Access games. A whopping $3.99. Not a lot in comparison with other game titles on Steam now is it.TL:DR: Survivors is a promising early access city builder/god game that has some really good ideas behind it and has a very dedicated game developer behind it as well. While at the moment the game is incredibly bare bones, it has enough potential to be a good game in the future, and it's only $4.			"

								I find this game very fun,It's the kind of game you play when your bored or having a rough day and just want to play god for a bit.And though there are many features that have issues and bugs are sprining up there are easy ways around them.My personal least favorite thing is the totorial it barely even brushes the top of what this game about and the stuff it does tell you is very vauge.My personal suggestion to the game makers is to stop adding new stuff and work on the stuff they already have (AI sucks)this would make it not only easier for new players to enjoy the game and really learn the game mechanics but it would make a better experience for those you have hundreds of hours on record(the only reason i'm saying that is becuase i got confused on what the number of chikens meant and wound up putting it to 0 in other words i whiped out my entire population of chikens, people died, thought fish might help, got to point with only two peeps when total could have been 14, zombies came... soldiers = 0 yeah that kinda sucked but now i know betta! ^^*pun intended*)(Game is in beta)so bugs aside lets get on to all the cool, cute, awesome stuff in this game~God Gamei mean who doesn't love these????????~Simple ControlsIt's a click game...~Cute CharactersEven the zombies are put in this cute art style!~VerietyTons of stuff to do~Survival SandboxPretty much...~Cheaponly $4 for all this content? sign me up!~BetaIt's only in beta.

												IF you are going for the most casual boring game to whidle away time at work, then go for this. Or a facebook game. Or an idle game that is free on kongregate or something. Here.... eh... it is slightly better. Once you figure out the formula and how to get things started, it is easy. Too easy. Boringly easy...Formula:1. Make sure winter doesn't happen before you get your basic setup done.2. make a tailor and a mine.3. get some chicken coops, prefferably up to 6.4. Get a forester.5. get 2 more mines and a forge.Congragulations, you now need to watch as things go sooo slowly, and you cannot lose until you want to increase your pop. Once you want to increase your pop6. Get 2 boats.7. Get agriculture.8.sawmill/mines/take FOREVER to research things even on x3 speed.Once you do this you basically wait to win.Aside from that, the game has a ton of crashes or just dumb AI. I have had to create so much land to get people out. Make a square. A simple square and you should be fine 90% of the time... but 10% of the time your people will just die. Due to quite a few glitches I have not beaten the game. I have gotten to this point where I am fine, going to get the portal soon no problem, even had it a few times, and then all the land vanishes. People instantly die since they stop getting food. 50 undead pop up from no where and my citzens all ran toward them. Leming tactics is not impressive.All in all, not worth the waste of time, but that is just me since I want a bit more to my games.			"

								Survivors is an oddity and a throw back to times past.The God game genre historically has been a mixed bag of either wonderous gems or utter train wrecks with very few finding the middle ground.Survivors, though still in early access has amused me, it's made me remember simpler days of gaming and it has made me smile.It is certainly rough at the moment, and it has it's fair share of bugs, but as the Dev is so very active you can just pick out a glimmer of a gem underneath, patch by patch it shines a little brighter.It's never going to be a cult hit, but as of this moment I can say it has fully surpassed in terms of enjoyment another more high profile & fully funded God game made by one of the industries stalwarts. I'll be back with an update as this game continues it's development, a thumbs up from me.			"

								TL;DR- The game needs a lot of work before I can recommend it.I'm afraid I can't give this game a recommendation. While it has a lot of promise, it needs far more work to actually be a game I would suggest to a friend to buy. It reminds me a lot of other, similar games but lacks a key feature that those city-builder/survival games have and that is a motivation to the AI controlled villagers.In a game like Banished or Dwarf Fortress, which I am greatly reminded of, the villagers are outside of your control, but they have various jobs or tasks that they prioritize which allows for you to create a thriving village without having to hope that your villagers bump into the things you need them to bump into, as is the case with this game.It's possible that the randomly roaming villagers is actually intended to be a feature and that you should design your cities around that, but in my opinion that is a flawed premise and does not make for enjoyable gameplay.

												Pixel Surivors is a simple & mostly a short strategy/simulation-game.Dont expect to much from the game and you will have a great game for now and then.Pro:  pixel graphics short strategy/simulation game villager turns into zombies when they die wont play it longer as like a hour, great diversion steamcards and achivementsCon: stupid AI is still stupid :D pixel graphics (some wouldnd like it) wont play it longer as like a hour, miss some longtime motivation if you see a zombie the game is nearly game over if you have no recources Rate: 8/10 What i miss in the game: would like to see some more animals like deers or somthing no tree spawn without a building more ways to protect against zombiesDont expect a long on going Strategy-Game, for that its just to simple if you mastered it once(its first really hard even on easy). But its a great game if you just want to look at a village and see how its growing as you wish.I played since the Beta about 20 hours. The progress of the game headed forward and its now beautiful and mostly a stable game. Since its release you cant build everthing from the start you have to research new building and a more efficence way for you villager to gather recources. But so the game got some more deeper interaction and a long time motivation.			"

Review For Pixel SurvivorsReview by: DEHUPros :- Simple graphics- Lots of buildings to buildCons :- The Survivors are stupid and have problems getting resources and insted just walk around and doing nothing.- Game could have been improved more.Review :Pixel Survivors is a simple survival game.You start with that you have to create land, that cost 10 mana for each square of land you create.When you create some land, 2 survivors spawn and start collecting resources.You have to build farms, livestock, ect to get food to survive. You can also build houses to get more villagers.You can build Tailors, libraries, and much more for improve the survival of your village.Tailors needs Cotton and Leather to craft clothes, Blacksmith needs stone and wood to make tools, and so on.You can build graves for your villagers when they die so they don't lay around on the ground, and if they do they turn into zombies and you are pretty ♥♥♥♥ed if that happens early game.The problem with the game is that your survivors are quite stupid. They do fine in the start with collecting of resources, but after a while they just walk around and only focus on food, even tho you have max food insted of looking for resources.It could have been better and it needs more improvement of the AI.I know this is an Early Access game, but i can't recommend it.Additional Infomation :Developer: Sachonski , Renamilanesi , SithPublisher: PatagoniartGenre: Casual, Indie, SimulationReleased on Steam 21.

												This game has a lot of potential, but isn't quite there yet. The tutorial is buggy and resets before you're finished, and was written by someone without a solid grasp on the english language. The mouse click isn't where it is poiting, and though you can afford it doesn't always place when you click. There need to be significant balancing going on, had one game where my villagers got a plague and all died because the library to research a shaman is ungodly expensive.It's not expensive, and if you have the patience this could be a cheap fun god-sim in the not-so-distant future.

I'd be surprised if the rating weren't good.There is a decent amount of content even in it's current state. The game is bug-free from what I've experienced so far. I have no real complaints. Some may whine about there not being tons of options for video/audio settings but come on, it's early access and it's not a massive company behind it, no but a single person is doing everything. So cut him some slack. Enjoy the game, and have fun.Overall I'd give this game 9/10, needs a few tweaks such as a settings menu and a few small changes.As for an early access score though 10/10. Very strong potential here.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo, let me first say that I typically adore sandboxy village-building sort of games to an inhuman level.  I'm usually so biased towards them that they could literally be sucking my soul out from my tear ducts and I would love them anyway.  That said, I cannot play this game.  I want to!  I really do!  But right now, I just can't.Mainly, the issues for me boil down entirely to UI / UX so the issues are completely fixable for the future.  So that's good!  But as the game stands right now, the UI makes me want to kick puppies.  It's clunky, slow to respond, and hard to find what I want in.  And it makes it hard to see when the game is glitching and/or doing something it shouldn't be.The game does have potential but if you are looking for something that doesn't feel like sheer work to play, this is not the game for you.  Hopefully that changes!			"

It has a lot of potential but so far none of that is met, like seriously the game is incredibly boring, ugly, and just.. overall pretty bad, I'd recommend a different god simulator game, unless you wanna stare at trees vanish and nothing else happen.

I loved banished and I know I would love this game if it didn't feel like every game is a gamble. When you start a new game you never know what resources will be available and even if you do have a good assortment there is almost no guarantee that your ♥♥♥♥nut populace will give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ They just gather things to gather regardless of what they need. I had people starve to death while collecting wood even though chickens and wheat were harvestable.

Until then, avoid this game no matter how cheap. It should be free until they fix their♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Not sure how to vote for this one. It's great idea and all. But it's stupid to find out that your population died because they couldn't just grab that food from butcher few steps away. AI definitely needs to improve... Now it's just guys going random direction and collencting stuff they find along a way. I will change this review after fix.List of bugs I encountered:After saving and loading fastforwarding doesn't workAfter saving and loading storage limits resets (to 200) - also I would recommed counting these from building actually builded rather then in own variables which can be lost when saving (obviously) and changed by cheat engine (for example) - I just feel it's safer (I'm also just working with what I think is true... maybe it is already that way, but then I don't get how can I change my housing space via cheat engine and why I have only total of 200 space in 10 storages after loading)After saving and loading all resources disappears (leading my game to the point where I'm defending my village against 500 zombies)			"

								Fun: 7 | Plot: 1 | CTRL: 6 | GFX: 7 | SFX: 6 | Stable: 3 | Replay: 9+ Fun little island town builder+ Charming minimalist graphics~ In Beta and fixes and additions will only improve it~ No tutorial but easy to figure out- Bugs and freezes galoreMore of a goldfish bowl than a city builder. This is an ant farm where you supply the infrastructure and the citizens take advantage in random fashion. It's oddly rewarding. Most games currently end by stability issues prematurely stopping play.. but that's beta for you.Conclusion: 6/10. Great start, hope it continues.			"

												This is an excellent game. I started to play it when it was still getting most of the bugs worked out. It was frustrating at times due to the learning curve and it does tend to punish the player for growing their village too fast. But for the most part it is a great game. On top of the good and rewarding game play, it was nice to know that the developer is very active in the discussion boards for the game. When ever I had run into a bug or mechanic that I did not quite understand or did not seem to work right, he was quick in posting a response to help figure out the issue or help. All in all it is a great game all around. I would recommend that if you like games that offer a good challenge and is a little off the beaten path, then grab this one and give it a good try.			"

								Fun Game. Once you get to know the game and how to set up your village up. The updates are often so thats good too. The game has came far from when I first played this. Also Should add more achievements to the game.Also would be cool if this game is added to IOS for the iPad. This came is great and is getting better by the time. Keep up the good work and hopefully this will be on the IOS market. This is a fun game to pass time. Survivors has became even more fun with the more updates from when I first played this game.			"

								Don't get me wrong. The gameplay is ok for a survival game like this, but after you figured out how to deal with the game it's more like:""Ok, let's get some more citizens ... oh no, food is missing. Let's produce some more... ok, now you don't have any clothes.   Here are some cotton fields. Oh wait, i don't have enough wood at the moment, because for some reason I need wood to build crop fields"" 10 minutes later ""Ok, here are your cotton fields. Now I can build more houses, but first I need more wood"" and so on.So after a while it gets boring and annoying, because it is really only survival part, without being creative like in other survival games, where you can build a city with individual houses for example.If you still want to buy it, then keep in mind that this game is only good enough to fill up like 1 or 2 hours.

YouTube™ Video: Survivors - Quicky Look ( EARLY ACCESS GAMEPLAY ) 

			Views: 656		

			Gameplay and first impressions of Survivors. An early access title released today on steam. A town builder with graphics that make me think about Minecraft with a top down perspective.		

The game is quite simple.You create land after which people and chickens (Damn there are a lot of chickens) start to roam the freshly created land.After this you must build shelter and other buildings that help you'r villagers grow and live.These building include chicken pens, mines, fishing boats(which at the moment turn into wormholes) and fields of wheat and such.Villagers collect these resources and build the buildings when the required resources are available.Graphics are very simple and very Minecrafty.Personally I dislike games that mimic the look of Minecraft, because even if the intention is not there, it feels like the dev/devs are trying to blatantly copy it.It indeed is in early access so there isn't a lot in it, but at least it works.I still would't recommend buying it until it leaves the early access if you can wait.Do check the video if you wish to see some gameplay of it!

Early Access Review
 Disclaimer: This game was provided by the developers and all my opinions are based in the early access stage of the game.Pixel Survivors is a very nice strategy video game wich reminds me the classic Age of Empires, but this time in 8 bits! The idea is to grow up a little civilization on an island and avoid to let them die. Strategy games are not my favorite ones but I like this one because it's not so complicated like others and it's fun. The game has a very intuitive interface, anyone could play this game with no need of reading a lot of tutorials. In some way seems to be too basic the tutorial, but for me is just what I need, of course always could be improved. The rest? Well, it's practise. Also has a complexity, maybe I'm not good in this kind of games but I lost the population several times and only once I could reach 10 people. I sail trying an army! I hate the winter. Kills all the chickens! So, you have to carry on the economy of the game, provide shelter and food. I suggest expanding in a foresting tower, a barn, and a chicken pen at the beginning, because you'll need a lot of stone and wood for houses then, wheat, barley, etc. Try to focus on the economic balance, and don't forget the medicinal herbs and.. the graves! Yes, you have zombies here, and that's fun. The use to kill the population if you don't have a proper army.What I didn't like... Well, is too small maybe, the island, the tiny houses, but that's a personal looking about the art. The idea was about retro 8 bits. The population grows so slow, seems to. The music... It's quite low, I don't ask for heavy metal but something different, maybe something that changes the course of the game and not so sad. I noticed, but maybe this is sort of bug, the AI doesn't work well. I'm trying the hard mode and the of the guys refuses to go and do something or he's on strike I don't know. apart from that, as I said I liked the game. Hope you can improve with my comments!! Thanks :)I leave a review of the game (in Spanish).

Early Access Review
								tl;dr Don't get this game get Banished instead.I don't write reviews mainly because I tend to be very neutral on what makes a good game but for this I felt that I had to write one warning people of just how bad the game currently is.For starters you have to build your own island for your villagers which isn't a bad thing except you can't build more than one or else your villagers can't travel to the others which makes this feature kind of pointless. Another thing you can't do is build a circular island that’s 1 block wide as villagers will just pace back and forth on corners even if there's a viable path in front of them.Next off you have the villagers themselves which are the dumbest things in existence, they wander aimlessly in a zigzag pattern rarely getting resources unless they happen to bump into them making building structures near impossible. You do have little flags you can place to make villagers move but once they reach the flag they wander off and don't collect the resources. Another problem with the flags is the fact you have two flag colors red and blue, red of soldiers and blue for workers though only 1 flag can be placed at a time and if you have no soldiers or no workers you can get stuck with a red or blue flag on your island without the ability to remove it.This game though in early access shouldn't even be here, I wouldn't even consider this game to be out of the alpha phase yet which is pretty sad. I paid 99 cents for it on sale and still asked for a refund because I'd rather keep my dollar then support this game as is.I will admit that this game might get better over time but seeing as this is just utter garbage right now it has put me off of it forever and will never pick it back up.I suggest getting Banished instead if you want a good god-like game.

								I enjoyed the base concept of the game and its a good start. I feel the AI needs a little better priority system. Yeah, main issue is AI priority, cats can be a little bit more organized. Like when a person gets cold they should go for the tailor instead of wandering around away from it. Or if a person is really injured they will start moving towards the closet shaman hut. There are a lot of bugs like buildings covering up people and they get trapped in them or suddenly my 200 tool supply drains to 0 as every tool breaks on a single use. I do look foward to more updates and it seems like they keep coming. This will be a good little game and its off to a great start. Keep up the great work!Update:There has been lots of changes and I still come back to play the game! The Devs are doing a great job of updateing and squishing bugs.			"

								I can't think of a more simplistic game, from the graphics to the limited options you have in it. Yet it's still super entertaining to play this and watch your little civilization grow. The devs are working hard to fix every bug and performance issue and boy, do they deliver good results with every patch! My positive review goes for this game because of the hard work they are puting into it, making this more and more fun with every update.			"

								It is very entertaining watching you little settlement prosper in to a hamlet. The game is early access, it's like a simplified ""Banished"".Pros~-Custom town building-Custom land making-Simple Resource/Food collecting-complimenting music-Humble vintage sprite artCons~-EARLY ACCESS, you'll have to wait a while for the complete game-GUI icons are hard to see on my 1080p Monitor-Tutorial is a bit lacking-Needs a more descriptive help barGamescore: 8/10			"

								Either made by the guy who made banished or basically a low end copy of banished it's only worth the sale price but it's fun for like an hour, not $10 worth but fun, I guess if you wanna support the creator/s buy the game in hopes that they will make a better version. I liked it but it's not going to last you a long time.			"

								This game has many pros and cons as it is still in development... but seeing as that is the case it is reasonable to say this game is pretty good. Few bugs here and there which is usually solved by a quick save, quit and load. For those who struggle in the game they may have expanded too fast or not considered the farms and medicinal huts.Pros:Simple quick gameCan guide survivors with tool (Aura)Buildings are upgradablePretty realistic where tools break clothes wear out etc.Cons:Somewhat buggy (usually fixed by save quit then load)Pinball survivors (bounce around interacting with the things they come into contact with)Help button is a bit small i didn't notice until i got most of the games conceptsKeeping in mind it is still in development i believe this game has a bright future			"

												it was ok...My biggest problem was the tutorial to simple and seemed quickly done.(didnt explain fishing AT ALL, its just like .. ok at the end of all this you only need arch and ocult 3 to beat it then press a button 50 x ) LOL the dev  has a lot of work on his hands i look forword to see what this game becomes2 1/2 star \5****UPDATE 14/3/16Since the update the game had gotton worse. The ""people"" still just bounce around doing nothing  unless you constantly use aura. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR a DEV whom gives a damn .TBH ive paid for this game (THERE IS A DEMO BTW! I DIDNT KNOW THAT) but i still wouldnt play it longer then 10 mins even if it was free.			"

								I liked the game, I feel like if you are looking for something strategic but cozy and relaxing, this is the game for you. You'll have to micromanage a lot of resources to build your city but it feels relaxing at the same time. Make sure you start with the tutorial because you'll get lost otherwise, but once you get the hang of it, you'll get entertained for hours.			"

												As of right now I wouldn't recommend this game. Maybe it's the ""Banished"" player in me but I can't help but feel like the major thing that's missing in this game is some sort of way to set roles for your little guys that will make them more prone to go toward certain activities. I had two forges and more iron than I could use and I still ran out of tools. And maybe I'm missing something, but shouldn't one chicken pen at least be enough to feed one villager? Well it must not be, because I had one two for each villager and they still starved.			"

												Okay, after originally leaving this game a negative review when it launched back in March of 2015, I have to say I recently played this again and saw that the developer has made a lot of changes and updates to this game to make it much more user friendly and fun to play.It still lacks the graphics and game depth that you might expect from a AAA city management or such simulator game, but for the price tag this game is now well worth its money I think.  Everything that I saw works now, the game is much brighter and clean than it was back in 2015 when it first launched, and I have to give the developer(s) credit for putting the needed work and updates into this little game to flip my review into a ""Recommend"" especially if you like these kind of games.My score: 8 out of 10, with much of that score based on a great game value for your money.
