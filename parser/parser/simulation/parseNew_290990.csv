												Grade: DThe story is generic and forgettable even if it has its moments. The art is decent but uninspiring. The farming feels tacked on and is largely pointless (as you can only spend money on, gasp, more seeds). For genre of ""dating sim"" it does nothing new and features an un-relatable protagonist. I'm not sure how any girl or guy would find this story or its male lead compelling.I can't say I hate this game but it is a solid, ""Meh.""			"

												Twee anime virtual choose-your-own-adventure where slacker college boy-seeks-girls in quaint little town. With flowers.Probably a little better than that sounds (unless that sounds awesome to you, and then here's your game). The characters are all a little two-dimensional (also literally) but kind of engaging. The story's somewhat predictable but not terrible, and achievements are pretty easy to pick up in a few hours. Also the emoticons are pretty. Picked it up in a bundle and I have no regrets.			"

												IF only there was a thumb recommendation that shows the thumb aiming sideways in the only means to justify that me saying this game is fairly decent.It's not groundbreaking, it's not revolutionary, it's not bringing anything new to the 'visual novel'/'dating sim' genre (aside from the 'Harvest Moon' mechanics) but the game overall, is not BAD, per se. Far from it, it is a decent experience.You take control of a character (or need to say pervert) named Steve, as he recently broke up with his ex 'Jill' and you get sent to farm slavery by your dad throughout the course of the summer, while trying to score with new chicks around the block. And that's pretty much it. Fairly simple, not hard to follow and you will get to learn more about the new characters you interact with, depending on how much time you spend with a particular female to increase your many stats. Incresing your stats helps you to unlock this game's 9 endings...which I have spent 7 hours unlocking (if there are MORE endings then 9, please let me know). These endings are not anything special besides the fact of helping yourself to unlock an achievement and to see how that ending alters the original ending of the game. Phew, I managed not to give away spoilers.The art is decent, the soundtrack is decent, the story, in itself, is decent, the whole game is decent. While it may not be a worthwhile game to spend your money on, it's one of those dating sims that is only enjoyable first time through and a chore the other 9 playthroughs after that.Funny enough, there is a voice volume slider, and yet, there's no voice acting in this game.

												Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook feels like an early effort by the developer. The central charater is a boy named Steve who is shipped off to his uncle's farm by his father for making all D's in school and for being a selfish child with no ambitions and an attitude problem. On the farm, Steve protests royally against having to do actual labor, but in order to try to have good relationships, you have to choose options that seem contrary to Steve's nature which takes some of the believability out of the situation. Steve is a jerk, but in order to make progress in the story, you need to not let Steve be a jerk. The uncle seems to be an important character, but then he vanishes for 75% of the game. The girls Steve meets are all ends of what-the-hell. There is another boy named Jacob who is innocently attracted to one of the girls in the game, and you can watch his anxiety and care for her in every frame get ignored. The farming mechanic is absolutely pointless. You can earn currency which is spent on more seeds to get more currency to do absolutely nothing more than buy more seeds. By the end of the game, I had saved more than $1000 and thought something neat would happen. Nope. No option to buy anything. No acknowledgement of my small fortune. You can earn lots of money FOR NO REASON, and this infuriated me. So the game ends, and the one girl you were after never ended up liking you enough, and you don't really know what you could have done, but Gee Whiz, play through it all again and try harder, sport.

												Apparently I suck at this game, since I had three playthroughs were I ended up alone and a fouth were I got a girl I didn't aim for. The farming gameplay is utterly useless, since you earn money just go buy more seeds and your work at the garden doesn't seem to influence anything for the characters. But well, since it forces you to work at the garden every morning, you might as well keep growing and cleaning.The game is very short, which means that neither the story nor the characters are deep in any way, but it's still enjoyable. Everyone who loves dating sims may have some hour or two fun playing the game and going for the best girl. Don't pay too much though and hope for better and bigger games of this genre in the future.edit:Apparently I am just too bad with farming, since the money indeed has influence on the kind of ending.

												This third visual novel release on Steam by Winter Wolves feature a male protagonist Steve who started with a partial break-up with his girlfriend Jill who attend the same college with him in Los Angeles. As a result of his poor grades in college, his father sent him to a remote town in Fairbrook to help out at his uncle's farm over the summer.At his uncle's farm, Steve has to help tend his uncle's farm by cultivating 8 different types of crops and making a certain profit. At Fairbrook, Steve will get to meet and interact with his uncle Sam, his ex-girlfriend Jill, the owner of the flower shop in Fairbrook Susana, the daughter of a neighbouring farm owner in Fairbrook Clara, the librarian in Fairbrook Marian as well as additional supporting characters Trent who is Susana's brother, Jacob who helps out at Clara's farm, Orpheus who is Sam's pet cat and Steve's father.The game has plenty of save slots to enable quicker replays to reach a different romance ending, a tell-all relationship meter with any of the main characters that goes up or down depending on your dialogue or option choices and the option to skip and fast-forward already read sections.

												I really wanted to give this a good review but I couldn’t. The iPhone version is better but it stopped working after the iOS 4 update. I was very glad to see this show up on steam however I must say that the new mechanics almost ruined the entire game. The farming mechanic is useless and the rearranging of the way you spend your time broke the story in to parts where it just doesn’t feel as well made as the one made for the iPhone. The one advantage this one has over other dating Sims is that it doesn’t feel like it takes place in some kind of modified version of Japan and feels like an American story. It’s really sad how this came out on steam as the IOS version is in my opinion one of the best dating Sims I have played. My advice to the dev is if he still can restore the game to make it identical to the iOS version. This is also the 1st and only review I have ever done and plan on doing I felt this all had to be said.			"

												First of all I must mention that i've played Always Remember Me which was also made by Winter Wolves and left a negative review. It's not that they are bad games, it's because they have some pointless aspects, they will force you to grind to get the different endings and they have a very short duration for $15+ games.Flower Shop is a visual novel with a vegetable patch that you can manage in uncle Sam's farm. The story is good in my opinion, but to get the different endings, there is some grinding to be done. The art is fine i'd say and the music is good despite being repetitive.On the good side, your choices affects the story and you have 5 possible different endings. As I said it's not a bad game, but there are too many things that makes no sense for me to recommend this game!First of all, the farming part of the game: You have a plot of land that you can weed out, plant seeds and water them, then sell the product to make money... The catch? It's pointless! I've planted 5 plants at the start of the game and during the rest of the game I just choosed the option ""Done working"" and every single character told me that I was working hard and improving! I was also able to complete all 5 different endings without farming.Also the price... $15? It took me 2 hours to get the 5 different endings (yes i've let the game opened for 1-1.5 hour to get cards) and after that, there is 0 replay value. I just can't understand why Winter Wolves sets their prices so high. It would be more logical to sell their games at a $5-8 price tag.So overall, I believe the story was good and I enjoyed playing the game (alot more than Always Remember Me). But it's way too short and as I mentioned before, the farming part is useless. Feel free to get this game around $5 if you're into visual novels, as you might regret spending $15 for such a short game. I really wish in their future games they will fix those issues as their stories are quite good.			"

												Another meh VN. What’s the point on having a farm simulator together with a dating simulator if when you earn over $1,000 you’re basically stuck in Fairbrook and cannot date the girls? It simply RUINED the concept of the game!The art style was okay, nothing fantastic and nothing terrible. BGs were ok too, BGM was a bit annoying sometimes. The story was meh and its characters were also meh. This game is really short and all about status raising, and you barely have time to talk to the girls. And when you do talk to them, it all happens way too fast. I only recommend this game if you’re already used to Winter Wolves VNs and/or it’s on a good sale.3/10.			"

												4 love interests, 9 endings, steam achievements and trading cards!I enjoyed and highly recommend this Visual Novel and its little farming twist.  The plot revolves around Steve, a guy who’s barely getting by at college with a D average, just got dumped, and has an appalling relationship with his father.  His father sends Steve to live with his uncle for a “Summer in Fairbrook” as punishment for his low grades, where Steve is destined to become a farmhand.  This trip changes him.  His character developing based upon choices you make.  The best aspect of this game is its character development.  For instance, Steve’s character changes dependent upon whom you decide Steve should romance in Fairbrook.  Other characters also change as events occur within the story.It takes a little while to work through all the endings, and also very enjoyable to do so, as you learn more about each of Steve’s love interests.  Definitely recommend for people who enjoy VNs and dating sims. "

												It's not totally bad per se, but since there's only two options here I must go with a NO.The game is very short, with easily forgettable characters and for the dating sim genre it's overly simplistic. The only thing that stands out a bit from the typical games in the genre is the farming part, but since you can just skip that portion without doing a single thing and have no effect to the overall game I just can't see the point of it.I've played worse, but even for under $5 I can't just go and recommend this game to anyone.

												Albeit not worth the normal steam price, this game is actually rather satisfying, with some really in depth and likeable characters and some really cute romances!The farming mechanic is rather useless/pointless but that aside, the visual novel element is good, but ultimately, the soundtrack is what wins it for me. Such peaceful and serene music!If you can pick this up on sale or in an indie bundle, it's definitely worth your time and money! :) "

												The Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook is the first game in The Flower Shop series of visual novels produced by Winter Wolves. A large part of the gameplay also has players managing a farm while creating relationships with characters in the game.The game revolves around Steve who is on break from college. Steve has just recently split from his girlfriend and his dad decides to send him off to his uncle’s farm for the summer rather than having him at home. Needless to say Steve doesn’t start out the game in a very happy mood but after discovering four girls that have the potential of a romantic relationship he turns around by the end of the game.Summer In Fairbrook is all about deciding how to spend your time as Steve. While much of your time is spent on the farm raising crops to sell for profit he still has plenty of free time to spend romancing the four available girls and doing all the normal things a college student loves to do on his college break. Many of these activities can increase your skills in particular areas to help you in the game or be used to impress girls.Raising crops has multiple game mechanics to it including the purchasing of seeds, planting, watering and clearing the land of weeds. If you can successfully grow your crops then you’ll be able to visit the market to sell them for better seeds and some pocket money.On the romancing side of gameplay players will engage in a number of activities with each of the girls which in turns increases how much of a relationship they have with Steve. Just like in real life building a relationship takes time, skills and lots of talking.Depending on the relationships you pursue you can experience one of nine different endings which are saved in the archives to be viewed later which encourages you to try and collect them all.All in all, if you’re a fan of visual novel games, want a short one, and want to pay the proper price for a short game – pick up The Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook on Steam. There are achievements, Steam cards, and everything you could want.			"

												Don't play it, there's better games out there.Biggest problem is that there's no relationship bar outside of the one you see when making important dialogue decisions. This means that you can spend 80% of your Summer with one girl and still end up with the forever alone ending. Just for an example, Clara the Tomboy is interested in the big city. She's only interested in you once you tell her your from LA. Okay, whatever. But then despite being a tomboy you have to figure out that she wants to be kept up to date on LA Styles and whatnot, despite being a tomboy.To keep up to date on LA, you have to keep in touch with your Ex whose still living there. So to get a new GF, you have to keep in touch with your ex, that's quite intuitive.I don't know how many different ""events"" there are, but a lot of time seems to be spent getting the same filler text.Farming is pointless, there's nothing to spend the money on and it's ridiculously easy to get a ton of money.The same music loops about 90% of the time, to the point that you'll probably be startled whenever it changes.You can literally just play the game until the final 3 weeks, save, and then just constantly reload that save and get the different endings.Playing this blind, I had no idea that I was doing anything wrong until I hit the ending. Plus the fact that I saw almost no events or choices.There's better virtual novels out there.			"

												Story is quite shallow.  The farming component not well integrated.  You get all these money and don't really have anything to spend it on except for more seeds. Not very imaginative if you ask me. NIce drawings/art but I didn't find the characters that likeable, especially the main character you control. On the dating piece, you could be pursuing one girl in mind, but was generally nice to someone else then suddently they've hooked up with you.  I didn't like it.  Not enough depth to the story.			"

												I have to be fair about this game. So I try to play it simple. It is a dating sim or visual novel, whatever term you prefer. It isn't exactly bad - but it also isn't quite good either. The story in short, you and your girlfriend break up at the start of a three month semester break. Your father is upset about you being a slothful , negligent and superficial way of life (what also was the reason your girlfriend was using to coerce you). So he puts you into his car and drives you to your uncle, who is a rural farmer. You have to cope with this, and your uncle ... you might fight against those things and befriend other girls, or you see that your dad, uncle and girlfriend might be right and develop some reason.One of the things on visual novels is, that everything is about decissions and making it work out fine - in that way they are related to adventures of the type choose your own adventures - but this game has also a little twist. Your uncle is farmer, but his produce is restricted to fruits and vegetables and he's expecting you to also do some farmwork by giving your own plot of land a bountiful harvest (yeah, whatever) ... So you have to weed them, plant seeds and remove pests, water and in the end harvest them ... did I say that you also can muck your plants?In reality this is truly backbreaking work, and you'll have to have a lot of patience over a long period of time (salads don't grow to harvestable size in three to five days) but you have to make concessions to get the game going. The money of your harvest goes into your own budget and this budget is used up to shop new seeds - you'll see where this is going? Yeah, at the end you'll have money for the things you farmed ... Fast growing plants guarantee a constant but low input in money, slow growing plants will cause a good earn in money (blackberries being the most expensive)...*sigh* In the end, your semester break comes to an end and you have accomplished: Nothing. Well you might have grown aquainted to one of the girls, worsened the relations to others and of course ... your family or the opposite of all this and grown a pro (hahahahaha) fruit and vegetable farmer with a lot of bucks at your own disposal.And this is the thing with dating sims that do give me the creeps most of the time - on a pure fantastical setting all is fine and you can say, well this game at least doesn't give the pretension of being a sim - it is a story being told in which you are the protagonist and decide what is happening (I love the endless dungeon series from TSR back in the 70s and 80s, I also love Steve Jacksons and Ian Livingstones Fighting Fantasies) - but in a modern world setting a lot is going amiss, trying to be realistic doesn't help (hey it's a fricking dating sim) and too much fantasies also won't work (doh, look at those horsies *sigh*) I grew up in a rural setting and to tell you the truth, this game has a far to simplicistic world view about a lot of things, but you have to start somewhere - this game got a E grade from me. Sure, it isn't all bad, but it also isn't all well and it has lost a lot of things - especially the ""spoiled adolescent"" role of the protagonist is a very painful stereotype.I can't recomend this game, based on the gaming experience.

												I really just don't like this game.Characters and Arcs are just really generic and forgetable. I hate the main character. There was just no emotional investment compared to other visual novels. Most choices for relationships are two options and woe betide you if you guess the wrong one. There aren't many clues as to what's what. I understand VNs are meant for multiple playthroughs, but I see no point or drive to continue. Not to mention, there's little feedback in game on the stats available, it took me half a playthrough to realise what was going on with those.The art is nice and I haven't played much of the game so I'm probably missing alot - but what I have played is enough for me. It's so bland. I like the concept of the farming, but the dating/farming aspects don't meld well together, and it's just left a bad taste in my mouth.There are better VN's out there for your money's worth, honestly.

												Bad and short grinding visual novel. The romance is not really cute or the story in any way interestening. Played 2-3 hours and got all endings. The decisions you make are feeling somewhat random, even if you have max sympathy with a character for some reason you have to get atleast 50% sympathy from another character to get her ending. So the game felt without a guide pretty unbeatable, since you would have played through the game and just guessed a couple of times. Would not recommend this one, there are better winter wolves games(the dev). Also the farming flowers simulator is completely useless and repetetive.2/10			"

												Decent Visual novel.   Choices have direct influence with the girl with whom you're interacting, but the best part is the secondary effect of that interaction on a different girl whom you're trying to romance.  I wouldn't call the game Earth shattering and the choices are fairly mundane as is the farming aspect which is effectively filler.  Overall it's decent.  I ended up collecting all five ending - game was sufficiently interesting to drive me to want to see all the unique endings and because of that it gets a thumbs up.			"

												Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook is a Visual Novel with an more or less properly integrated farming minigame (that actually does no/barely impact to the game... sadly) To begin: IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE! You should buy it on sale or in bundle or on other sites, 15€ is simply too much, the game itself is a solid novel.Story: You play Steve, college Boy who looks after cute girls - thats how his girlfriend Jill gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off from him and brakes up. To all unfairness his Father sends him to his uncle to work as a Farmer for him as Steve lacks character and needs to be taught the hard way. There he meets the 2 girls  Clara and Susana as well as the women Marian. He can get a love relationship with them, or phone his ex Jill and try to reunite with her.Each run takes about 45-60 minutes to complete if you rush (and with skip function after 1st run) the first one took ~80 minutes.Every day you start with the farming game, then you can choose what you want to do, either farm more (as said it does no impact to the game ... : ( ), go walking with Clara, visit the Flowershop to buy seeds and visit Susana, visit the Library to read books and visit Marian, phoning Jill or sleeping to cure fatigue.Pro:- Story, although not the best, you actually can enjoy and get to like the story once you played a bit of it.- Farm minigame (although kinda tirering after a while)- Many choices- Characters have a nice personality- Music- Background- Trading cards- AchievementsCon: (somehow steam doesnt accept the formation in the end... -.-)- Price... 15€ is definetly over the top, this might be worth 5€, maximum of 7€, so buy only on sale or on bundle sites- More or less unpolished characterdesign, still not as bad as in the Heileen series. (Susana actually looks buitiful)- Repeatable dialogues when you visit the girls without having an event triggered- Farming minigame has no impact to the plot, not even an achievement, you more or less can skip it all day [only impact it has: you get special ending if you have ~500$.. that is earned in the 1st 2 weeks alone, after u can skip it all day)                                                                                        - Often scenes without sound at all- Not 100% appropiate for small children (might be okay for 14+? All how the parents may see it themselves) as the Marian route has a wet shirt szene where you can see her bra. Overprotective adults should therefore not let their smaller kids play that route ^^. This is stated as con only for parents buying this for their smaller children. It is not that of an ""extreme"" scene.Hard for me to rate and not to misrate it...either 6/10 or 7/10  so ill stick with 6.5/10 for nowI enjoyed it, but i would never pay 15 € for it, bought it in a bundle or on sale, i dont remember anymore its been a while hanging untouched in my steamlogg.

												As I believe someone else said, I wish there was a thumb going sideways.. a more neutral response.The Bad:This game is a lot shorter than any other games of similar genres that I have played. Like, way way too short (especially for the 14.99 price tag)... it only took me 2 hours to play through it the first time, and that's with actually reading everything. It only lasts the Summer (which I think had been a period of 4 months). Most games of this type tend to be at least a year.. So I didn't feel that you had a lot of time to make the choices you need. You also only get to decide on one thing to do every day. In the morning you work in your little garden patch, and then in the afternoon you do the one thing you decided to do (Eg. Go to the library, or for a run). Far too often spending time with the girls is nothing more than a filler ""It was a lot easier to run with Clara today than usual... and so another day is over"". It's a little annoying to find out that you wasted your only choice that day by getting nothing but filler text.When you do have a ""meaningful"" interaction with someone, you only get to choose one response through the whole thing (more often than not) and everything else is pre-determined.. so I found that the character did/said far too many things that I wouldn't have done, had I been given the option. More often than not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off people that you didn't intend to anger.I also, personally, found that choosing any of the women was quite limiting, as Steve makes it very clear that he still wants to be with his ex-girlfriend Jill... there by making chasing any of the other women just seem weird.... and when I did finally decide I like one of the other girls, I was able to get my relationship to the highest it could be... and we just ended up being friends.. not really sure what happened there.The good:The farming is decent, it doesn't make the game, but it doesn't break it either.The characters are decently interesting, if you ever actually get the time to talk to them in a capacity other than the flavour text added in the game, and the writing is fairly good.The music isn't bad, I had my volume down, so I didn't pay too much attention to it.The art is quite nice.All in all, I would give this game 50%.. it isn't good, but it isn't bad either... however, it's not worth 15 dollars.. so if you can get it on sale, then it's worth it, but you shouldn't buy it at full price.

												This game is your standard dating game, with a farming mini-game thrown into the mix.Honestly i don't see why the farming is there since it just hinders the romantic relationships with each character if you get over a certian ammount of money. Still the girls you can romance are sweet, brainy spice, sporty spice, baby spice and vanilla spice.If you fancy a shot at this game i'd recommend you grab it in the sale. Still an enjoyable experience none the less.			"

												Short, solid, romantic VN.  The asking price of $15 is high, but if you can pick this up on sale and enjoy romantic VNs, you'll have a good time.The writing and art in this is good.  Nothing really extraordinary, but also not disappointing.  There's really only one thing I didn't like about this, and that's that the farming part of the game didn't really mix well with the dating part of the game.  Other than to get a different ending (which isn't required to get any of the 4 achievements), there's no real point to doing well with the farming.  If the monetary system in this was fleshed out a bit more it would have been nice, but as it stands you don't really need to worry about the farming.Basically, if you want a dating sim that doesn't require too much investment, consider picking this up during the next sale.

												Nice dating visual novel with simulation elements.The writing is good, even better than average I'd say.The art is nice but nothing out of the ordinary. If any, expressions are sometimes a bit exagerated.There is also an intelligent farming minigame based on time (and money) management which could have made use of steam leaderboards,Overall, it is enjoyable.

												I really enjoyed this game.It's farmville meets dating sim, and I love it. You play as Steve, a lazy college kid shipped off to his uncle's farm in order to build some character.Which he does, by growing crops and getting to know the locals. As is usual for these games, there are four potential, quirky love interests.Unlike many such games, in order to get close to any individual love interest, you have to get to know everyone, and level up several stats. Getting the specific ending you wanted can prove tricky, as the stat you level up by spending time with a woman, is not the one that is vital to her romance path.This means you may be trying to romance one woman, only to wind up with a different one. And they're all quirky, there's your bossy ex, the neurotic poet librarian, the relatively normal girl attempting to escape from country life, and Susanna. Susanna appears in a LOT of WinterWOlves games (she's Myrth in 'Loren the Amazon Princess', and Sally in 'Roommates'), either because she's a neat archtype to write around, or someone on the team knows her in real life. She's vegan, into nature and natural healing. You mention in passing you'll take an asprin for your headache, and get treated to a lecture on chemicals and how natural remedies are so much better. But the game is gentle and fun, it is quite entertaining to see Steve learn, mature and grow up. The characters are not particularly deep, but they don't really need to be. You manage stats and get to know people, what more is there to say?			"

												Story Spoilers:Let me start this review by just saying that I guess I had different expectations for it. With that said, I think this game could use a lot of work if it were concerned with my thoughts/complaints on it. So to summarize what this game is about; You are a stereotypical slacker with low ambitions and a bit disrespectful. Your dad doesn't exactly get along with you, but figures your attitude needs changing so he drives you up to your older uncle's farm where you're expected to raise vegetables on a small plot of land. You get to drive into town within your first week of being there, where you'll meet 3/4 of the young women whom you can get to know better. Your uncle decides to go back to his normal schedule and lets you do with your week as you will. This leads you to several options for each day of the week; work more, visit the flower shop (Susana is here), visit the Library (Marian the Librarian is here), go for a jog (with Clara), stay at home (and talk to your ex-girlfriend Jillian), and relax. Choosing any of the options with the women will boost the tied ""stat"" that goes with it. These stats will reflect what you may or may not see when visiting the women. Your days start with working in the plot of land you're given. You have to clear out squares filled with weeds to actually start planting anything. Plants take a few or several days to grow, depending on if you use fertilizer or not. Once they are grown you can sell it. The choices you have at the plot are; clear out weeds, plant something, using fertilizer, water plants, and clean up a plant. Any of these choices will take up 1 hour of your time, I think you have until noon to get things done in the morning before you go to whatever you chose to do that day. If you go to the flower shop you can choose to buy more seedlings to plant in your garden with the money you've gained from selling your full-grown plants (or not full-grown if you want to sell those early for some reason, I think that is an option, but I never chose to do that). Okay, so I think I explained the garden part fairly thoroughly, let me just explain what I think was done wrong with it and why it's one of the complaints I have about the game. You grow stuff, you sell stuff, and you buy more seeds to grow and sell more stuff. You get money by doing this, and as far as I know that money had no impact on any other part of the game whatsoever. This gardening plot mechanic seemed like such wasted potential, and was a big disappointment to see. Plus the money you made from selling those vegetables would be less than you'd get working a part time job at minimum wage for the same amount of hours. Fertilizer cost $2, and sped up the growing process by 1 day, but takes away from your end profit and takes time to use.			"

												This is an interesting little game. Winter Wolves has done a lot of great games, and while this is not as high up as most (It seems to be rough enough that maybe it is one of their earlier products), it still is satisfying. So, you split time between farming vegetables and fruits (berries are fruits, so are tomatoes) and trying to build a relationship with some available women... or even the one who dumped you before you got shipped off to this town.Oh yeah, you were shipped off to Fairbrook because you are basically a good-for-nothing slacker and your overbearing dad wants you to shape up... so he sent you to the brother he doesn't like so much for a taste of rural life.Now you can end up alone, or with one of the girls. Supposedly there is a normal and a special ending for each girl, but I have only seen the normal ones... guess I'm too good with the crops... (apparently there is a cash limit you shouldn't go over... cumulatively).Still a fun little thing.			"

												With  art that looks like it belongs in a 'worst of deviantart' tumblr, and such stunning romance candidates as rabid anti-traditional medicine hippie princess, ex-girlfriend who sounds like a nagging mother, cranky girl who is only interested in you because you're from out of town, and hot older librarian, Summer in Fairbrook is totally worth it if Steam discounts it to under a dollar. Then you can date the one good candidate, if you can stomach the atrocious weekly scheduling and annoying protagonist, that is. On the bright side, the music is good.But, seriously. There's already a romance farming sim series: it's called Harvest Moon, and the love options and time control are far, far superior. "

												Great idea of combination farming/dating sim.This game unfortunately falls horribly short of this idea.The farming has nothing to do with any other part of the game and is completely unneccesary. There's no point to even remotely doing any of the farming.This requires a detailed guide to navigate the relationships at all. I failed the first playthrough. Why? Because I answered that I liked mystery books instead of poetry. There's no versatility in the answers (even if you're given 4 options)-- There is only ONE right answer. Anything else will screw you over.Second playthrough the wrong girl fell in love with the main character. I bought this game during Steam Summer Sale and still regret paying for it at all. There's not enough to this game for it to cost anything.			"

												What you see is what you get with this game. And what you see is a constricting disappointment. Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook is a shallow, uninspired dating sim with a tacked on and unless farming simulator.Steve is a dull, flat character with no chance to really gain any interesting traits. No matter what you do during your week, Steve stays the same. No new dialogue choices open up, no new events (You can go through each and ever event present in one play through, except for the ending events.)Each of the romancable options are two-dimensional and boring. You have the standard affair of the tomboy, the delicate, the bookworm, and this games interpretation of friend from your old life. None of these characters stand out on their own or branch out from their preassigned and obvious roles. This game can't even do something interesting with the 4 simple, tried and true roles it uses. The minigame of farming, which you would assume would be essential, is useless. The only thing you can do with the money you earn from it is buy more plants. There is nothing else that the money can be used for. And while the farming will inform your ending, it has no real measurable effect throughout the game. As the ONLY thing to do outside of simple interactions with the girls, you would hope it would be more interesting or even fun.For diehard dating sim fans, this game offers nothing new, interesting, or even fun. For people jsut getting into the genre, avoid this game, it is representative of the worst in dating sims. This game is too fast to beat and lacks any real meat.I would only recommend this game to dating sim enthusiasts looking for ANYTHING to play, regardless of quality.			"

tl;dr -> Play as a spoiled brat who gets sent to work on a farm, meeting 4 girls who might only be interested due to the proximity principle - you are really the only eligible bachelor there. You can be the sweetest friend, but make just one wrong move, and you will be friendzoned by your potential lover. 11/10 real life simulator.I got this game in a bundle, and was very happy I did not spend that much money to buy just this game. I normally try not to mention price if I feel a game's mechanics outshine any monetary value, but $16.99 CAD for this is horrendous. Honestly, you can pick up almost ANY book (or even several if you go to a thrift store) for that price, and the writing will be leagues better. Do not waste your money on this. Read a book instead.The aesthetics are okay, the detail in the characters and backgrounds are average. There are not many extra scenes, so you will have to get used to seeing the same character positions over and over and over again. The music is bland, and there is no voice acting or sounds - which is odd because there is a voice toggle in the options. There appears to be some optimization issues, as I have been unable to run the game in fullscreen - it zooms in and cannot be altered even after I tried experimenting with the settings. The story is very, very basic, predictable, and quite boring. I will highlight my potential bias here, as I have been an avid reader of many different genres all my life, but even then, there are other cheaper/free alternatives if you insist on having a visual novel experience. I really try to stress whether or not a game is worthy of your time and resources, and this one isn't. Seriously, try out Katawa Shoujo for much better game, and there are countless other visual novels with a far better script. The controls are basic of a typical visual novel, and there is no tutorial needed. The learning curve is non-existent, however, you will have to plan your weeks (similar to the style seen in the Princess Maker games) out. Each activity you do provides different increases to your stats (ex: working on the farm increases your determination) and gives you more chances to interact with the 4 girls in town. There is a rudimentary farming system that surprised me - it added a very slight change to the constant reading. You can plant seeds, water your crops, remove weeds, and kill pests. When your vegetables are ready, you can harvest them to sell at the shop to buy more crops. This feature irritated me greatly, as I had a lot of money by the end of the game, but never saw an option to use it (except for buying more seeds). There is really no point of planting/harvesting your crop. The character interaction system is very, very boring - you will have MANY days of reading the same script over and over again. I tried going on runs (to interact with one girl) 4 days a week, and every day was just a repeat in the script. Also, if you get one interaction incorrect (ex: say the wrong thing during one of the few dialogue trees), you will completely blow any chance you had to get an ending with the girl you wanted. Overall, I strongly suggest you avoid this game and seek out any alternatives - there are many visual novels available on steam that are free. Even if you got this game for $1, I think it would be better spent elsewhere.Do not recommend.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Even though the story is mostly predictable, I did like the development of the characters. The main character going from a lazy brat to taking responsability and actually appreciating a girl for who she is. That said, there are some big downsides to this game which takes away the natural flow of the novel and instead feels like a huge grind if you want to experience the full game.I dislike grindy Visual Novels and unfortunately this is one of them. You don't build up your love relationships by interacting with one girl through the story, instead you have to grind for secret points by doing different activites. That makes all the love relationships feel forced rather than naturally taking place. As an example, I thought the character Marian was most interesting, so I spent most of his vacation with her. The game ends without any acknowledgement of them liking each other at all and I get flowers from another girl instead. Reading the guides, if I spend less time with Marian, I can unlock the romantic ending with her. It seems very backwards to spend less time with someone you love to make them truly love you.The huge downside of this game is the farming. Every single morning you are forced to the farm area. You can skip it if you want to, yet I would have prefered to not see it there at all. There seems to be no reward for actually farming. You can earn money, which you can only spend on to buy more seeds, so you can sell more vegetables. Yay? I would rather have seen that you could gift something to your potential love interest or save up money to take them someplace for a special event.			"

												Firstly, I bought this game with a 50% off coupon. When it first came to Steam I thought it looked promising due to the colorful atmosphere and the dialog seemed good (and at that, there are a few spelling errors here and there but you have to look hard).The farming really doesn't add too much to the game, just feels like a distracting mini-game in this dating sim. The pests and weeding make it slightly less boring and alright. There's a 5th ending you can actually get if you reach over $1000 from simply harvesting (blackberries and strawberries are the way to go). Would be nice if a fifth achievement was added for this ending.The story itself seems alright, you get sent to your uncle's house for the summer for having bad grades, breaking up with Jill, and having a generally lazy attitude. Over time, you get better at gardening (or just don't bother at all and watch the wees grow, best thing EVER!), and can try to get with one of the four ladies. Kind of odd you have a Relationship bar with your uncle....Getting the endings can be a bit stressful since even if you do max out the relationship bar and continue to visit with the ladies, there is a chance they will never date you or have an ending with you which means having to either restart from the earliest checkpoint (save right after getting to Sam's house is recommended) or starting all over again from the start. This is pretty much where my biggest gripe is, maxing out the relatiosnhip bar with any lady does NOT guarantee a date or an ending with that lady no matter how much you continue to visit her (unless you follow a near perfect strategy to level up all stats each week).The music fits a lot of the places and sadly the music seems to be the only thing I enjoyed about the game in the end.While the game does have a few good moments if done correctly, it's just a really bad mix of dating sim and tossing in farming for money to buy... well, nothing but more seeds really. You can get one of the ladies flowers much later in the game but that's just Susana being polite towards you.3/10			"

A middle-of-the-road combination dating and farming simular, though the farming is mostly optional. Five hours to see all four possible outcomes, but zero replayability beyond that. It's worth picking up on the cheap if you like this sort of thing, but probably not if you don't.Ultimately, I settled on a thumb down because the list price of £10.99 is far more expensive than I feel the game merits.

												I went into this thinking I was going to get a medicore dating sim mixed with Farmville. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I assumed wrong. Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook has some pretty touching story archs. Mind you, they aren't mind blowing and it does have its fair amount of cliches but I was able to get invested in all 4 of them. I'm also happy to say the farming aspect is more or less optional! I was able to skip over it entirely and achieve every ending without any consequence. The first playthrough will probably run around 2 hours long. Going for all the endings after that will take about 15 minutes each (20-25 if you are a slow reader). I saw everything there was to see in about 2 and a half hours. It was a very worthwhile 2 and a half hours too. I highly reccomend this game if you're in the market for a new Dating Sim/VN! The artwork ain't half bad either once you get used to it.Note: The character you play as is borderline insufferable for the first few sections. Probably one of the most ridiculous and self centered characters you could play as. Thankfully, it doesn't stay that way for long!			"

												This game is a combination of classical VN and a farming minigame. While at first glance it might sound interesting, it doesn't work out so well. Plot of the story is very simple and it's there just so you could say there is one. Gameplay is little different than usual, after the ""prologue"" part, which works as usual, it comes down to a calendar where you pick what place you visit each day of the week. This was a bit confusing for me and it took me 3 or 4 playthrough to get the 1st girl end. Art is ok, CGs are minimal and soundtrack is nowhere near memorable. There were some mistakes I noticed in text, as well as some logic ones I minded. Also haven't figured out the purpose of the farming part, it gets boring pretty fast and it's not necessary for finishing the game, got all the endings while skipping it. Routes are story-poor and leave you pretty indifferent so if you haven't bought this for a dollar as a part of a bundle, like I did, feel free to skip it.			"

												Good game. I dont usually write reviews, especially on big titles. But this small game kinda warmed my heart.Story was decent enough, nothing overwhelming or far stretched, and allowed to easely get into character of the Main protagonist.The light novel parts were fun as well, and coupled with the ""farming"" part of the game which, to my surprise I did actuallyt enjoy, meshed well toather.The only downside that I personally found, was the fact that it ended way to soon. The game coulduse a bit more in the terms of the character development and farming, to stretch it a notch, an houror two would be nice.Had this game another installment I would be happy to get my hands on it. (I avoided the Winter version of this game, as it has a female MC, and somehow, trying to date guys did not click with mebeing a dude as well.)Overall enjoyable little experience. Sometimes it appears in Humble  Bundles, or gets discounted hereon Steam. The original price is a bit steep, but if you get the option to nab it for 50% or so, I wouldrecommend it.			"

												You’ll be a young man who argued with his girlfriend.

												There are certainly some better Visual Novel experiences out there but if you're looking for a fun little game, this one is pretty fun at the very least. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something cute and fun. 11/10 it was okay -IGN			"

												This is an enjoyable little VN. You start out as a garbage human being and through hard work and the ""country life"" you slowly become a viable, dateable member of society. 4 cute girls. 4 cute endings. Play it.			"

												Don't let the reviews fool you, while this game is very short and not one of Winterwolves' greatest it is still a great way to pass a few hours. The protaganist is a pain in the beginning, but by the end of the game he at least has a few redeemable qualities and the cast of females is amazing, specifically Susana. I do, however, wish that the farming 'mini game' had more impact on the story and more depth. It was this VN's single draw that set it apart from others and yet it ended up being a bit of a disappointment.^^			"

												i don't know what it is with visual novels and me hating the main charater... realy ♥♥♥♥ing quickly. but i digress this is a quiant little tale of how a boy become a man, and by that i mean becomes someone who is respectable and not a idoic douch, and you get to contorl him as he make relations to four girls (one of which is back home and hates his guts). the girls ofered a nice varaty of personilitys and quircks but i found that it's a little out of your ability to chouse which ending you'd get because i spent most time going after the libarian for a cultured experence and the one girl i could get to have an ending with was the la street girl wannabe. my only certic is the game doesn't seem to know the meaning of the word cute. as it described all three girls in fairbrook as cute, that is not the case one is cute one is elegent and the other is... what a stright person would call hot? i'm not entirely sure but the point is it's not cute. either way it's a nice tail with some ups and downs			"

												I wasn't expecting much walking into this game, but I ended up being pleasently surprised. It's not the most lengthy or exciting thing in the universe, but it's a fairly interesting and relatable story about a University slacker with a poor relationship with his father getting packed off to his relatives in the country. What he does from there is mostly in your hands. It's a fairly standard 'Time management Visual Novel' style game, but with good art, decent characters and fair writing.It won't win any game of the year awards, but it's well worth the time spent playing. If you like this style of game, it's a fairly easy recommend.			"

												Grabbed this game from Indie Humble Bundle for 1.87$ and you will not regret it. A beautiful visual novel game that requires you to score with 4 different chicks or live a lonely life without love (this game made this sound so bad). The cons would be that this game ends too quick and only need 3.3 hours to get all the different endings. Personal Opinion : 8/10, Grab this when there is a sale.			"

												Short but very fun! (That's what she said).So what do we have here? 4 Endings followed by a linear and basic story nothing too extravagant or new but hell this game it's really cute and relaxing (I wont suggest buying it at 14,99 though that price tag is unreasonable)			"

												Visual novel games are not everyones cup of tea, which you do in fact drink in this game. I liked this game as I do with most of the ""Winter Wolves"" titles and as I would with Hanako. These games are targetted for a certain market which falls inbetween a myriad of gamers, for arguement sake I would say it is casual gaming and not facebook casual gaming. I liked this game, I thought the gameplay was straight forward where you maintain a farm as required by the storyline which helps pass time. When you are finished with your days work you have the option of courting one of four other women who have genuinely different personalities. The characters were not totally hollow and they did interconnect with one another and the supporting cast that shadowed them.It is not a title for everyone and I cant say I payed full price either, none the less for the price of admission for the bundle I got it from I am completely content with my purchase.The only thing I can say against the game is that it is abruptly short and does not use the farming segment at all within the actual game to further the story, money has no purpose.

												Before I start, I'd mention that I am not used to playing these type of games. I did like playing Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbook. It's like a storybook of some sort, short one, but still. Plusses:+ Decent story+ Nice looking images/pictures/scenes+ Requires some planning to get the achievements+ Keeps you interestedMinuses:- re-playability is kind of low- gardening is actually quite useless - game of this price should have more content. Currently I played the game through the first time with 1 hours 20 minutes (I actually read all the texts).			"

												You start your game as Steve, the main protagonist. You and your girlfriend Jill end up getting into a huge fight and break up. Your father yells at you for not having any ambition or resolve and decides to ship you off to Fairbrook to work for your Uncle Sam. You get to Fairbrook and seem to not like all the hardwork at first but upon meeting the townspeople, you start to warm up to the idea of spending the rest of your summer vacation in Fairbrook. Along the way you meet four cute and vastly different girls all whom which you can romance.Summer in Fairbrook is a great game with cute stories and colorful, exciting visuals. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it to dating sim and visual novel fans.			"

												This game was a lifeline in the bleak darkness that I faced in the end of Walking Dead 2. It really is great for cheering you up, its sweet and while things can go badly at times, it all works out in the end. The farming is a kind of fun and a good way to rake in some Summer Money (not that you can spend it on anything but MORE farming. But that's fine.)The game shows off the values of hard work, in that the main character is good for nothing, but a little farm living and he's no longer an awful human being. The growth is slow enough to be believable, and the interactions with the other characters are nice too.If you're a hopeless romantic, or could just use a smile, this game is worth picking up.			"

												Achievement unlocked: Forever alone (even in a video game).  Game is mildly entertaining.  I will say working in the garden is completely useless and can't court the female even if you become filthy rich.  Wish the art was more interesting with a little more depth in the stories and characters. This game is meant for casuals.			"
