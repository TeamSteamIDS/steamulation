												Rollercoaster Tycoon the best of the rollercoaster creating games! If you never played this in your childhood, your parents probably didn't love you or you weren't old enough to comprehend how awesome this was/is, Now you can experience it whether you played it back in the day or are new to this!! Have fun building awesome rollercoasters that visitors are to afraid to get on, that took you an hour to create! You can build cool food courts with fountains and flowers with a random pyramid built in the middle because WHY NOT!?! its all to make your park looks cool! You can also build death traps! do you remember those visitors to afraid to go on you really cool rollercoaster that took you forever to make!?! why don't you just go kill them off by build a rollercoaster that launches them into the air and then they hit the ground in a ball of flames! That will teach them next...well it will teach the other visitors!! In conclusion this game is awesome and cheap and it has the same stuff back in the day! i give this 1,000 visitors and a Park Rating of over 900!!! or 10/10			"

												In a post-apocalyptic world, you are the manager of a random (more or less) spot of land with the ability to instantly change the terrain and build Disneyland rides, and an endless population of white, brown-haired males that need to eat, drink, go to the bathroom, and be entertained. In order to survive in this unforgiving world, you must ask yourself difficult, sometimes painful, questions. Such as:Should I create a legit coaster or something to turn people into cherry pudding?Why will nobody go on my roller coaster I spent the last 2 hours making?And, most crucial of all...How did I lose all my damn money?!Roller Coaster Tycoon. Your Decisions will shape the amusement park around youFor real, if you didn't play this game (or one of the sequels) as a kid, something went wrong in the system. Sorry to break it to ya.			"

												Roller Coaster Tycoon: Deluxe is an isometric tycoon game where you manage your own them park. Not just one, but each of the game's 70+ scenario is a different park. The scenarios get broken into four different categories: original, loopy landscapes, corkscrew follies, real life parks and extra parks. There is no fast forward button, so you're stuck going at the same pace. A game year would be an hour of real life time and several scenarios go between 3 - 4 hours. Each scenario has success conditions like have X amount of people in your park by year 3 with a rating of over 600. Others are more complex like double the park value without taking out a loan. Then after the time expires, you can keep playing if you'd like. There is around 210+ hours of game in these scenarios.As the manager of the theme park, you can plop down rides. From there, you can paint them, change their music and entrances. Even change different options on each one like how many times does a Ferris wheel go around? You'll build walkways to get to places and lanes to get to ride entrances. Without lanes no one will stand in line. The longer the lanes, the longer people need to wait in line. You can even raise and lower terrain, add water all at a price.The joy here is designing your own tracks. Roller coasters, go carts, flumes, slides and every other type of track. The game comes with premade tracks, but you can design your own as you go. Couture them to your land, have them dive into tunnels, over walkways. Heck design them to launch the trains off the track to kill people. This is your game, you do what you want. Just don't expect anyone to ever ride a crashed roller coaster again. You can even take away bridges to drown your patrons.Building the tracks is fun, there are a lot of roller coasters to chose from. Standing steel, sitting steel, inverted steel, wooden, twisting steel, diving coasters that can drop at 90 degree angles, hanging steel and far too many others to list. Different rides have different needs. Some need to be a smoother ride with less sharp turns. Others like the wild mouse roller coaster need sharp turns everywhere. The only down side is you make it as you go. There is no way to construct your perfect coaster, then add it into the game like you can with Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. You can still save any track design to your premade tracks to use at a different time.Each ride has stats broken into three categories, excitement, intensity and nausea. Every patron has their own stats. If they're looking for something calm, intense or exciting. If your ride is 18 loops back to back with an excitement stat of 23, but an intensity level of 23, don't expect many riders. If rides are too gentle, like kid slides and bumper cars, you'll hear about it. You need to pace things, blend gentle rides next to thrill rides. The more nauseating the ride, the more people will throw up unless you have enough benches outside the ride exit for them to sit down on.If someone throws up, you'll need to hire handymen to clean it up. They'll also water gardens, mow grass, empty trash cans and so on. You can even set the land they cover. When your rides break down, you will need mechanics not just to fix them, but inspect them. This ensures rides run with less down time and no one randomly dies due to brakes cutting out and one trains smashes into another. There are security guards for when patrons get too angry. Costumed characters can get hired to keep people happy while they're waiting in line.Decorations also boost patron enjoyment. Plant flowers near walkways, statues near lines, plants and trees next to rides. Its all up to you. Decorations next to a ride will slightly increase its excitement value. For the most part, designing a ride track under, over and next to either itself or a different ride will boost its excitement level. With enough effort, you can make a merry go round into an exciting ride, but its easier to make anything else in the park exciting.There is a thought view of everyone in the park, so you can determine what the people want. Are they hungry? Thirsty? Sick? Do they need to 'go?' Well then build food stalls, drink stalls, benches and bathrooms. There are a lot of different stalls and you can set the price on everything in the park including setting all your drink stalls to charge the same price. Not just that, but there are plenty of merchandise stalls full of things for your patrons to buy when they're happy enough.So how do you get different stalls, rides, coasters and decorations? You devote X amount of dollars each month to ride development. Minimum, medium, maximum or no funding at all. This will be how quickly you'll unlock something for the park you're managing. There are even check boxes for what you want to research. Gentle rides, thrill rides, roller coasters, shops & stalls, scenery and ride improvements. Ride improvements are simple things like putting a wooden roller coaster train backward.The game is very flexible when it comes to finances. Each scenario will usually start you off with a hefty bank loan that has minimal interest. You can get a bank loan up to a certain amount, depending on the scenario. Having money always lets you keep playing and growing. If you outgrow your park, then just buy land tile by tile. Its a little tedious, but whatever. Sometimes you need to buy rights to have your coasters go over roads, because you can't buy the land itself. While you can charge money for each ride, you can also make them all free with a park entry fee. Some scenarios force you to do certain things financially. The restrictions, coupled with the different parks make it interesting. Instead of just having the perfect park over and over again.On top of that, there is promotion for your park. Pay X amount for park or ride marketing for X number of weeks. Free ride vouchers, free food, half price entry for the park and so on. Its all to draw people in when you need it. Without patrons you can't make money, but all you really need are fresh rides. Old rides start breaking down more often. People visit them less in favor of newer rides. No one wants to spend $4 to ride your 3 year old roller coaster and so on.The patrons themselves seem pretty dumb. They'll walk in circles, so I've found straight lines are the best way to get them around the park. In one of the expansions of the deluxe version, there is a no entrance sign that you can post. People can't enter, but they can come out. Its helpful, especially for scenarios that start you in a park that has dozens of paths. Patrons get lost and start destroying things.I've owned Roller Coaster Tycoon for 15+ years. Its one of the first PC games that I bought with my own money after playing the 3 scenario demo. Not just that, but then I proceeded to buy all the expansion packs. I've completed the game on 5 different computers. I am big into management and tycoon games and I think this is one of the best if not the best.Even though a lot of people enjoy Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 more for its much larger parks, I still like the original better. I still feel its the best management game, but I can understand that the game can play itself at some point. You can walk away for two hours and come back with the scenario completed. Unless of course a roller coaster explodes or something. Its a relaxing low stress game, even if you're put in charge of a place that people could die... and you can kill them.			"

												One of the best PC games ever made. I originally got this game back in 1999 when it was first released, and 16 years later it's still fun to play. The Steam version also comes with both expansion packs.The game had amazing optimization for its time. It ran smooth on a 400 MHz Celeron, even with a huge park. Chris Sawyer is a programming genius for making the game run so well. It still works on modern systems too, and runs flawless on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.There is a large variety of different rides to build, and you can build your own roller coaster designs. There are also lots of different scenarios to play and unlock, each with their own goals.The only downsides to this game are the lack of mod support, and that there is no sandbox mode. There are, however, a few scenarios with unlimited money, though they still have goals you have to reach, and failing them will result in your park being permanently closed.Still, it's an amazing game, even to this day. I would recommend if you enjoy building simulators and/or theme park management games, or just for the nostalgia if you played it years ago.			"

												-=| works with windows 10 |=-Ah, yes Rollercoaster Tycoon what a great gameI doubt I have to tell you what this game is you either played it when you were young or you've seen the pictures and or video's. but if you have lived under a rock in a nutshell you build your own park you can just place alot of premade structures and roller coasters or you can build your own coasters.1 thing is for sure RC1 and RC2 are great RC3 not so much you can see it was made by someone elseI just love the fact that in RC1 you can both charge your customers at the entry as for the ridesin RC2 this is no longer possible but RC2 has more rides and customizations Also don't hire security you don't need them if you find angry visitors smashing your benches, garbage cans and street lights just pick them up and trow them in the lake, that will teach em!

												A classic! I just wish the resolution options were up to date.2014-05-26: The game has a few shortcomings, being as old as it is. Some things I think might make the game more up-to-date are:- Widescreen support- Buildings where staff spend their stand-by time, instead of having your staff trekking all around the park. This applies to technicians in particular.- Ability to choose elevation when placing buildings- Mouse wheel zooming- More/improved customer/visitor statistics and information overviews- Better feedback on game mechanics like customer happiness, popularity and satisfaction.- More detailed economic insight/control, including salaries, maintenence costs and infrastructure.

												As a game from my childhood, I may or may not hold some bias in favor of this game.However, this will not be evident in my review. Let's answer some questions.""What is this game?""Rollercoaster Tycoon is a franchise where the player becomes an amusement park owner with the power to create tracks, customize everything from the terrain and decor to the ride names and colors, and even charging people to use the BATHROOM. Great idea. Think the sims, but without families and more workers and rides.""Any ACTUAL skills I can get from this game?""Yes. Balancing out a budget is seen by the money amount you are given in loans. These allow you to buy rides, stands, construct in general, advertise, et cetera. These loans CAN be paid off so you can run the park and not have your money taken away every month for loans. Also, there is keeping things cleaned/organized. The park gets awards based on how you run it, ranging from ""Safest Park in The Country"" to ""Worst Looking Park"". In order to keep good PR, you want to hire some handymen who sweep up all the vomit and trash people leave lying around.""Anything popular come out of this game?""I WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDEI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDEI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDEI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE""Why not just RCT3?""RCT3 is just, eh. It's hard to explain. RCT3 is not a bad game at all, trust me, I own that one as well and its fantastic. But, it will never have the same bouncy feel the early ones do. RCT3 is more calming and orderly. RCT 1 and 2 are bouncy, chaotic, and generally more enjoyable. In the earlier games, you get more of a RCT feel and less of a Sims. The gui in RCT3 even looks like the Sims. Still tho, try both and see which is your cup of tea.""DLC?""get out""Any bugs?""The game is being updated constantly due to being on steam, mainly in language support from what I've seen, but that doesn't mean its lost some if its old bugs. Sometimes, mechanics pay no attention to rides and they just get fixed on their own by some means. Guests still just wander off park when you delete the path they're on instead of finding another path. RCT was made in 1999, so its not really a suprise when these things happen. You just have to push them in the right direction and it's all figured out (by that I mean pick them up and throw them at the ride's enterance until they get it RIGHT).""Is the music good?""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ yes.You can set music differently for each ride, so if you don't appreciate one song, just pick another!----------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, get this game. You will not regret it.			"

												As a kid I would always start off every park I made by hiring 5 or so handymen, in preparation for the onslaught of puke and overfilled garbage bins the park would soon be plagued with. And yet, I always made sure to remove the ""mow grass"" from their job descriptions; keeping it meant your handymen would be off mowing instead of doing everything else. And yet, I always felt bad for the grass; was it really right to neglect it, simply because of a minor inconveniance to my park? So I always hired one more than I needed, and made his only job being to mow grass. 35$ monthly, earned solely through his sweat and his lawnmower. Off in the unexplored regions of the park, where nobody can even see the grass he's mowing. I always made sure to give him a absurd name.Around 10 years later, I find myself tracking Dorkle's adventure through the wilderness, chronicling his neverending battle against the grass, as I try to find a good spot for the next ferris wheel.10/10 would relive cherised childhood memories again.

												A charming and timeless game, Rollercoaster Tycoon will continue to please the young at heart and theme park fans today. The Pre-Rendered graphics still hold up to this day better than most games of it's time. The most impressive thing about this game is the development of it. It was programmed by one man; Chris Sawyer. The highlight of this game is seeing your guests come off your ride enjoying themselves. It is a very rewarding experience. That's not to say this game is without faults. One of the bigger problems is the limitation of scenery. This was however fixed in the game's sequels, and if we go into nitpicking, there are problems with the janitors only mowing grass (which can be easily fixed by checking a box). These things can be overlooked however and I believe that this entry in the series is by far the most rewarding. I haven't sunk as many hours into this game as the other entries but that doesn't mean I haven't had fun the entire time, grinning like an idiot ear to ear8/10			"

												Definitely takes me back to when I was a kid and first got into PC gaming.  If you enjoy building, this is the game for you.  If you enjoy management, this is the game for you.  If you love charging people $20 to go the the bathroom, or sending them to their doom on death coasters, than this is DEFINITELY the game for you.			"

												RCT Deluxe is one of those rare old gems that, no matter how much people try, has yet to have a spiritual successor fully recapture its essence or innovate in a meaningful way, and the reason for that is in the game's fundamentally brilliant design: it's a concise, well-balanced blend of extreme customization and structural rigidity, two seemingly-conflicting ideals that are perfectly intertwined. Coaster design, park layouts, scenery, and other aspects offer near-infinite variety, but the isometric view and deceptively simple and intuitive grid system offers a very acute precision to coaster refinement that allows a player to master the art of designing and redesigning coasters.The game's primary focus is on the creation of your very own amusement parks in one of dozens of locations, each with their own distinct goals. To be successful, one must learn how to keep their guests happy by providing them with an assortment of pre-built rides, stalls, and utilities as well as custom roller coasters and other rides that the player must design using a user-friendly ride editing tool. This and other tools offer the player complete control over the ride's track, trains, thematic elements, and price. The player must be considerate of their guests' ride preferences, as every section of track and the overall route will affect three ride statistics: excitement, intensity, and nausea. Learning to design coasters with these stats in mind is a fun and challenging puzzle in itself, and it has a major impact on a park's overall success.Beyond the fundamentals, after the game eases the player into the basics of park management, each new unlocked park objective teaches a new skill and provides new challenges for the player to test their ability to adapt. The absurd amount of campaigns, contents, rides, scenic options, and other items allows for literally hundreds of hours of fun just to get through all the campaigns at least once, and no two feel alike. Furthermore, while certain methodologies and techniques are sometimes encouraged, the game allows for all sorts of individualistic play styles and different approaches to the same hurdles, so it always feels like strategic and creative problem-solving, not memorization or repetition. Challenges are always present, but they are fair and well-crafted in their structure, so you are always encouraged to improve. Visually, the game has aged extremely well, and the sprites and assets all look and function beautifully. The game is coded in Assembly, so modding will likely not be an option, but the game's performance is always top-notch. Be sure to check that this version of the game is compatible with your OS before you buy it, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It has superb replayability and is always as fresh and exciting as the first time you played it as a little kid. If anything, it's probably more enjoyable today, given the ability to revisit and appreciate the complexity of the game's design with the mental sharpness that comes with adulthood.Granted, there are occasional small issues with path-finding and staff location assignment as well as the occasional imprecision of the algorithms for calculating ride stats. However, none of these concerns are close to game-breaking, and a bit of extra forethought and experimentation can avoid most if not all of the effects of these, thus the limitations of the game encourage you to work more effectively within those limits. For example, careful planning of main paths, kiosks, queue lines, and facilities can ensure that guests' needs are catered to, and assigning staff locations based on footpath traffic and ride exit access can ensure that rides and paths are always maintained in a timely manner. As of this review, I've clocked over 100 hours into this game, and I absolutely cannot wait for the next 100 hours.My final rating is 9.8 out of 10. This game was a labor of love, and it really shows.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon was a freakin' staple of my childhood.I would spend HOURS building torture devices--I mean roller coasters--that would scare the bajeezus out of Chuck Norris.  Here are some of the high points of the game:--Ability to charge insane prices to use the bathroom.--Drown patrons who dare to complain about the high price of using the toilet.--Practice physics by building rollercoasters that launch people to their deaths (velocity and speed are key).--Employ ""Sad Pandas"" to entertain people dumb enough to wait in lines for a hedge maze.--Find ducks.  Click on them.--Place a balloon stand and charge $15 for a balloon only to pop it after a patron buys one.It's the simple joy of disgruntled customers that keeps me coming back for more after all these years.Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												This is another game that I had on a CD in which my little brother used to throw around as a frisbee. Which therein made me buy a virtual copy so he couldn't touch it. I have spent countless upon countless hours on this game. My oldest brother who rarely played video games played this. My sister who never plays video games played this. Even my dad spent half an hour trying to figure the game out before saying he had something better to do. RollerCoaster Tycoon may have been the first park simulator game (arguably). RollerCoaster Tycoon is a park simulator game (an old one I should add). You are a manager of a park and call all the shots. When you first start on a map, there may be trees in your way or uneven land preventing you from building properly. Not a problem. Trees can be removed and dirt can be manipulated at your whim (for a nice price of course :)! Alternatively, you may build underground. Basic rides such as a merry go round, track-carts and a pirate ship may be available. You may further your parks research and choose specifically what you want to be researched.I personally go after the thrill rides first and try to acquire go-karts as they are a money maker! My first piece of advice would be to go to the research tab and ensure that you are maximizing (the research) and choose what you would like to be discovered. If you don't like my idea, heck makes some new roller coaster, scenery or even a new food kiosk! The rides get pretty crazy after some research and some new insane roller coasters (like suspended ones) come out. Be mindful of your designs. Some guests don't like rides that cost too much, are too long, are too short, are too intense or not intense enough. I haven't quite figured out the scheme to build a successful roller coaster but I found simple concepts that use gravity instead of using manual rails to get your roller coaster to a height is preferred. Some types of roller coasters (or rides like the log flume for instance) give only a certain amount of flexibility regarding their construction. Some coasters allow for tight turns while some need extra wide turns. Some (like the steel roller coasters) can do helix's and loops! Information kiosks are also available to sell your customers umbrellas and maps of your park. Additional scenery items can also be placed by the player (and unlocked as mentioned) such as trees, gardens, statues, fountains, benches and even garbage cans. Benches by exits of thrilling rides are exceptionally needed as some guests may have to puke. While sitting down, they slowly recover and you don't have to pay as much for an extra handy man. There are service staff that can be hired, most notably mechanics and handymen. Handymen will keep your park clean and will water the gardens whereas mechanics do inspections on rides and fix them as needed. Guests and rides in the park can be clicked on to get feedback (as in was it fun, what is this person thinking, what is this person thinking about this particular ride etc...). Almost anything can also be renamed (including guests) and admission costs to get into the park can be modified. Parks come in different sizes, shapes, colors and location. RCT works off a grid system making it quite easy to build what you need to build. The graphics are not quite outdated but will be bothersome to a few. A full screen resolution is available and should work on most to all monitors. I think the game play will outweigh the graphics on this one. Sounds are pretty varied except for the screams coming from the people on the rides and the noise of the rides themselves.The game was pretty big back in the day, still sort of is. It may take a bit of time to build up and get your park to a steady standard. To some, that wait is definitely worth it. (Game rating back in the day 8.2/10)RATING : 7.1/10 Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B Overall  B "

I can't think of many other games that people actually still play on a daily basis because it's still as fun as it was released so many years ago and also able to compete with today's similar games. I can only hope that the new coming RCT World will be worthy of stepping in the footsteps of this magnificent game.			"

												Where to begin? RollerCoaster Tycoon is arguably the best tycoon game of all time. The game's development was mostly credited to only one man (Chris Sawyer), and was released in 1999. There were four games that defined my childhood. The Sims, Age of Empires II, Dungeon Keeper 2, and this.RollerCoaster Tycoon truly gives you the power to make exactly the kind of amusement park you want to build. Even in the scenarios, it largely feels like a free building game; the game does not ask you to do anything you don't want to do. For example, instead of asking you to build a park based on nothing but rollercoasters like some games might have implemented, Rollercoaster Tycoon simply plops you down on a plot of land and basically says, ""Get this many guests and have a good park rating in three years. Have fun and buh-bye!"" This game should be truly applauded for being a tycoon game that is not only great fun, but never turns into a chore by forcing you into situations where you feel you're only doing something to beat a level. It gives you an end goal, and it's up to you, the player, to decide exactly how you'll get there.The game allows you to build your own rollercoaster, water slide, log flume, monorail, railroad (and many more) designs from scratch, which gives you endless possibilities in each level (and you will be playing levels over and over again simply for the fun of doing them multiple ways). You can build these rides around one another, underground, over water...there are few limitations. You can also decide what color themes each ride has (or not), even down to making each car in a rollercoaster train a different color. Also, put shops and food stalls around your park and decide how much to charge. You can even charge for guests to use the bathroom, bringing out the greedy capitalist in each of us (I usually make a profit over running costs with my bathrooms, charging just $0.10 per visit).You can even name guests and track them, which brings another level of fun to an already ridiculously great game. Read a guest's thoughts, pick him up and drop him in front of a ride you think he'll like, see what things he's bought from your park that are in his inventory. Hey, you can even drop him in a lake if he's so angry he's potentially messing with your park rating and drown him. It's up to you!RollerCoaster Tycoon is also, in my opinion, better than its sequels. Other than some rides not being available in some levels, it will never revoke your abilities. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, there were levels where you had to meet a scenario goal without charging any entry fee for your park, for example, which only ended up taking freedom from the player's hands while pushing itself into the ""chore tycoon"" category. RollerCoaster Tycoon never crosses that line.In summary, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a fantastic classic game that is perfect as it is. While the graphics may be simplistic by today's standards, it would be simply ignorant to pass up the game because of it. This game is fun, relaxing, rewarding, timeless, and close to flawless. If you don't yet own this game, pick it up. Otherwise, the only one who is missing out is you. ;)			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon: Deluxe is a classic. A classic that I grew up with, and was amongst the very first games I've played in my life, so it was an instant buy for me, alongside RCT2.Here, like the games after it, you manage a theme park, and try to keep the rating as high as possible, and basically keep your visitors happy. (And if you so wish drown those who don't like your park, just to set an example)It's a fairly simple, and straight forward game that you can sink many, many hours into trying to manage your park, create the ultimate rollercoasters, and keep profit up at the same time. This game, unlike it's successor Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, has unlockable scenario's. You start with several scenario's, and work your way up (or down) from that, trying to get to the very bottom of the list. There's three lists of unlockable scenario's. One for the vanilla game, and the other two are from the expansions Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes, so if you're a completionist; you'll be sinking many, many hours into it!Other than that, the game has aged very well since when it was released back in 1999. So do you like managing parks, creating rollercoasters, completing scenario's to progress and having countless of hours of fun? Then throw your money at the screen and buy this game already!I give this game a definite 9/10, truly a wonderous game!			"

												You know the game, don't you my old(?) gamer friends. Basically the best tycoon game EVER! So I wrote this review especially for the end of discussion. If you not decided yet(between this one and the RC2 TTP), my advise is you must choose this game. Beside the building system(with the scenery it is the one of few things that better on RC2) original is simply the better than its sequel. We all love the design rollercoasters i know that, but we also love the missions and achievement. At RC2 the missions ar meaningless, unfinishable and less fun. So if you can't buy the two of them (i ignore the bad one-RC3) you must choose this one. With the expansion packs, it's a real gem. Believe me i've played those two games for years. You won't regret. 10/10			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon is a game where you make an amusement park and build your own rollecoasters and such. The game was originally going to be Transport Tycoon 2, but then it was changed to RollerCoaster Tycoon because he wanted to make roller coasters instead, and so It wasn't Transport Tycoon 2.Pros:-It's flipping rollercoaster tycoon-A fun little game indeed. Especially the bad things you can do, like charge $20 to use a bathroom, Rename your peeps, and especially DEATHCOASTERS-Both DLC packs are included (Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes)Cons:-Limited to 1024x768, in 4x3 ONLY. (Sorry, 1080p gamers!)-Game might give trouble to Windows 8/8.1 users (Works fine for me and I'm on 8.1...)-No sandbox modes, sadly. But finish the objective and you might as well do whatever the hell you want, but no infinite cash.			"

This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												This is a very wholesome game and nothing bad happens in it. You definitely can't open half-built roller coasters for business or imprison park-goers who think critical thoughts about your park on island pillars and just watch their stupid little faces get redder and redder as they realize their doom and wail ""I want to go home!"" into eternity.Also the janitors are extremely competent and definitely know what a puddle of vomit looks like.

												""The first installment of the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise is a true example of an instant classic.""A genre I play and like a lot are the simulation games: the SimCity series, Theme Park and Transport Tycoon Deluxe are good examples of the early games in this genre. Transport Tycoon was Chris Sawyer's first simulation game created in 1994 and obsessed by roller coasters, he created RollerCoaster Tycoon. And still after more than 20 years this game is great and for me the best in the series.The goal of the game is simple: built an amusement park including the biggest, fastest and baddest roller coasters you have ever seen. This goal repeats itself 21 times, but the different surroundings and kinds of rides and roller coasters make it a very addictive game. Each scenario, you start with a budget and a loan for building the first rides of your theme park to attract people. You can give each ride a name, price and different colours which is fun to do. When building a ride you can choose from a few standard designs, but building and designing a custom design is the way for having a real challenge.Besides placing rides, you have to have personnel to watch over your theme park. You will need handymen, mechanics, security guards and entertainers for every issue that may occur with the hundreds of sloppy visitors. They vomit, throw garbage, demolish the rides and scenery and are not happy. Well, not always. You can hire enough personnel placing them in your park and they will walk just around or you can hire less personnel and then assign a route to them. The last option has the advantage that for example the mechanics are on time to inspect and/or repair a ride, but it takes more time planning the routes. It is up to you.As I am not a roller coaster fanatic and therefore do not know all the sorts and names of the turns and stuff, building one is so much fun. How good your coaster is going to be, depends on the amount of money you have to spend. That is an easy rule, but there 3 ratings that can make or kill your coaster. These are the nausea, excitement and intensity rating. A good score on all three, extreme not included, will attract lots of visitors. And a good score on these ratings will cost you. Building above and undergrounds is possible. Building undergrounds is pretty difficult, because it is sometimes hard to see where your entrance path or coaster is.The graphics and sound are great. The lovely tiny people walking around, the rides and coasters you see are detailed and colourful. Menus are easy to use: the different sorts of rides and the flora and fauna are categorized into tabs.Overall it is a true fun and very addictive game.Ratings:Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 8,5/10			"

												I cannot tell you how happy I am that Steam doesn't show you the amount of hours I have spent on this game as a kid, and I am somewhat glad. I had this game waaaay back when it first came out, on my Windows DOS machine. This was the game of my childhood, and I couldn't tell you how happy I was when I discovered that it had been released to work on newer generation computers. Anyway, this game is great if you like to build, and then run the show. It's a pixel game, so it's similar to the likes of theme hospital, or any of these ""tycoon"" themed games. The aim is to create a thriving theme park, and keep your guests happy. Pretty much everything is customisable, and you can also create your own roller-coasters, which I had hours and hours and hours of fun with as a kid. I was also really impressed with the ""Real Life Parks"" option when creating a new game. I chose Alton Towers, and was surprised to see a very impressive recreation of the famous UK park - someone, somewhere, has a lot of spare time!This game is great for people who like to create and innovate. It's a fun, bright, colourful & an interesting game, and rest assured you'll be following my footsteps and playing this for hours and hours after you've bought it. This game never really goes out of date, because every game you play is different!			"

												I played this game a heck of a lot when I was little on my family's old Windows XP computer. My sister showed me these awesome tips and tricks you can use in the game and I still use them to this day. After switching to a gaming PC from my Mac, the first game I thought of putting on it was Rollercoaster Tycoon. Unfortunately, I had lost the main installation disk despite having the Loopy Landscapes expansion. So I looked around on Steam and found this. Those $6 for nostalgia was worth it. I don't play it as much as I used to, but when I get bored (And don't have any internet) this is the game I go to.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 1, a game we waited 6 years after RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum came out in 2008. This is my favourite PC game since i always played this game when i was a kid and with my sister. RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 had to bring most peoples childhood which is why this game is 1 reason to love. You just bought a plot of land or a park with rides already in it, its your job to making enough profit, get enough people (its not easy guys) and.... watch people die (your messed up if you choose to do that. The game is mostly about patient if you dont have any, than your kinda screwed. If you choose to ignore the objective than have fun playing an endless game even if you beat the park level. Your guests are kinda messed up since they literally puke on the ground. You need janitors, mechanics, security guards to make your park safe and get awards which increase your chance to get more people.I give this game 10 out of 10 since there is nothing wrong with this game and since this is a deluxe version, they fixed some bugs from the 1st version. Please this game is extremlly fun, I literally have to thank 1 of my friends cause they gifted to me :)			"

If you like build your owen Park, then this is a must have. graphic are outdated but who cares about graphic on an old game?  Buy it on a sale and you will spend a lot of hours on it. Its a bit buggy on Steam (I owen Retail and Steam Edition) but I can live with that and there are a few easy fix how to play the game on fullscreen. (maybe not 1920x1080).I`m using Windows 7, 64bit and game runs well on my Laptop. No lags, no freezes, no blackscreen.  Only thing not working is Steam overlay. You can do screens with pressing on Save Button and then ""Screenshot"", you will get an PXC file, If you cant open it on Paint use IrfanView and you can save your PXC Pictures to JPEG.For me a 9 of 10			"

												In the 1 and a half days of owning this game, I spent over 10 hours in it.Send help.PLEASE.EDIT:Since this has actually gotten a surprising amount of attention, I'll actually write a proper review.RTC is an isometric management game made by the ever so wonderful Chris Sawyer, who is an absolute genius when it comes to these types of games. The focus of this game would be the missions, which usually requires you to have at least a certain number of guests, and at least a certain park approval rating.On the first couple missions, there's hardly anything pre-built, or in your way, so you can just keep playing those on a loop, or continue them after you win to build the park of your dreams. Some of the later missions have a lake or something in your way, or maybe a park with rides in it already. It adds nice challenge, but I prefer the empty ones.If you like management games, this is a must have for your Steam library! If not, but you're curious, I recommend watching a couple videos on it, plus with the refunds now there's hardly any risk.			"

												The best classic game ever!More realistic than you might think:-Attractions break down (and might even crash)-Reliability and popularity decreases over time-Guests won't ride too intense coasters-View the cash spend and remaining of every single guest-Start with noting, take a loan and make profit-Set ride fees according to ride popularity and entry fee-A lot of choices: free attractions/high park entry fee or free entry/expensive rides (or ask money for both ofcourse, which is not possible in RCT2)-Small trains lose speed faster than long trains, and rollercoasters are faster with guests riding on it-Advertising your park brings a lot a new visitors-Cheaper coaster types attract less guests-Choose what you want to research-Design your coasters correctly to make it worth every single cent-Understand your guests, and become the ultimate rollercoaster tycoon! A must have for any strategy fan!(is there any way to add the hundreds hours played on the cd-version to my play time?)			"

												Mr Bones wild ride never ends... This game is really what you make of it. You can play it seriously, aiming for the objectives; but you can also have fun making epic rollercoasters and other rides, and killing sims with doomsday devices as well as getting them lost in endless mazes. Or you can theme an amazing looking park where everything works perfectly together.Objectively speaking, the isometric view has its ups and (mostly) downs, and the AI is just horrible. There's a LOT of waiting around if you're a good player. To us older fans, it's part of the charm, but I guess newer players can't be expected to be so enthusiastic.			"

												Roller coasters are life. RCT makes me so very happy; this game was a childhood classic for me and I still go back to it every time. I remember the first time a roller coaster exploded in front of my eyes (Diamond Heights pre-built coaster BS), it was magical and 16 people died.First of all the price is currently ridiculous for what you get. Only $6.49 CA DAMN! Even when it was first released it didn't cost nearly as much as one would expect after having played the game.To play the main parks it takes approx 50 hrs (give or take), this doesn't include the other 2 WHOLE EXPANSIONS that it comes with, each of which appear to take just as long AND the other 5 additional bonus parks ontop of that (3 of which are modeled off real-world parks). I don't think anyone could ask or even think to ask for better value.So happy I might actually die :)The only downside is that its not usually very challenging once you get the basics down (Rainbow Valley insanity being my main exception to this). I mean, yeah, every now and then it throws you for a loop by causing a coaster (or one time a water slide WTF?) to explode 2 months before your objective is due; but after the first couple of parks you should know how to deal with inspection times, mechanic requirements, accessibility, and PR making this a rare and manageable occasion. I remain hopeful that the expansions will add some pizazz to the game play (as I have never had the chance to play the explansions until now) but even if it does not, the game itself is just so satisfying when you achieve your goals and all your little people clap for you and release their balloons that they bought with their own little money into the air in celebration of your momentous achievement!

												You have to go back to the classics, by far one of my favorite Roller Coaster tycoon games from the franchise to date! Build rollercoasters of such high intensity and make rides in a weired way so more people go on them, however you play the game does not matter, if you like the way you play it is what matters. Hire staff members to keep your facility clean, and if you like murder whenever someone pukes... DROWN THEM!!! So much to do, so much to see, make monster rollercoaster, charge way to much for a merry-go-round, make the umbrellas expensive so everybody has to spend their well earned money on them which makes you rich $$$. Or play the normal way, make a well balanced rollercoaster, sell everything at original value for high ratings, build all types of rollercoasters for different intensity levels... but the game itself is never holding back, so just come on in!

So i recommend this game to anyone you wants to drown all of your guests, (and of course have fun)			"

												I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon relatively new in 1999 and I don’t really recall what put me in such a rush to buy it. Did I play a demo? Read a review? Was I excited about an upcoming trip to Six Flags Great America? Some combination of the 3? The answer to that is lost with time.I wasn’t the lite-sim veteran and seeker I am today, I enjoyed Aerobiz Supersonic and the Sim City series but beyond that I hadn’t really dabbled in the genre. I’m not sure I ever played a game with such low stakes to that point. Half-Life starts with your research team breaking reality and charges you with fighting through both otherworldly creatures and a deadly serious black-ops regiment. Chrono Trigger had you traveling and attempting to save time itself. Even in Super Mario Bros. you’re chasing and fighting a large fire-breathing bipedal turtle who kidnapped a princess.In Roller Coaster Tycoon you build and manage an amusement park. Winning oft means providing people a good and affordable time and making some cash in the process. Losing means people don’t come to your park and the ones that do are let down; and you may end up in debt. Despite the low stakes, unspectacular-for-1997 graphics and the sometimes restrictive scenario structure this game is a shining jewel, a beacon to us video game fans – showing us what gaming can be.  It’s far more intuitive and engrossing than Bullfrog’s respectable Theme Park, even with added options and more freedom there’s rarely ever a reason to feel lost or stuck. Those low-res textures which are only a slight step up from Chris Sawyer’s previous gem, 1994’s Transport Tycoon, really play beautifully with each other. Rides, coasters and peeps move around in a brisk yet non-chaotic manner.Ah, those peeps – the lifeblood of the game – they look like they’re made from around 3 pixels and have less visual character than those Amiga-era Sensible World of Soccer players they share a passing resemblance to. These diminutive and faceless little blobs of color are very effectively animated and presented – green faces leading to vomit, the happy hop after a sweet ride, the quickness in their decisions to go or not go on a ride. It’s hard to to love the little guys and I can’t see why so many people enjoy ending their tiny digital lives.Later RCTs still have the effective and rewarding gameplay loop and fantastically open coaster creation and maybe even add a few more bells and whistles than the inaugural title has to offer. They never seem to add up to so much more than the sum of their parts the way RCT1 did. The sheer elegance of the base game’s level design is never reached on any other core RCT.This game is not only valuable for it’s history and influence on game design, production and marketing, it’s still danged fun to play.  It’s a must-own, must-play and is and will likely continue to remain one of the finest games ever made.			"

It's quite simple and straight-to-the-point, unlike its sucessors which got a bit too cluttered. Graphically, it hasn't aged very bad, as it's design is very minimalist, but it ain't pretty either.Overall, a good game to waste some hours on.			"

												This product has a really good value!I can't belive that my Windows 10 likes this as much as I do. This classic of the classics had no argument with my system and I can announce that I am hooked into it again. Roller Coaster Tycoon is like a theme park version of Sim City or Cities: Skylines and the thing which keeps me getting back to it over and over again is complicated but yet relatively simple design and controls, with which you design, create and manage your park. There is dozens of different maps and challenges to play and the key feature is that every playtrough is more or less different than the last because you get exact freedom to plan the overall layout and architecture and create Roller Coasters from tiny joy rides to most extreme coasters beyond this world (if you can afford it). The another cool thing is that the parks can be decorated by creating some beautiful sceneries to make your park even better experience for your customers. The management is the thing that assures that player won't feel bored at anytime - if there is not anything to build you can check that do quests have something to complain about: rides will get broken, streets need more handymen to clean up some vomits next to roller coaster ride's exit, some ride has gotten old and thus over priced etc. You also must take care that visitors have always something to eat or drink close-by.All these and various other tasks must be handled well enough to pass the maps and unlock some new ones. While all this may sound hard it is not, thanks to the ultimately successful user interface, which lets you solve things by few clicks without getting lost in hell of management windows. In my opinion this is the very feature that makes RCT1 and RCT2 better then the third installment.			"

												Oh man, here we go. Before I start my review of this game, I would just like to say that I have been a fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series ever since I started playing it when I was five years old, and the first game will always be in my memory. Alright, lets get this review on the roll.Ever wondered what it would be like to run your very own amusement park, to build rides at the click of a button, and such, then RollerCoaster Tycoon is definetly for you! RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of the best PC games of all time, and it deserves it's place in history as it. The story as to how RollerCoaster Tycoon began was when Scottish video game developer Chris Sawyer, who developed the legendary Transport Tycoon, was planning on making a sequel to the previously mentioned game, but when in the process of making it, Sawyer developed a keen interest in rollercoasters, and with that being done, he shifted his focus from that to making RollerCoaster Tycoon, and thus, a masterpiece was born.The basic gameplay of RollerCoaster Tycoon is simple. You're tasked with a specific park of your choosing, and your job there is to reach the goal that is given to you at hand without completely destroying the reputation of the park itself. This can either mean to achieve a certain park rating, amount of guests, and other such tasks that can keep you busy for a while, and with that being said and done, it's time to start building!You mainly play from a thirdperson view of the park itself, and you can build whatever you want in it, as long as you have sufficient funds. The game has a variety of different attractions to build, ranging from the gently ferris wheel, to the pulse-pounding steel roller coaster. Doing all this is very fun and addicting and can keep you occupied for a very long time. Since this is also deluxe, you'll have some extra fun with additional scenarios to play in, so you can be sure to have endless hours of gameplay. As the ""Tycoon"" that you are, building all these rollercoasters, rides, stalls, scenery, and paying all your staff in the park is costly, you'll need to be more careful with what you spend your money on, or else you'll need to start taking loans out, and that's never a good thing. With all being said and done, RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of the best games of this generation, and a must have for everyone of all ages.In conclusion, RollerCoaster Tycoon is definitely a must own, and is a materpiece that could never be remade.

												Good for throwback memories, also feels timeless. After a while you forget that you're playing a 17 year old game as everything is just so well made, so much customisation that is generally shocked me. However, bugs... I changed my screen resolution to 1024x720 and when I tried to change it back to 800x600 the game would constantly crash. I was building and creating for 2 hours and I went to save and the game window dissapeared completely with no error message or warning.Also, Achievments and Trading Cards would be pretty cool.			"

												The very first game I ever played on PC... and I still love it! It has enough content to keep you entertained for hours, and the graphics (even though they are not high-end) do NOT take away anything from this game!Plus you get to drown people, create rides that kill them, trap those who don't like your park in little enclosures, and make guests pay $15 for the restroom. So if you're not into being a nice park manager, this game is still a piece of cake ;)			"

												First time i loaded up this game in years and a wave of nostaliga hit me full in the face, i almost wept in happiness after so long!This is one of those true classic games that you can't replace, sure there have been sequels but none of them can stand on a hand or a foot to the original. Simply put this game is a product of an era where some of the best games were ever made, in the late 90's to early 00's.the graphics are not great by todays standards, but who really cares? the game is fantastic to play.You are an aspiring mogul looking to make a name for yourselves in the country by building the best, more profitable and greatest theme park around, to get you started, you get a few gentle, thrill and extreme rides along with food stalls and toilets. with the tools at your command, you go out to build that dream.It's simplistic and that works for me as far too many games these days are too complicated or have too much flash and not enough substance. this game fits all the boxes needing a tick for a tycoon game.

Rank: 7/10Recommendation(s): Don’t expect to play a classic on new systems. Play RCT2 instead.Major Theme: For the real hardcore old school gamers.Bought at Price: $1.62 (Steam Sale)I might still have the real CDs for this game (yes CDs… Not DVDs). Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 were my go to games before I joined Steam.I remember spending a lot more time on RCT2 than the first, but there are still some memorable parks in RTC1 that I still like to visit.If you are new to the older Rollercoaster Tycoon games, pick up RCT2 (and OpenRCT2 if you are using Win 10/8). You will have a lot more to play around with, RCT1 is really just for those who had it part of their childhood.The graphics are simple, the gameplay is simple. Nothing more really needs to be said about this game.			"

The most important being that it takes me back to my childhood running Windows '98 and wasting hours upon hours playing--it's very nostalgic!Honestly, the graphics don't even come close to the games we have now but while playing, I really don't have time to pay attention to how the game looks when I'm building rollercoasters and pranking the park guests >:) There's so much more to do in this game than the main goal--to build a great, successful theme park. There are so many ways to be creative from the color schemes of the rides to the beautifying placements of various designed theme park decorations/paths/shrubs/etc. You can name your guests and--I love this--punish them for being jerks.All in all, I think this game is pretty awesome.

												I have very fond memories of playing this game when I was a child. Easy to learn, but with a lot of room for improvement especially with the development of bigger and better rollercoasters (learning what works with what type of coasters). All-around a very fun game with one shortfall: a lack of different challenges for the various parks. Most of the time it's just have this many people in your park by the end of year (insert year) and a park rating of (insert park rating). However, don't let this deter you from purchasing this game. With the deluxe edition, there is at least 300+ hours of fun to be had at a low, low price. My score: 9/10. You won't be disappointed once you get the hang of it.			"

												Are you a nostalgic fheg? Then this game is for you. Re-live your days with those impressive for the time graphics and that ever so annoyingly catchy theme song. Enjoy mopping up puke and making go-kart rides that are so long people complain to get off. Complete with vomit splatters and panda costumed entertainers, this game will bring back all the good memories of what it was like to be anti-socially locked in your room while clicking away at your computer while you launch coaster riders to death into enemy parks for the sake of ratings. (Seriously who thought our childhood nightmares of rollercoasters bolting off the tracks and plummeting into a fiery death lived out would be a good idea?) Build your own coasters, complete scenarios, and plant dem flowers. Charge 5 dollars for the bathroom and laugh as people complain. Take a tip from the Sims, drown your guests in water. (WHY U NO SWIM!) Build your dream rollercoaster to only be ignored by your guests like a red-headed step-child. This game is a charming play, this isn't a re-mastered version, it's the old school stuff, so if you're looking for a newer RollerCoaster Tycoon look elsewhere. But seriously, this game is a gem, must git. 10/10			"

Making coasters and parks, trying to complete the objectives while making sure your not breaking the bank is strangly addicting. It is a game that has aged very well and continues to be just as addicting as when I was a child. I consider it a must have.			"

The second is the best but I really recommend both as there are some differences between them.

												The parts of RCT that have aged poorly:-- The visuals-- The audio quality-- The UI and menus-- The animations (which were gorgeous for their time btw)-- Just about everything that has to do with how the game looks.The parts of RCT that have aged extremely well:-- Building roller coasters is still a blast, with simple controls and lots of trial and error that legitimately pays off.-- The management part of the game is still brilliant and engrossing.-- The variety of maps and scenarios means hours of content.-- Plenty of options for personalising your park.-- Picking up customers who complain and dropping them in the water to drown them, or making them go on an unfinished or otherwise dangerous ride so they crash to their death, is still morbidly satisfying.-- Just about everything that has to do with how the game feels.In short, an immense amount of nostalgia and happy memories of playing RCT is what led me to buying and playing this in 2016. The fact that the game is still a ton of fun is what led me to play it for more than 100 happy hours in 2016. This is one of the best simulation/management games ever made, and THE definitive amusement park game, and it's a testament to its greatness that unlike many dinosaurs of turn-of-the-century PC gaming, it's still great today.

I remember basking in the glow of my old CRT monitor and gleefully building rides and attractions to stuff more people into my pixilated dream park. Now I sit down to play this game and feel that same happiness at seeing my guests throw their money into my ever-growing coffers. It seems a lot easier to win the scenarios now that I am older (and presumably wiser). At the very least Roller Coaster Tycoon Deluxe is a fun nostalgia trip. "

												When I was younger, I played this game non-stop and it was one of my favorites of all time. Having gotten older and gone back to this, I can see how it becomes repetitive, with a set amount of rides in the whole game. The challange becomes how you will design the park to make you the gamer happy, not so much the guests or the game system. But, it's still a fun game with great personality. Whenever I play this game, I get lost. I'd say this still holds up, even with it's aged flaws.			"

												This game is a whole lot of wonderful nostolgia.  I would sink endless hours into this game as a kid, and as computers got newer getting the thing to work was harder and harder. Then steam came out with this! Completely worth the 6 bucks! And it even has the 2 expansion packs to boot! This game is old, so bear in mind it's isometic rather than 3D so if you are used to a free-form camera you may need a moment to adjust to having it locked at 90 degree angles. However, I never found myself struggling to place objects because of the camera. The AI is.... not the best.  Your park layout has to be, for the most part, a strait line or a large circle.  Otherwise your park guests get lost. However, I don't find this takes away from the game. Placing information kiosks and using monorails or chairlifts help with this ""guest 102 is lost and can't find the park exit"" nonsense.A great feature is any alert it gives you, good or bad, you can bring the camera to that spot. Lost guest? pick him up and show him the park exit.  Despite it's age the coaster design part of the game is still my favorite.  A good variety of coasters, options, designs, I can truly build the monster coasts of my dreams. And make incomplete ones that rocket guests to their dooms like a total sadist.  If you were a fan of the game a a kid, totally dive back in it's a wonderful game.  And to anyone curious about trying it for the first time, it's an excellent simulation game and you really can let your creativity shine.  ONLY issue I ever encountered: The game will strobe if you have the program F.lux running. This is a program to dim your monitor to yellow-toned colors at night to reduce eye strain.  But it's incompatible with this game. All you need to do is disable F.lux before firing up the game and you will have zero issues.			"

												This game definitely has some flaws, but it has not aged a single day since it was released. It is just that good. Really the only question here is, Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 or Rollercoaster Tycoon 2? I would recommend buying RCT2 instead of this one. RCT2 is a better game overall, and the modding community (particularly OpenRCT2) for RCT2 is going strong. OpenRCT2 is just amazing, it adds so many upgrades including multiplayer. So while RCT1 is good, definitely buy RCT2 instead.			"

												For me, a person who has play this back during it's early release, this game does not lose its fun easily. The scenarios may be very easy for awhile, but overall it is very fun and enjoyable, and a good learning experience for those who like to build their own rides within the game! Anyway, let's get to the breakdown for it.Gameplay: 7.5/10This game holds a simple but fun hold of its gameplay. To keep it short and simple, it takes the standard overview ""god"" role to building things, and allows you to monitor everything and do as you will. While it is a relatively common style, it fits well.Sound: 8/10The roller-coasters available in this game for the most part have very good sounds built around them, as is the music of the rides you can choose. However, the smaller rides (minus the Haunted house and rides without a cart and/or moving vehicle) like the Ferris wheel and the Merry-Go-Round have no sound around them if the music is turned off. Whether it was intentional or not, it's not really that big of the deal, the sound still is very good.Graphics: 9/10For its time, the graphics were built very high-end, especially the rides. The detail put around the scenery and the texture of the land is pretty amazing for its original release, but the people seem to have been left out of this small loop, like they have gotten just a tad bit lazy. It's not really that bad though, and is truly a great sight for its age!Controls: 6/10The controls consist of a simple click-and-go kinda game. For the most part that is it, but you can hot-key many things, like closing windows, screenshots, opening the tabs available and even for seeing through the ground. The hot-keying is almost a necessity for those looking to do things very quickly, as the clicking can be very burdensome when doing many things you are trying to do. The hot-keys save it, though.Overall: 7.6/10 (Pretty Good)This game certainly holds its head up high for those who look into tycoon games from many angles. A few things here and there can get a little bothering, but overall it's a solid slate, and I would recommend it for anyone willing to try it out!			"

												I remember playing this with my mom as a kid and I could never get past some of the harder scenarios. Now that I've come back to it I've been having a lot of fun getting to all of the parks I could only dream of unlocking. It does have some strategy to it, but I feel that as you go through each park you learn something new about the game. I lost my original disk, so when I saw that it was on steam for such a low price I bought it immediately.There's only a few problems, most of them technical.1) steam overlay and screenshots don't work, plus I have no idea where to find the built-in screenshots folder2) once you leave the game or alt-tab out, opening/minimizing/closing windows becomes weird, and the only fix I've found is to restart the computer3) there isn't a real sandbox mode. RCT2/3 are the better sandbox games, so take a look at those insteadDespite all of this though, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves building or simulation games.			"

												This game was my childhood. Every morning I would wake up, run to my parents room and ask if I could play RCT. Sure, I sucked at it and never made it past Bumbly Beaches but it was awesome. Today, I upgraded my Windows 8 laptop to Windows 8.1 and lost everything. So a really nice guy on the rct subreddit offered me the deluxe version. Sort of bittersweet since I'm a disc/cartridge purist and would rather keep my disc version but now I have all the expansions.10/10			"

												Played this game nonstop like 7 years ago, you could say I ""grew up on this game"" so my opinion is may be slightlly biased in favor of this game compared to somone who just got this a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, it's addicting and very fun, an easy way to waste hours. You run a theme park and can make a ton of rollercoasters, stand/shops, trains, farris wheels and other stuff, you can every create you own roller coaster from scratch just make sure you park go'ers enjoy it as in it doesnt make them too nausious or have the que line too long that they get tired of waiting. Very fun, especially for when it came out,. Graphics were good for the time it was released but now have a limited screen resolution rate. Don't be suprised when only half your screen is filled when you play this if your playing in 1920x1080, and this is when it is ""fullscreen"" which is the only option, there is no windowed view but really how many people actually use that. Good game, easy to put 100 hours into this game within a month.			"

												Classic but very addictive, creative and fun to play this game.Sometimes, it can be challenged when you must finish mission in certain time & you must solve the problem your theme park when the problems come out (such as the roller coaster exploded, too crowded, too dirty in theme park due nausea & litter, etc.)I have been played this game since the first time i played with Windows 98 when the first initial release (non-Deluxe version) is out in my childhood. Works like a charm with old Windows.Until now, i played this game with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. Still good & smooth as well, thought that the maximum fullscreen max resolution is only 1024x768, but it's still enjoyable to see due classic setting resolution.Overall, it's great classic game simulation.9/10			"

												After 10+ years of not having this game, I was delighted to have the oppurtunity to get this masterpiece of a game on Steam. Nothing like cleaning up barf around every spot of the theme park while trying not to propel every person on a roller coaster off into their immediate death. All in all, this is a classic theme-park build up type game with many different options and variables being thrown which way at you. I promise I wont make you pay 50$ just to get on the ferris wheel, I swear.			"

												This game is a nice upgrade from the original. My significant other purchased this for me and I was pleasantly surprised with upgrades, new maps, and buildings the original did not offer for a vanilla purchase. I love this game just as much as I did when I was younger. If you are looking for a pleasant, sandbox tycoon game, with a little spice of being able to create some amazing rollercoasters, this is definitely one to try.As for gameplay, It changes up what you have to work with with every map when it comes to terrain. Each with their own difficulty, and you don't have to play every map to unlock new ones. They offer at least five in the beginning for variety at the start. unfortunately, the rides don't vary much from map to map. It may get repetitive for some. What rides you get at the BEGINNING vary from map to map, but you will get your simple rides always first. Building a rollercoaster that people cannot get enough of is a great feeling. It is a rather rewarding game and, if you don't want to complete the objectives, you can cause a little mischief by seeing just how far you can make rollercoasters launch off their tracks and into the air.The only bad note I have is that it runs rather weird with my computer, since it is such an old game. Some text boxes don't show up, but you can still type in them, so it is not a huge problem. Maybe it will be fixed in the future.Final note: This game is a wonderful romp as any tycoon game should be. "

												I was a big fan of Rollercoaster Tycoon back in my teens, and am pleased to say this still absolutely holds up!I purchased it and loaded it up 'just for five minutes' and before I realised it several hours had passed and I was still having a great time. I didn't have any issues loading or running this, and it plays smooth and easy. I would advise you put aside a chunk of time before you start playing, as 'five minutes' can quickly become two hours as you work to unlock each new park. Highly recommend - once I've completed this one, I'll be moving on to the others!			"

												Without doubt, this is one of tbest tycoon games I have ever played.I first played this game when it was released back in 2000 and recently discovered it on Steam and fell in love with it again.The game is basically management of a theme park, which you build, either from scratch or from a starting point, depending on the scenario.  You add rides, rollercoasters, eateries, facilities, etc.  You must recruit handymen (absolutely vital as the park guests hate the site of sick on the ground!), engineers (your rides will breakdown regularly) & security guards (vandals exist you know).The best aspect though, is the designing of your rides.  Some are set, such as the Merry Go Round, but others, such as all the rollercoasters, the log flume etc, you can either accept pre set designs or have a go yourself.  Piece by piece.  There is no better reward than the self design of a monster rollercoaster that the crowds love.I use Windows 8.2 and this game runs smoothly.Buy this game.			"

												I love this game. I grew up playing this on my father's Windows 98 machine and to be able to play this again on modern hardware is amazing. That aside, it's much better than Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Having yet to play RCT2, I am willing to go as far as to say that this is the best of the trilogy. Yes, the rides and amusements are a bit dated, but that doesn't take away from the fun.There is no game speed change like in RCT3, but one park year is about 1 hour. This won't stop you from doing the scenarios in one sitting as they vary from 1 year to 5 years.			"

												The game itself is just as wonderful as I remember it being nearly a decade ago when I played it. Unfortunately, not much has been done under the hood to make the game run well on modern systems. Don't get me wrong, the game itself runs fantastically. It's just that it's not updated to run on Modern operating systems so don't expect to be able to do much while playing the game since it has to run in compatibility.It's still well worth the ticket price.

												Its a amazing game I love it so much. The only thing that I hate about it is I had my park built up very high and stuff then I started a blocked in area and called it prison. Then I started naming each prisoner binary digits. (EX. Prisoner #00001000)and then the game detected a violation of some sort and kicked me out losing all my progress :'(. Its still the most amazing simulator ive ever played even if I accidently triggered a theft violation or something. (I did not steal the game I bought it with a gift card so don't even start.)			"

												I am one of the few players to have owned Roller Coaster Tycoon since March 31st, 1999. This game IS my childhood, it wasnt a part of it, but it was my life as a child.RCT has taken a huge chunk of my life away, as I have spent thousands of hours creating parks, creating scenarios and editing custom content. And im here to tell you after nearly 16 years of gameplay, why you should buy and cherish this relic.The objective is simple. Build the theme park of your dreams. But it goes much deeper then it seems. There's staff to manage, bills to pay, capital to gain, advertisements to be used, and new rides to be build. RCT is simply not a reskin of Theme Park, it's a buisness simulator underneath a Theme Park simulator. It's extremely open ended and there is no TRUE endgame, other then beating all the parks. It is litterally endless thanks to the support of custom content and scenarios that are always popping up through the internet.Many people have complained about the steam port lacking compatibility with Windows 7/8. I have yet to run into any serious issues with the port. The only thing that HAS YET to work is the Steam Overlay, but it's to be expected.In all, Buy the game. Play it, introduce your children to it. Enjoy it.			"

												This is pure nostalgia for me.  I had this game years ago and loved it, but never did complete all the scenarios.  Saw it was out and on sale and jumped at the chance to grab it and finally complete them all. The graphics are a bit dated, and there are many more features in the later versions of the game.  But this is the one that started it all and I'm having a great time!  If you played this back in the day, you'll likely enjoy having it available in Steam.  And if you didn't play it back in the day, you might still enjoy it now.I especially like griefing the guests by drowning ones that had a particularly bad attitude.			"

It's really a fantastic game with loads of features that I didn't expect in a 16+ year old game.

												Don't let an abysmal final entry draw you away from the series.  RCT1 is as good a game as it always has been, and I daresay it's one of the greatest ever made.  When Steam offered the nomination for the ""Test of Time"" award, I thought very briefly of X-COM... then ignored that thought and went straight here.  Then I took that award back, so I could give it to the game again.==Made by a single person, and with NO ENGINE (the entire game is written in Assembly), Chris Sawyer's Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 fall under the definition of a masterpiece.  They play well, run smoothly, and have all sorts of great features that other tgames wouldn't catch up to for years.  When SimCity 2000 and 3000, and even 4 were simply running cities with fake-people sprites occasionally walking around, RCT had something only Bullfrog had succeeded in-- a management game with AGENTS.  Every single one of the people in your park are active.  When they're idle and bored, they find something else to do, and the guest count can reach well beyond even 1000 guests.  They're never inactive, the performance never tanks; it pulls off the simulation of thousands flawlessly.  IN 1998!What makes this game stand out so much from older titles, however, is the clean interface and visuals.  The isometric graphics still hold up rather well.  The performance is at a stable framerate constantly, and while I'm not sure where this cap sits, it's at least 40 FPS and never drops.  The interface is neatly organized, and every time you click a menu, it IMMEDIATELY pulls up that menu with an accompanying sound.  It also behaves like Windows, with windows appearing per menu that can be dragged around the screen freely.  It actually LOOKS like a game instead of an alien interface, something that can't be said about other classics like X-COM and Theme Hospital.Perhaps what draws me to the game the most, however, is how you're genuinely building a world in it.  It doesn't have much in terms of background music, and at first, the park feels empty; however, you start placing your rides, give them selective background music, and extend your park.  This music adds up to build an atmosphere.  Then, your new guests will make noise.  You'll hear the clanging of capitalism and greed every time a customer buys something, and your guests are louder depending on how many there are.  Coasters going downhill with passengers will have them scream.  You'll also see them very well-animated-- they'll walk around, they'll pull out umbrellas if they bought one for $20 at one of our kiosks... heh heh, they'll throw up if they get sick.  Yeah, their 'tasks?'  All based on their own selfish desires.  They'll want to be happy, need to be awake, need to use the bathroom, and can't take motion sickness.  Their actions all change based on these stats, and it's in your best interest to accompany them all.In reality, I'm making the game sound more complex than it is to play.  These mechanics are slowly introduced to you, and I played this at a very young age without a tutorial; it just doesn't suffer from the usual complexity problems of these old games.  If you need it, there's a tutorial that consists of watching someone play in real time, essentially a demo of Chris Sawyer taking over the mouse and playing for you.  You can hit Escape to take control at any time, but assuming you don't you'll get to see where all the options you need are.  In reality, however, the game won't take too long to figure out for the most part.As far as replayability value goes, you just shouldn't be concerned.  There's several challenges to go around, playing with the game rules in various ways by giving you a task and either a piece of land to build on or a prebuilt park in its early stages to improve.  You will NOT run out of content-- in all my years of playing this game, I still have yet to clear through all the scenarios, and Forest Frontiers will always be a special memory to me.====================BUY THIS GAME.  It hasn't aged at all.  It's still better than any modern sim... SimCity 5, Cities Skylines, and Planet Coaster all fall short in some areas that this game nails, despite all being good games themselves.  Its compatibility is near-perfect (and if by some odd chance you run into an issue, there's a lengthy guide detailing workarounds and solutions), and a hexeditor widescreen hack is out there if you need it.If I don't end the review here, I would ramble endlessly about all the things this game does right, but as it stands the best way to do that is to experience it yourself.  The Steam release is a simple port, true, but nonetheless the game looks and runs perfectly.  It still is a highly innovative and organized game, and few things stand in the way of showing off its strengths.  Pick it up, for your own good, and try it yourself; whether it's the full track editor allowing you to build custom rides and coasters, the atmosphere-building sound design and gameplay design decisions that help it feel like a living world, the management of your finances and distribution of staff to keep the park at max efficiency, or the morbid prospect of drowning panda-costumed staff and throwing coasters into the lake, or perhaps any combination of the two, this is a game you simply must play.

												This is pure nostalgia for me.  I had this game years ago and loved it, but never did complete all the scenarios.  Saw it was out and on sale and jumped at the chance to grab it and finally complete them all. The graphics are a bit dated, and there are many more features in the later versions of the game.  But this is the one that started it all and I'm having a great time!  If you played this back in the day, you'll likely enjoy having it available in Steam.  And if you didn't play it back in the day, you might still enjoy it now.I especially like griefing the guests by drowning ones that had a particularly bad attitude.			"

												A great blast from the past game that I had a lot of fun with in my childhood, and continue to occassionally play now. Let's you really make your own theme park the way you want too while offering some very challenging scenarios.PROS:Lots of Levels Plenty of Ride Designs you can createRetro Graphics and 'old game feel' while not taking away from the game itselfOverall, just a very fun gameCons:Time can be a bit repetive, a year in game takes an hour of real life time while playing, which some scenarious can take up to 4 years and can be a bit long/repetitive			"

Worthy of the 'Masterpiece' tag on Steam.Low learning curve; the manual is available.If a first time player: once you get past the aged graphics, and some-what odd controls, then you are ready to create the prefect park.You might not beat the first map on your first time; don't let that stop you.8/10, aged but still got it; +1 for nostalgia if applicable.

When he starts to get bored of being their God, he saved up the game at their success peak and start to fauck up every-singe-shiets and start to injure people for fun, drop kids down the lake, flew people into the mid air and explosion in the rain etc.Now that im an adult, and been playing this game constantly for the past weeks, i now understand exactly all of his effort and joy that he put into building his one of a kind roller coaster tycoon, and once its all done being game and fun, noone can stop you from being a nasty lil sheeeiitttt.

												It's time for a RollerCoaster Tycoon review, I assume.I think it was in the beginning of late 2000, when I first played this game, and back then I thought is was as fun to play as I find playing it today! Sure was a solid 14 year old nostalgic trip, when I saw this and after a while bought it. It's really great fun.I like how it plays, and all of the scenarios are well done. Though I can find a thing which I remember from the second RCT, and that is the ability to create senarios and maps on your own - a thing I yet haven't found in this version - which is a minor minus.Part from the minor dislike, I can recommend this game still, to those who are wanting to try it out! Overall, a solid 10/10!			"

Sure, the graphics are extremely simple but that is to be expected for a game of its age. Plus it does not feel terribly dated since the artwork is somewhat stylized. The only other potential downside I can see is that the gameplay can seem rather repeditive but that is to be expected from a game based on a singular purpose. Still, the number of challenge parks and the variety what you can do certainly makes up fofr this. Still love RollerCoaster Tycoon and am glad it has been added to the Steam store!			"

												I played this when I was 7, and it's still very good. Enough said.In all seriousness, nostalgia does cloud our perception, and I don't play a lot of simulation games, so I may not be the best person to review this game since I don't have much to compare it to. I haven't played more than a few minutes of the sequels and games by other companies inspired by the series like Planet Coaster. Those are probably a better option if you're looking for a modern experience, as this game definitely is a bit dated. Still, for its age, I don't feel that the UI is too clunky or the learning curve is too steep. Fun to pick up for a couple hours exactly once, or to dump days into, if you have that kind of time.I never did fully understand a lot of the roller coaster-specific mechanics, like intensity and excitement, which can be limiting when I'm trying to make a park the best it can be. The track builder is a bit clunky, too. Still, I'm a lot better at the budgeting and management aspects than I was when I was a kid, and the game can still be easy or challenging depending on the scenario. The quirks and flaws are a drop in the bucket of nostalgic goodness. Or lake. Lake of goodness, which your guests can fall into and drown.			"

												Don't let an abysmal final entry draw you away from the series.  RCT1 is as good a game as it always has been, and I daresay it's one of the greatest ever made.  When Steam offered the nomination for the ""Test of Time"" award, I thought very briefly of X-COM... then ignored that thought and went straight here.  Then I took that award back, so I could give it to the game again.==Made by a single person, and with NO ENGINE (the entire game is written in Assembly), Chris Sawyer's Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 fall under the definition of a masterpiece.  They play well, run smoothly, and have all sorts of great features that other tgames wouldn't catch up to for years.  When SimCity 2000 and 3000, and even 4 were simply running cities with fake-people sprites occasionally walking around, RCT had something only Bullfrog had succeeded in-- a management game with AGENTS.  Every single one of the people in your park are active.  When they're idle and bored, they find something else to do, and the guest count can reach well beyond even 1000 guests.  They're never inactive, the performance never tanks; it pulls off the simulation of thousands flawlessly.  IN 1998!What makes this game stand out so much from older titles, however, is the clean interface and visuals.  The isometric graphics still hold up rather well.  The performance is at a stable framerate constantly, and while I'm not sure where this cap sits, it's at least 40 FPS and never drops.  The interface is neatly organized, and every time you click a menu, it IMMEDIATELY pulls up that menu with an accompanying sound.  It also behaves like Windows, with windows appearing per menu that can be dragged around the screen freely.  It actually LOOKS like a game instead of an alien interface, something that can't be said about other classics like X-COM and Theme Hospital.Perhaps what draws me to the game the most, however, is how you're genuinely building a world in it.  It doesn't have much in terms of background music, and at first, the park feels empty; however, you start placing your rides, give them selective background music, and extend your park.  This music adds up to build an atmosphere.  Then, your new guests will make noise.  You'll hear the clanging of capitalism and greed every time a customer buys something, and your guests are louder depending on how many there are.  Coasters going downhill with passengers will have them scream.  You'll also see them very well-animated-- they'll walk around, they'll pull out umbrellas if they bought one for $20 at one of our kiosks... heh heh, they'll throw up if they get sick.  Yeah, their 'tasks?'  All based on their own selfish desires.  They'll want to be happy, need to be awake, need to use the bathroom, and can't take motion sickness.  Their actions all change based on these stats, and it's in your best interest to accompany them all.In reality, I'm making the game sound more complex than it is to play.  These mechanics are slowly introduced to you, and I played this at a very young age without a tutorial; it just doesn't suffer from the usual complexity problems of these old games.  If you need it, there's a tutorial that consists of watching someone play in real time, essentially a demo of Chris Sawyer taking over the mouse and playing for you.  You can hit Escape to take control at any time, but assuming you don't you'll get to see where all the options you need are.  In reality, however, the game won't take too long to figure out for the most part.As far as replayability value goes, you just shouldn't be concerned.  There's several challenges to go around, playing with the game rules in various ways by giving you a task and either a piece of land to build on or a prebuilt park in its early stages to improve.  You will NOT run out of content-- in all my years of playing this game, I still have yet to clear through all the scenarios, and Forest Frontiers will always be a special memory to me.====================BUY THIS GAME.  It hasn't aged at all.  It's still better than any modern sim... SimCity 5, Cities Skylines, and Planet Coaster all fall short in some areas that this game nails, despite all being good games themselves.  Its compatibility is near-perfect (and if by some odd chance you run into an issue, there's a lengthy guide detailing workarounds and solutions), and a hexeditor widescreen hack is out there if you need it.If I don't end the review here, I would ramble endlessly about all the things this game does right, but as it stands the best way to do that is to experience it yourself.  The Steam release is a simple port, true, but nonetheless the game looks and runs perfectly.  It still is a highly innovative and organized game, and few things stand in the way of showing off its strengths.  Pick it up, for your own good, and try it yourself; whether it's the full track editor allowing you to build custom rides and coasters, the atmosphere-building sound design and gameplay design decisions that help it feel like a living world, the management of your finances and distribution of staff to keep the park at max efficiency, or the morbid prospect of drowning panda-costumed staff and throwing coasters into the lake, or perhaps any combination of the two, this is a game you simply must play.

												Overall grade:  A +Age of me playing the game: Like 8 - Still play it today (I did have the actual disk before but I decided to get it on steam as well so I could get the game without the disk).Although I may have not been alive when the game came out this game is still excellent. Since this is the steam edition and not the actual disk you gotta admit this game is cheaper than it should be. And this game was made in 1999! The special part of this game is that you get to let your imagination free of building an amusement park that works in the game. Rather if you wanted to build a Wooden Roller Coaster or an Inverted Roller Coaster, etc. And when you are done beating the objectives to the amusement park you could just kill them all! Rather if you wanted to drown them or make them CRASH on a roller coaster and as you could asume many other ways (just make sure you turn down the volume when you are doing this because it will hurt your ears with notifications). Therefore this will be one of the games that I may never forget.If you want to want to see what the game is like before you actually buy it here is some videos by a youtuber known as KYRSP33DY that you could watch:

												Anybody else remember getting this game as a disc in what was probably a Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal box? Because this was the best 3 dollar game I ever got when I was a lad, and after playing it again at least 10-12 years later, I have to say it is (still) pretty fun. Graphics aren't terrible, and the sound is still alright. A little bit too basic of a simulation game for me, but still fun regardless, and a good game for people both new to and returning to simulation games.7 purposefully unfinished death coasters out of 10.

												A very relaxing and simple game that brings back a tidal wave of childhood memories. Sure, it's not nearly as good as the later Rollercoaster Tycoon games - They clearly got better as time advanced and the games advanced. However, this game is still as great as I remember it from long ago. I will always recommend this game to other people, no matter if it's 1999, 2015, or 2050, I will recommend this game for others to play, it is just that good of a game.

												Game itself is fantastic. Its the best in the roller coaster tycoon series ( i mean obviously). But since the game is old as hell, it runs super poorly. Buggy whenever I try to change the window size. It'll freeze to desktop and won't let me do anything. Upon exiting the game it'll freak out and freeze. Cites a weird 'administrator permissions' message. (I am the administator??) I wish they'd update it so it can run on new computers and updated versions of windows. Cause the game is still just as addictive, it just runs poorer :(			"

												This was one of the first games I ever played.I played every other entry in the series, but I never had as much fun as I had with the first one.Besides the obvious reasons for not liking the third installment (3D-ish and such) , some might say: What about the second game? It has everything from the first game + new rides and everything.Well that's somewhat the truth, but for me it wasn't enough new things to justify a new game instead of an addon. Also unlocking new parks in the first game was a nice goal and made the replay value higher if you failed a goal of a park, because you can another one if you manage it. :)Another big problem with the second game for me is that the new rides (especially in the addons) are just reskins of existing rides, so the number of real new rides isn't that high.Well if you like a nice theme park game than stick with this one, because you still have the goal for unlocking new parks and not just a semi-sandbox game like the 2nd.Ps: Please don't ask about the weird ""World"" game. xD			"

Insane amount of gameplay here once you factor in all the different scenarios and virtually limitless ride design options. The only problem is that it is now so old it has compatibility issues with some programs. It causes my Chrome to lock up for example. Due to the compatibility issues this game gets a lowly 8/10.			"

												The original Rollercoaster Tycoon is not only one of the most favourite games from my childhood, but it is one of my favourite and most loved games of all time.Rollercoaster Tycoon still holds up until this day.  The mechanics may seem a little clunky compared to back in 1999, but that should not pushh you away from buying this game. In Rollercoaster Tycoon you need to build a theme park to complete a set of objectives set out for you at the beginning of each scenario. Some of these objectives can be completed easily while others will take quite a bit of time.  There is many different theme parks and scenarios to chose from, as this version of Rollercoaster Tycoon also includes the expansions!  Pretty good for £4.79.There are many different attractions to unlock from Merry Go Round's to Viking Ship to huge Rollercoasters; which is done through researching.  The researching mechanic is really straightforward,  the player needs to select from a bunch of preset options from ""minimum"" to ""maximum""  each option has a different cost attached to it.The game is not called Rollercoaster Tycoon for no reason!  The game enables the player to design and create their own custom rollercoaster from scratch!  Make every turn and drop of the track completely unique.  Watch that excitement rating! Players can also create rides such as log flumes, kart racing and even transport attractions such as a monorail.Of course, you need staff to run a theme park.  The player can recruit four different types of staff:  Handyman, Mechanic, Security and Entertainer.  The handyman is used to keep the staff tidy, water plants and mow the lawn,  the mechanic of course repairs any broken down rides while the security keeps those annoyances away meanwhile the entertainer is busy...well, entertaining people in many different cute and quirky costumes.The game offers quite a few customization options.  The player can set how fast a ride can go - Watch out, don't let it crash and kill your guests! Decorations such as statues, water features, plants and trees are available.  Fences, benches and trash cans are needed to keep guests happy! If you have fond memories of this game and are reading reviews to make sure it isn't just nostalgia making you interested in the purchase - I found say go for it.  This game is still solid and truly holds up.  Meanwhile, if you have not played this game and are looking for something fun and relaxing, yet potentially challenging; I would say that you owe it to yourself to play this classic game.Please note:  The steam overlay does not work in this game.  Meaning you can not press shift + tab to look at friends, guides, achievements, etc, because of this Rollercoaster Tycoon does not support screenshots.  The resolution is off too - This game can not be played on full screen on my monitor.Now, go charge your guests a $100 entrance fee and overcharge on all food, drinks and rides!EDIT: This is a fantastic game that should win the ""The Test of Time"" award in the Steam Game Awards 2016!I also wanted the badge.

While you start out with nothing, if you play your cards right you can grow to be the biggest theme park around (Assuming that there arent other theme parks in buisiness.) I cant see any negatives to this game, other than not having a sandbox mode. However, that is just trivial. I would have to recommend this game, its nothing but sheer fun.			"

												This is my favourite game in the RCT series so it pains me not to recommend it. The game itself is brilliant, but sadly there are too many bugs in this port for new PC's. Its hit or miss whether the game will allow you to save, sometimes it will work fine and sometimes when you press the save button it will just crash to desktop. Sometimes when you launch the game it will crash on startup and sometimes it wont. As others have said, the game doesn't run in full screen mode (however, we're all using HD monitors these days and this was made in 1999, so not really the games fault that we still play it over 15 years later!) - If you're still running XP or have a retro gaming rig that supports steam then this game is well worth it. Sadly if you're running newer OS'es you will face problems (it seems to be the newer the OS the more problems it has, it used to work OKish for me on Win 7 but is pretty much unplayable on Win 10)			"

												Let me begin by saying that I have been an avid Payday fan since the first installment starting around early 2013. I played the hell out of the first game and when I heard the second was on the way around April of 2013, I couldn't have been more excited. I put in a pre-order for the Career Criminal Edition and played the beta prior to release. Once the game came out, I dumped lots of time into it. Although I'd get burnt out on it and have to take breaks for about a week or two at a time, I kept coming back to it. I was always so inspired by the devs at Overkill to do like they had, and for the past few months my friend and I have been making our own game. It's not anything much at this point but people like Simon and Almir made me passionate about games and I chose to persue that path for myself. Watching this game evolve from the beginning has been incredible, and although it's had some bad moments, we can't deny that it has had some kickass moments as well. But not anymore. Now that Overkill has made the bright decision to put microtransactions into the game, I've never been more disappointed in them. The least they could've done is ignored the questions about microtransactions, but even so, going against their word is sickening. I can no longer recommend this masterpiece product to others because they turned it into♥♥♥♥♥♥with the addition of paying more money. I mean seriously, there's already enough DLC for this game to starve your bank account, and then they decide to pull this? I don't think so. Sorry Overkill, you guys really ♥♥♥♥ing blew it this time.			"

												This game is really good, because it comes with the expansion packs. It's a solid game and it's fun to make your park, customize things, and watch your guests enjoy themselves. The only problem is with this steam version of the game. You can't fullscreen it, and it comes with a ton of custom made garbage you don't want, and it makes it harder to find the rides you DO want.

												Oh gosh, this game. It's fun. REALLY RUN. RollerCoaster Tycoon is about a game where you make rollercoasters or more specifically amusement parks who have rollercoasters in them. Your goal is to reach a certain amount of guests or park rating, among other things. The gameplay is simple. Make attractions, like rollercoasters, Go Karts, Log Flumes, etc., so your park can become more popular. You can charge people for many things, including to use the bathroom, which can be hilarious when they really need to go, but don't want to. However, doing things like that can make completing your objective harder, because people will complain about it, which will bring your park rating down. However, you can drown the unhappy people, which will bring your park rating up for some reason. However, there are some downsides. For example, on my laptop, almost EVERYTIME you close the game, my computer doesn't recognize any touches and FORCES you to shut down by using the power button. Also, the guests are WAY too scared. I made a rollercoaster that just goes down by not that much and it had an intensity meter of 11 and nobody would ride it, even though I made it free and advertised it. Also, NEVER save on the same save file. I did that and it stopped working, which was a world I spent 6 hours on.Final Verdict: 8/10+Fun+Replay Value+Years of entertainment+Addicting-Guests way too scared "

												RollerCoaster Tycoon can be decribed in one word: Amazing. In this game you get to build and manage Rollercoaster Theme parks. There are over 50 Theme parks you can work with and each 0f them gives you a differnt task to complete the theme park, some of these are to have a certain amount of people in your park by a certain year and some of them are to have a Theme Park value of a certain amount of money by a certain year. Each of these Scenario's can take over an hour to complete so this game gives you many hours of Fun and Enjoyment. Overall, this game is well worth $5.99 and it is a masterpiece.			"

												A must-have classic. Excellent, addicting gameplay along with qualities apart from that that I certainly enjoy due to nostalgia, but newcomers may find off-putting. I find the audio pretty good, the graphics not as bad as they could be, and the GUI incredibly helpful if a little annoying at times.Steam integration has not been fully added at this time, but devs have promised an HD remaster in the future. So while we can enjoy this masterpiece as it was all those years ago (it's as old as me! and to think I played this so much when I was younger.), we can expect small improvements over time that should be not at all detrimental to the glorious gameplay.

												Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.” Now maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now, this isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don’t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.” Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said “optimism” so if you’re a cynic, if you’re a pessimist you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to everybody. But if you’re somebody who knows that there’s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company. Maybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free. So just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share this amazing stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site.			"

I want to play it so badly, I'm actually considering buying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old computer just to play this and Zoo Tycoon. Definitely don't get this game if your computer was bought within the last five years.			"

												Don't get me wrong, Roller Coaster Tycoon is an amazing game that you'll spend hours and hours playing. The issue is that the support for this game here on Steam is virtually non-existent.Some cons:- Most people cannot get fullscreen to work- Despite being in Window mode, you're unable to click outside the window and use the desktop most times- The Steam Overlay does not work- You can not take screenshots and upload them to the Steam Workshop- A small patch was recently released which broke everyones' progress in-game. No explanation or help was offered from any of the developers/CMs, and a crude ""fix"" for this had to be provided by one of the playersKeep in mind however that I'm not hating on the game itself. In fact, I love it. But if you're new to the series, or even if you're a returning player looking to get back into one of the best games of the 90's, I'd recommend getting this game someplace else or at least waiting until this game is properly supported.

												Terribly buggy game. I get that it's old, but it still should work. If you want to know the problem I had, I edited a certain ride, and after I'd finished making the changes, it said I had no entrance although I did. So I couldn't place another entrance down because the other entrance was still there. I had to add another new platform, by which time there was no money left and the entire ride had to be changed so the tracks would fit back on... Not the only bug I encountered. Now I remembered why I uninstalled it the first time :)			"

												This game is exactly what it advertises itself to be and what you would likely expect it to be.I did enjoy the time I spent in game, however there is one (rather large in my opinion) problem with the game that leaves me unable to recommend it.In game everything works as it should, most if not every part of play is confiigurable from how much the admission cost of the park is to the time of the intervals your maintenance workers check the attractions you've built. On my first day playing I was quite content with it until I made the mistake of alt. tabbing to change the song I had playing in Chrome (heck after I messed with the game a little more today I've realized that even saving the game and closing out of it triggers this). Basically any time I leave the game's screen after starting, whether to alt. tab or turn the game off the input from my mouse is messed up. Basically I can interact with some things on my screen but not others. I can change the songs in my youtube playlist, but not what tab I'm on in Google chrome, and this affects more than just that as I also could not interact effectively with task manager. Just what you can't interact with seems to fluctuate some given time off the game but still makes normal use of my machine impossible. The only semi-decent workaround I've found to this is unplugging my mouse and plugging back in, and when I went back into the game today to see if this glitch would really happen every time I closed the game out or tried to tab away even unplugging my mouse and plugging it back in didn't work at first when the glitch inevitably did occur again. Which leaves me fearful for what it could actually be doing to my machine. While I assume it isn't really hurting my machine I'm not going to continue tempting the fates with it as I don't want to have get my computer fixed.While my overal experiance in playing the game was good, this glitch has made this game the epitomy of throwing five dollars at a wall as this game has proven itself to be one that I cannot play if I value my equipment.I'll be uninstalling this and I do not recommend this game.prosSimple, easy to playhighly configurabledecently pricedconsNo tutorials or hintsIn my case a large glitch that I do not want continuing.

												This game is nearly unplayable on my laptop, and it's not because my laptop is horrible -- I have a brand new MSi with some of the best specs as of 2015. I also have Windows 10, incase it is my OS causing the issue (which seems to be the case for some people in the 'discussion' forum).How is it unplayable, you ask? Some of the command keys will become completely unrecognizable by the game, and thus I will be unable to save, load, enter my name into the scenario chart upon completion of a level, or even toggle the in-game ride music on and off. It will simply not respond when I try clicking anything in the options or save menus.Unfortunately, as much as I love Roller Coaster Tycoon (I have been playing it since it first came out ~15 years ago, and do indeed still have my disc copy), I see absolutely no point in playing the game if I can not progress in it whatsoever, and it is unbelievably frustrating spending hours to create a park worth tens of thousands of dollars -- and then not be able to save.:( </3			"

I have had this game for years on disk and never had this many problems with it.I suggest an updated version if steam has it. This game needs to debugged in a hurry.			"

												Completely frustrating game. Frankly, this game has made me realize I can't trust Steam reviews anymore, at least not in the aggregate. This game by any modern standards is terrible. Awful, clumsy interface. Level design that will make you pull your hair out. Controls are clunky. Ugly graphics, even considering its age.Why do people rate this so highly on Steam? Purely nostalgia. This is why I can't trust Steam reviews anymore. I understood that the graphics would be outdated, sure. But the gameplay, interface, level design, and controls should all have stood the test of time, right?No. I have to do so much tedious labor to do the simplest of tasks, such as leveling the ground, getting rid of trees (hint, you have to do it one click at a time), and making sure that the roller coaster pieces fit not only the slope of the ground, but each other. Simply, there is a lot that the programming should have taken care of for you. Did I really need to click on several different menus in order to 1. raise the slope 2. raise the tiles 3. place the tile or track 4. make sure it all exactly fits back at the beginning. Otherwise, start all the way over with a clunky arrow system to select the exact track you want to change out, rather than simply clicking on the piece you want to change. I can't count how many rollercoasters I've begun just to delete the entire thing because it would be easier to just start over than to figure out how to make it all fit in the end. Oh, by the way, the game timer will tick away as you figure out how to finally make the rollercoaster pieces come together. Level design is either very repetitive, or done in such a way to be completely frustrating. One level has a park that's a lovely garden. But in order to achieve the usual goals (park rating above X, number of guests above Y at a very specific date), you have to destroy all the loveliness. In other words, destroy the park and build yet another cookie cutter theme park that makes for good business in order to reach the level's objectives.Worst of all, you have to play every single repetitive little level in order to get to what you really want - a sandbox mode. Look, the reason why we all play this game is not to make fake money. It's to have a theme park that looks the way we want it. Right? So why not just give us the sandbox level to start with? I understand that the game developers want a learning curve. But right now, the thirty or so levels all feel like agonizing tutorial levels that I cannot skip. Interface involves so much unnecessary clicking. In addition, the little pictures that indicate different menus are not very intuitive. Poor design. And of course, the graphics are an eyesore. They're not just outdated. They're just plain ugly. I can play a very old game, such as the original Super Mario Bros. or Sonic the Hedgehog and appreciate the graphics for what it was in its heyday. Even if I can't, the lack of good graphics is compensated by good gameplay in a true classic. But as discussed above this is not the case in this game. I haven't yet tried the sequel (RCT2), but my guess is that's where the game developers actually fixed all the problems that drive me crazy. If you want a good theme park simulator, find another game. There are plenty out there.			"

												A lovely game to play again after so many years, however, I and many others wish that the crash upon saving bug would be fixed! It's absolutely the worst thing about this game, you spend a few hours working on a scenario and it's basically like saying ""Oh lets start over, who cares about all that work!"" >:IFix it please. Until then, Do not reccomend.			"

												So I buy this game because it looked fun, but when I launch it, the sounds and color pallete are broken. Colors are switched up and sounds are glitchy. This does not happen to everyone though, but when it does, you only have an 80% chance of fixing it. Yes, I tried everything I could but it wouldn't work. Make sure you computer meets the expectations of the game. Other than that it looks like a good game.			"

												RCT is an amazing game, but this steam port is trash.  It takes a miracle to get the game to launch, and when it does, it crashes all the time.  It is hard to have fun playing a game like this when you always have to worry about a game crash.  Whenver I try to save the game, it crashes about 25% of the time.  I have the same issues on both my desktop and laptop.  The issues make it pretty much unplayable.  When (hopefully not ""if"") they fix the issues then this game will be worth every penny, but until then, DO NOT buy this game.  You will spend more time getting it to work then you will actually play.			"

												This is an awesome simulator of being a huge theme park tycoon and although there are some who would argue that the sequels are better, in my opinion the original is almost certainly the best. It's a really old game, but with the cost that it's currently at, it's well worth the price of admission. The main goal is to unlock all the maps by completing the set objectives by each individual map - obviously as time goes on, the maps get larger and larger and the potential for your park also grows.Apart from that - it's up to you! There are freeform maps where there aren't any set objectives and you can literally go wild without needing to stop. I honestly started playing this game on the original original Xbox and sadly that particular game couldn't be transferred onto the 360, but, as usual, Steam came to my rescue and the experience is miles better and the game is just as engaging as it was when it originally came out. If you get the chance to give it a go, I certainly reccomend this based on the price and the sheer addiction that forces 23 hours out of your day to day life.All good and nice, right? Well I have come across a pretty severe bug because for some reason after completing Trinity Islands last night, all my progress has been erased. Not my parks, but my progress; according to the game, I haven't completed one park, and yet according to my computer, I haven't lost a thing. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I'm going to see if this is a permenant thing or if my computer is just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's morning. In either case - buy this game for the really low price or even if it goes on offer [which is doubtful but Steam offers more packages than a postal delivery service, so it could happen].			"

												If you havent ever played this game, or have only ever played the newer 3d version i beg you to step back in time, and enjoy the best variant of this game. This game was so ahead of its time, and if you look at its era, so beautifully put together. The game comes with many awesome prebuilt tracks to get you started, and the learning curve is soft enough that you can become a master builder in your own right in no time. <3 x 100 to this game!

												If you're looking at this game and you're wondering why it's so highly rated, you probably never played this as a kid, so you don't have nostalgia enhancing the experience. That's probably the biggest reason, and I'll admit that my review will likely be tinged with it.RollerCoaster Tycoon is an old game. It's older than one of my teenage younger sisters, which is actually not as old as I thought. (I was pretty sure I was only a year or two old when this came out. I guess I was five, at least when the deluxe version came out.) The graphics are dated, the gameplay is very simple, and money is apparently a million times more valuable because it's the late 90's. (I'm kidding. Sort of. I mean, you do start out with only $10k, and you still have enough to buy a few rides, so clearly something is off with the value.)I didn't actually grow up with this game, as far as I can remember. My parents were big on the Tycoon and Sims franchises, but I either wasn't allowed to play them or didn't care about them. But when I found the CD a few years ago, I decided to boot it up and give it a try. I was not disappointed.The game is really easy to pick up. You get some money, you get a clear objective (usually a number of guests and a certain park rating), and you get to work. The game is all about managing both your finances and guest happiness. The game makes it very easy to figure out what you need to do via guest feedback, and it's up to you to actually do it.Just because the game is simple, though, that doesn't mean it's boring or easy. Some of the later objectives get quite challenging, especially the park with no room for new rides. But even after you complete the challenges, it's still tons of fun to go back and continue to build up your park. You can have some pretty awesome parks going after four or five in-game years. Just sit back and watch the awards and the cash come flowing in!Oh, and if guests don't like you, you can drown them. No one else notices or helps, either, which is both amusing and disturbing. But it's a great way to boost park rating in small doses, and it's a sick sort of amusement.So, even if this game has no relevance to your childhood or your inner child, this still can be a fun game to go back to time and time again. Just make sure you set aside three hours or so for it. You will sit down, open the game, look at the clock, and realize that hours have gone by without you realizing it. That's why my playtime is so low on here--I've only gone back to it once, and I still accumulated over two hours of playtime. You can bet that I'll be playing it once the semester is over, however.P.S. As I mentioned, I still have the CD, but I saw this on here for under three bucks, so I decided to buy it. I didn't have the deluxe edition, so I got a bit more content, and the devs got some more money. It was a win-win.			"

												I remember playing this game when I was a little kid. I would spend countless hours ♥♥♥♥ing around with the rides, not even worrying about the objective. I would create glorious death traps and make the park rating tank. A few years went by and I started to move towards games like Halo and Uncharted and such. I grew apart from RCT and eventually misplaced the disc somewhere. Still have no idea where the hell it is. Fast forward to last week. I noticed a friend of mine was playing this game on Steam. At first I thought, ""Oh, it's probably a non-Steam game that he was just playing through Steam."" Oh god damn was I wrong. I immediately bought this and RCT2, downloaded them, and started this one up. It's just as fun as I remember, maybe even more. This game is a classic and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun. It allows me to use my cynical trolling ways against the A.I. and watch them suffer. That's not disturbing, is it? infinity/10, my all time favorite game.			"

												Sweet mother of nostalgia.I played this game when I was a child, loved it then, loved it now. So great it came with the other packs, I had to base game and Loopy Landscapes misplaced somewhere so I jumped to get Deluxe when it came out here. Not disappointed. I always used to play this game either right before going to an amusement park trip, or right after because I was in the rollercoaster mood. This game almost simulates a real amusement park; cool rides, annoying customers, ""I want to get off [name of coaster],"" ""I've been standing in line for [ride] for ages,"" ""I'm not paying that much to go on [ride]."" Heh.			"

												Before I get more in-depth, I'll explain my opinions on the RCT games for anyone unsure on what to get. If you're looking for a fun and challenging campaign-based RCT, buy this one. If you want lots of mods and custom scenarios to toy with, buy 2. And last, if you want MORE mods, more realistic theme park recreations, water parks, zoo parks, and lots of sandbox coaster building, buy 3. I think all are good, but each has its strong points. But anyways, this is the original RCT, with all the expansions and a bunch of fan-made tracks added on. To put it short, it's a good game. The only major problems with this version are its quirks when used with Windows 7 and 8. The game, from what I know, will only run in a square resolution unless you change the inner workings of the EXE. It can crash fairly often, for semi-random reasons. And my install sometimes glitches my desktop when I quit, forcing me to reboot. However, if you can look past some irritating glitches on newer OSes, then this is a must-have. For about the same price as a CD of the game, you get everything on it already on your hard drive, no CD insertion required. If you're a big RCT fan, then I'd say buy it.			"

												This is an awesome simulator of being a huge theme park tycoon and although there are some who would argue that the sequels are better, in my opinion the original is almost certainly the best. It's a really old game, but with the cost that it's currently at, it's well worth the price of admission. The main goal is to unlock all the maps by completing the set objectives by each individual map - obviously as time goes on, the maps get larger and larger and the potential for your park also grows.Apart from that - it's up to you! There are freeform maps where there aren't any set objectives and you can literally go wild without needing to stop. I honestly started playing this game on the original original Xbox and sadly that particular game couldn't be transferred onto the 360, but, as usual, Steam came to my rescue and the experience is miles better and the game is just as engaging as it was when it originally came out. If you get the chance to give it a go, I certainly reccomend this based on the price and the sheer addiction that forces 23 hours out of your day to day life.All good and nice, right? Well I have come across a pretty severe bug because for some reason after completing Trinity Islands last night, all my progress has been erased. Not my parks, but my progress; according to the game, I haven't completed one park, and yet according to my computer, I haven't lost a thing. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I'm going to see if this is a permenant thing or if my computer is just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's morning. In either case - buy this game for the really low price or even if it goes on offer [which is doubtful but Steam offers more packages than a postal delivery service, so it could happen].			"

												Such a nostalgia trip~Definitely still holds up as an easy building/management game that's great for all ages, beginners and experts alike. There's a lot of fun to be had starting up a little park then watching it grow slowly over time as you add stalls and rides and even build your own roller coasters. I absolutely love this game and remember playing it a lot as a kid (I still have the CD laying around, but I may or may not have lost it) and its sequel RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 adds to the experience in so many lovely ways~But since I played RCT1 much, much more than 2, I have to say that this is my favorite entry to the series with the second game nearly tying. RCT 3 was an interesting jump into 3D that added quite a bit and changed things up, but you can just never beat a classic~ Plus this game works on almost any computer due to its 2D nature and sprite-art, so I'm sure it'd work on a toaster if you had the right OS.Buy the game if you like management genres, but don't expect the deepest of intricacies.

												this game has enough nostalgia to make me sit at the title screen and listen to the theme music for a good 10-15 seconds before i actually play. my childhood and stuff. when i do play it, i play it for 3 hours straight or not at all. part of this is because you can't speed up the time scale of the game (it's old school or something), but mostly i just get lost for 20 minutes building a single rollercoaster because that♥♥♥♥♥♥i hard. the game also doesn't have steam overlay (♥♥♥♥ing 1999 man) so i have to minimize it to check the time on my computer, which means i have no awareness of time passage. it's really good though. the nostalgia is validated by the impressive content and detail that is in the game. the detail adds a lot of realism and interesting mechanics. building coasters, for example, that scare your customers on sight won't have much business and a coaster that inches along the track at speeds an agoraphobic wouldn't be intimidated by won't bring customers either. the content includes a big variety of rides, many of which aren't rollercoasters (half of the rides probably are roller coasters though). there are water rides, gentle rides like merry-go-rounds, thrill rides like swinging ships, and a variety of shops and stalls. the incorporation of many different elements creates a genuine experience of running a themepark. the game comes with something like 100+ scenarios; they are like campaigns with specific goals, such as reaching a certain company value at the end of october (it's always october for some reason) in year x. the scenarios are pretty difficult and time consuming. given the content, you can spend immense amounts of time working through those alone. not too bad for isometric 1999.

												First off it is a shame that there is no middle option for a review because this game is great and you should buy it... but it has one big flaw that lets it down hugely (skip to the bottom to see what that is if you don't want to read the whole thing.I would like to say that this is the type of game that makes you sit back and think ""I havn't played a game this fun and simple and really enjoyable in years"", it is made to be fun which is a word not usually heard in video gaming these days.As this is a game that you can buy on disc i will compare it to the disc version but first lets talk about the game on its own: It is a very happy game and definatly cheers me up, running a theme park is wierdly enjoyable and when you win the guests all clap for you (which is so cute, also if they are holding a balloon they let go and it fly's into the air (simply joys)), it has many different parks with a lot of variety in goals and map types, the graphics are still decent and the little sweeping activity the handmen do is very sweet, and if you are a phycopath then forcing the rides to fall off the rails makes a great explosion.Now lets start comparing Pros of Steam version: It has a lot more variety of maps includng real world parks, there are more variety of rides, making banners is fun, also (only fans of the disc version will understand) you can set the price of all the burger stand to be the same price and not have to go round changing them all.Cons of the steam version:  It may just be with my version but you can't see what the rides will look like untill they are built (except for the original rides that were on the original disc version) this is very annoying as i don't know what the ride is at all or if it will be similar to previous rides i have or if it will be too extreme for my guests. Also,  most of the new rides are far to big for any park and are too exspensive to be able to build. It is a shame that they have this variety of new ride designs but it is impossible to use this feature.If you liked the original disc version when you were younger then get this, it will be quite the nostalga ride and I look forward to seeing you at the exit saying ""Rollarcoaster tycoon 1 was great!"" (if you get my reference to the game)			"

												When it comes to the RTS (Real-Time Strategy) gaming genre, there are quite a few games that have left their mark. From the Command and Conquer series to Blizzard greats like Starcraft, or Warcraft, there are plenty of options when it comes to combat-style RTS games. Roller Coaster Tycoon, however, took things in a whole new direction and this is why it's in the spotlight for this BTN Gaming Review.     Now Roller Coaster Tycoon, upon arrival, totally reshaped the way people look at RTS games. In fact, it really created a whole new sub-genre in the Real-Time category. While the player doesn't necessarily control every aspect of the game, they do have control over the most key features. This is just one of the many details that makes Roller Coaster Tycoon stand out from its predecessors. Another key aspect, and quite possibly the one that carried the most impact, is the simple yet detail-oriented style of play. It's a very relaxed game in the fact that there isn't an enemy on the map who is ready to pillage and plunder you for everything you've got, but that's not to say that it doesn't have its own edge. Roller Coaster Tycoon delivers its thrills in a much more intricate and subtle way. It's these exact features that make it a great game, while at the same time might give a newcomer some frustrations.     For starters, Roller Coaster Tycoon's maps (campaign?) is a series of challenging theme parks that all have a certain goal that must be obtained. Whether it's building a brand new park from scratch, obtaining a specific park value, or even just to up the rating of an already thriving theme park, every single level in Roller Coaster Tycoon is wrapped around achieving these goals. Once these goals are achieved, a new map is opened up and the player can progress further on down the line. This is a great feature because it keeps the player interested with new scenes, new objectives, and really fills out the experience with the many different types of obstacles that can be overcome. However, it's this exact reason that might deter the more ""casual"" player. The reason for this is the simple fact that there is no sandbox mode. Not only is there the void of sandboxing but there is also this... nagging urge to just quit a park once the objective has been completed. If the player decides to save the current progress on any park once achieving the goal, they can return to it at any point in time.... but there really isn't much of a need to do so. This can severely cut the replay value of the game short, and while it isn't the biggest problem in the world, it can still be considered when arriving at the decision to purchase the game.     While the goal-oriented gameplay of Roller Coaster Tycoon is great, jaded only by the lack of a sandbox freeplay mode, we can't forget the details. Literally, the details. Roller Coaster Tycoon is absolutely FILLED to the brim with detail-oriented time management, and it's in these details that Roller Coaster Tycoon really thrives. From being able to design the roller coaster of your dreams, down the simplest detail as simply painting every ice cream shop a different color, it's these little intricacies that drive the game. That said, it's also these very minute, albeit important, features can become daunting at certain points in the game. For instance, when it comes to building said ""Dream Roller Coaster"" the game will not allow it to be built unless all of the brakes and speedups are in the right place. Prices too high for ice cream? Well that will drive potential patrons away before you even get the chance to fix it. So with that said, it's quite easy to get lost in the details and if things start getting to difficult to understand, just remember: breathe and if all else fails, RESTART!    On that note, however, there is also lack of any sort of tutorial or information that is in-game to help the player, should they feel lost. Don't get me wrong, I completely enjoy playing a game and feeling it out without any sort of help system at all. That's why I do what I do! But there are other players out there who don't want to mess around with understanding the mechanics or explore and experiment... simply put they want to achieve that goal for the next map. This is why some sort of help system within the actual framework of the game would be a huge help. For instance, your rating is dropping too low and you are just two months away from getting that coveted pat on the back for achieving an overall rating of 875 and you are sitting on 725. How do you get that rating up? Do you build more attractions? Do you lower the gate price? Do you run promotions? None of these answers are found directly in the game, not even in the help section. Thankfully though, there are pioneers out there who are willing and ready to write guides on issues such as this! That said, at least this information shouldn't be hard to find.     Overall, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a great little game, especially if the player is just looking to relax and chill out with a non-stressful game. All of its features can be seen as a double-edged sword so to speak, and if you are planning on buying the game, just make sure to take these things into consideration.For more information on this game, or to buy it yourself, please visit:Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming "

												I remeber as a kid playing this game for hours on end along with Transport Tycoon. There is hours of fun to be had from this very old game. The main shortcomings of this game come from the fact that eventually you just run out of things to do. After building your park, it just becomes routine, but that's a part of the magic of this game. Each time you get to build up a new park, struggle to make it successful, and then begin again with a new park and new approaches to building your park.			"

												Prior to purchasing it on Steam, I put endless hours into this game as a kid and at many recurring points in my life. Even now as an adult I find myself completely addicted to it.I definitely think these types of games are catered to a specific type of person, though. Some people will simply look at this and think it's boring or too niche. So if you're unsure about purchasing it and already feel like you won't like it then you're probably right. As for me I love everything about it.I love organizing things. I love micro-management simulators. I love games where you start with nothing and very gradually work your way up to the top. A lot of people play RollerCoaster Tycoon because they think it's fun to make horrific, nightmare-esque theme parks in which people die and their ratings plummet right off the bat. I can understand the appeal of this but I honestly adore this game for exactly what it's trying to be. The better you do at running your park the more attractions you unlock. You can reshape the landscape, choose what stalls and shops will be available for your guests, hire a specific number of employees, and of course decide exactly which rides you want to include and place them exactly where you want them.Whenever I meet the goals of a level I feel a unique sense of silly pride at doing so--but pride nonetheless.I dunno. I just find everything about this game extremely satisfying.			"

												This is a serious review. Seriously serious this time. Seriously.In my opinion, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a classic simulator game. It's fun, addictive, bright, colorful and most of all very engaging. As a kid, I would frequently play this for hours on end and I enjoyed every second of it. There's a definite charm to it all and it's satisfying fufilling the goals the game sets for you.In short, BUY IT.			"

												One word and one word only needs to describe this game. Fun.I played this game all the time at my cousin's house as a kid and finally getting the chance to play it again is so gratifying. It's that feeling you get playing any game that you haven't had the chance to, a certain sense of notalgia. It took me a while to get back into it and recollect some of the lost information from 13 years back, but once I did, it was hype.You may only enjoy this game if you played it before, but if you did, then this must be in your library.

												I just couldn't recommend this game more.Being the first video game I ever played, this game is special to me. As the grand-daddy of all tycoon games to come, RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 is simply unmatched by the many games that tried to replicate it. And the fact that it's less than 5 bucks right now is just the icing on the cake.This game is packed to the brim with amazing content, and scenarios that keep you playing for hours on end. Although at first you might be confused as to what to do first, it's not too hard to get into the swing of things. And once you do, you'll feel like a god making some of the best coasters the world has ever seen.So please, pick this game up. Even if you're not a fan of the tycoon genre, I'd be surprised if you didn't have fun. "

												The original Rollercoaster Tycoon was an awesome game.   It was a giant sandbox for you to build your own theme park, design your own coasters (as well as log rides and go-kart tracks), charge however much you wanted, and expand your park empire across the globe.  The best part is that the game has aged quite well.  It's still awesome to design your own coaster, including color scheme and even the music that plays as people line up to ride it (even importing your own music if you wish!).  The games many challenges will keep you busy for a long time as well.  There's so many small details that make this game great, like paying attentions to the staff you hire, making sure to eject trouble makers in the park, making sure there's restrooms for patrons (you can even charge for access to the restroom!), keeping up with ride maintenance, and making sure your latest coaster isn't a deathtrap.  It's worth the low purchase price for the many hours you will get out of this if you haven't played it before.			"

It is one of the better sims out there.Pros - A lot of customization available.A lot of thought put into development.Just fun to build roller coasters.Cons -15 years later and the game still  has some of the same bugs like: Losing control of your mouse when you quit the game. To regain control you have to right click, which isn't intuitive.Still freezes when it saves sometimes and randomly freezes, but never crashes.Mechanics nearest the rides that need to be fixed don't do anything.

												When it comes to the RTS (Real-Time Strategy) gaming genre, there are quite a few games that have left their mark. From the Command and Conquer series to Blizzard greats like Starcraft, or Warcraft, there are plenty of options when it comes to combat-style RTS games. Roller Coaster Tycoon, however, took things in a whole new direction and this is why it's in the spotlight for this BTN Gaming Review.     Now Roller Coaster Tycoon, upon arrival, totally reshaped the way people look at RTS games. In fact, it really created a whole new sub-genre in the Real-Time category. While the player doesn't necessarily control every aspect of the game, they do have control over the most key features. This is just one of the many details that makes Roller Coaster Tycoon stand out from its predecessors. Another key aspect, and quite possibly the one that carried the most impact, is the simple yet detail-oriented style of play. It's a very relaxed game in the fact that there isn't an enemy on the map who is ready to pillage and plunder you for everything you've got, but that's not to say that it doesn't have its own edge. Roller Coaster Tycoon delivers its thrills in a much more intricate and subtle way. It's these exact features that make it a great game, while at the same time might give a newcomer some frustrations.     For starters, Roller Coaster Tycoon's maps (campaign?) is a series of challenging theme parks that all have a certain goal that must be obtained. Whether it's building a brand new park from scratch, obtaining a specific park value, or even just to up the rating of an already thriving theme park, every single level in Roller Coaster Tycoon is wrapped around achieving these goals. Once these goals are achieved, a new map is opened up and the player can progress further on down the line. This is a great feature because it keeps the player interested with new scenes, new objectives, and really fills out the experience with the many different types of obstacles that can be overcome. However, it's this exact reason that might deter the more ""casual"" player. The reason for this is the simple fact that there is no sandbox mode. Not only is there the void of sandboxing but there is also this... nagging urge to just quit a park once the objective has been completed. If the player decides to save the current progress on any park once achieving the goal, they can return to it at any point in time.... but there really isn't much of a need to do so. This can severely cut the replay value of the game short, and while it isn't the biggest problem in the world, it can still be considered when arriving at the decision to purchase the game.     While the goal-oriented gameplay of Roller Coaster Tycoon is great, jaded only by the lack of a sandbox freeplay mode, we can't forget the details. Literally, the details. Roller Coaster Tycoon is absolutely FILLED to the brim with detail-oriented time management, and it's in these details that Roller Coaster Tycoon really thrives. From being able to design the roller coaster of your dreams, down the simplest detail as simply painting every ice cream shop a different color, it's these little intricacies that drive the game. That said, it's also these very minute, albeit important, features can become daunting at certain points in the game. For instance, when it comes to building said ""Dream Roller Coaster"" the game will not allow it to be built unless all of the brakes and speedups are in the right place. Prices too high for ice cream? Well that will drive potential patrons away before you even get the chance to fix it. So with that said, it's quite easy to get lost in the details and if things start getting to difficult to understand, just remember: breathe and if all else fails, RESTART!    On that note, however, there is also lack of any sort of tutorial or information that is in-game to help the player, should they feel lost. Don't get me wrong, I completely enjoy playing a game and feeling it out without any sort of help system at all. That's why I do what I do! But there are other players out there who don't want to mess around with understanding the mechanics or explore and experiment... simply put they want to achieve that goal for the next map. This is why some sort of help system within the actual framework of the game would be a huge help. For instance, your rating is dropping too low and you are just two months away from getting that coveted pat on the back for achieving an overall rating of 875 and you are sitting on 725. How do you get that rating up? Do you build more attractions? Do you lower the gate price? Do you run promotions? None of these answers are found directly in the game, not even in the help section. Thankfully though, there are pioneers out there who are willing and ready to write guides on issues such as this! That said, at least this information shouldn't be hard to find.     Overall, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a great little game, especially if the player is just looking to relax and chill out with a non-stressful game. All of its features can be seen as a double-edged sword so to speak, and if you are planning on buying the game, just make sure to take these things into consideration.For more information on this game, or to buy it yourself, please visit:Be sure to check out my other content!YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qABlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/Tumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/Follow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming "

												Aaaahhhh rollercoaster tycoon. I`ve played this game when I was like 7 years old with a copie that I couldn`t save on my dad`s old work laptop. Which means that I had to complete a park straight! But still, even years later, this is with no doubt still the best simulator I`ve ever played. And now with the steam version I can save the game properly! And heck this only 5,49, so why wouldn`t you play it?			"

												This game is a classic. I still have the original, but it is nice not having to pop in the game disk every single time I want to play.Quick Startup, lightweight programming, responsive and low system requirements. A game for the kids in the family and the people who are still kids at heart.One downside, though.No 1080p or any form of HD support. I wish Atari would update the game to support 1080p.			"

												It was a stormy summers eve when I bought this game. My childhood memories of this game overtook me with nostalgia and forced me to press ""Buy"". I installed the game and watched it boot up, the carnival music filling the room as the rain beat against the window outside. I start a new game, and descended into Hell. I broke all the rides, drowned all the children, every bathroom had a fee of fifty dollars and the exit was closed, trapping everyone in my eternal damnation. The food was infested with flies and the security guards were nowhere to be found. The entertainers robbed the customers before they all huddled inside the haunted house and sacrificed them to the dark lord. My greatest dreams came true, thanks to this game. 10/10, would recommend.			"

The guests are at your disposal, whether you choose to make them happy and build a successful park, or pick them up and drop them in the water and watch them drown. You are a theme park God. The UI is a little tough to get down at first, since it is an old game, but once you have everything figured out it's smooth sailing. Would definitly recommend to anyone who enjoys simulation games.			"

												I feel a ton of time about to be wasted!I originally got this game back when it first came out on CD-ROM and I lost part of my life to it. There is nothing more exciting then creating a massive successful park and feeling like you accomplished something big. Oh and lets not forget about the senseless killing of visitors who complain about your park. You can destroy a section of roller coaster they are one, drown them, or make them for ever walk in a pit full of vomit. You can charge people to go to the bathroom!When I had the CD-ROM version I only had the loopy landscapes expansion but this deluxe version also comes with the corkscrew follies expansion. I guarentee that if you buy this game, you will sell your soul to keep playing for another hour.			"

 8/10 Another piece of nostalgia here. This game is incredible fun and keeps you wanting to play for just one more ""month"". It is the right level of challenging and casual fun. I cannot grant it higher than 8/10 because you aren't always compelled to return to it and elements of the gameplay are frustrating: for instance you can't make an actually interesting roller coaster without it being too ""extreme"", ""unexciting"" or ""nausiating"". Still a great deal of fun, with no real flaws.For the casual ""indie"" gamer I would definately recomend this game.			"

												It's the original RollerCoaster Tycoon that I remember playing as a kid with a few extra things like more parks and different pre-set rides you can make. It still has the same feel as when I played it when I was younger and it makes me feel so nastalgic.There was one bug that I noticed though, when I built one of my big coasters it kept telling me that I had to build an entrance for it even though I already had and it made me keep building entrances to the ride but would still say that I needed to build an entrance. I ended up scrapping the ride and just restarted that park entirely. Not too huge of a deal though, it only happened to me once pretty early in the game.			"

												This game is incredible, just keep in mind it takes a lot of patience to get through.  A one year scenario takes 50 minutes, 3 years scenarios ~3 hours.  There are 60 scenarios in this pack, which means there is probably around 120 hours of content in the game, without playing any scenarios twice, and assuming you know what you are doing. For those who haven't played the game yet, it takes some time to get used to, I would strongly recommend you look at a tutorial, or you will miss incredibly important parts of the GUI that are very easy to notice, for example, research, advertising, and loans.  If you have time and patience to learn, you won't be dissapointed by this game.			"

												A favotite from my childhood, and seeing it come to steam has made me fall in love with the game once more.For those that have not played the game or any on the sequals, the game revolves around building a theme park in one of a numerous range of landscapes. Though most of the parks are locked at the start and require unlocking by completing previous parks and tasks (which can be quite time consuming), I find this a point to work towards that you don't get in the second game.The selection of rides is rather stunted in this version, and some of the landscapes don't really make for great/vast parks like in the second or even third so most parks end up feeling the same. The only reason I would not recomend this game OR you are new to the series; is because RollerCoaster tycoon 2 does everything the first does but better. However this is one game that I would recomend to a vast crowd and it is a great, fun game to play to pass the time. "

												This is an awesome simulator of being a huge theme park tycoon and although there are some who would argue that the sequels are better, in my opinion the original is almost certainly the best. It's a really old game, but with the cost that it's currently at, it's well worth the price of admission. The main goal is to unlock all the maps by completing the set objectives by each individual map - obviously as time goes on, the maps get larger and larger and the potential for your park also grows.Apart from that - it's up to you! There are freeform maps where there aren't any set objectives and you can literally go wild without needing to stop. I honestly started playing this game on the original original Xbox and sadly that particular game couldn't be transferred onto the 360, but, as usual, Steam came to my rescue and the experience is miles better and the game is just as engaging as it was when it originally came out. If you get the chance to give it a go, I certainly reccomend this based on the price and the sheer addiction that forces 23 hours out of your day to day life.All good and nice, right? Well I have come across a pretty severe bug because for some reason after completing Trinity Islands last night, all my progress has been erased. Not my parks, but my progress; according to the game, I haven't completed one park, and yet according to my computer, I haven't lost a thing. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I'm going to see if this is a permenant thing or if my computer is just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥because it's morning. In either case - buy this game for the really low price or even if it goes on offer [which is doubtful but Steam offers more packages than a postal delivery service, so it could happen].			"

												My room mate recently started replaying this game and seeing as Steam had it I bought it and started playing it again as well. Ahhh~ The nolstagia is strong with this game. Your main goal with this game is to build up and maintain a them park while following the guidelines of each level. Some start you from scratch, others don't. Anyway, it's a simple but complicated game as most Management type games go. For instance, can't make a roller coaster too scary or hardly anyone will ride it but if it's too weak, no one will want to ride it because it's not intense enough. Just be sure to Test Run your ride first to make sure it isn't a death trap. I've accidentally killed some people because I forgot to do that first. >_> Sometimes it's really hard to know if what you're building will appeal to your guests, but once you've got it right, advertise the crap out of your new ride, and watch the dollars signs fly up.Anyway, this game is enjoyable and relaxing. If you likebuilding and maintaining and feeling powerful because you know how to maintain a park and make big bucks doing it, then this game is for you. P.S. If you click on a stray balloon it will pop and if you click on a duck, it will quack. I didn't know about these fun little Easter Eggs until I bought it on Steam so I thought I would share that with you. :) Have fun!			"

												This game teaches you how to be a capitalist: Your goal is to continuously expand you park even though you have a limited ammount of land to do so. This is in order for you to then gain the money in order to pay back the backs the loans you start with and then once you've done so, just accumulate money until you've run out of room in you park at which point you suddenly become hommicdal and set out to drown everyone until any body of water that you've placed into, or that is in your park becomes an open cemmitary. Now you gain money by investing in your park by purchasing rides/consumor points, investing in advertisment campaings and charging people to use the toilets so the 20% of all guests who go on your roller coasters can throw up into a tolet instead of on the pavement making you hier jannitors to clean it up. This game also teaches you that there's no negative reprocussions to actions that due to your own fault injur, annoy or kill any of your guests and you'll be rewarded the ""safest parkin the country"" so long as you have ""Furguson Missouri"" levels of police. But if one ride crashes and blows up (which is out of your control) then your population levels drop faster than a gold digger at the sight of a £20 note. The game give you goals for each park as well just to give you a purpose in this game and infact life.Honestly though this game, Fifa Street, Lego Football mania and NEED FOR MADNESS? was my childhood and I will definatly recomend this game because it's on steam. However the game crashes for me most of the time when I exit the game and you can't Shift+Tab for the steam bootstrapper while in game. But this is a must own game.			"

Tons of roller coaster types to choose from as well as other thrill ride types (motion simulator, customizable go-kart tracks) and even some generic types (haunted house, mazes). There is still a good balance of progressive challenges in maintaining the parks. Don't understaff your janitors in your park!			"

												Such a nostalgia trip~Definitely still holds up as an easy building/management game that's great for all ages, beginners and experts alike. There's a lot of fun to be had starting up a little park then watching it grow slowly over time as you add stalls and rides and even build your own roller coasters. I absolutely love this game and remember playing it a lot as a kid (I still have the CD laying around, but I may or may not have lost it) and its sequel RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 adds to the experience in so many lovely ways~But since I played RCT1 much, much more than 2, I have to say that this is my favorite entry to the series with the second game nearly tying. RCT 3 was an interesting jump into 3D that added quite a bit and changed things up, but you can just never beat a classic~ Plus this game works on almost any computer due to its 2D nature and sprite-art, so I'm sure it'd work on a toaster if you had the right OS.Buy the game if you like management genres, but don't expect the deepest of intricacies.

												this game has enough nostalgia to make me sit at the title screen and listen to the theme music for a good 10-15 seconds before i actually play. my childhood and stuff. when i do play it, i play it for 3 hours straight or not at all. part of this is because you can't speed up the time scale of the game (it's old school or something), but mostly i just get lost for 20 minutes building a single rollercoaster because that♥♥♥♥♥♥i hard. the game also doesn't have steam overlay (♥♥♥♥ing 1999 man) so i have to minimize it to check the time on my computer, which means i have no awareness of time passage. it's really good though. the nostalgia is validated by the impressive content and detail that is in the game. the detail adds a lot of realism and interesting mechanics. building coasters, for example, that scare your customers on sight won't have much business and a coaster that inches along the track at speeds an agoraphobic wouldn't be intimidated by won't bring customers either. the content includes a big variety of rides, many of which aren't rollercoasters (half of the rides probably are roller coasters though). there are water rides, gentle rides like merry-go-rounds, thrill rides like swinging ships, and a variety of shops and stalls. the incorporation of many different elements creates a genuine experience of running a themepark. the game comes with something like 100+ scenarios; they are like campaigns with specific goals, such as reaching a certain company value at the end of october (it's always october for some reason) in year x. the scenarios are pretty difficult and time consuming. given the content, you can spend immense amounts of time working through those alone. not too bad for isometric 1999.

												I can easily say that this game was my childhood. I bought the game at the full price of $6 because I decided I couldn't wait until it went on sale, and honestly I regret it.Immediately upon launching it for the very first time, it caused my laptop's video driver to crash. I was a little alarmed as my laptop is stronger than many gaming desktops out there, but brushed it off once a restart of my laptop got it working. Immediately I was reminded why I loved this game: it's fun and reminded me of everything that I used to love about the RollerCoaster series.Downloading and launching the game on my desktop the following day, I was pleased when there were no problems... except why can't I play it in fullscreen? Ah well, I'll deal with it, at least it didn't crash funny on me like it did on my laptop.Well then I encountered the horror story that I had read in a review - the 'save crash'. Upon saving my game after playing for two hours it crashed on me. Immediately the idea of logging back into that game and re-doing everything I  had just done  was frustrating. But ultimately the part that really bothered me was Steams support for the game - read the supreme  lack  of support. Going through the support site here on Steam just wanted me to contact Atari.Looking back, I feel that these were probably bugs that had been present in my original RCT, I vaguely remember problems with fullscreen mode working, and I definitely remember a video crash or too - at the time I had assumed it was my very, very outdated computer (it was classified as outdated in  2000  so it was definitely rather basic). The fact that these errors actually continued on to Steam was disheartening. I currently have an old scratched up CD of RCT; the reason I didn't shove that into my desktop and download it there was because I'd wrongly assumed that the one here would have these errors corrected. That was my fault.Now, I'm not saying that the game is horrible - At the time of writing this I've put 4 hours into it, and I will continue to play. However, I would  highly  recommend waiting until it's on sale.			"

It is a fun, original tycoon with a multitude of things to do, ways to create new coasters and of course, keep your guests happy. I love the square land based system and the way things are built, you can also kill a few people without too much of a consequence if you get bored. The game lacks perspective with only four ways to view it from but this is quickly forgotten as you try to pay off that huge loan you took out to build that mega coaster. Overall great game and you should all definitely play it :)			"

The normal $6 price tag is well worth it, but it's a can't-miss when it's on sale for $3 or less.Only major drawback I can mention with the gameplay is that sometimes you can beat the scenarios far in advance of the deadline, and waiting for the deadline to come so that the level ""ends"" can be annoying.

												Honestly if you're looking for a good simulation game to eat up time or relive your childhood through, you really can't do better than rollercoaster tycoon. I always found RT1 to be more fun than RT2, and vastly superior to RT3 but that's just my opinion. I've always liked that you can unlock different maps as you progress through the game, it's fun and it makes it feel like you're progressing as a tycoon, I suppose. It's also fun to build death coasters and/or build only one bathroom and charge people ten dollars to use it.			"

I love the square land based system and the way things are built, you can also kill a few people without too much of a consequence if you get bored. The game lacks perspective with only four ways to view it from but this is quickly forgotten as you try to pay off that huge loan you took out to build that mega coaster. Overall great game and you should all definitely play it :)			"

												Was fun way back, and it is still very enjoyable.  The normal $6 price tag is well worth it, but it's a can't-miss when it's on sale for $3 or less.Only major drawback I can mention with the gameplay is that sometimes you can beat the scenarios far in advance of the deadline, and waiting for the deadline to come so that the level ""ends"" can be annoying.

												If you've played RCT 3 and never played its 2d predecessors, then your missing out.Play this, its gold.Very little bugs, simple 2d platform, provides an excellent ""themepark managing simulation"" experience.This game has a surprising ammount of depth to it.Weather its your paths are disgusting and guests are complaing, people are getting lost, vandalism in the park, or the rides being too expensive. There is ALWAYS something to be done.- A very relaxed game, something you would probably want to play just to waste a few hours. ++nostalgic feel ++ only 6$++ well over 80 hours			"

												For over 15 years, this game has been one that is always on my favorite games list.  If gaming has an equivalent of comfort foods, then this is mine.  Every computer I have ever owned has had this game installed on it at some point.  I'm not sure if it is the nostalgia, but I swear this game holds up like no other, both in gameplay and aesthetics.  The game is great for all ages, it's very easy to pick up and play and thankfully there isn't a very big learning curve.  It also offers more in depth gameplay for those who want to manage everything including wheter or not to charge to use the restrooms.  I always like to charge at entry and make my rides free, but you could easily play the opposite way, there are just so many options.  Come to think of it I have little to no complaints about this game, which I think is most impresive.  The only thing I ever find annoying is the guest tend to get a little lost when you make paths double width.  In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												If you're looking at this game and you're wondering why it's so highly rated, you probably never played this as a kid, so you don't have nostalgia enhancing the experience. That's probably the biggest reason, and I'll admit that my review will likely be tinged with it.RollerCoaster Tycoon is an old game. It's older than one of my teenage younger sisters, which is actually not as old as I thought. (I was pretty sure I was only a year or two old when this came out. I guess I was five, at least when the deluxe version came out.) The graphics are dated, the gameplay is very simple, and money is apparently a million times more valuable because it's the late 90's. (I'm kidding. Sort of. I mean, you do start out with only $10k, and you still have enough to buy a few rides, so clearly something is off with the value.)I didn't actually grow up with this game, as far as I can remember. My parents were big on the Tycoon and Sims franchises, but I either wasn't allowed to play them or didn't care about them. But when I found the CD a few years ago, I decided to boot it up and give it a try. I was not disappointed.The game is really easy to pick up. You get some money, you get a clear objective (usually a number of guests and a certain park rating), and you get to work. The game is all about managing both your finances and guest happiness. The game makes it very easy to figure out what you need to do via guest feedback, and it's up to you to actually do it.Just because the game is simple, though, that doesn't mean it's boring or easy. Some of the later objectives get quite challenging, especially the park with no room for new rides. But even after you complete the challenges, it's still tons of fun to go back and continue to build up your park. You can have some pretty awesome parks going after four or five in-game years. Just sit back and watch the awards and the cash come flowing in!Oh, and if guests don't like you, you can drown them. No one else notices or helps, either, which is both amusing and disturbing. But it's a great way to boost park rating in small doses, and it's a sick sort of amusement.So, even if this game has no relevance to your childhood or your inner child, this still can be a fun game to go back to time and time again. Just make sure you set aside three hours or so for it. You will sit down, open the game, look at the clock, and realize that hours have gone by without you realizing it. That's why my playtime is so low on here--I've only gone back to it once, and I still accumulated over two hours of playtime. You can bet that I'll be playing it once the semester is over, however.P.S. As I mentioned, I still have the CD, but I saw this on here for under three bucks, so I decided to buy it. I didn't have the deluxe edition, so I got a bit more content, and the devs got some more money. It was a win-win.			"

												Whenever I think of an amazing old game. This one comes to mind. This has been my favorite game ever since the DEMO came out. RollerCoaster Tycoon is all about building and managing your own amusement park. Not only can you customize rollercoaster, go-kart tracks and other tracked rides; but you can also customize prices for everything from the rides, to the staff, to the restrooms. The entire park is pretty much at your finger-tips.You can build yourself any coaster you can imagine, though your 'peeps' won't always want to ride them. If they're too intense, or not intense enough. Same with all the rides and prices. These guys have preferences, and stick to them rather heavily.It's impossible to do this game justice in a simple text review. If you have any interest in financial simulators, you should get this game. Can't go wrong for the price Steam is offering either.			"

For users running widescreen and/or 1080p+ monitors, this game was not optimized for you, much less were those screens widely available in 1999. Simply set the game up for highest settings and you're golden; anybody can run it at that.If you're new to the game, however, well, you're in for a treat, that's for sure. :)			"

												Playing RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe is actually a nostalgic ride for me. I have never thought that I would be able to play this game again, especially in this state. I am glad Steam was able to provide and I am able to yet again play a game that I have loved since childhood. It holds the same graphics (maybe better) and it is exactly as it had been before. I am very happy with my purchase and with the availability. People should play this game, I have to say that it may be the first but arguably the best. Management games have gone long from simpleness but Rollercoaster Tycoon is a management game that you will find difficult to put down.			"

												This game is just as addictive as it was when I first played it.You get many hours of content with this game. It is simple enough to get started with just enough features to make some wacky parks. Two major downsides for me are that the isometric camera makes it difficult to build at times and that it can also be frustrating when you have to work with the landscaping. However, if you stick to it, you'll get used to it. If it gives you any trouble starting up on Windows 7 or beyond, adjust the compatibility settings. Enjoy!			"

												If, like me, your original experience of simulation games was as a child playing RollerCoaster Tycoon then the came has aged to a point where it's still incredibly enjoyable. While certain taken-for-granted mechanics like game speed aren't available, and the roster of rides and attractions grew increasingly through the series (which ends at RCT3...it has to), this is well worth picking up again for the memories, the satisfaction of completing the huge number of scenarios and to relive a classic.

												The original Rollercoaster Tycoon was an awesome game.   It was a giant sandbox for you to build your own theme park, design your own coasters (as well as log rides and go-kart tracks), charge however much you wanted, and expand your park empire across the globe.  The best part is that the game has aged quite well.  It's still awesome to design your own coaster, including color scheme and even the music that plays as people line up to ride it (even importing your own music if you wish!).  The games many challenges will keep you busy for a long time as well.  There's so many small details that make this game great, like paying attentions to the staff you hire, making sure to eject trouble makers in the park, making sure there's restrooms for patrons (you can even charge for access to the restroom!), keeping up with ride maintenance, and making sure your latest coaster isn't a deathtrap.  It's worth the low purchase price for the many hours you will get out of this if you haven't played it before.			"

												So good! Brings me back to my childhood when I first started getting into video games. It runs very well on Windows 10, and it's still fairly challenging and very fun to play through. The biggest hiccup on Windows 10 is that after you quit the game, you have to hit, ""CTRL+ALT+DELETE"" for the keyboard to reset back to default settings for the operating system. (Not sure how else to to describe it, but if I don't, the mouse and the keyboard are not able to click applications on the task bar or desktop properly if I don't do this).Personally, I still think this and RCT 2 are better than RCT3 because there is much more control over construction (though visibility is limited significantly).

												I remeber as a kid playing this game for hours on end along with Transport Tycoon. There is hours of fun to be had from this very old game. The main shortcomings of this game come from the fact that eventually you just run out of things to do. After building your park, it just becomes routine, but that's a part of the magic of this game. Each time you get to build up a new park, struggle to make it successful, and then begin again with a new park and new approaches to building your park.			"

												It's been a long time since I played this game and it's just how I remember.The UI feels clunky now that I have got used to modern games having a much sleeker UI, but it's still a good game to burn a few hours building a theme park.There are a few things which bug me about this game, like the fact that I can't work out how one might remove trees when they are in the way of rides I want to place. The footpath/queue placing system is also a bit confusing at first.All in all, a good piece of nostalgia for those times when I just want to burn a small amount of time with something not too complex.

												I feel so nostalgic when I play this game, wether it be the endless possibility's of coaster building, making a trap so that the guests can never leave your park ever once inside, (I know genius of me isn't it lol) or almost everything in the game, it will satisfy you more than you think only because in your park, you have endless time to think of your next move. Games need more of that kind of thing in my opinion. A mode where the possibility's are endless, Like Garry's Mod. But forget that, your here to know what I think and than criticize it, (Most people anyway) well that's just it really. There is nothing else to this, just that I love this game too much to refund forever.			"

												It was a stormy summers eve when I bought this game. My childhood memories of this game overtook me with nostalgia and forced me to press ""Buy"". I installed the game and watched it boot up, the carnival music filling the room as the rain beat against the window outside. I start a new game, and descended into Hell. I broke all the rides, drowned all the children, every bathroom had a fee of fifty dollars and the exit was closed, trapping everyone in my eternal damnation. The food was infested with flies and the security guards were nowhere to be found. The entertainers robbed the customers before they all huddled inside the haunted house and sacrificed them to the dark lord. My greatest dreams came true, thanks to this game. 10/10, would recommend.			"

												So good! Brings me back to my childhood when I first started getting into video games. It runs very well on Windows 10, and it's still fairly challenging and very fun to play through. The biggest hiccup on Windows 10 is that after you quit the game, you have to hit, ""CTRL+ALT+DELETE"" for the keyboard to reset back to default settings for the operating system. (Not sure how else to to describe it, but if I don't, the mouse and the keyboard are not able to click applications on the task bar or desktop properly if I don't do this).Personally, I still think this and RCT 2 are better than RCT3 because there is much more control over construction (though visibility is limited significantly).

												I freaking love this game, but the steam version has a LOT of bugs. I played 20 hours after downloading and saved about 6 parks, then I started having weird problems. After trying to save the game would immediately crash saying i/o error. Also when I tried to change resolutions the game would crash and I couldnt even do ctrl+alt+delete, I had to hard reset my computer to use it again. Im going to try and re-install and diagnose the problem but all in all this game is freaking awesome, but beware, you might get halfway through the game and have to restart all over.			"

												I remember playing this game years and years ago, and had such a good time messing around in a park. I couldn't install it from disc on modern operating systems anymore, so I lost sight of it until the Steam Sale of this year. I immediately got this edition and all the nostalgia rushed back at me. This game is very realistic and challenging, despite it being already sixteen years old. You need to be able to handle money and guest needs in order to reach the goal in every scenario. Do you loan more money? Would you rather custom build your own coasters or use prebuilt ones? Do you have enough mechanics and handymen to keep your park in working order? Are the guests happy? There is a lot to take into consideration, and that is what makes this game fun to play over and over again. Even after finishing a scenario you can simply try again differently if you wish. With many scenarios present in the Deluxe Edition, some with blank parks and some with pre-built parks, you can have a lot of fun.For me it works on Windows 8 in fullscreen mode.			"

												It was a stormy summers eve when I bought this game. My childhood memories of this game overtook me with nostalgia and forced me to press ""Buy"". I installed the game and watched it boot up, the carnival music filling the room as the rain beat against the window outside. I start a new game, and descended into Hell. I broke all the rides, drowned all the children, every bathroom had a fee of fifty dollars and the exit was closed, trapping everyone in my eternal damnation. The food was infested with flies and the security guards were nowhere to be found. The entertainers robbed the customers before they all huddled inside the haunted house and sacrificed them to the dark lord. My greatest dreams came true, thanks to this game. 10/10, would recommend.			"

												Note: Ive owned this game since it came out, and have far more than 20 or so hours actually invested into itRollercoaster Tycoon 1 is a phenominal theme park sim. You basically just get to build and manage a theme park, either one thats already mostly built, or one you make from scratch. For a game from 1999, the graphics hold up quite well, and I havnt had any real issues running this. For reference, Im currently using a laptop running Win7. The music isnt bad, it can just get a little stale after playing for hours at a time. Honestly, I own Rollercoaster Tycoon 1, 2, and three, with all of the DLC, and this one is the one I return to the most. Pro's:Super funEasy to learn, but difficult to masterNice graphicsCan easily sink 100+ hours into this gameCon's:Music gets repetitive after a while, but can muteGame is almost 20 years old, can have issues on newer systemsCan easily sink 100+ hours into this game			"

												Like the RollerCoaster Tycoon from your childhood?On Steam?That's the greatest thing EVAR.So.  RCT, the first.  It's awesome.  It wasn't as complex as it's predecessor RCT3, but it had a simplicity that made your tiled parks so appealing.I have like, no hours on record; but I play this game religiously when I have no internet access.  I don't think Steam likes recording my hours.Not to mention the thousands of hours I wasted on the enormous map ""Evergreen Gardens"" as a kid; that you just have to fill up with raw, unbridled THEME PARK.....

												I feel so nostalgic when I play this game, wether it be the endless possibility's of coaster building, making a trap so that the guests can never leave your park ever once inside, (I know genius of me isn't it lol) or almost everything in the game, it will satisfy you more than you think only because in your park, you have endless time to think of your next move. Games need more of that kind of thing in my opinion. A mode where the possibility's are endless, Like Garry's Mod. But forget that, your here to know what I think and than criticize it, (Most people anyway) well that's just it really. There is nothing else to this, just that I love this game too much to refund forever.			"

												Work painstakingly to craft the theme park of your dreams, meticulously managing admission rates, food prices, and even constructing custom rides in a deep, satisfying retro game experience.Or, go to the unlimited money park, slap a DO NOT ENTER sign in front of the exit, construct your rides to be lethal, and delight in having made the worlds most brightly coloured death camp. Either way, it's a good time.			"

												I remember playing this game years and years ago, and had such a good time messing around in a park. I couldn't install it from disc on modern operating systems anymore, so I lost sight of it until the Steam Sale of this year. I immediately got this edition and all the nostalgia rushed back at me. This game is very realistic and challenging, despite it being already sixteen years old. You need to be able to handle money and guest needs in order to reach the goal in every scenario. Do you loan more money? Would you rather custom build your own coasters or use prebuilt ones? Do you have enough mechanics and handymen to keep your park in working order? Are the guests happy? There is a lot to take into consideration, and that is what makes this game fun to play over and over again. Even after finishing a scenario you can simply try again differently if you wish. With many scenarios present in the Deluxe Edition, some with blank parks and some with pre-built parks, you can have a lot of fun.For me it works on Windows 8 in fullscreen mode.			"

												If Steam existed 15 years ago, I would have thousands upon thousands of hours logged in this game. I've played this game all my life and nothing parallels it to me. I've never been one to build ""death parks"" or drown hundrds of guests at once (though believe me, I have at one point or another), but I can lose myself for hours managing my assets and maximizing profits through every little data point the game lets you tweak and customize. It's the perfect mix of art and science - though it takes a while to get the hang of balancing costs and profits, every level offers room for creativity in working with the space given to you and designing crazy coasters to attract new visitors. As a perfectionist with OCD, nothing satisfies me more than seeing all the tiny tweaks and behind-the-scenes minutia add up to a park full of happy customers, and hearing all the delighted screams and chatter mixed with rushing coasters and the iconic Merry-Go-Round music. For my money, this is the best game ever made.			"

												Please do not let the time fool you I have hundreds of hours in this game. Have had this game on disc since it came out. This game is absolutely great. People I see complaining about ""no remastering, no retouching, nothing new"" can honestly go to [redacted]. This game doesn't need it. It was great back then, and it is still great now. It may be simple and it may have its issues, but that is honestly what makes it great. The parks and their objectives range from easy to challenging. What is better however is playing the parks after the objectives conclude. Some of them have so much expansion room that you can double or triple the size of the original park. Honestly, many of the parks only come into their own after the objectives have been completed because if you stay with them, what you can research and what you can build is just great. The only reason I have the steam version, plus low time, is because it was on sale and because I wanted to play them on my newer computers. Still have an old XP desktop with my original game and about 90% of the parks unlocked.			"

												I've literally been playing this game since I was 12(28 now), and every time I sit down to play again it is as charming as ever. I also find that I play it a little bit differently each time, finding new ways to be successful , which to me, is one of the things that makes the game so interesting. There really isn't a right or wrong way to play, and even after all this time there are still people sharing their designs online, whether they be for rides or parks, which is fairly unique. This package is so great, not just because of the price, but because it includes both expansion packs as well. The original stand alone game is deep on it's own, even by today's standards, but with the additional attractions and scenarios the game basically expands to 3 games in one.When you think of if that way, it's basically the price of 3 good apps for your smartphone.

												Probably one of the best games ever, and I've been playing the vanilla game since its release in the late 1990's. This package includes the extensions and it's a f***load of fun too. All in all, I'd recommend this game over its sequels because of the much softer learning curves for the management aspect, but there's still the park editor and creator missing from the later game which is why you should get RCT #2 or #3 if you're looking for a sandbox experience.

												This game is just as addictive as it was when I first played it.You get many hours of content with this game. It is simple enough to get started with just enough features to make some wacky parks. Two major downsides for me are that the isometric camera makes it difficult to build at times and that it can also be frustrating when you have to work with the landscaping. However, if you stick to it, you'll get used to it. If it gives you any trouble starting up on Windows 7 or beyond, adjust the compatibility settings. Enjoy!			"

You can build your own rollercoasters or build the ones that are already made.  It is really fun to color coordinate your rides and theme your parks.  The graphics are a little dated and it takes some fiddling to get the settings to be just right on a more advanced computer.  Overall, this game is very fun as well as reasonably priced for what you get.  Yes, it's an older game but it still a lot of fun and it brings back great memories!			"

												This game is honestly one of my favorite games of all time. I've sunk probably a couple thousand hours into this game throughout my entire life (Don't let the steam hours fool you), with both the regular and deluxe editions. Everything about this game ranges from great to perfect. This game has one of the most memorable soundtracks I've ever heard, with everything from the title theme to the music tracks that the rides can play. The game itself is incredibly simplistic, with the interface being easy to navigate and control, but still has enough complexity in how you have to manage everything in order to properly meet your objectives, and stay out of debt. It also has tons of replayability, and it takes a long time in order for it to actually become boring. The difficulty is the only thing remotely negative that I feel that this game has, and the only reason I feel this way is because it doesn't really have much consistency with how it progresses, as some parks early on will be more difficult than ones that you end up unlocking later from completing more parks' objectives. The Scores  Gameplay  : 9/10 Audio  : 10/10 Visuals  : 8/10 Difficulty  : 6/10 Overall: 8.5 / 10 A great game that has withstood the test of time for over 17 years.Would reccomend to anyone who enjoys simulation games, or just wants a fun little time waster.

												With the new Planet Coasters game and the latest RollerCoaster Tycoon having just been released, I felt some nostalgia to go back and play a bit of this one. I played it a lot years ago, an it's still a great game to this day. This game really sets the standard for a park sim. It's approachable for a new player to just go in and start throwing coasters and other rides around, but you will quickly realize the level of depth there is to the park management. From keeping eye on customer satisfaction with pricing per ride, to promotions to increase interest in your park, this game packs some fine details for being the first release in the series. If you're not sure you're into park sims, this is a great place to start before delving into newer games!			"

												I remember purchasing this game when it came out, and ever subsequent expansion pack and sequel. From the beginning, RCT invites you to take full control of a world of theme parks and encourages you to not only manage a successful business, but to design the coasters of your dreams along with a great selection of theming, scenery, music and other fun rides. While RCT2 added much more control of scenery and added a lot of new rides, its merely another expansion for this one (in my opinion).  For the time, the isometric graphics were great and many games since have copied the Railroad/RC Tycoon game's ability to easily convey to the user how things should look. While not incredibly realistic, the game does introduce you to other parts of the world and how they view theme parks and attractions. It wasn't until this game's release did I ever hear about free admission to parks and paying for riding the rides, but thats how a lot places in Europe go about it. By the way, this team was based out of the UK which is why some things are surprising for US audiences.If you're going to buy a version of this game, I highly encourage RCT2 for the added scenery and construction options as well as the Six Flags park packs. RCT 3 is also very fun, it came out not long after SIM Theme Park and SIMcoaster which (both borrowed tons from this game) and adds the ability to ride nearly every single attraction. It's still a classic to me, and I will never be able to get the music out of my head.			"

												While it's not the newest game on the market it is the classic themepark simulator, and is surely used as a role model for even newer games like it. The game itself offers many challenges, and while not graphically astonishing will keep the player glued to the game for more than hundred hours of gameplay.			"

												Had this game as a kid. Saw it on steam sale for a buck. As in...ONE DOLLAR. So I got it. And it's every bit as good as I remember it being.There are so many things I could say about this game, but all you really need to know is that you are seriously wasting your time reading this review seeing as I'm not very good with words, and you could be using this time for something far more useful, like buying this game and experiencing immense nostalgia, and probably a little lack of sleep from staying up until all hours of the night playing this game........Seriously, you're not still reading this, are you??!?!

As per the instruction manual, you will require: 1 disc drive, 200mb hard drive space, among other things. (Game download is 400mb, And its not on a disk anymore). This game will also positively ruin your multitasking experience, Attempting to alt+tab, or switch windows whatsoever with the game open will promptly render thus windows unusable, and the game is also click-through (Make sure you are on your desktop before you launch, Tested win8.1).

												Such a nostalgia trip~Definitely still holds up as an easy building/management game that's great for all ages, beginners and experts alike. There's a lot of fun to be had starting up a little park then watching it grow slowly over time as you add stalls and rides and even build your own roller coasters. I absolutely love this game and remember playing it a lot as a kid (I still have the CD laying around, but I may or may not have lost it) and its sequel RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 adds to the experience in so many lovely ways~But since I played RCT1 much, much more than 2, I have to say that this is my favorite entry to the series with the second game nearly tying. RCT 3 was an interesting jump into 3D that added quite a bit and changed things up, but you can just never beat a classic~ Plus this game works on almost any computer due to its 2D nature and sprite-art, so I'm sure it'd work on a toaster if you had the right OS.Buy the game if you like management genres, but don't expect the deepest of intricacies.

												This was the first real computer game I ever remember playing (I was probably about six or seven) and it's still a ton of fun. I still have an original physical copy, but I figured I'd get the Steam version for the expansion packs. It runs awesome on Windows 10 assuming you can install DirectPlay as easily as I was able to. 10/10 RTC is an utter classic. I'm excited for Planet Coaster when it's been thoroughly updated (*cough* what's Rollercoaster Tycoon World? Pff). It's cool to play the first game in the franchise for the nostalgia, though.			"

												First off it is a shame that there is no middle option for a review because this game is great and you should buy it... but it has one big flaw that lets it down hugely (skip to the bottom to see what that is if you don't want to read the whole thing.I would like to say that this is the type of game that makes you sit back and think ""I havn't played a game this fun and simple and really enjoyable in years"", it is made to be fun which is a word not usually heard in video gaming these days.As this is a game that you can buy on disc i will compare it to the disc version but first lets talk about the game on its own: It is a very happy game and definatly cheers me up, running a theme park is wierdly enjoyable and when you win the guests all clap for you (which is so cute, also if they are holding a balloon they let go and it fly's into the air (simply joys)), it has many different parks with a lot of variety in goals and map types, the graphics are still decent and the little sweeping activity the handmen do is very sweet, and if you are a phycopath then forcing the rides to fall off the rails makes a great explosion.Now lets start comparing Pros of Steam version: It has a lot more variety of maps includng real world parks, there are more variety of rides, making banners is fun, also (only fans of the disc version will understand) you can set the price of all the burger stand to be the same price and not have to go round changing them all.Cons of the steam version:  It may just be with my version but you can't see what the rides will look like untill they are built (except for the original rides that were on the original disc version) this is very annoying as i don't know what the ride is at all or if it will be similar to previous rides i have or if it will be too extreme for my guests. Also,  most of the new rides are far to big for any park and are too exspensive to be able to build. It is a shame that they have this variety of new ride designs but it is impossible to use this feature.If you liked the original disc version when you were younger then get this, it will be quite the nostalga ride and I look forward to seeing you at the exit saying ""Rollarcoaster tycoon 1 was great!"" (if you get my reference to the game)			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon is highly recommended to get! I always played this game when I was younger and its still very fun today! Pretty much this game is saying, ""Don't have enough money to make a real amusement park? Buy this game and you can make what ever amusement park you'd like!"" + This game is the deluxe which means it comes with everything Rollercoaster Tycoon had to give, all in one!			"

												I had been intrigued by this game when it was new, but never bought it. Saw it for sale recently and decided to see what the fuss was all about. It was at about 11 p.m. when I decided I'd poke around with it for a couple hours before going to bed.Eventually, I decided it must be getting late so I'd better save the game and go to bed. I did, turned off the computer, turned around, and noticed daylight in the window. I looked at the clock. It was 9:30 a.m.My wife wondered what the heck had kept me from going to bed all night. I showed her the park I had made. She bought her own copy for her laptop, and has been playing it all night.On my Windows 10 desktop PC, the game ran with no problems. On her Windows Vista laptop, it had to be set to run in Windows 95 Compatibility Mode to keep it from crashing when loading a saved game. Note that I think the game runs in 256-color mode, so it probably will not display correctly in Windows 7 or Windows 8, as those operating systems handled 256-color palettes differently than earlier or later versions of Windows.

												Pros:- It's RollerCoaster Tycoon with both expansions.- you can build your own rides.- you can let people drown if they don't want to pay $40 to ride your inventive creation.- you can let people be killed if they actually want to pay $40 to ride your ""inventive"" creation.- you can change the name of parks and rides to whatever you want.- The game got some really challenging scenarios for you.- It's old.Cons: - Steam Overlay doesn't work.- Right after you stopped playing or you tab out to your desktop you aren't always able to open another program. (will sometimes work after a little bit of time and some clicking - it's a bit random).- It's old (some rumours say it can be a con as well).- heard about that it doesn't work on Win 8. (I can't really say if that's true because I don't even own Win 8).OS I used/use to play the Steam version: Win7 & Win10This is a good game! I recommend it! And you can even play it on nearly any PC, unless it's a potato.But I can't say anything if it will work on any other OS's (I only got Win 7 & 10).And of course if you can't live with the con's reconsider if you really want to buy this game.

												It's a good game but can be difficult! So, remember if you're really planning to get this game, IT'S NOT GONNA BE A WALK IN THE PARK!I was originally hoping to see more sandbox features but when I started seeing if I wanted the game, I knew that was NOT gonna be the case.Roller Coaster Tycoon has a great number of things to do and unlock with rising difficulty. I obviously haven't played much of it and I definently will.It earns a solid 8.5 out of 10 in my opinion.TBH i bet if I play more that rating will increase by large amounts! :)RECOMMENDED! :)			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon: Deluxe is the First installment of the RollerCoaster Tycoon Franchise. This game was made I believe late 1990's or early 2000's, with pretty good graphics and programming, made by one guy (Chris Sawyer).I remember when I first started playing this game when I was 7 years old, I had no idea what I was doing, but I had fun messing around until I went bankrupt or something. Now I know how to properly manage a park, and respond to the guests' demands, as well as making sure I make a nice and steady profit.This game still holds up really well IMO, and is nice to kill some time when you got nothing to do or anything like that. The game is also very realistic, people react to what happens in the park, not entirely, but functionally. Here's to name a few things:1. If a RollerCoaster crashes (Accidentally), some people will leave the park and the ride's popularity will plumet to 0%2. A ride's intensity and price will affect whether a guest will ride it or not (Some guests like intense rides, some don't)3. When you begin building more than 3 (Good) RollerCoasters, guests will start to no longer want to pay more than $1.00 for less thrilling rides.Just to name some things---(Also, Employees get paid less than minumum wage on this game, so be glad you don't live in a RollerCoaster Tycoon world, or you'll be living with $35-$50 a month)Overall, it's a good gameIf you like RollerCoasters, Tycoons, and CHEAP games, then give this one a try.

												With the new Planet Coasters game and the latest RollerCoaster Tycoon having just been released, I felt some nostalgia to go back and play a bit of this one. I played it a lot years ago, an it's still a great game to this day. This game really sets the standard for a park sim. It's approachable for a new player to just go in and start throwing coasters and other rides around, but you will quickly realize the level of depth there is to the park management. From keeping eye on customer satisfaction with pricing per ride, to promotions to increase interest in your park, this game packs some fine details for being the first release in the series. If you're not sure you're into park sims, this is a great place to start before delving into newer games!			"

												If, like me, your original experience of simulation games was as a child playing RollerCoaster Tycoon then the came has aged to a point where it's still incredibly enjoyable. While certain taken-for-granted mechanics like game speed aren't available, and the roster of rides and attractions grew increasingly through the series (which ends at RCT3...it has to), this is well worth picking up again for the memories, the satisfaction of completing the huge number of scenarios and to relive a classic.

												In my opinion this game is a very fun game and so far even though I suck at this type of game the game kind've gives me a drive to keep going. My only issues so far are that the A.I (to be expected) sometimes is a little wonky as one time one of my rides was not working for like a long time and the engineers wouldn't fix it even when I told them to and turned off inspect rides. So far so good so I give this game a very positive review. One last thing before this is done for some reason sometimes my game's colors just die out for some reason not sure if it's just my laptop (as I'm typing this review it is happening) but other than that fantastic game that I would reccomend to people who are new to this type of game as in my opinion it is easy to pick up and addictive to play.

												Man, what a deal this is -- I paid $50 or so for this when it was new over a decade ago, and then bought the expansions separately after that. Fast forward to now and while I can find the discs, they're scratched up and my computer won't read them properly half the time. I got this for $2.49 on sale and it is very much worth that price. Hell, I'd say it's worth ten times that when you look at the amount of scenarios and content this game has.For the uninitiated, you build a theme park... sometimes from scratch, sometimes adding on to an existing park. Some scenarios require you to have a certain amount of guests, a certain park rating, or increase the value of the park by a certain amount before a year or more has passed in the game. There are dozens of attractions, coasters, rides, and shops to place into your park and quite a few besides just the roller coasters allow you to construct a ride of your own design (other ""build your own"" rides include a boat hire, train, monorail, car ride, log flume, and water slides), and there are a dozen or so types of coasters on top of that.Building and running a successful park is a balancing act of proper pricing, layout, marketing, and well-designed custom rides. You can't just make a coaster with a 90 foot drop that sends your patrons through all kinds of madness at 80 mph -- they won't get on it because it's too scary. A successful coaster has lots of different elements (hills, banked turns, helixes, tunnels, loops, and what have you), goes through those elements at the proper speed, and has scenery and theming that add to the ride's excitement (like rushing through a row of trees after a big drop, or a loop that has a track going through it).I feel like I could talk about this game forever... in short, if you like building things, buy this game. If you like theme park sims, buy this game. If you are put off by the dated graphics (which still look pretty darn good to me), buy this game anyway and be surprised at the depth and amount of content there is.I can't recommend this game enough.

												A must-play classic. Many would say its sequel RCT2 is superior with more rides, scenery, scenario editor etc, but RCT1 has the vastly better learning curve and scenario structure. The challenges are more interesting and is a much better sense of progression over the sequels. While in RCT2 you are often presented with empty landscapes to build a fresh park, most of the RCT1 scenarios involve picking up an existing park (with a few really cool starting rides) and fixing its unique problems.The challenge progression also takes you through the history of theme park rides (up until the late 90s). The first available rides tend to be wooden or small coasters, but eventually you are introduced to the 70s classic Arrows and Schwartzkopfs, and the later parks include the more modern (at the time) B&Ms.			"

												If you like building sims, or you just want to see the many ways you can have kids never leave, or just want to watch some kidss have fatal accidents, this is your game!I don't know how many hours I've ACTUALLY clocked in on this game (owned it back before Steam was a thing), but I never tire from the challenges this game provides just to unlock new levels, nor from finding new ways for me to kill, confuse, or otherwise keep kids from ever leaving >:)Plus, I never tire from seeing the trains crash into one another...usually without passangers >.>			"

												Quand j'ai vu ce jeu, j'ai eus énormément de souvenirs qui sont revenus (pourtant je suis assez jeune et j'ai pas connu l'époque du jeu). Donc, je l'ai acheté et je suis toujours aussi content d'y jouer. Juste un petit défaut : les montagnes russes un trop fortes en sensations ne sont pas prisées et donc il faut chercher un équilibre infini entre sensations et calme, donc c'est un peu génant quand on fait une montagne russe nous même et il faut la changer :D			"

												Still one of the best theme park games of all time. Got it for $1.50 and worth a hell of a lot more.			"

												What a nice ride down memory lane with this game. I remember getting up in the middle of the night and sneeking out of my bedroom into the office with the computer and playing this game. Will always be a classic.			"

												Favorite game of my childhood. Still a wonderful game! The challenge of constructing the perfect roller coaster is intriguing, the goal for each park is fun, and unlocking new parks is always exciting. I just wish my guests enjoyed the scenery and my artfully constructed food courts...			"

												Oh, Rollercoaster Tycoon. My childhood in all of it's glory of crashing train cars, dirty parks, and stupidly easy to obtain profits. Nothing about this game is particulary challenging, and building your own coasters from scratch is tedious as hell, but it's all rewarding in it's own way. It's stupid fun even now, over fifteen years after it's initial release. I just wish I didn't have to mess with my resolution settings every time I wanted to play.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon is a very good game. It doesn't have any issues I've found, but it does have an annoying thing. The time in the game can go really slowly. I'm waiting in one level to reach October, and it's taking forever. Beside that, it is a really amazing game.			"

												Great to be able to play a game from my childhood again ( even though my mum left my dad for a bit because he got that addicted to playing it!). I love everything about the game and the graphics are still good today. One of my rollercoasters however did crash and kill 16 guests which never happened to me on the pre set ride layouts before! so its still giving me new challenges to this day!			"

												The best of the bunch for scenarios and challenge. Still beats brand new releases in many aspects of game and visual design. If you just want to build rollercoasters and carry out genocide, the sequel is probably a better option.			"

												One of the best games ever the origional one was always the best by far! If they just kept bringing out that one with new updates everyone would still buy it over and over again, i think many will agree with me, i have been playing this game from day 1 1999? or a similar date and its one of the best games ever i will play this for the next 20 years too.
