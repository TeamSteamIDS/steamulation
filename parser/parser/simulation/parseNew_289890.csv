												It is what JA: Back in action should have been. More guns, mods, combine 2 mags with ductape, create tripwires. Challening gun play with the most detailed combat system on this kind of games. If you are a fan of tactical shooters, you really should give this a try. Steam version also comes with an easy way to install much needed community mods (Blue Sun Mod) and patches. See the sticky in the game forum. You might want to give vanilla a try first to get into the story line. The mods seems to make it more sandboxy, not that there is anything wrong with that.I have had problems running the game on Windows 7 in the GOG version. But this version seems to run fine on Windows 7.Update: Game has had some issues. But publisher and mod developer has released day 1 patch when I posted crash log.  One time it was crash and another time it was wrong translation in the mod.I have played the vanilla more than my game time says on Steam, game is new on Steam but its an elder gem of a game.			"

												You are a mercenary in  small Latin American country during a revolution. Your main contract is to hunt down Russian businessmen, and while doing that you will eather protect the govermnent or help the bunch of bearded men with Kalashnokovs to take over the country. Well, this is not a new game. In fact, it was released in 2009, so don't expect up-to-date graphics. Its gameplay is what makes this game unique. It's the most realistic tactical simulator in the world. The closest example is new JA.Second strength of 7.62 High Caliber is guns. There are tons of guns (pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, smgs, machine guns, rifles, sniper rifles) and lots of attachements (scopes, colimators, laser sights, flashlights, grips, grenade launchers).So, if you are looking for realistic tactical simulator with enormous  range of guns - this is the game. P.S. I would also recomment checking out Hard Life and Arma Realista mods. Hard LIfe makes game more varied, add more capabilities; Arma Realista makes range of guns more authentic for Latin American region (how about 20 types of AK and 15 clones of Colt 1911?) "

												Probably the best real-time JA2 clone I've played. It has much of the deep modelling that JA2 had that very few recent tactical games have had, e.g. new XCom - which was a great game, but didn't do as much to sate the micromanagement itch of obsessively modelling character states and subtle differences in ammunition types. Lots of weapons and weapon-related stats.Also very tough, as it befits the genre. The stunning mechanic when being hit and the adrenaline mechanic that penalizes your accuracy when there's a lot of near misses flying around as well as other mechanics make life very challenging when outnumbered (which is pretty much always). Even fairly novice characters will hit targets at optimal weapon range if left alone, so you really need a plan to be successful in game.Game has some stability issues (save often - though you'd do that regardless), some interface issues and a plot that doesn't really make sense, but it's also incredibly fun for those who like the JA2 mechanical formula and are compulsive about micromanaging for tiny advantages.

												Chances are that you have never heard of this game. You'll most likely not have heard of Apeiron, the developers, either. It's one of those obscure Russian titles that have been released in Russia for a few years, and had many years of delay to get a translation going.The main focus of the game is tactical team based combat. It takes a lot of elements straight out of the Jagged Alliance series. A big difference is the lack of turn based combat. Everything is completely real-time, with a twist. You can set events at which moment the game can pause, zoom in on the event, show a shortcut and have a popup. . Because one or two seconds can literally mean life or death, it's quite handy to be able to hand out orders on the millisecond.Besides micromanaging the orders on the field of battle, there is also the micromanagement of your inventory and loadout. You can carry backpacks, belts with extra pouches, tactical vests, armored vests and you can throw a weapon or two around your neck.The game features approximately 225 weapons, and although some of these weapons are variants of another one, you'll probably never get bored of them. The combat can be really intense. You and your band of fearless mercenaries are often, if not always, outnumbered. This is where superior equipment, superior tactics and quick saving comes into play.The game is pretty poorly optimized, and suffers from a horrible memory leak that the developers have, apparently, been unable to fix.You'll also come across a bug or two that will render a quest broken, as the guy you needed to kill or escort out is stuck in a ceiling. It might be funny at first, but it can quickly become frustrating.  The voice acting is atrocious, as well. Fortunately, you can drag the speech slider down to 0. If you were into Jagged Alliance or the UFO series, then you should probably give this a go.  "

												One of the three Apeiron games, famous with their game engine, made exactly for squad-based tactical wargames simulations. Recently it was updated with Hard Life community mod, which optimised some of game's features and edged to maximum its strong and weak sides.In short, I can suggest and propose that game only to quite small cohort of true fans of tactical squad-based games a-la ""Jagged Alliance"". In fact, community-upgraded versions of 7.62 and Brigade E5, another Apeiron game, are probably the most capable successors and inheritors of Jagged Alliance good fortune (along with just a few more titles, like Silent Storm and some more).So. You take the command over small group of mercenaries, merged into another domestic war in small 3rd-world country. You manage guns , tons of them, equip vests, scopes and other tacticool little things which make you a bit more ready-for-anything... And you constantly engaging in some fierce shootouts, where you need to use all your tactical skills and the best of luck, to stay alive for another day. Fight, collect trophies, rest, find a new quest for your squad, get to the new location, goto 10 - the golden formula from Jagged Alliance. If you're still reading, guess you already know all that drill.Now, what's the special about Apeiron engine and game in general?First, it is NOT turn-based, it is using smart-pause real-time pattern instead. You could have seen that in the recent ""remake"" Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, but trust me, it was only spoiled there. Apeiron created, up to the moment, the most complicated and advanced engine to perform a gunfight between small squads. Ballistics, lines of sights, variable reliefs and layouts, combat interferences, contusions - just name it - it is there. Second, if we don't speak about engine, but overall game's features instead - sadly, it is weak, at best. Lame scenario, questionable and obscure quests and so on. If you're coming to the game not just for refined tactical simulation, that's not the right project. I can suggest to look for the next Apeiron game, Marauder, as there will be at least some of plot, narrative motivation and other things we're usually expecting from the complete game, as of the any piece of art.As of conclusion, 7.62 is a niche product, connoisseurs of the tactical combats only. The gameplay is about tune your gear, shoot some folks, rince and repeat. Guns-adorers would find many satysfaction there, with all charts, graphs for hundreds of various tools of death. Normal players, who are not ready to shift all those irons hours after hours and then perform one battle, about 2-3 minutes of ""clear"" time, in another dozen of hours, with every second micromanagement fixes, saves and reloads... Normal players will be either bored from the first look, or drained and exhausted, when with all time needed to finish another Call-of-Duty project, they only (probably) manage to clear the first village there...As of my mark, usually I'm not high about projects where so many gameplay parts are obviously ill-performed. But, with 7.62, with all community support... It is worth my 8/10 mark, as I'm really like squad-based tactics and guns, and this is one the best on given patterns.			"

												I honestly don't know how to feel about this game. On one hand it's a game that's just overflowing with massive flaws. The graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ a ♥♥♥♥ ton of buildings are copied and pasted (seriously, every town has the same damn hospital and bar), the UI is pretty unintuitive, and the game is buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥and prone to crashes.Still though, it's a game that's just bursting with ideas. The inventory is complex and rather interesting. You want to be able to do more than just sling a rifle/shotgun over your shoulder and carry a pistol and some other stuff in your pockets? Well guess what, buddy, you're going to need more than your pants and a t-shirt to do that. Get yourself a vest, bandolier, backpack, whatever if you want to store more gear. You just unloaded a bunch of loose shells from a shotgun and shoved them down your pants and now they're taking up a bunch of room. What are you going to do about it? Get a box for those shells of course! Uh oh, you just ran ou of ammo for your handgun in the middle of combat and need to reload it! Wait, what are you doing with that box of bullets? You don't just put bullets in a handgun! You put bullets in the magazine and then you put the magazine in the handgun silly! The inventory system just pays so much attention to even the most minute details that it's just awesome. It also helps that there's a ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous amount of items, weapons, and miscellaneous♥♥♥♥♥♥you can get.Then there's the combat. To put it simply, getting shot ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, as it should. There's no standing out in the open soaking up damage while mowing down enemies. You get shot, it really ♥♥♥♥ing hurts. Your character can bleed out. Your character can go into shock. Your character can pass out. Your character can drop his gun. Your character can just drop dead from that shot altogether. The same can happen to the enemy too though. I've yet to see any gore but the game's still incredibly morbid in terms of how it manages damage. I've finished quite a few fights where a few bandits and marauders who were mortally wounded just ended up succumbing to their injuries as I finished off their companions. Despite the lack of gore and copious amount of blood you see in games going for some sort of shock value, it manages to deliver the same amount of gruesome carnage and satisfaction games like Dead Space strive for.It's a game that's had a lot of heart and thought put into but it just doesn't feel like it had the budget to support all the great ideas it had wanted to share. If you can look past the copious amounts of technical issues, dated graphics, constantly copied and pasted structures, and poor user interface you'll find a game with quite a lot of potential. It's a shame I can only vote yes or no because this is one of those games I'd definitely just give a ""maybe""			"

												7.62 High Calibre is a Strategy Game developed by Apeiron and is the sequel to the game Brigade E5. It almost feels like a spirtual successor to the old Jagged Alliance games, which have influenced many games in their time. This game does not fail to impress, and emulate all the key elements of Jagged Alliance which made it such a good series, while bringing new features to the table.Based in the fictional nation of Algeira, a country just north of Brigade E5's previous warzone, you are a mercenary who has been hired to hunt down a Russian man who screwed over a bank and was never apprehended. He has fled to Algeira to avoid prosecution, and you'll have to hunt him down by any means necessary, and bring him back dead or alive. Of course, you'll start the game with rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ equipment which means you have to spend some time doing jobs on the side, but that's one of the big advantages of the game in a way, as it is a strategy game, yet you get to carve out your own destiny and plan prior to getting stuck in and finishing the main quest before you've even done the cool parts. If you go try to go ahead with the main plot and speedrun it, you'll most likely get curb-stomped unless you know what you're doing, but you're always free to roam the jungle and cities of Algeira, finding quests and new mercs to hire on your way, up to a 6-man squad.A big plus in my opinion is the HUGE variety of weapons you can get. Literally tons, from Glock 22's and P220's to Remington 870 Magnums and AKS-74U's, all the way up to FN Minimi's and M14 SOCOM rifles. You'll never go more than an hour without finding at least a few new weapons to play with, and they all come in many flavours of calibre, allowing you to mix and match your ammo with Armour Piercing Rounds, FMJ Rounds, and many more variants. Many weapons can also be custom rigged with scopes and lasers to allow you to get the most out of them in a firefight too. Even better is that the game can be installed with the Blue Sun Mod which adds a massive amount of content & weapons to a game which already has plenty to play with. I will mention how to install this mod at the end!The game's key feature is Real-Time Pausing, which allows for a mix between turn-based and real-time gameplay, allowing you to experience the best of both worlds. The game can be paused at any time to allow you to command your merry band of mercenaries, and then unpaused to let them carry out their actions. Alternatively you don't need to pause the game once (The game does it automatically VERY often but it can easily be disabled), and instead command your team on the fly, allowing for fast-paced combat and tactical planning to overcome the enemy. Sound Effects - 7.62 has a lot of good sound effects, mostly for the weapons you can get your hands on. Turn bass up on your computer and expect to hear some ear-shattering explosions and gunshots loud enough to kill a blue whale.Graphics - The game is a little dated now, and the graphics aren't really up to competition with the likes of XCOM - Enemy Unknown, but it's still a beautiful game. Watching the sun set over Algeira as you mow down squads of bandits with unending bullets is truly a wonderous sight. Some of the textures of the game aren't the greatest, but again, it's not a new game. AI - The AI is what makes the game so challenging. They're bloody smart, and will routinely change tactics just to get the drop on you. Snipers on your squad can be expected to be flanked while they shoot at other bad guys, and you'll have grenades thrown at you purely to force you to retreat, giving the enemy more ground to corner you into. They'll even retreat themselves if they know they're in trouble, and will regroup with their buddies so they can have another pop at you. If it seems too difficult however, you do have an option to dumb down the AI so they aren't performing counter-attacks that would see Delta Force hang their heads in shame.Playability - The game is very playable and enjoyable, albeit being a bit confusing at first. Tossed into some Latin country with nothing but a TT-33 and ammo can obviously be a little uninformative, so you'll have to do most of the snooping around yourself. The controls are relatively simple, but do get a little getting used to. One of the good (or bad, depending how you know guns) things about the game is that guns must be cleaned, have their magazines filled individually, and then loaded into the firearm that uses them, as it obviously doesn't help trying to fire empty mags at someone trying to take your head off. So bear in mind to use a firearm effectively -1. Make sure you have the right mags for the gun.2. Make sure you have the right calibre of ammunition for the gun.3. Make sure you have the gun loaded with a mag of ammo.It may seem a little condescending, but it's painfully easy to run into battle and forget that you never loaded your mags up, leaving you one full magazine to fight many enemies, unless you want to waste ages loading up each mag as you get shot at. ~The game also gives you a lot of leeway too, you aren't in a rush to complete the main quest, and you never really have to. If you just want to shoot cops in a 3rd World Dictatorship then the game won't stop you. But the Army might. On the other hand, if you want to hire your own private army and run a revolution of your own, then you can quite easily do that.~The developers of the game are very supportive and helpful to their community, who you can find on the discussions of this game frequently assisting players with technical issues and other options. They are very polite and can definitely be relied on, which is always a good thing.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The bad things worth mentioning ~ The game does have a tendency to crash. Make sure you save often and keep more than one save. The game auto-saves quite often, but even losing one save can set you back a little.~Sometimes enemies will get stuck on ladders for whatever reason, so if you've killed all the enemies you see but are still technically in 'combat mode', check the ladders.~Whether this is good or bad depends on how you like your game, (I like this but not everyone might) but the game is ridiculously difficult. You can add as many modifiers to make the game as easy as possible as you wish, but even then, enemies are very accurate and can shoot you in the head, (Near blinding you) shooting you in the chest (Crippling you), leg shots and even arm shots which will send your current weapon flying on the floor, stunning you in the process. Sometimes you'll end up in shock if you encounter many enemies at once, get shot at, or whatever else. It can be frustrating, but the enemy is also prone to all of this, so make your shots count. (The game is rather punishing but very satisfying to play)~The game is rather cheesy and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting you aren't fighting in the Congo in the 80's, especially with some of the silly dialogue options. The only thing that convinced me otherwise was the fact you can find things like Kriss Super V's and XM8's if you're lucky.~Like most RPG's, you can screw some missions up, and not even realise until you get to them. What I mean is that last guy you blasted in that town? Oh yeah, he's part of a quest later. So try not to be too trigger happy, even if it is just so you can kill them and take their weapons.[All in all however, this game is definitely worth buying. It's a steal too, for only $5, or £4. The Blue Sun Mod is recommended, as it adds a lot to this great game, as well as having patches. You can install it by right clicking on the game, going to propeties, beta (I think it's the last tab) and clicking the community patch.] One of my personal favourites, and I hope it'll be one of yours too. 9/10.

												7,62 High Calibre would be a great game except for the random crashes to desktop. No error messeges just click on an item, NPC or get shot and bam there is the desktop. All I can say is ""Save, save again and save some more."" Dispite the random crashes 7,62 High Calibre is fun and interesting to play. A Mod is also included just opt in on the beta properties menu. Read the Forum pin topic to learn more. I have not tried the Mod myself. I have noticed the crash problem is a little less frequent in a lower resolution 1280x720 and compatibility mod set to WinXP SP2.			"

												A brutal, unforgiving tactical game with semi-realistic guns and gun mechanics. The real-time with pause gameplay adds real diversity to the value of various weapons: a faster-drawing, lighter gun gets lead on target earlier than a larger, heavier-hitting one. Sometimes you'll want a pistol, other times a SMG or carbine, and others a full-size rifle, sniper rifle, or machinegun. It depends on the situation you find yourself in and how much time you have to prepare. It's a great change from games like Jagged Alliance 2, where rifles were always the best choice. Even in the late game, it pays to have a pistol available.If you're looking for a game that punches you in the face with realism, 7.62 isn't perfect but it's probably the best game out there. No other game models suppression, the faster pointability of smaller guns, and the psychological effect of getting shot as well as this game.			"

(Note, this review is for Brigade E6: 7,62 High Calibre with the Hard Life Addon)In a nutshell:♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥БлятьIn depth: 7,62 Hard Life is a 100% slav-certified content and mechanics overhaul to the slavtastic CTD operating-operationally Real-Time-With-Pause simulator Brigade E6: 7,62 (yurop and ,'s instead of .'s) High Calibre (or just 7,62 High Calibre in some locales). There's more than enough real life firearms and things that want to be firearms to satisfy even the greatest of autists and here's a real game that lets you live out your innawoods fantasies, removing kebab with obrez, RPG-7V and RPK and making Mikhail Kalashnikov (PBUH) proud from his home in vodka-heaven. Weapons have relatively realistic ranges, such as shotguns with slugs, flechettes or 00-buckshot having more that five inches of effective range and Jamal's AKM being able to hit people even at 100 yards given enough dakka used. Everything from♥♥♥♥♥♥diddly♥♥♥♥♥♥grip Makarov-PM in steel case 9x18mm to ivan YES 7.62x54mmR glorious russian have their own effective ranges, but rounds fired still go places, and that includes places you don't want them to go. If you don't follow the four cardinal rules of firearm safety you are going to make Jeff Cooper cry and hit some poor mexican peasant because you FORGOT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S BEHIND YOUR TARGET. You can also tacticool many weapons to your inner-operator's content, like adding suppressors (which you have to find the proper caliber ones for your guns), lasers, flashlights, night-fighting equipment, bayonets, grenade launchers, KAC masterkeys, optics in red-dot, reflex, combat scopes, sniper scopes and so forth of multiple actual brands, models, sizes and mounts. Yes, unless you get the proper adaptors, your weaver rail mount♥♥♥♥♥♥will NOT go on your factory stock AK-74M. Rifle is fine, comrade. Different types of magazines fit in similar guns, like FAL magazines fitting in FAL derivatives, 75-round RPK drums fitting in regular AKMs, Beretta M951 mags going into Beretta M9s, etc. Basically every weapon, type of ammo, grain of dirt, etc. in the game has information on it, and firearms especially have stats like weight, accuracy at various ranges, durability, aftermarket acceptance, balance, rate of fire, time-to-ready and so forth that you have to pay attention to when you decide which one(s) work best for your various mercs and characters. If I haven't convinced you yet that this game is maximum operator yet then I don't know what will.Another 'tistic aspect is that even the individual rounds of ammo play a part, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ locally produced rounds having crap gunpowder and thus less velocity and less penetration, and top-tier FMJ or HP rounds from actual arsenals being the go-to for operating. Thus not only is it important to nab clean, reliable firearms and magazines that aren't beat up, it's also important to keep those mags loaded with good ammo or you're going to be jamming so hard you'll think you're at a punk rock concert. Basically, there's a lot more mechanics-wise in the game than you'd think and the manual only tells you so much, and unless you can read slav runes (Russian) the forums aren't really going to help you too much.The game itself has rather unique mechanics, being real-time with pause and all. Instead of other turn-based tacticool games like Jagged Alliance, 7,62 has everyone take their actions simultaneously, with all actions measured in seconds, with hip-fire shots taking less time and shots-through-optics taking much more. This does make things like soloing fights more viable, as instead of shooting one poor♥♥♥♥♥mook every turn and then being buried under a pile of incoming fire when it's the enemies' turn, you get to blap blap Jamal and Paco continuously as they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants and fire their glock-40 problem solvers sideways, making things like cover, concealment and proper positioning all the more relevant. Fights can and will be determined based on who has the drop on who, and you actually have to pay attention to force multipliers like suppressive fire, optics, numbers, good positioning and so forth, or die in extremely painful for you ways. Grenades track individual fragments from the explosion, different types of ammunition can be loaded in the same magazine, the NIJ rating of body armor actually matters, shooting someone in the arm is less likely to kill them than in center mass, etc.There's also a lot more into the game like finding, maintaining and inevitably losing cars (seriously, the breakdown rate on some of them is atrocious), maintaining your firearms (i.e. if you don't know the exact sequence to disassemble an M14 off the top of the top of your head you're screwed unless you have a cleaning kit), cleaning your ammo, keeping fed and watered, making sure to sleep so you don't go into shock for 5 minutes because you got grazed by .22LR, actually making sure to talk to everyone you meet or else you don't get the best results for quests, killing people you don't like, making weapons caches and pretending you're a mexican drug cartel, spending far too much time and money trying to keep your cars fuelled and fixed, and much much more.Story-wise the game gets kinda weird. Basically you're sent into a banana republic after you just got done ruining the neighboring banana republic (in Brigade E5: New Jagged Union) and you're being paid to find some slav thief who tried to steal money from a buncha Russian banker dudes, kick his balls in and bring him or proof of his death to your employers for lods of emone. If you play Hard Life (which comes with the base game as a separate game on Steam and is in my opinion a lot better, if not harder) then you start out in the camp of a buncha commie-wannabe revolutionaries and you have to fight your way to begin the actual main storyline. Regardless, along the way you get to work for the gommies or the gubmint, suck♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for firearms licenses (just like in New York), start a peasant rebellion, help out a bunch of hapless average Joes and kill more people than Simo Hayha and Vasili Zaitsev combined. You can work alone or hire a bunch of mercs who charge far too much for their services and even with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AIs every now and then. You can make money by killing bandits and rebels and selling their♥♥♥♥♥♥ opening up a gun store, taking over and running a gold mine, smuggling liquor and gold ore between two countries and so much more.There are downsides to having this much slav magic packed into one game, though. The game crashes so often you could probably record it on dashcams and make a Youtube compilation on it, the voice acting (what little of it you hear) is terri-bad, being a Russian game and all (think Men of War tier, just not THAT bad), a lot of the game, especially in Hard Life, remains either untranslated from slav runes or consists of Google-translate tier bad work. Enjoy having your magazines labelled ""clips"" half of the time and ""magazines"" the other half. There's very little documentation so many of the game mechanics will be figured out through trial-and-error, reading guides or forums, crying like a ♥♥♥♥♥ or hoping to the vodka god that things work. There's also a lot of glitches, some of which are potentially game or quest breaking, and if you play Hard Life it's probably a good idea to set manual saves in combat to ""unlimited"" in the config tool or you're going to wear out your F5 and F9 keys, as well as your LMB, from clicking ""load game"" so often. Be sure to save often as the game CAN AND WILL crash to desktop if you so much as look at it funny or even if it has been running so long. You may also run into terrible framerate lags, especially in towns, and I don't know of any fix. In fact, even the devs don't know how to fix some of the problems, but they sure try.Since I'm running out of characters, I'll tl;dr this: Slavtastic OPERATING simulator 10/10			"

												These games are awesome. Great concepts, complex calculations, a dynamic world, and utterly bugged from the very beginning. With community mods, they turn this game into one of the best games one could want to play. A definite must if you actual enjoy being frustrated by a game which is fairly ""Realistic"". Try several complex strategies, fail. Go gung-ho and start throwing grenades and hip shooting everything and succeed. Get even more frustrated.			"

												The concept of this game is what tactical shooters should be. This game fails on the basics of a good game though. Few good points:The amount of guns, the different brands of ammo (Brown Bear or WPA), inventory system is what should be in every game. This game also adds the mechanic of having magazines for guns. So you don't reload the gun (unless its an internal magazine) you reload the magainzes and load those into the gun, this allows for a lot more realism that is missing from other shooting games, IMO this should be standard in games.The Merc system is nice, but it should of been taken one step farther and allowed you customize mercs. Slave Mercs should level like everyone else. The pause system is interesting and different. As a 'gun guy' I feel like some of the timings needed to be adjusted, along with allowing you to do multiple things at once, you can't turn and prone at the same time for instance. It also allows for some time crunching manuveurs. Do you pull your side arm or reload your primary? This game is riddled with issues all over and it really ruins the experience in the end. BUT (and the reason I recommend this game) is hopefully more developers see the depth put into the concept of this game and can execute it better. So much potential is lost with this game.			"

[This text refers to the modified game - new version of BSM mod]Brief desricption of this game:This is a hardcore spiritual heir of Jagged Alliance series. It's ugly, unforgiving and full bothersome bugs. If you're a person who is raised on perfected, shiny and eye-catching, easy to learn triple A games and you hate games which don't explain anything... Well, this is not game for you. Even if you're a mega-fan of Sir-Tech genius and you love tactical gameplay, it cannot be quaranteed that like you'll like ""7,62"". Try it yourself, it's cheap and this the only way to judge it.Longer description (something like review:-))::This is a game that is hard to learn and hard to master. Even after 72 hrs of gameplay i didn't reveal all of it's secrets and nuances. You must learn how to travel, explore, fight, trade and execute mission targets by your own. It's highly recommended to read some guide before you enter the world of Algeira. It's not as bad as it can look, trust me. Your real enemy are serious technical issues which you'll certainly encouter during the game: translation problems, bugged quests, freezes and crashes. In addition this is game isn't a pretty one.So why there are currently 50 positive reviews on Steam? Because this game do it's job and it's really brilliant in surprisingly many aspects. I do not want to write a book about it. It's easier to me to highlight main points:Pros:- Graphics: Yep, Industrial Light and Magic didn't make FX for it, that's for sure:-) But you know, this game is not an high budget FPS, but modest tactical one and it's 8 years old! Graphics are pretty clear, you can easily see what is in your inventory, on the ground and where are the enemies. Farther, the are no limitations in camera control. You can zoom in, or zoom out without any restrictions. - Sounds and music: these are pretty decent. You'll probably get tired of this songs after a couple of dozens hours of gameplay, but you can easy change it using music mod. In terms of gunshot and explosions: you'll probably won't hear it in a loud and ""crunchy"" way due to distances in gunfight. These sounds are rather sharp, rattling and kind of ""dry"". There are no ""juicy booms"", forget about it. I read somewhere that part of these sound were recorded at the shooting range.- Tactical depth: this is one of most complexed and complicated game in whole military / tactical smart puase / turned based genres. There are virtually no limitations in the way you want to fight with enemy. You can use melee, huge range of small arms, grenades, booby-traps, you can use buildings, vegetation and terrain as cover and your advantage. You can flank your enemies, defend position, or attack aggressivly. Yo can snipe them slowly (if you can), put some OO buck in them in close range, or pin them down using squad automatic weapons. There are many, many tactical solutions, ""7,62"" at it's best... - Variety of weapons: you won't find anything that could be even close to ""7.62"" in this matter. It's incredible how developers and modders did their job. You know, it's like putting an editor from ""Guns & Ammo"" to game developing process! Yes, it's unbelievable how they have done it. You got everything in here: pistols, revolvers, shotguns, SMGs, rifles, assault rifles, carbines, PDWs, sniper rifles, antimaterial rifles, SAWs and grenade launchers. Every each gun has it's own statistics like: accuracy, durabilty / dirt resistance, rate of fire, inflicted damage / bullet penetration, balance, time to preparation etc. Believe me, this is very sophisticated system which is affected by skills of your merc, use of specific type of ammunition and for example attachments that you can mount on your weapon (scopes, collimators, underbarrell shotguns, bipods, silencers...). If you like guns, you'll be in heaven when you'll see it!- Smart Pause Mode: There are no action points when you move, shoot, or reload your weapon for example. Character skills are converted into time units. The higher are the merc skills, the faster he or she perform action. Of course there are skills that translate into precision or accuracy. It's very sufficient and effective hybrid system and it simply works very well.- User interface: Very transparent and intuitive in most cases.- Enviroment that could be partially destroyed. You can destroy unfortunately only light sources, cars and fences. Well, it's better than nothing...Cons:- Graphics: Oh man, just look at it...- First general reception and impression: It's clunky, ugly rough and plain.- Uncertainty: You never know if you're doing something right.- Goofy camera control: when you (or your enemies) are in bushes, or in tight building cornes camera starts to act crazy. It's really horrible...- Bugs, bugs, bugs: you'll find them everywhere. Fortunately, modding community has improved it significantly.- Pathfinding: it's very annoning, especially in combat. - Clipping objects and characters: enemies can sometims stuck inside of an inaccessible house and shot you through walls.- Serious problems with stablility: this game always crashes after one hour or so. There are extreme fps drop.- Dead world: shabby houses interiors, NPCs are like lifeless puppets, deserted streets and very limited interaction with the environment.As you see defect list is overwhelming. But believe me, if you're a fan of JA / UFO series, you played Silent Storm and you loved it, and gun-porn is a thing that makes your heart beat faster:-),  well you should at least give ""7,62"" a chance and consider buying it. This game is unique and you won't find this kind of tactical depth and weapon freakness anywhere else. It's really beautiful Slavic brothel !:-)			"

												I want to love this game.  I love turn/semi-turn based tactical shooters/RPG's.  (and have been playing them since ones like Xcom and MOM, or even the 'Gold Box' series for the C-64 were originally released).It's a great concept/start.  And while the same ~9 male or female faces, and running around to various cities asking tons of people the same questions does get tiring - I am more than willing to forgive those little things.You REALLY need to add the community mods (Blue Sun Mods, SilverGirls mods - Thanks SG & Thrillseeker)- which add a LOT.  But, imho, they can't overcome the insane inconsistent game mechanics.The cameara will drive you insane.  Regardless of the events settings.  No matter how you set the camera settings - you will be moving the camera around manually a LOT (especially elevation).  And you will find that the game will not always move the camera to the appropriate character - even if you have that enabled.  I can't count how many times I've lost someone because they were waiting for someone to enter their view (it's even happened to two characters with one standing behind one kneeling), but were shot by someone in plain sight (and we're talking 5 feet in front of them) because the camera never moved to them or the game selected them.  (and yes - those were set in the settings.)  And trying to view/move into buildings is insane.  You have to get them into a doorway (and if they pause - you're dead) or zoom down incredibly close which then looses area 'context'.  (If you can even do, because the camera won't 'back up' past the edge of the battle field...)Then there's the 'action'.  Or attempting to figure out how to consistenly 'pause' the action when required.  You invariably screw yourself because you go to pause, only to unpause it becuase the game just paused it before you tried to pause it.  (Get it?)  And, you tried to pause it because one of your characters was in 'no action' mode so that you could have another character do something else first, but the moment was lost because the game autmatically started the action again once you assigned a task to the first character. (And, seriously, every little millisecond in this games MATTERS) There should at least be an option to let you either UNPAUSE automatically - or manually.  (Like after you've assigned orders to ALL non-active allies).And then ther's the issue of the computer constantly 'cheating'.  Like ALWAYS being able to position characters PERFECTLY around corners/doorways so that you can't hit them (trying to do the exact same thing) while they smoke your people.  (And there is a 'jump-areound-the-corner', shoot, and move back, but you REALLY need to micromange camera and time for that character, and it usually doesn't work anyway, because when you pop around they get shots off before you do, or because it decides to have your chaaracter face a completely different direction than the previous one, or two, or...  And because your character HAS to turn to face before they START to shoot, well, you're dead.Other irritating items:Characters will die after being notifed that they were only shocked (no damage), or sustained very little damage (head, with helmets) or otherwise.  Have seen no damage hits to heads (with helmets) kill characters many times.Characters could be in the middle of throwing a grenade when a NPC gets near them, tries to pass, etc., and the player character will stop whatever they are doing to move (""pardon me miss, I was just trying to kill the bad guy""...)  AND, sometimes they move back (and you MIGHT be able to stop it).  And sometimes they don't.You will select Snap Shot for speed, and it does an Aimed shot anyway.  Or you select Aimed - but then you can't aim. (And I am talking about tens of times from the exact same save point - not different circumstances).Allies cannot shoot (even when barrel shows it extends past) or throw objects through walls.  Enemies can.  (Even when they are far away from it).Or, you're in a crouched position, and you can't stand.  (Like, behind a bar counter, which you need to - to be able to shoot the bad guys, but thery're blasting your head away meanwhile...)Forget trying to get past the Top Secret mission.  It will take you hours and hundreds of attempts.  (In a bar with 'innocents, and the enemy can get off 10 shots for each one of yours.  You can even trow grenades from behind the bar (ducked down) without those characters getting picked off - or the grenades going everywhere else, yadda...  (I still haven't - and have tried all kinds of ideas, including shooting/grenading first, trying to lead out of the bar, yadda...)And while you can get it at an excellent price, I believe there are other similar games at the same price point that aren't anywhere near as frustrating.This game does have the potential to be an awesome one.  But it needs some serious work.  Save your money.  And your time.  And your sanity.  Especially 'casual' gamers.			"

												(note: i prefer the 'hard life' version of this game, despite the fact that iteration suffers from humorous translation problems. being able to customize how easy or hard 7.62 is a big plus for me in hard life)This is easily the greatest X-COM/Jagged Alliance alike you've never played. I am going to tell you why, with a bit history on the side.Long before Aperion was founded and way back in the 90s, Vladimir Ufnarovskiy finished his college degree and proceeded to make his first computer game - Remember Tomorrow (or Pomni Budushcheye), a 4X title with a few unique spins. Sadly, that game didn't really take off anywhere, superseded in popularity by games like Master of Orion and the Russian multi-genre, cult classic Parkan: Imperial Chronicles. A modern reimaging of Remember Tomorrow was released on Steam months ago: Polaris Sector. That game is absolutely worth checking out if you want to scratch your 4X itch.Apeiron came to frution in 1999 under Ufnarovskiy's direction, and in 2002, a free to play prototype of their first game E5 was released. It gained a lot of positive attention, and 1C offered support and funds to help turn it into a full retail title. The proof of concept version of E5 had the foundations of all of Aperion's games: intricate control of squadmates and insanely detailed bullet ballistics. It was a mild success in its native country, but hardly made a dent outside of it. Regardless, E5 has earned a place in the hearts of those who wanted to see what 7.62's precursor is like and stuck with it until the end. 7.62 was released as a direct sequel to E5 in late 2007, and improved upon its flaws in various ways. I'm not going to beat around the bush - the UI in E5 is horrid, but 7.62 improved interaction with the game and made it more easy to swallow for newcomers. 7.62 is Aperion's most well known title, and for a lot of good reasons. Have you ever wanted to take upon the role of an mercenary operator in the middle of some sweaty and hot fictional South American country undergoing a civil war? This is what makes 7.62 great, even if it does suffer from bugs. You can obsess over every little piece of equipment you can carry and see how it can serve you best. Combat feels confusing, weighty and incredibly satisfying all at once. Not a whole lot compares after seeing a hostile flop over dead when you shoot him with your hunting shotgun, or tagging mulitple hostiles at once with said weapon. Just about all of the missions in 7.62 in are 'go there and do this', but it's impossible to predict if you'll get there safely because of how frantic the combat is.Sadly, there is a fly in the ointment for just about all of Aperion's games: the meele combat feels like an afterthought, but that's something to expected for an game engine that puts so much thought into how firearms affect everything. Along with this, all of their games are very ambitious and are riddled with bugs from development oversights. Still, if you have the patience and don't mind some bumps on the ride, you owe it to yourself to check out 7.62. A small, but incredibly dedicated community has worked to iron out the most offensive bugs, so make sure you take the time to see what fixes are out there.Another thing to note is that Apeiron provided development and historical counselling when Battlefront was making Combat Mission: Afganistan. There's an extra little tidbit for you if you like the Combat Mission games.			"

												Hands down the best tactical game ever made in terms of content and realism. Bullets are simulated as they travel just like Silent Storm, so no missing just because like XCOM:Enemy Unknown. It doesn't have the destructible environments of Silent Storm, but damn does it have more gear, weapons, attachments, armor, armor accessories, attachment attachments, guns for your guns, holsters for your guns, magazines, duct tape to turn your magazines into more magazines, grenades, and bullet types.

The story is lackluster, the characters are a joke, there are however some funny dialogues.I believe it's called the Blue Sun mod, improves the game but i personally have not installed it.The game is far better than the trailer makes it out to be.I'm only reccommending it for a certain type of people -- the people who bothered to stumble upon the game anyways.

												762 High Calibre is a top-down RTS game with RPG elements. You play as a mercenary hired to find and assassinate a man hiding somewhere in the war-torn region of Algiera, where a corrupt government faces off against an equally corrupt organization of rebels. Bandits, smugglers, mercenaries, and drug cartels run amok-taking advantage of the civil war to turn a profit at the expense of innocent people. You will have to choose your battles wisely and your friends carefully.The gameplay is good, with a focus on a large amount of weapon variation and the ability for players to choose how they want to apporach a given tactical scenario or situation. Either way, the player will almost always be vastly outnumbered by enemies, and combat is brutal (though in a good, challenging way.) and rarely felt frustrating to me personally. The player is given the option of choosing which side to support (The government or the rebels), which of course affects the story.The game does have a number of issues-there are some translation problems here and there or stilted dialogue, and the camera is uncooperative, especially when trying to rotate when you are near the edge of a map. There are some very occasional crashes.All of these things, however, are certainly worth dealing with, at least for me personally.The game comes with the hard life addon, which adds a significant amount of content to the game, though personally, I would recommend the blue sun mod, which also comes standard with every purchase (and can be activated by going to your properties-->betas tab, and clicking ""Community_patch_and_bsm"" from the dropdown menu. It has much of the content from te hard life addon, plus much more.)All in all, I'd say this game was an enjoyable experience for me.			"

												For those a fan of meticulous strategy, this game is for you. If you are a fan of RTS, you'll likely be bored. 7,62 plays at a slow pace. In my current 89 hours of gameplay, I've experienced a couple of firefights that sucked up two hours of time. Due to the player-controlled pausing system in which you can stop time to give directions to your mercinaries, an hour-long realtime firefight can be composed of only three or four minutes of action.That's part of what makes this game great though. This system allows for complex and detailed micro-management of your squad of mercs in ways not achievable with other titles. Not to mention the attention to detail of the engine's weapons and ammo system. An incredibly diverse and large in-game arsenal compete with weapons attachments makes this game very enjoyable for the kit or gear-♥♥♥♥♥. Red-dot sight not cutting it for you? No problem, slap on an ACOG. Need a higher round count or faster reload time? Here's a 100-round Beta C-Mag and a roll of duct tape to tape two magazines together. Just to highlight how deep the game goes, most FPS or shooter-type games use an ammo-pool system where the ammo is reloaded from a pool of round. Detailed shooter games use a magazine by magazine system, where the ammo is counted by magazine (i.e. Red Orchestra). 7,62 uses a round-by-round system. The engine counts every individual bullet in the magazine. This leads to some interesting situations where you can top off your shotgun's tube or a partially filled rifle magazine with a different type or quality of ammo.7,62 is not without its faults however. The game in its vanilla form is unplayable due to the glitches. You have to play this game with mods or you simply won't play at all. Fortunately, the Steam copy comes with the community patch and Blue Sun mod standard. Blue Sun is not without its glitches as well, but it does make the game playable while greatly expanding the arsenal and features as well as adding an entirely new questline seperate from the main questline. 7,62 also suffers from a unique ""memory drain/leak"" issue that I'm not entirely sure how to explain. This presents an issue for lower-end machines that should have no issue running it. With low-end and mid-end machines more than a few years old, expect CTDs up the wazoo once you put some hours into the game. Unfortunately, there isn't a fix for this short of deleting all local content and reinstalling fresh and it can only get worse. Heed my warning, hard save frequently.This is an enjoyable and realism-based title that I really wish was more polished. If you're a fan of detailed military strategy, for the couple bucks you'll pay for 7,62 High Calibre on a Steam sale its absolutely worth it.			"

												This game is really good. I must say I was surprised that I was unaware for so long of such a good game. Note that I really like tactics based RPGs. Positives:- A LOT of guns, seriously tons of different guns, different ammunition and even different mags,- Innovative mechanics whe your accurac depends on your stress level-  Challenging, On higher levels random encounters are really almost impossible- Character development is well thought. You really see that levelling up makes senseNegatives:- Glitchy. Sometimes you will be shot through walls, sometimes granade explodes in a bit peculiar way,- Music or maybe the lack of music (I think, there is music but it is boring and repetetive)- Mechanics is not explained and given it's a Russian game (I think) sometimes its quite hard to get a good explanation what exactly this or that parameter does,- Plot is only okeish: it's neither bad nor surprising Summary:7-8/10			"

												Have you ever been playing arma and say to yourself what is it was turn based. well now that dream is here in this game. I like this game alot. It has all the guns i love and they seem like there real counter parts, theres lots of different gear and vehicles as well. the missions are interesting with some very funny and dark writing, each mission you usally have to make desicions on how to do it menaing you cna just kill everyone use diplomacy or take bribes or just be a scumbag what ever floats your boat. It also comes with a community mod which add a huge amount of content as well as graphic upgrades and i can play the game on my widescreen which is nice. if you like turn based and you like mil-sims heres your game.

												7.62 High Calibre is a real-time tactical strategical action game released in 2007, similar to Xcom series while in the battling mode but in real time. You are a mercenary tasked to find a russian who stole from colleagues who hired you. There's some RPG elements inside.You will need to find clues, upgrade yourself, hire other mercenaries, equip them, find your target. You know who he is, you don't know what he has. You'll find him, and when you do, you'll know what he has and you need to make it out in one piece while completing your task.The storyline is nice, but the replies from the NPCs are kinda repetitive. The music is nice, the graphics are ok. There're quite some interesting choices you can make, the camera is a little hard to control. Pausing is crucial during engagements.7.62 Hard Life is a fan made enhanced version based on 7.62 High Calibre, released in 2015, provided free and comes with the steam workshop, The workshop doesn't have much but there're a few good mods. It's harder to play compared to 7.62 High Calibre due to the sheer amount of enemies, but you'll be able to handle it if you've played the original first. Weapon pack mods are recommended to lessen the difficulty by a little and adds more diversity in weapons.I would totally recommend it to Xcom lover, but you need to be more patient with these game compared to Xcom. It's already worth its current price, but do grab it when there's a sale, being thrifty is a virtue.			"

 This is probably the best game ever i have bought for few bucks!  And now about the game.Pros: +Very hard or even Hardcore. (its very hard even on normal)+Gun physics are great.+Looting system is very good too.+Wepon modifications.+Other physics in the game are great too. (except what buildings can be destroyed)+All your crew members are very important for you if they die, thats it, you lost them and there is no way to get them back.+Health and injuries system, its very realistic, and you can easily bleed to death or get to bullet in your head or just a scrap from explosion what you or your enemy made and THATS IT you are DEAD!!! Cons: -No good toturial.-It's way too hard at the beginning of the game.-Bandits will keep attacking you and you will have to last stand against them for really long time until you get bigger squad size or better cars.-Mercenaries (squad members) are way too expensive.-Map isnt very big and only few towns.-Few Combat Maps outside the towns, so you will keep fighting in zones again and again, but that isnt the main problem. (played about 30hours in Hard Life DLC/MOD) My verdict about this game: 1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

Product received for free
												I am not a huge fan of Strategy/Simulator games, but I can see the highlights of 7,62 High Calibre which makes it a classic. Since the game was released on 2007, don’t expect it to be top notch with the graphics, effects or the audio like the games released today.The features listed on the Store page remains true to its word and if there was one thing I liked most were the variety of guns and character’s to choose from. When you first start, you will be given the option to select your mercenary and use attribute/skill points to your preference on the list. Along with that are the fine detail on the player’s map, inventory mission and other settings.With this, the game gives a thorough detail on your inventory, actions and missions to guide the player too. It’s not the best, but regardless, a great old-school game that I would recommend trying out.			"

												This is the sequel to the interesting Brigade E5: New Jagged Union. In the same vein as that title, it is a real-time with pause tactical shooter much like the newer Jagged Alliance titles such as Jagged Alliance: Back in Action and Jagged Alliance: Crossfire. I haven't played as much of this one because it seems like it's actually more buggy than the earlier one; it runs fine on my gaming PC but on my laptop, if I change a single setting and restart as the game prompts me to, the resolution bugs out in the menu, leaving the game unplayable without a full uninstall. Beyond that bug, it seems a little less deep than Brigade E5 in terms of gameplay, but that might just be my initial impressions in about half an hour of gameplay. Overall a fair title in an under-represented genre.			"

												Well as a complete newcomer to the entire series, I found this game FAR more accessible than Brigade E5. The GFX, camera control and overall feel is still very difficult to get to grips with, yet this time I persisted for many hours, as the micro-management and combat system is very compelling. The game still seems far from amazing, and after my short time with game I still have no idea if I was 'playing it right'.. but I plan on returning to it at some stage..			"

												If realistic tactical shooters are your thing, then look no further. I've barely scratched the surface of this game, but before playing I watched hours of guides. This is the game for in depth inventory management, mercenary hiring, stat min/maxing, taking in to account ballistics, weapon degradation, weather conditions, armor, reload/fire speeds, movement speeds, positional accuracy and more explicit details when it comes to planning your perfect tactical fire fight. Highly strategic game with a large learning curve and massive complexity. In addition to all of that, it manages to be quite a bit of fun, and the dialogue and story aren't awful. It can even be humorous at times. I am playing using the blue sun mod, which can be conveniently added directly through the steam client.			"

												A VERY rough diamond here. There are a bunch of great ideas in this game, massive amounts of weapons and equipment and great ballistics simulation. Many bugs, however, and unfinished features, hold this title back quite a bit. Thankfuly, the mods (provided here on steam) make it conciderably better and actually expand on the content, by adding a whole new quest line (some additional 6-10hours of content!) and even MORE GUNS! So if you enjoy meticulous tactics, and are at least somewhat aroused by firearms, this game should suit you quite fine!PS. GEMFX/SweetFX is highly recommended for this title.			"

												You are a mercenary sent to a war-torn Banana republic to bring back an idiot who double-crossed the Russian mob. Along the way, you'll accept jobs from grieving family, the rebels, the government, MI6 agents, anyone who'll give you the time of day. The action is a sort of RTS/RPG thing. You have your squad of 1-6 hardened warriors, and you choose their equipment, stance, location, etc. A single bullet can send everything to hell, so you have to be extremely careful and stratrgic.

You are a soldier... but i can't call it a soldier, i have attacked a civillian with my bare hands and my character died from man-to-man fight.Attributes and skills.Able to skip video cutscenes.There are some tips available to read during the loading screen.Sort of an open world.Really bad camera angles.Weak guidelines.Other things.Released in 2007!No idea why, but when at the main menu or at options. The computer is really making weird noises. Ingame its fine.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

												Love this game, very enjoyable. Just SO many bugs, even with the MOD on. Crashes to desktop every 8th or 9th time I go to the map, many times your units become stuck on boxes while looting or in walls while running around or fighting, the MOD adds much content, but I have noticed some of the MERCS you get become bugged when you try to heal them at a hospital and simply just vanish and never come back, many missions seem buggy and dont appear to work as they should. Just so many crashes make me want to just scream. If the dame game would stop crashing so often, it would be a 10/10.Overall, I still rec buying the game because when it does work, it does a better job than either of the JA2 games do. And for only 99 cents (at time of writting this) its worth it.6/10*EDIT*Can no longer take the constant crashes. Trying to clear the ""Base"" and it crashes every 2-5 min. Screw it. Uninstall.

												7,62 High Calibre tries to mix the genres of tactical top view shooter and RPG.Keyword being ""tries"" here. Because it fails. It's not all bad but definitely a bad game:PROS* Character equipment customization* Wandering around the streets gathering intel on objectives, playing in a undercover operative kind of way* Active pause to give orders and evaluate situations before movingCONS* Terribly confusing. Knowing what to do, where to go or even what your objective is or why you're even here is a challenge in itself* Terrible AI that makes the enemies either dumb as hell or incredibly overpowered* Luck based combat: Sometimes a character can tank a few bullet like it's nothing more than mosquito bites, sometimes a single bullet will knock them down and they will take forever to get back up, while still being shot at (so it pretty much means death). This applies for the payer or the enemies.* Automatic actions are terrible: the game autopauses when you're spotted by an enemy but you want to pause because pause too because you saw the enemy coming? Odds are you're just going to unpause the autopause that paused teh game a few miliseconds before you pressed the button. Happens ALL THE TIME. Too bad, considering combats are so clunky that even easy encounters can go to hell very fast.* The interface is unclear* It takes forever to move around or to do something, even organizing the inventory is tediousTL;DR: This can could be good if it wasn't for it's slowness, the confusing interface, story, missions and terrible attempts at automatising things. It's really one hell of a clunky mess that drags down the few good points that made me buy the game39/100			"

												I would have liked to fully enjoy this game but I can't even get past the first battle. If any enemy notices me or goes to shoot at me or in some case I go to shoot at an enemy the game instantly crashes to windows. No error report no warning not even a crash log so that I could figure out how to fix the crashing. All in all the camera is annoying but the concept of this seems fun. The sheer amount of controls at your disposal are overwhelming but it fits nicely. So in otherwords the only reason I wont recommend this game is that I didnt even get to fully enjoy it much less play the first battle.			"

												Firtst you see that the game is quite nice. It features smart and realistic combat system and a lot of weapons and modification. Nothing more interesting. Though there are A LOT of bugs and you will drop off in windows every 5-10 minutes. After one day of playing it became unsustainable. I am really angry and cannot recommend this game, you should better play Jagged Alliance 2 or Silent Storm.			"

												overview: has lots to love if you want to put the time and effort into it, but for something to jump in and just start having fun, look elsewhere. This game definately has a following, sadly I cannot say I am part of it. It has huge amounts of customizability between the weapons, stats, and approaches but I couldnt get into this game like I could other tactical games. The camera is odd to control at best, and initially getting into the game can be a hurdle.			"

I'm not sure how this game is even relevant anymore - even for its time though I suspect - this is a shonky, part-adventure, part-strategy, all-boring game. Clearly 30 minutes is nowhere near enough to delve into this - I didn't get to see much, but when you have 1000+ games to get through - time becomes the most important factor...

												I played the game far longer than 60 minutes it states, but offline and timer did not add.I cannot recommend that game. It aims at being active pasuse JA type, but it fails, just as JA:BIA failed.Negatives:-bad design plot mission, after few very simple plot missions when you are attack twice by sme bandits, so you do not get much cash out of killing them, you are send the the front line, your team and few NPCs with bad AI vs a small army.-bad mercenary hiring system, you cannot see merc stats until after you hire him and merc appear at random, so you can spend days traveling from town to town and find nobody worth hiring.-not making sense finding equipment system - I was allowed to enter super secret prison without any guard stopping me and look very good AK and some best kevlar vest out of trash bin, seriously who allows some unknown to enter secret prison and who puts good guns and vests in trash bins, more good gear can be found over towns, so you have to go loot them before going into some firefights, kind of not making sense - destroy barrels and loot stuff from cRPGs.Positives:-active pause shooting system works well.-inventory management is good, if you try to load an empty clip from ammo in your backpack, get ready for freezing your soldier for a minute or so doing it, realistic and good, you need to place extra clips in some easy accessable pockets in vests etc.All in all game is painfully average, some pros, some cons, nothing stands out.

												7,62 High Calibre is tactical shooter type of game. It has no tutorial, what makes getting into the game pretty hard, because controls are hard to figure out. NPCs you talk in game sometimes have nothing useful to say, so talking with them is sometimes waste of time. If you are into tactical shooters and you like to figure everything out on your own, then you can give this game a try, otherwise just stay away from that game, because you can get bored and fustruated pretty quickly.

												The graphics, at least the textures suck, and sucked when the game came out. The missions are barely understandable but most are just the same 'go here, do this and come back'. The trick is to figure out what and where. You can tweak and adjust your viewpoint so you'll see the world. You'll be able to plan several seconds ahead of the incoming engagement. You will find out how little you know about squad tactics and if you want to learn from your mistakes you will try again, and again, and again, ad nauseam. Then there's the guns, and the more guns and the attachements you can hook them up with.... that is, if you live long enough. The game is hard, not for beginners and COD enthusiasts.The same goes for E5 the next brigade union.Mixed review? I love the game.			"

												(This refers to BlueSunMod)Excellent RT alternative to JA2 1.13. As mentioned by other reviewers, all the limitatons and problems are due to the engine and unfortunately will never change. The most realistic and detailed squad based real time strategy you can play currently. (I wish JA2 modders could do the same and offer all their builds on steam)I believe that all the contributing mod creaters (R@S first and foremost( should be given a percentage of the sales, if not only of the sales that use the mod. (which is easily trackable) The only thing I would wish for is a way to watch the replays of the battles, it would be fun to see that huge battle you spent 6 hours on to be completed in 5 minutes in real time. As an advice to those that are gonna play BSM for the first time, I suggest to skip the boot camp, since it will get very frustrating very quickly and takes a lot of time. Actually it is itself a complete DLC of sorts.			"

												well lets begin il say now sry if my eng is a bit bad.About the game this game is great but dont take it like that tho this game is full of bugs yes but if you get over this bugs this is one of very little games that do this genere this well but again i am not playing the vanila version i am playing with blue sun mode and Mercapocalypse this mods add so much content its insane But now lets talk about some of the bugs i got and you may get to again i never played vanila from the start i played with blue sun mode later merca mode toook 1 bug i get alot is AI shooting trough walls rocks anything that you cant shoot trough the AI is somehow able to another one is AI clipping trought this object's and getting faster to u another bug i used to get and still sometimes i get it is in some maps its random when my soldiers walk over certain area they go under ground you can only see thier body and head legs are under ground stuff like that is pretty rare for me but might not be for you another one i really hate is freez's just random freez's that last around 15s they always happen in the start of the game or reloading a save yes makes sense maybe game takes time to load all of the content but still its bit annoying there are some other bugs but you get the point.Now for the great things this game does  again talking about moded the combat system in this game is just amazing the depth you get makes it so fun a thing that i love the most is the weapon amout there are over hunderd of weapons of course most are modded weapons but thats why i play it with mods  and the mods are free so you can too there are alot of mercs to recruit too yes you are limited to 6 ppl but if someone dies and well you are playing like never reloading for death so he stays dead u got alot of ppl to replace him all got thier skills and cons all can level up too the story in this game is almost none existent its very basic never payed attantion to it.the game runs in a turn base system but not fully there arent really turns but actions that take time real time like to shoot you need 3s to aim and 1s to shoot so 4s total after that if no other merc is doing an action it pauses the game squad control can get annoying if you got 6 its hard sometimes and they love to bump into each other so that makes it even harder but its still fun there are alot of other great things but il let you find them by your self i hope this was helpful for you guys :D.

Overall Score: 9.0/10 7.62 is an RPG, real-time tactical squad game in the likes of Jagged Alliance Series , Silent-Storm and X-Com. A must have for hardcore fans of these types of series. It's a hidden gem, taking the squad based level combat to a entirely new stage of complexity. Impression:The storyline is actually great - you are a mercenery from a previous series: Brigade E5: New Jagged Union (another gem IMO). You have a mix of characters and backgrounds, some of which you will find very convincing - and bring additional immersion into the game. Your quest is to find a ""businessman"" who went into hiding in a latin-like country of Algeira. You will need to be resourceful; you will need to navigate your hero(heroine) character , finding good companions and simply fighting to survive. You will need to be well-planned for the dangers ahead, in a volatile world full of bandits, military personnel and organized crime. Combat is a heaven for those who thrive with micro-management. The combat progresses real-time, having to manage each and every person's actions in the squad, more or less at the same time (can be paused). Small movements like simply raising a weapon,as well as firing, has its own measure of time. It changes the tactical nature of combat totally by having to trade-off speed for power - imagine that in a closed confined quarter - it's actually better to use the fast-response type weak pistols rather than slow firing powerful rifles. The same thing cannot be said for large open spaces. Combat is fast moving and generally unforgiving if you face high-level enemies - or make a stupid tactical decision (like throwing a grenade too close to you), or simply get unlucky (like meeting a great number of enemies in open space at daytime as opposed to night). Saving and loading are frequent - if you want all of your squadmates to come out of combat alive.The health system is equally complex as the combat time-mechanics. If your squadmate gets hit in the head, chances are that you will be dead (if you raise the difficulty level), or you will get blinded - which renders the screen in a white-red curtain that renders the person totally useless. Critical damage to limbs and body can happen - which simply cannot be fixed by simple medi-kits; you need to go to a doctor.The inventory system is equally complex and shines, for those who are meticulous at sorting and storing things. It requires you to think about how to carry a wide assortment of not only weapons, but bullet magazines in pockets, on shoulders, around the neck, belts and different type of bags.This a gun-porn game. There are simply so many types of handguns, rifles, grenades and body armor. You can end up being very confused about the best outfit. In fact, I believe the character actually needs to use the weapon for a while, to get proficient (can't remember if this was a vanilla or a mod feature). There are mods which improve the vanilla by a lot (BSM mod and Hard-Life, both available on Steam)Likes Storyline is good an immersive, at times comical  Combat and inventory system (great if you like challanges)  A large list of weapons and itemsDislikes  Quirky and glitchy  Difficulty spikes are at times unforgiving "

												Almost like a good old Jagged Alliance 2. Must have for jagged series funs, IMO.Personally I like that sweet assortiment of firearms. It is pretty big and there is a various types of ammo for them too. Another good thing is camera - You can see Your merc shoot full auto in a closeup, to admire brass cases fall on the ground.The only bad things IMO - game needs more variety of territory to fight on and for Gods sake - fixing bugs that are sometimes throwing You back to Your desktop. But apart from that - Very good game.			"
