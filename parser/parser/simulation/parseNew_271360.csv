												This is one of the games, that brings the ""thumb up or down""-system to its knees.The game itself is not that much of a complex economic simulation. It's a resource-management game that gives you the opportunity to create stuff from resources and sale it in your stores. It's your job to organize the location of your factories and stores, plan lines of productions, set prices, watch surrounding cities growing and plan your logistics. It's a re-release of an older game, so don't expect high end graphics or fancy animations. The only thing you will hear, are some simple effects and different background music, which you will turn off at a certain point.If you like games like Transport Giant, OpenTTD or Capitalism 2 then you should take a look at it.The problem with this game is a technical one. Actually, there's more than one problem. First, like the retail version it seems to have trouble with every graphic processor that is not from stone age and as long as you run a newer modell, the game won't even start. You can prevent this, by starting it in windows comp mode (WinXp or earlier). Second, right now there seems to be a problem with some Win10 systems. The problem should be known by the dev team now and if the publisher wouldn't have a history of non-delivered patches, I could be optimistic. Third, there're some glitches and flickering that may occur under particular circumstances. Best advice to get rid of that, would be closing all programs you don't need at the moment of playing the game.Ok, there have been games with bigger problems and patching a game after release to make it more stable seems to be a common practice at the present time. But this case is different: These problems were known for years, long before the new dev team kicked in. I'm asking: Where is quality assurance? Did they do any Beta tests? If you buy this game now, you give the dev-team and the publisher a big advance for work there is still to do, to make this game consumer-friendly. Question is: Will they do it, if they hadn't done it in past?There is a very high chance, that if you buy this game now, you will have some kind of issue, but the good news is, that these issues are known to the community, waiting years for a stable version of this game. So in most cases there will be some sort of fix. The game itself is a economic goldie. If you get it running on your system, you will have a lot to enjoy. A smoothly rising difficulty, endless maps and maybe they will add a working multiplayer to it, but even without there are plenty of gaming hours to play. I recommend this game to people interested in economic simulation or logistic games, being aware of the technical issues. Waiting a few weeks, taking an eye on possible updates, is also a good idea.			"

												I played this game for hundreds of hours as a child and it's great to see it working again (the game is notorious for poor hardware support). For a 13 year old game it holds up fairly well, although it does have several usability quirks that stand out such as build and info menus only closing when you press the X button rather than clicking anywhere off the menu as is much more common these days. Selecting moving vehicles can be a pain as well and so selecting your trucks from the vehicle status menu is advised.Unlike many of the transport tycoon simulators out there, IG2 lets you manage the production of goods from start to finish. Each factory, mine, farm, refinery and so on, have their own production levels which change depending on the availability of resources. In other words, a ranch in grasslands produces more milk than one on a beach. This makes production more complicated as you add more stages of manufacturing before reaching a final product but the financial rewards are worth it. You also get to set the price of the products and place your stores in key locations to manage demand. Always make sure the demand is slightly higher than supply to prevent buildups of unsold goods in your storage areas. You can also export goods overseas for a reduced profit but the demand is always high. The range of goods available to export is slim though, conversely you can import goods for a higher price but without the hastle of producing it yourself.As the game goes on you unlock a vast range of products and vehicles from inflatable dinghies to luxury cars. The number of options is impressive but may leave players feeling overwhelmed with choices that often won't make much difference.One area the game does disappoint I feel is the transport side, although you can choose from lorries, trains, planes and ships there are few circumstances where the lorries aren't the best option, even over large distances. You don't get to set their route either so you can't choose to avoid a busy downtown area in lieu of the empty country road you just built. With trains you do get to choose which tracks to take, but you don't get to choose which platform they use and with a maximum of 2 tracks in and out of each station (2 per side if the trains turn around rather than passing through) bottlenecks at your large stations are an issue that has long since been solved on other transport sims.It is disappointing that this remains one of the best games in the genre, it is a good game certainly, but there are lots of little issues you feel would not exist if they remade the game today. I would also advise caution when buying as it will not play on many computers. I have owned six PCs over the years and this game has only worked on two of them. This version does appear to work better than the original with the Nvidia patch, but do not be surprised if you have to ask for a refund. It's a shame that such a classic can't be enjoyed by a wider audience.(It works for me on an Nvidia GTX 970 and on my GTX 770, both on Windows 10, since the issues seems to be graphics related you should be OK with either of these)			"

												I'm going to save everyone some time looking through the forums waiting for the devs to respond. If you want to play the game, you have to run it in compatibility for Windows 95. That'll make it work. (Good game if it wasn't for this rather botched launch).			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Industry Giant II Developer:  Fancy Bytes & Reactor	Publisher:  United Independent Entertainment	Genre:  Economic SimulatorGeneral ImpressionIndustry Giant II was initially released in 2002 but found its way onto Steam in 2015. And it is a fortunate thing too, since it’s still one of the most complex (even if the graphics themselves are aged) industrial simulations for PC. Everything from the gathering of raw materials, processing them into finished products and supplying them to their intended retail outlets, is very well simulated within this game. Where it lacks in eye candy, it makes up for in the gameplay mechanics and especially the ever shifting economy. The cities on the maps develop at an equal pace to your (hopefully) successful business plans and the means of transportation for the goods you produce are also nicely represented through many age appropriate choices. You have a well designed campaign featuring a scaling challenge which serves as a great tutorial at the same time, for the open-ended levels you will enjoy the most. This title’s educational value is beyond a shadow of doubt.Strong Points+ Steam Achievements.+ Complex economic simulation.Weak Points- Simple graphics regardless of the self-proclaimed HD makeover.- No Steam Trading Cards.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

												A nice optimization game based around producing, transporting, and selling various goods. Pros:- Tons of industries, products, and resources. Lots of transportation options.- Very little guessing with the products. Lots of graphs and statistics tell you exactly how much of a product will be produced and consumed at each factory/store. This really helps optimizing.- In-game wiki describes each product, where it is made, where it is sold, and what it takes to make.Cons:- Graphics are outdated (early 90s sprites). This doesn't really bother me a ton, but it could bother others.- You never miss something until it's gone: the interface is outdated. Specifically, there is no time dilation (faster/slower) or pause. There is no view rotation which can make hooking up roads/rails difficult. - The range of their buildings should be rebalanced. I find myself constantly either kicking myself or just taking dynamite to things because they are just out of range. Often by just one or two squares.Nitpicks:- They skimped on their English translator. You get the gist of what they're conveying, but it is off-putting. Names aren't exact so if you look for one thing, it's often called something else (though similar enough).- Trains need brains. Even with two rails, they often go down the same side and slow each other down.Edit: Found on the forums that + increases speed and - decreases. ""P"" will pause. Still marking them down for not showing key bindings in the options or something. Who knows what other keys I'm missing?			"

												I was so excited about the ""restored"" version of this game.After years of waiting this was such a huge disappointment.No trouble in launching it but multiple crashes during gameplay made this old gem unplayable for me, and seen the past of this publisher regarding product support I decided to refund it.

												I had the original box version of this. Got it back when I was a kid.The box version would not run on modern PCs, but this steam version does run. I had only one crash. I guess the Devs did an ok job on remastering the game.The game sets you up in a role of an entrepeneur, you decide what your company will produce and sell. Sadly there is no simulation of inter-company trade.Eg. You could focus on being a supermarket. You grow your own fruit orchard, have a dairy farm, and makes wine to sell in your own chain of stores. You adjust prices of your goods and the demand-supply curve will adjust to your price. City grows overtime as you open new types of stores in the city (growth is VERY slow).You must control all three sectors of business (Produce. Manufacture, and Retail) and also manage logistics for your goods.It is good to play in campaign mode, deadlines forces you to make difficult choices, as your finances are limited and must be used in the most efficient manner. Eg. Would I set up a new production line (costs millions) next to a big city or would I buy a new cargo ship to supply that huge city across the map with goods made elsewhere? Would the transport cost break even or make a good return on investment?My advice is to start slow and do not grow too fast.The system is fairly simple when you get used to the quirky controls of the game. Warning: The ESC button returns you to the main menu.---------------------------------------------------------------------7.5/10It's a good simulator, but it's not the best.It's a good test of macro management skill.It does not promote varying play-style, you will find one working formula and probably stick to it.

												Its an overall good buisness game, reminds me of Transport Tycoon and Capitalism Plus.The game is slightly basic and gave me a couple of good hours of entertainment.I like how I can influence growth of a city and the transport network I can chose to make a depot hub or direct lines of transport.If I could change some aspects of the game I would want to impliment a stock system and more advanced production chain.ie, If I produced wood boards, I would gain saw grains as a bi product instead of one building, one product.

												Fantastic game!  I owned this on disc many years ago, and I have not been disapointed with this re-release, which enables you to run the game in full HD.  It is unfortunate that others have experienced problems when running the game - I have had no such issues (NVIDIA GTX 660, Windows 10).  I would advise those individuals to try again with the latest verison as a couple of patches have been released since launch.Before starting the campaign, I recommend completing the three tutorial missions.  If you happen to close a dialog by mistake, which I did find frustrating at times, most can be re-opened from the message window (mail icon in the bottom left of the screen).As for the campaign itself, I cannot comment much at this time as I have not been playing the game for long.  However, I remember playing the original game for many hours and finding it highly enjoyable.  In summary, highly recommend for those who have not experienced Industry Giant II before and for those fond of the original game who have always wanted a version that would work on a modern PC in full HD.

												This is how business simulations / management games should be: Lot's of stuff to do, to create, many choices what stuff you want to produce. Micromanagement is also a big deal in this game. If you ever wanted to create your own business while experience freedom of choice in finally doing it, you're gonna love this game. Industry Giant 2 on Steam is a HD version of the classic game made in the early 2000s. It works perfectly fine on Win7 and I guess it does also on Win8 and above.The game itself contains several campaigns with different difficulties and also a tutorial of how to play the game. Of course there is still a sandbox-mode without any goals where you can just run your enterprise. You start between 1900 and newer dates and can experience everything that comes with it: technologic advantages and possibilities. For example if you start in 1900 most of your business might be farming and stuff, while in the 50's you can produce sunmilk, boats, vendingmachines, bottles and other stuff.The only thing I really dislike is the fact that you can't switch to the optionsmenü during the game. If you press ESC the game will end while creating an automatic savefile and will then show you the mainmenu where you can change your graphic and audio options. This can be annoying sometimes. The price itself for such an old game is pretty high, despite the unique high quality it has for a business simulation game if you compare it with newer ones (which do not exist, sadly). You should buy it during a sale or if it's included in the Humble Bundle or something similar.			"

												Many people have been complaining about various compatability issues, telling others to not buy the game. The fact is, on some PC's it runs better than on others. From what I've heard about the developers, these various bugs may or may not get fixed. However, my PC runs the game just fine, and, to me, it is very playable and enjoyable in its current state. I would suggest buying the game and, if you have problems with it, simply return it. As I've seen, there seems to be no way to tell if the game will run on your system or not. It's not all NVidia graphics cards, which I use, its not later versions of windows, I'm currently on 10. Just try the game out and hopefully you can get the unique experience that I've been looking for in a game for a long time.The game itself reminds me of Anno in that you have to set up production chains and turn products into other products. What was missing for me from Anno was the ability to just focus on the business aspect of the game. No diplomacy, no ecobalance, just making products. Now to be fair, I am a nerd. I like to see efficiency and to make small numbers get larger. If you don't like working with numbers, this game might not be for you. I for one like looking at my cow farm and deciding that I can run it at 75% efficiency to supply demand, or making the perfect ratio of wheat farms to donut factories. Hopefully the developers will keep their promises, fixing bugs and even adding multiplayer. I've even heard talk of a sequel, so I would be very excited to see a modernazation of this classic.			"

												This is a great game which was made many years ago, and is one of my favorites once again. That being said there is an error (info below was from launch date; think they may have fixes this now. Compatability mode is often used for older games) which you may get when starting this game, and here is how to fix it:Here is how to run this game when you get the graphics card errorGo to where this local game is stored on your computer. On mine it was:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Industry Giant 2Next rigth click on the file Ig2(underscore)AddOn (It won't let me type underscore on here it looks sort of like the minus key.)Next click propertiesClick compatabilityCheck run this administrator, and click run this program in compatability mode for: Windows 98/Windows ME. Now run your game.Also once you start a  game go to options, and turn off the videos as videos can cause crashes to the desktop.The Good:Very fun game based on transporting resources/products around and manufacturing/selling them. This is one of my favorites of all time. If you like business type games, this could easily be one of your favorites.Cities growOk graphics; remember this game came out originally in like 2002. :)The Bad:Have to run this in Windows 98/ME compatability.Graphics a little outdated			"

												Although it's advertised to work on Windows 7, 8 and 10, some people have problems with this game. There are a couple of fixes mentioned on the forum that seem to work for most people, but be aware that you'll probably have to spend 5 or 10 minutes getting the game to work, as I had to do as well. This is an old game after all (released 2002), and wasn't developed to be compatible with our modern hardware.The game itself is what I consider somewhat of a classic. Even though the Jowood games catalogue consists of relatively obscure titles like Traffic Giant, Transport Giant, and Hotel Giant, I think they have made some of the greatest classic tycoon-genre games ever made (apart from the *real* classics of course - you know which ones I mean). IG2 combines goods transportation (similar to their other game Transport Giant) with industry and production management, and the result is a pretty fun game that, even though it shows its age in a number of places, will keep fans of the genre entertained for a decent amount of time.To me it's worth its current discounted price (12€), to get to play a more or less ""fixed up"" version of a game that I used to play a lot of. Without the nostalgia I would probably find it just a bit overpriced, especially the full price (15€) I think is pushing it for an old game like this. But it's definitely still a fun game, no matter how old it is.			"

												Little mixed on this one so I will start with the good.The good.It runs with a little bit of life support aka windows compatibility but the devs said they are working on it (They really should have tested this first before releasing).Supports 1080 60Hz the game might go higher but that’s all my screens can do.The game itself is a great industry sim game still looks good in its old age just animations are not very smooth at times.Easy to run no need to install any mods and change configs just install and run kinda.The badRequires you to set windows to compatibility mode for it to even run (Should have been fixed before release)They have taken the mod that has existed for the original game and just done some patch work on it, (You can tell as the mod changed the gold bars to gold fish for some reason this also occurs in this version and by the UI in the main menu) but they did fix the issue that the size of the train stations changed so some credit is due.No multiplayer simple really they could have patched the game to use steam servers or just have direct IP connections but nope it all been removed that would have made it great.A few graphical issues with the game when it comes to scrolling around the map and misaligned images in the ui.No editor they really should provide this it makes the game much more fun and can make you enjoy it for longer.Sound issues if you turn down the volume of the game sound effects and the music will change to full randomly can be very annoying.Overpriced little work has gone in to this game from the devs poor testing and only small issues fixedOverall I recommend the game itself as it is a great game but unless you want it on steam don’t get it on steam it is overpriced for its current state and if you already have the disc or gamergate version then don’t bother unless you want less hassle to play the game.Hope this helps people and the devs and if the devs needs more info on the issues I found ask :).

Posted: July 29, 2016
												An excellent economic management game. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.First, I should mention that I originally played this game years ago and so I'm somewhat biased due to nostalgia. Even so, I've spent quite a few hours with it in 2016 and I think it's still a very good game.The gameplay consists of managing production chains. You have factories that make stuff, railways (and ships and trucks and planes) that move stuff, warehouses that store stuff before it's sold, and stores that sell stuff. Cities have limited demand for each individual product, so you can't just produce lots of one of them. There are over 200 products, and typically you'll be producing several at any one time. What you can produce depends on what raw materials you have access to. (And if playing a mission, what the restrictions are. If 200+ products sounds overwhelming, playing the missions helps.) The basic raw materials are wood, oil, various ores and various farm products. Wood can only be harvested from forests, oil and ores from relevant deposits, and farms require good soil. Different plants and animals thrive in different conditions, so for example a dry map will let you grow the likes of peanuts and cotton, whereas a wet map will let you grow wheat and corn and potatoes and tomatoes and such.The challenge mostly lies in choosing what to invest in. Once a production chain is set up, it's rare to not make a profit, but the size of that profit can vary greatly. Setting up production chains is usually quite expensive, so if you make bad choices at the start, you'll likely end up not making enough money to invest in anything else, and thus fail the mission or fall behind in endless play.The second challenge is transportation. It's possible to avoid building any, as warehouses have a short range in which they transfer goods automatically. This is one of the major strategic decisions you'll face - do you go for a less profitable chain entirely built close to the customers, thus skipping transports, or do you go for a more profitable chain that requires transportation? What type of transportation to use is also an important consideration.One of the main strong points of the game is how consistently a chain works once set up. You don't really have to micromanage, other than occasionally adding production capacity to account for increased demand due to cities growing larger over time. This means you can focus on actually growing your business while the existing parts of it work fine without constant oversight. There are 2 semi-exceptions. First, there are variations in climate that can increase or decrease agricultural production for a few years. You should account for this by having some surplus warehouse capacity, so excess production from good harvests can cover insufficient production from bad harvests. Second, some products get replaced as technology marches on, so you'll have to adjust or replace chains as necessary when that happens. For example, deep freezers lose their popularity once refrigerators are invented.There's actually a third semi-exception. The amount of available ores and oil is finite, and the mines and oil wells don't cover the entire deposit, so you'll need to demolish and rebuild them every once in a while to cover a different part of the deposit, then finally move them to a new deposit once the first runs out, which also requires replacing infrastructure. And if you manage to exhaust ALL the deposits, that's it, no more of that raw material. In practice, this won't be much of a problem in actual gameplay unless you go for very long games in endless mode, but I still found it annoying enough to mod it out.And speaking of modding, quite a lot can be modded. You'll need the file ""Industry Giant 2\config\Config.gen"". Make a backup, open it with Notepad, copy everything inside and paste it in a blank excel sheet. This lets you actually see what the different values do. When you figure out what you want to change, open Config.gen with Notepad again and find the values there. Credit goes to Turel97 for teaching me this.Two issues I have with the game that I modded out are the extremely short coverage area of shops, which means it can take a ridiculously large amount of them to cover a large city (and there are many different types of shops!), and the negative effects industries have on city growth. The latter is nonsensical, as industries provide jobs, and nobody moves to a city with sky high unemployment. So I modded all the non-polluting industries to give postive, not negative growth, and decreased the growth bonus of shops to compensate, as it was overly high by default.In conclusion, this game achieves something of a holy grail of economic games - it lets you set up production chains that require minimal micromanagement, and what few frustrating issues it has can easily be modded away. Add to that a map editor and enough content already in the game to keep you interested for many dozens of hours and you get one of the best economic management games ever created.			"

												The game is very enjoyable, it has a good selection of production, sale and transport methods to begin with, a nice early game, the mid game introduces much more complicated production chains, which you can however ignore if you prefer simpler production chains. As of writing this review, I have not gotten to the late game yet. I would also not be too quick in comparing it with OpenTTD, as some reviewers seem to do. The similarities between the games are merely that they are 2D isometric games which feature vehicles. The base game of OpenTTD focuses on transporting one of about 10 different goods with very simple production chains, this game features complex production chains and much more flexible vehicles, which allow you a much greater ability to plan efficient routes (For example a truck can transport one good one way and another the other way)Overall I think you should try the game out. As other reviewers pointed out, there is the chance it might not run on your computer, however if that proves to be the case you can just take advantage of Steam's refund policy.In the past, the game had low frame rate issues, but I'm very happy to report that this has been fixed! The game runs very smoothly now!			"

												This game is one of they best Tycoon games i have every played! I owned this back in the day when it was first released and still play it today.Pros -Plenty of industries to buildmany Transport optionsGood AIBig choice of maps with more easily created or obtained from the web!Multiplayer Via LAN or online with Tunngle (when patched to re enable the button. was removed from the main menu for some reason)Cons -Can be tad easy to make money. (there are patches out there that modify the prices ect to make it harder)I go though stages of being addicted to this game and lose track of time when playing!Highly reccomened to Tycoon game lovers!

												This game is a buggy mess on modern PCs. It has issues with frame rates when choosing different color skins, UI is extremely small and difficult to navigate, no tutorial system, constant crashing, the list goes on.I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this game. I had very high hopes for it; I read a lot of reviews months before hand with people saying it ""Its like Captialism 2!"" Which I absolutely loved the ever loving poop out of Captialism 2! However, Industry Giant 2 is nothing but a let down and I am very upset at how poorly ported this game is for Modern PCs; it stood as my #2 on my wishlist for so long, only to find out it was a complete let down, and therefore I requested a refund.Better luck next time, Fancy Bytes & Reactor.

												A great flash from the past!I have this game on the a CD that no longer works with modern OS.  So when this poped up, I had to have it!  So far, this game runs fine on my system (GTX 980, Windows 10).  The only issue I've had so far is that some text doesn't render properly for a second but quickly sorts itself out.From what I've read here, most of the negative comments are a result of the game not working on their system. No issue for me, so can't comment on them.			"

												Yes, those were the days! Just remembering the winter days back in ´97, the noisless runing WIN95 System, the itching pimples....Industrie Giant I , yes, those were the days!So, serveral years later, 2002, the heat was on again, IG II !Critics were criticising, but nonetheless, the games principles still work and night after night just flew by.A few years (and PCs) later, you feel the need to play the game again. But, the CD-Version got its problem with NVIDIA-Cards etc, so screw it, the game´s lost, I thought!Till yesterday!I´ve found it here on Steam and it was like...DAMN, is it possible?I studied the reviews, no probs, no freezes in the menu, runing smooth n gently like a hamster on speed.60fps, high resolution and now, one day later, I´ve already played over 11 hours, despite working-routine.Go out on a concert tonight, naaaa, I´ve got better things to do.Sounds a lil ridiculous, I admit, but it is pure fun n a lot of the good o times.YIKES, I nearly could feel the pimples again!But enough monkey business, to the game itself!Most important: IT RUNS without any probs!Simply install and get going.If you don´t know the game at all, watch an Let´s play.If you´re a fan of those up-building, businesssimulations, this is your thing.If you really don´t know the game since now, you must have had things to do with your life...Everyone else, who knows the game but is just doubtful, BUY IT!Better than this Business-Sim might only be a decivilization-version of civilization :)So thanks a lot, Fancy Bytes and Reactor, for bringing this gem back on modern systems!Hope it pays off and I seriously have to stop the !s now, damn!

												Cool intro but the intro is nothing like the game content just like in most intros anyway. 


YouTube™ Video: Industry Giant 2 - start up & intro 

			Views: 48		

			Cool intro shows machinations of industries. 2017 01 05 22 34 04 821		

Clear easy to understand tutorial. In the beginning there's only one but it looks like more will be unlocked as you progress. http://dai.ly/x57im1lGraphic quality is old school but adequate. There is no option change anything but the resolution and sound levels. Plenty of sound effects to match the bustling activity in the game world from cars to factories to birds. Music selection is excellent; i love the music but sadly no player nor playlist unlike Transport Tycoon. Excellent game; lots of information to let you know what's going on in your business. Very flexible management options like setting the percentage utilization of your production facilities and how much to pay your workers so you can set the proper balance between expense and income.A bit of disappointment is that the map cannot be rotated so your point of view is fixed although you can move and zoom. This is not a critical omission since placing buildings is easy enough.UIG does publish some good games despite some titles that just don't seem to work right and their take on simulation genres are quite unique. Runs fine right out of the box in Windows 7 64-bit native mode. I think i got this in a bundle at a very low price so it's definitely worth it.			"

												Get it on sale.Get past the clunky UI.Watch your maintenance costs.There is a fun interesting game underneath.I bought this on sale and let it sit for several months unplayed.  Then when I opened it something about the UI hit me, and I didn't want to bother learning it and asked for a refund.  But they told me I had owned it long enough they wouldn't refund it (even though I had only played for 1 hour).  So fine... I decided to try it again.  And it is fun - but it borders on tedious in places.Hints would have helped this game a lot.  Like ""Hint: + and - will change game speed.""  That's a big one.  Or ""Hint: Just because water looks contiguous doesn't mean a boat can go through it because the graphics are buggy.""  That one kind of sucks.What would I compare this to?  It strangely reminds me of Factorio - some of the same logistics take place here, and some of the same tedium.  What is not like Factorio is the possibility of having maintenance costs that overwhelm an economy into a downward spiral.  This is a really great feature of the game.  Build a bunch of warehouses and a ton of transportation and watch the balance sheet go deeper and deeper into the red with no hope of reversal!This is probably more accurately a precursor to Anno 2017 - although I find this more playable and engaging - maybe because has more logistical puzzles than Anno has (for example the warehouse placement can introduce interesting problems).This is an economic sim.In all I'm happy they refused to give me the refund.  This is not a bad game, and it was worth the effort overcoming small learning curve and UI.			"

												I am pretty sure I have never posted a review on here but felt compelled to do so for this game. I have loved this game ever since it came out 13 years ago and was really disappointed when even with all the online fixes, patches and workarounds I could find, I could not get it to work on my new pc or laptop. I emailed the devs last year who said they were working on a version that would work with modern day computer's and their operating systems, but did not see anything further. Then yesterday I see it drop on steam and immediately by it whilst it was on sale at £8 and I was upset to learn it still wouldn't work. Read some forums and tried a few workarounds including various different compatibility modes, but no dice.I shut down my pc and rebooted and just as I was about to send an email to the devs, venting my frustration and requesting assistance or an eta on a fix, I decided to boot the game again (with no compatibility modes turned on), so that I could get the error code and Boom, worked first time and worked flawlessly all evening last night.So to all who buy this game wanting it to work, try the workarounds, shut down and reboot your pc to try and make it work, you never know your luck. The fact it does work though on my PC which has an overlocked i7, GTX 780 ti, Windows 7 pro 64 bit, shows that there has been progress in making this game compatible with modern day PCS.Unfortunately it does appear that its not universally working so yes its a risk, but if you played this game in the past and enjoyed it as much as I did, its worth the risk especially with the steam refund policy that now exists.

												So I played this game quite a bit before it came on steam. If you like Logistics and resource management with a touch of a Supply&Demand system then this is probably the best one available. It's actually fairly easy to make profit which makes the game simple if you play alone. The AI opponents are fairly competent so they can give you a challenge if you so choose.Anyway. Getting your massive scale electronics manufacture and distribution with a fleet of cargo ships going is quite a satisfying experience.			"

												I was not familiar with this game before steam. I like economy and management games so I bought it and it is a very good game. 27 hours in and I feel as if I barely scratched the surface(still discovering things in it) I strongly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of these types of games(capitalism 2, economic war, industry giant 2) My only tiny gripe with it is the lack of thorough documentation. Like, I would liek to know how transport cost is calculated exactly? and how towns grow exactly(there is this weird blue button that I can click and then hit ""upgrade 100 times"" and the town seems to expand without costing me any money and magically gaining population, what is that about?)

												This is my first review on steam so don't expect an awesome review :)I already knew the game so I knew it was good before I bought it on steam. It is however an old game, but I really love the idea behind it. The purpose of the game is basically having a company and trying to make profit (by getting resources, manufacturing, transporting and selling products). You can play endless, where you don't really have a goal. You can just play the way you like. But if you want a goal, there is also a campaign mode which contains missions with goals you have to complete in order to win.The soundtrack does get boring after a while but you can turn it off and listen to your own playlist (via Youtube for example). I really recommend buying this game, it is cheap for the fun you can have with it!!			"

												Had quite a few issues on launch, but the majority of problems are fixed now.I always loved this game when it was first released, unfortunately, my last two computers haven't been able to run it off the disk. When I saw this had been re-released on steam, I read some reviews and was hesitant, because a lot of people had the same issue that I had with the disk copy. Eventually I gave in and got it, and honestly, I was very glad I did. Exactly the same as I remember, but able to run in my native screen resolution.It's a great game for tycoon/management game fans, however it is over 13 years old, and it does show this with a lack of all continuity past 2002, where it becomes 'future predictions.' Regardless, it's an excellent game.			"

												First time played 10 years ago.And till this day i played this game non-stop. Atleast 1 time in week.After JoWood Productions bancrupt i thought all source files was destroyed.But miracle happened and game lives again.Little sad we dont have LAN or INTERNET mode.But i hope to see this in the feature.Game is amazing. Not hard, easy to learn. Many product variations.You can create mods (Create new buildins, products,  vehicles)You can create maps (just download from JoWood website, use waybackmachine website)-----------Jau gan ilga laiką žaidžiu šį žaidimą. Mažiausiai 10 metų. Žaisdavau mažiausiai 1 kartą į savaitę visą šį laiką.Turiu rusišką CD, pirkau iš internetinės svetainės virtualią žaidimo kopiją, o dabar ir iš steam.Kai bankrutavo JoWood Productions galvojau, kad žaidimas visam laikui liks užmarštį.Neatsirado jokių kompanijų kurios norėtų apsiimti žaidimo perpirkimu ir tobulinimo, to pasekoje dauguma manė jog žaidimo svarbiausi source kodai buvo sunaikinti.Bet įvyko stebuklas ir štai vokiečių kompanija po šitiek metų sugebėjo įgyti teises į šio žaidimo vardą.Per pora savaičių išėjo svarbiausi atnaujinimai, kurie pataisė kritines klaidas. To pasekoje dabar visi su naujausiom vaizdo kortom gali paleisti šį žaidimą be jokių problemų!Ko nesugebėjo padaryti JoWood per daugelį metų!Žinoma gaila, kad kad nėra multiplayer modo (LAN arba Internet), bet kolkas galima palaukti ir pasimėgauti Single-Player rėžimu. Jeigu vienam nuobodu, tuomet žaiskite prieš kompiuterio valdomas kompanijas.Žaidimas tikrai geras. Ir kaip turbūt supratote - vienintelis ir nepabostantis.Tai ne šaudyklė ar super sunkus strategas. Tai ekonominis simuliatorius kurį išmoksite be didelio vargo.Labai daug produktų ir pasirinkimo laisvės kur statyti ar ką daryti.Galite net sukurti modus (Sukurti naujus pastatus, produktus ar mašinas)Galite sukurti savo žemėlapį (Atsisiūsti galite iš JoWood oficialios svetainės naudodami waybackmachine svetainę)Rekomenduoju.

WOOHOO!! :)_________________________________________________Firstly, Do i recommend this game? well, ATM, I will say Yes! It looks great and while I have only done the tutorials and not put much time into it, it looks like it will be an awesome time sink! :)Now, on to the part that nearly forced me to not recommend the game!Along with may others, I had the crash issue as the game loads! Usually an instant thumb down!BUT, For me the issue was fixed simply by finding the game .exe file (\Steam\steamapps\common\Industry Giant 2)  and then setting the Compatibility Mode to Win Xp Sp3. By doing this the game loads just fine and it loads in 1080!!The only other Compatibilty mode it loaded for me was in Win95 but I couldnt change the resolution at all because it just crashed.So, IF you have the game and it wont load, try what I posted and see if it works. A dev has said they are working on fixing the issue. I will update this review IF they fix it!			"

												Oh... my first love, when it comes to Tycoon-like simulations. Beside those 18 hours atm of writing this review, I probably spent 100s of hrs more almost 15 years ago... man! Many times I blindly checked to see if the game exists on Steam, and one time, out of nowhere - BAM! There it was. In HD and everything!

It might sound stupid, but I think some ways of thinking that are helping me in life I learned from this game. Once I saw a friend of mine making a mistake and crashing his small business (irl) before it even started and spending all of his savings, and I was like: ""poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why didn't you play IG2 for a day or two before starting with this little adventure, you would have planned better ahead!?"".

												This game is a lot of fun.It is a bit old but still a classic.Of all the Tycoon style games I think this one is among the best. If you like Tycoon or business sims I think you will love this game.The game allows you to move your goods by Road, Railroad, Air, and over the water ways. In addition to that you can setup your fields, factories, and warehouses in such a way that you don’t need a transport system if they are close to each other. The world changes as the city’s and town grow as you meet there needs.You can fine tune your production to be a lean efficient business, lowering and raising your industries output and changing wages paid to your workers.

Get resources to make products to sell in stores, thats about the long and short of it, but the variety of resources/products here is what keeps me going.

												The game is relativly fun and I think I would enjoy it if I could put it in a realoution thats 16:9 because I hate the black bars appart from that if you enjoyed OpenTTD then this is a more indepth version of this, the Price of it is OK I guess, it old as hell so I would rather it be around the £5 range but I guess £10 isnt too bad. Follow me instructions below if you have a issue with not being able to launch due to a graphics card error.This is a Fix for the issue people are having with a graphics card error.Its quite basic really, supprised people havent tryed it already.Just to clarify I'm running a Nvidia GTX680 and can run the game.OK now to the fix simply head into the games directory should look something like this C:\Program Files (x86)SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Industry Giant 2 and right click the file called i♥♥♥♥ddOn and run it in Windows 95 compatability mode and it will launch.Because basically what the developer has done is just upload the origonal files to steam it is looking for a old graphics card and operating system, by tricking it with compatability mode the game runs fine, only issue I see is, is that there are no 16:9 resoloution options because as previously stated this is a old as hell game. Not a bad game its just old so bare with its quirks.			"

												This is a fun game I played way back when.Game runs great at well over 120fps at 1080pThe tool tips do kinda spaz out and become unreadable sometimes, don't know why or how to fix it yet.I had actually forgotten how to do simple things like rotate buildings before placing them, etc.I couldn't see an option for the manual so I found on online.http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.7854It might seem like a dated game but it has what you need for hours of fun although I just like to make complicated railroads. The trains section is the best. "

												This game is a lot of fun.It is a bit old but still a classic.Of all the Tycoon style games I think this one is among the best. If you like Tycoon or business sims I think you will love this game.The game allows you to move your goods by Road, Railroad, Air, and over the water ways. In addition to that you can setup your fields, factories, and warehouses in such a way that you don’t need a transport system if they are close to each other. The world changes as the city’s and town grow as you meet there needs.You can fine tune your production to be a lean efficient business, lowering and raising your industries output and changing wages paid to your workers.  I am running it with no issues on Windows 10.			"

												After many years of hanging on to my legacy PCI Graphic card just so I could enjoy this game. The Dev’s finally blew the sands of time off the code and resurrected a classic instead of re-inventing the wheel and adding corners to it like, most them do these days. It shows great restraint and a respect for titles that have paved the way in their genre. And yes they are dated by today’s standards but put into context of their time period, they were and still are brilliant. Even today very few titles or Dev’s come close to or exceed the mark left by the ones that came before it. If you have ever play the original JoWood Game in 2002 and upgraded pc in 2004 and realized it won't work any moreWell you’re in luck as this now works on newer machinesYes there are Bugs but still very playable, but is the nature of the beast. Considering the iphone / android you are using has more power then most of the PC's back then 700 MHz Pentium 3's and the like so most of the bugs would be from JoWood's code and there narrow vision of the world in 2 years time let alone 13So hoping the new dev’s keeps this title going			"

The reason being that I thought it was the same type of game as the Railroad Tycoon series but the Railroad Tycoon series did a much better job of making the game fun and challenging to play.  This game didn't offer the same freedom when building and trying to get a station close enough to a storage building which was close enough to a store could really be frustrating.			"

												Maybe I dont have a lot of time in this game here on Steam, but I have definitely spent a couple 100s of hours in it. Still the best game of its type, despite some flaws.			"

												This game is a classic. Back when it was released in ancient days I spent many hours playing it. There is just a charm about it that I can not place.It's a classic, it's an old game, so the Graphics are not modern, but more or less 2D, like in the good ol' days.It could use some optmization, but overall, it's an oldy, but goody.

												Blame the nostalgia goggles if you want, but i love this game.It's basically like sim city, but instead of building the city, you build the economy around the cities. That means you're building mines to collect resources and then build stuff out of those resources, then building either railway or use trucks or airplanes to get your stuff to the cities to sell them. It's really fun and i love it.			"

												Bought this game when it lanched as 'Industry Giant 2: Gold Edition' in 2003; It quickly became my favourite and the only game I would play on my new laptop at the time.7 years later I found I could no longer play it after installing it on a new Windows 7 PC due to a graphics driver updated from Nvidia that made it unplayable. I emailed JoWood support and recieved no response. I eventually concluded that JoWood were never going to put the effort into fixing a 7 year old game and then shortly after they disappeared into the history books.13 years after the release and I once again get to enjoy this classic game. The more I play it the more I realise how advanced it was for its time, features such as the control of production, influces of a city's growth, but it is all to do with supply and demand.			"

												Nowadays, when so many various titles are on market in this game sector - some mechanics may seem obsolete. But it's one of classic strategy games you just have to play if you speak about yourself as tycoon fan.			"

												The best business and resource management game so far for strategic people. Great education, strategic thinking and entertainment especially when you go to campaigns where situations may suddenly change and you have to cope with that. It is enough simple to learn adequately fast, but provides a lot to play. I had this game before in original CD, but it didn't work any more in Windows 7 or later, but only in old Windows XP/Vista computers. It is great that Steam has took this to it's collection! Thanks! :)			"

												Overall i recommend this game. In the beginning i was worried to see only one campaign for each level but as you go on and pass a campaign it unlocks and makes visible a new one. So you have enough campaings and for many different levels of players. New products and industries are added as time goes by (within a game) which is a nice addonCould make some changes as every time i try to mute the music and sound effects it crushes,tutorials are a bit poor and maybe make it possible to make time pass quicker.
