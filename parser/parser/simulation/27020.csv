												These guys are seriously charging $5 for this garbage? When you look at this store page, you're not watching a trailer. That's a full walkthrough, because that's literally all you can do. You walk in a straight line, sit on a bench, listen to a song with subtitles on, and walk the f**k out. Game over.Yet despite how small this game is (at 47 Mb), they still couldn't even make it run properly. It skip and jitters almost constantly, and it's not just me. You can even see it in their ""trailer"". Not to mention the fact that when I played it, the old woman's animations glitched and I was unable to get up from the bench (or so I thought. Turns out that spending $5 let's the old lady kick the bucket while sitting on the bench). How f*****g incompetent do you have to be to make a game (and I'm being generous by calling it that) that's only 5 f*****g minutes long and still have it run like garbage and experience glitches? I saw the flat 2d tree decals disappear in fron of my eyes multiple times, and the shadows appear to be doing something which can only be described as ""sh*****g themselves"".I'm so happy that this was gifted to me as a joke because if I had paid even a penny for this pretentious mound of dog s**t, I probably would have shot somebody. I can understand attempting to make an artistic statement with a game but there's nothing here to begin with. The only emotion this envoked was confusion. And not at anything that I played, I was just confused as to how the hell this got released.I never thought that I would look at a game and genuinely regret wasting time on it, but congratulations ""Tale of Tales"", you did it.

												If you're considering buying this, don't.I get that this is supposed to be a small, artsy endeavor that shouldn't really even be classified as a game properly. I do. I've actually played other 'games' like that. The thing is, those were mostly very well done. This is crap.It uses standard wasd controls, but a and d turn instead of strafe. This makes movement awkward unless you're going straight forward. Fortunately(?), the camera angle is fixed and you have literally nowhere else to go because invisible walls block you from leaving the path forward in any meaningful way. Technically, you can travel a brief distance down the side paths before encountering them, but that hardly makes any difference.The worst part, really, is that it fails even at what should be its strength. The movements are poorly executed and frequently fail to match up properly with the environment. The birds, about the only moving things in the game apart from the protagonist, constantly clip through objects such as your character and the pavement. And the art assets themselves, even on highest settings, are mediocre at best in comparison with other 3D games of the last 5 years or more, and often considerably shabbier.Your experience of the game will not even vary in any significant way as near as I can tell. You will walk her to the end of the path where she will sit on the bench. Then, a transparent profile of her will appear along the right side of the screen, and a song about death sung in German plays, with subtitles. At some point during this song, she will die.The instructions are misleading, as they say you will walk her back out of the graveyard, ending the game, after it is done. I did three playthroughs, altering various things to try and see if she would survive so that I could, indeed, walk her back out and end the game properly, including going very slowly and letting her rest frequently and at length, in case it was linked to overexertion (perhaps as a way of punishing the player for not taking the time to appropriately appreciate this 'art'?). In the end, nothing worked. One of the only things I did not try was turning clockwise to sit down on the bench instead of counter-clockwise, and the idea that this could be the deciding factor is asinine, and I refuse to waste any more time experimenting with it because the game is so tedious and boring.I honestly don't even know why this is for sale. I could see this being made as a hobby project or maybe some kind of tech demo, but charging money for it seems almost unconscionable. This is easily in the running for the worst game on Steam.In short, if you still have any interest in this, just watch a youtube video of a playthrough instead. You'll get the exact same experience minus pressing the w key and then a or d to turn around and sit (which she does automatically). Don't waste your money on it.			"

												I was in a graveyard just like the one depicted in this game only a couple of years ago.  There was even an old woman limping slowly up the pathway to a bench.  I pushed her over, laughed and ran away but, having played this game, I think if the same situation occurs again in the future I'll simply sing a gibberish song and try to understand her point of view instead.Games can be so life-changing.

												The Graveyard is quite possibly the simplest game I have ever played. You play as an elderly lady in a graveyard and your only possible action is to walk forwards until you reach a bench and sit down. A song then plays for a few minutes and you either get up before the song ends or you remain and quietly die. That is the entire game.Interestingly enough, for a game that has absolutely no gameplay The Graveyard actually has a gamebreaking bug. If you remain seated during the song and die you will be forced to use ALT-F4 to end the game as the only real way to exit is to get up before the song ends.Poetry, Art, Experience. I do like that there are game developers out there that are experimenting with new things but charging gullible consumers money to play, what is essentially a postcard where you have to press the forward key for a few seconds to see it all, is just dishonest and greedy.This is not a game, some might consider it art. I consider it a money grab.			"

												This game changed my point of view - Yes, in fact it did! Only after about 10 minutes of almost crying excitement, I was literally stunned by the enlightenment which this game so forcefully granted me.This game changed my point of view - Before I played this game, I did not believe in a bad game. I mean every game has something... at least something... that makes it decent, in at least one way, even if it may have countless flaws.But this game - changed my point of view. This game is just pure bad, in every sense of the word bad. It is even that bad that it deserves a praise for how bad it is, from a scale from legendary to awful, it scores a pure awful! Yes, it's just that bad.I did get a graveyard for which my heart desired - yet with no freedom to interact or explore, only the vile path of unpleasantness awaits you.It's even that bad that I would almost recommend it just to experience the awfulness first hand, this is indeed a life time of awfulness squashed into a short 10 minutes of gameplay! I did not believe the end screen when I walked out of that graveyard, it came from like out of nowhere... it still scares me, this day today.Ofcourse, this is in my own personal opinion and I respect that your own opinion might be otherwise.

												It was all very tragic. By all accounts, grandma went to the cemetary, sat down on a park bench to rest her aching bones, and while listening to a terrible song about the deaths of many other people played by somebody she never really saw, she died....presumably the terrible song actually did her in.2/10If somehow her head gets lopped off later on, I will up the score a bit.p.s.

												This is barely a game. It is more akin to project a professor assigns to his/her class where they must explore a central mechanic/theme within a confined experience. It would probably get a good grade as a class project but as a game this is an absolute waste of money. There are better things you can do with the cash that is required to buy this game and the ~10 minutes (at most) it takes to play it. If someone gifts this to you, they probably hate you.			"

												I played the ""full"" version because my friend gifted it to me. I feel he was ripped off and should be given a refund. I've never been irritated by a gift before, but this one left me wishing I could have the time I wasted back. The only difference between the full version and the free one is... she dies on the bench. No sense of reflection. No walking back to the fence. No exploration of the graveyard (in either version). The entire game is shown in the trailer above. The instructions also detail the entire game (I wanted INSTRUCTIONS, not a plot spoiler with no alert... if you call that a plot... ?) The reviews are complete jokes. Most are mocking the game... yet giving it a thumbs up? Thanks, guys. Way to encourage everyone to waste money on this, rather than on other artistic games - ones that have real time and effort put into them.Yes, I love art. Yes, I own and love quite a few games that are artistic and most are rather short. Yet they tell a simple story. Some have had me in tears. I'll never forget the impact those indie games had on me. Their styles can be very unique, which is why some people do not even call them games. But this? This is incomplete and pathetic. I waited for 15 minutes for something... ANYTHING... to happen before I finally had to ""force quit"" in order to exit the game.Why should we support these indie developers? If they want your money, they should at least have the sense to put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" button at the end. Regardless, this takes less than two minutes to complete. It's not interactive. You don't even control when she sits down. You can't look at any of the gravestone. Come on, seriously? I don't understand why Steam even allowed this to be posted here.			"

Too short for empathy.A simple glimpse into a moment that is possibly a final one.    Actually, it will certainly be a final one.  She could die any time she sits on that bench and sits on it as long as you want her to. The avatar given has no characterization through dialogue, movement, flashback, or otherwise, and so the possible death of the character is totally irrelevant to the player as there is no consequence. A death such as this is only affecting to the most sympathetic of individuals.The game attempts to present video games as art, but fails to exemplify anything that let video games stand out as their own medium.

												Yesterday I was taking a walk in the park, I sat down near a lake and pulled out a sandwich I had bought at a nearby deli. I was stricken by an overwhelming sense of serenity and appreciation. Over out at the lake there sat an island with a giant tree, who's branches had been made home to a number of birds nests. From the lake, I could catch sight of elderly men fishing, children playing with bread crumbs and ducks, a couple holding hands and taking a walk, a shirtless man on a jog, two women passing by on a bike. Every one of them wrapped up in their own world, but all the same, part of an ecological system that brought upon a feeling of peace, safety, and a certain pure beauty that made me aware of just how nice the cool breeze felt running across my skin from the hot summer heat, the underlying frailness of some waterside flowers that reflected beautifully on the lake's surface, and the pleasures of smell the fauna brought simply from its own life and death cycle.None of that resonated in this lifeless game, it has absolutely no artistic merit, and the song sucked.10/10, would put my wrinkly old woman butt on a bench again.

												The concept of a painting one can explore is interesting, and on this the Graveyard delivers, albeit in a very limited fashion. The Graveyard caters to those interested in a short, yet unique emotive experience, similar to the Plan. Taken as such it may provide an enjoyable five minutes, however at $5 USD this title is far too overpriced for me to recommend - and regrettably so, as I'm a fan of the unique artistic titles Tale of Tales publishes, especially The Path.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												The Graveyard is a third person action adventure horror game with rogue-like elements (when your character dies the game continues). You play as a three-legged elderly woman exploring robust and realistic looking graveyard. Along the way you will encounter birds, a stone wall, stone tombstones, foliage and more until you get to the final boss, a standard sized park bench.  What happens next will leave you breathless.Controls: 3/10Resident Evil style controls with up and down moving forward and backward while left and right are used to turn. Grandma is as slow as a tank but without the bonus of destroying everything in her path. And when she finally does destroy the only thing she can, there is no way to quit the game after your victory. Also, there is no controller support.Graphics: 7/10 Some nice chiaroscuro in a beautifully rendered locale. Grandma's thick saggy jowls are a bit outdated, but you can imagine what she might have looked like 60 years ago.Sound: 6/10Pleasant sounds of a park; not even grandma's death get in their way. Or did you not play the full version? Music: 5/10All that setup just to get me to listen to a song by some guy named Gerry De Mol. He also has a song called ""Doof Me"" that you can check out on youtube. Camera: 4/10Assuming this was an open world graveyard game, I tried taking grandma down a side path in the cemetery to give her a little more time in this world and see if I could get any power-ups before facing the final boss. The camera didn't follow her movements and she disappeared. Having little value for my own time left on this planet, I tried to turn her around and have her walk back without seeing her movements (instead of just having her walk backwards) and ended up losing even more of my own life to this game. Now that I think about it, I never actually tried to walk backwards in The Graveyard, but I wouldn't be surprised if the programmers left that function out since time only moves forward.Final Thoughts:**Spoiler** If grandma doesn't die in the demo then isn't the promise of eternal life free? If you pay for things, you die; and please listen to Gery De Mol: that's the real message here. The creators really should have added a 2x speed option for those of us who would have preferred a painless death.If you want to experience a graveyard on a nice day, go to a graveyard. If you want to see death up close, spend your $5 on a bus ticket to a retirement home. If you want to hole yourself up into a virtual solitude, put a blanket over your head, grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the final cutscene of The Graveyard. It will bring you closer to death.			"

												First of all:Before buy this game, play the demo. The only diference from the complete version is that, in the complete version the old lady dies. And it is not a spoiler, it is told in game. So when you buy it (if you buy) you won't feel cheated and you will know that you bought just for support indie and artistic games.Probably, when you play The Graveyard you will say: Man! What the ♥♥♥♥ is that?! - And, ironicly, that's why I recomend this game.Yeah... I said that too. However I played it several times wondering what Tale of Tales was trying to do when they made this, and I think I found the answer.While mixing game and art, Tale of Tales tried to create in the gamer the defamiliarization that all the artistic work aims. So, after the defamiliarization, you need to open your eyes because you have a new and unknown thing before your eyes.""The Graveyard"" isn't a good game. Some will say it isn't a game at all, some will say it is pretentious. This game is not pretentious. Tale of Tales is not pretentious. This is a very good piece of art IMO. It is just hard to understand. I can say one thing: It is a freaking ""shock treatment"" for the expansion of concepts, and that's why I recomend it.If you want give it a try, play the demo.But you'll ask: How much you liked The Graveyard.I liked enough to ask for a translation for my language.I liked enough to offer myself to translate it.And I did it.And I am proud.

												Since years now I'm trying to make myself feel better about having wasted money on this, but I simply cannot lie to myself.What you're paying for here is not a game in any way (it's not even a walking simulator because you just walk over to a bench and that's it), nor some kind of artsy experience that gets you thinking or makes you say ""What a nice looking game!"". The only thing you are paying for here is a song, one single song while you watch an old lady die, and while I do like it (though it's far from great), it is not what I wanted to buy.I never even wrote reviews until this... thing... but I had to write this now to just say: There is really no reason for you to buy this. You can get better things with the money; you can go out and have some ice cream or buy a flower and give it to the love of your life or just buy an actually good indie game, but you don't have to do this to yourself. Just stay away from whatever the hell this is supposed to be.			"

												The dev's description on the store pretty much tells it all up front. Grandma walks. Grandma sits. Music plays. Maybe you'll walk out of the park back to the traffic of the street, or (only if you actually paid for this and don't just play the demo version) maybe grandma dies on the bench.I keep looking forward to when I'll finally connect with ToT and be entertained by their work, but this is not it. Really this only looks like a demo while working on animation cycles or basic engine functions at the start of a project, not actual release material.

												The Graveyard, is... wait, I need some caffeine.I wouldn't call this one an walking simulator. On the other hand you would not call it a game. It is no game and I feel an little resistance in my inner guts to go so far and call it art or an experience of any kind.There shouldn't be to much words about this... whatever you might call it, but I will give you an inside perspective of my kind of view on this one as well as any other... thing... in my game list.The wonderful world of surroundings that point your eye when you start the game might give you high hopes on the graveyard. It turns out that the atmosphere happens to be kind of relaxed and the black & white effect is underlining the cold but still hopeful overall touch that goes smooth with the sounds. As you keep going forward at the incredible speed of continents drifting away, you might consider what this world would look like if it had more colours in it or if it would have hurt to speed up the granny by giving her rocket powered rollerblades.As you keep passing the stones on the sight of the walk, you start to witness black birds and start asking yourself if you could fight back if an baby would happen to come by and steel your purse right before the bird attacks. Time goes by and you start to ask yourself what the name of this dot-based flashgame was where you happen to live an whole life from born to death in about 30 seconds and you wonder how many times you could have played it by now.Later in game you happen to get to the next task. You have reached the bench and you have to turn around and sit down - all together at the actual speed of dripping stalactites (thank god this is going into automatic, otherwise I wouldn't have made it)The next step is hard and sometimes glitchy, but I think that you might be able to do it anyway: Hold still. I know it sounds crazy and after all the rushing you might be thinking that you are unable to hold back, but try to ignore the spiders that try to use your armpits for webbing nets and chill for a second.The music you can hear has subtitles in many languages, even in english. If you are going to freak out at this point and you start screaming: ""What is this? How do they even come up with the idea that I might be able to understand english in the first place?!"" I can chill you here. You might think that you can't understand that language, but it is only because of the long time of isolation that you have been gone through since starting the graveyard.After a short while you will then slowly pass away. Everything will become grey highlighted and peaceful. About 5 minutes after that, the old lady in the game will also pass away.I know that I am on a point now where I would usually rate the game by my personal experience and than give an last catchy phrase next to it, so you get to see if it is fun or not, but I kind of got into an state of xtasy as if acid would run through my veins and I can not just go with something easy.. so I need to calm for a second.Thinking......keep thinking......well..okay.....I think I know$#/10 ""I don't know!""

												If you watch the video above, that's the absolute entirety of the game, sound and all. You walk (slowly) to a bench, turn around and sit down, then contemplate life while listening to a song. It actually even has something extra in the video, as after three full playthroughs, my old lady never stayed alive long enough to get up off the bench and walk out of the graveyard. Coincidentally, this is what you need to do in order to actually exit the game via the game controls, meaning I needed to exit via keyboard shortcuts every time. I guess when they say the full version includes the chance of death, they really mean that there's a very small chance of living. I can't stand playing any more to see how many attempts it takes. In any case, as much as I actually tend to enjoy the ""art"" games, this really has nothing worthwhile to it. Of course, having gotten it in a bundle with other games I actually wanted, I really don't care, but if you are thinking of spending money on this, go watch paint dry for five minutes instead. You'll have almost as worthwhile of an experience. I will give them this, in that the game description is quite accurate, though ""explorable"" and ""walk around"" are stretching things a lot. I was expecting to actually be able to, I don't know, maybe walk around and explore the graveyard on my way to the bench.			"

Turn her back to make her automaticly sat on that bench. Listen some more short music and sound effect.. then leave the graveyard....There is a bit background explaination that will show up like subtitle.. but once again.. it's not much.Not much to it.. seems like a granny walking simular that's quite well done for something from 2008. Too short and lack of content to be worth sold on steam. I do like the graphics and sound effect somewhat but because the simple 1 minute of total gameplay..

												Another one that falls squarely into the ""It's not a game... it's art"" category. Yes, you do get 95% of the game in the demo, but don't think of it as ""I want to buy the game to see if she dies"", think of it as ""This was an interesting exercise - I want to buy the game to support the developers to make more stuff like this"".Granted, they've now made ""The Path"" which is also worth a look at, but this was interesting. A previous review described this as ""an interactive painting"" and gave it a negative review. I feel the exact opposite. If you're going to interpret it as ""an interactive painting"" then I'd say it succeeds perfectly.			"

												This is a game that costs $5.  I received it in a bundle way back and in my quest to have every game in my library marked as ""played"" I've spent some time with it.The developers were too lazy to buy 3D trees from the unity store.  Instead there's literally a 2D sprite that comically shifts back and forth in the wind, which they must have known looks absolutely ridiculous.There is roughly 5-20 minutes of ""gameplay"".  Most of it is a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ song sung in German (I think.  Ignorant 'murican here) while the woman sits on a bench.  The rest is slowly limping in a straight line.  If you deviate from the path it gets pretty glitchy.Not even really worth downloading if you also picked it up in a bundle.			"

												The Graveyard is  a very short computer game. You ""play"" an old lady who visits a graveyard. You walk around, sit on a bench and listen to a depressing ""song""  and die. It's more like an explorable painting than an actual game. An experiment with poetry and storytelling but without words. I think it's trying to show that you can die anytime in an unexpected way and make 4.99 € from literally anything.Immersive gameplay though, it feels like aging and it's a pain to sit down.			"

												So this game is quite short and it seems more like an art demo rather than an actual game. Basically you walk the old woman to the bench and she might die. Not the most fun game in the world, but at the same time it's something you could play in case you need a break between playing regular games.I will recommend this game, not because it's good (or that it's worth the money, I didn't pay full price because I got it in the Tale of Tales Collection bundle when it was on sale), but because it's something unusual and that even if it's short it kinda describes life. Short but slow at the same time and in the end you die.			"

												Tajikistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia that borders Afghanistan to the south, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and Uzbekistan to the west and northwest. The ancient Silk Road passed through it. The nation is unique in that the majority culture is non-Turkic, unlike its neighbors to the north and west and east. Tajikistan is the poorest country out of the former soviet states, the poorest country in Central Asia and one of the world's poorest, largely owing to a devastating civil war that broke out shortly after independence in 1991.

												The Graveyard is like an extremely basic version of Dear Esther, except stupid. It's unfortunate that most of Tale of Tales games seem to be less a game and more a proof of concept or tech demo of sorts. Whilst the developer manages to create a unique experience they don't actually do anything to take advantage of it. It's as if Tale of Tales is an advertising agency, creating 30 second commercials, amongst a sea of giants who make 2-3 hour feature films. Yet they still charge a similar price of admission.If you want to make the experience infinitely more amusing, throw on some DMX (I recommend Party Up) whilst you spend five minutes walking down the path of a graveyard to sit on the bench of existentialism.

												""The Graveyard"" is not a game.  The developers want you to evaluate this like artwork and if that is the case,  One can view ""The Graveyard"" as encapsulating the frailty of humanity.The music is rather fascinating and makes you wonder if that is the life of the older woman in the game.  Who knows?But aside from finding a place to sit, I found myself wanting to get her to walk backwards, walk past the building and do anything to get any enjoyment of the game.But alas...I wasn't able to.If you want to watch the frailty of humanity, I do recommend watching a Yasujiro Ozu film like ""Tokyo Story"", Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" or even Vittorio D. Sica's ""Umberto D."" and you will find these films to be a much better experience than ""The Graveyard"".			"

												The Graveyard  is an indie game funded by, that's right, the Indie Game Fund. A cool little title, it is much like the first Portal, only without the narrative guide of GLaDOS' disembodied voice.The title is short, though I have yet to do the 2 Extra levels at the game comes with, I have completed the core game, and it only took three and half hours to do so.Challenging, yes, but the game is made more challenging by introducing you to a concept, then hitting you with a new one before you've really gotten the hang of the current mechanics.The game uses forced camera movement which disrupts what would otherwise be just like Portal's complete freedom to explore the game at all times, it also uses invisible walls, which it really shouldn't considering you're in a box of boxes.I'd absolutely recommend this game for puzzlephiles, but at it's current price point, many will object to such a short game for 15 bucks.

After that you play as jesus someking of gta but 2000 years ago, and there a guy who kills all the babys but you goto somewhere else, there a mission where you are in a desert.

												Interesting experiment in storytelling where you control an old lady visiting graveyard and the visit brings back old memories. It is a very melancholical game with excellent atmosphere. However it's simply too short and I feel it's a little bit of a wasted potential. The way the old lady moves indeed gives you a feedback about her fragility and though there are no decisions and the game is strictly linear, you have a feeling of control that helps you feel a little bit how the old lady feels. Still I recommend it as it is a very powerful experiment in immersive potential of games.			"

												While other designers prove games are art by using the unique mechanics of video gaming to accomplish things and tell stories in ways that other mediums can't, In ""The Graveyard"" TofT tackles the question of video games' artistic status like a bunch of overly earnest first year art students who know nothing about video games, but a whole lot about bad art film cliches. I can hear their brainstorming session right now:""So what would make a video game art?""""We could make it black and white! That's arty.""""Brilliant! Maybe we could even make it about something mundane, like an old woman walking in a cemetary.""""Mundane, sure, but we need some pathos. Maybe we could have her die too. Death is arty."" ""Yes! Then we could force the player to listen to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ french song after she dies. There's nothing more arty than French people, you know.""""Done and Done! The world will never understand our genius!

												According to the instructions, you are to force march the crippled lady to the bench, and listen to the song.  When you are done, you are supposed to force march the lady out of the graveyard.When I attempted to play the game, I got the lady lost in the graveyard.  After that ate up about 3 minutes of time, I got her sad sagging wheezy ♥♥♥ to the bench.  The song started, I tried my dammedest to follow along, and the lady started nodding off.  When the song was over, I tried getting the old bag up, but she was either sound asleep or dead.  Either way, there was no way to get her to move her ♥♥♥ out of the dang graveyard, forcing me to shut down the program by a way unintended by the game design.I'll play it again when they add a forklift and ambulance DLC to move the dang fatass around.

												I tentatively recommend this game; I'm more than tempted to give it a ""No."" The problem is that it isn't a game at all. It's an art experiment. I sort of enjoyed the idea, and I support the fact that it exists, but for anyone looking for more than a few minutes of something vaguely interesting, I guess I can't really recommend it. As I said already, it really isn't a game at all. There are ""games as art"" types who would probably not appreciate this, but, as much as I can in fact get behind this sort of thing, it really has no lasting value. Hum.

												This game was truly inspirational. Gifted to me by a close and dear friend, known for his witty choice of games, I was originally skeptical. The download for the game was quick and efficient. Upon first opening the game you are thrown straight into the gameplay, this originally threw me off guard as the controls were quite hard to get used to. However with perseverance anything can be achieved. After I had fully mastered the controls I began the game, before playing I advise you get headphones to play as the music is truly inspirational and the game is not complete without it. The first thing you see after starting the game is a divinely animated graveyard with a variety of different grave designs included. The lady you control moves at a smooth speed, which one could compare to a the speed of which a snail moves towards a particularly appetisizing piece of grass. The goal is far in the distance though, being not as smart as many players who had played this game prior to me I had to check the menu, which can be found by pressing the escape key. The goal is to get to the bench in the center of the graveyard. On the way towards the bench I found myself going on a journey into my inner consciousness, questioning my very existence upon this world. To sit down on the bench upon arrival you must slowly direct the lady backwards onto the bench until she glimpses poetically back at the bench before firmly placing herself on it. This is where the real story begins.Sitting on the bench transports you to an entirely new plain of existence. This is the part of the game which you definately need headphones for as the music here is both emotive and inspiring. Though the song sang is in german it speaks to you on an emotional level, without reading the lyrics I instantly knew everything the song was saying and I almost felt as though I was the lady I controlled. The emotions of her past flooded into my mind, emotions I have never felt before and I am sure I will never feel again. To my suprise once the song ended the lady did not wake up and I now know this happened because it is possible in rare circumstances for the lady to die, of natural causes, during the game. This came as a shock to me and something shifted inside my heart. ""Why was I chosen to witness this"" I have asked myself every night before I fall asleep and the only answer I could find was that I had been chosen by her.Writing this review I am finding it hard to control my urge to cry as this game has truly touched me in many ways.Masterpieces like this are hard to find these days so I strongly suggest you buy this game. Well done Tell a Tale games. 10/10.			"

It just made games that changed the way other game developers saw and made their games.This is where it started, folks. This is where the village sequence from Uncharted 2 comes from. This is where walking simulators were born.You don't really need to play Tale of Tale's games, since the other game devlopers inspired by their work made much better.

												This game is a true masterpiece. Not only do the graphics stand up even to this day, and come very close to be of similar beauty of the yet-to-be-released ""The Witcher 3""-game, it's even phenomenal looking in the artistic sense.A lot of manhours had to have been put in the carefully handcrafted graveyard area, the church, and even the bench. The lady in general has a truely realistic way of walking with a cane, and looks impressively detailed.Unfortunately my version bugged out so it didn't unlock the Zimmer for me when I finished the game on Nightmare mode.Both the Flemish song and the flipping trees are a notion of a deranged mind which was a necessary ingredient to make this game stand up to even the best games in recent game history. The tention, the ambiance, it was almost possible to actually feel like you're really there. The black and white-look of the game is sure to give you a nostalgic feeling.Even the moment when old gran-gran died on the bench has got to be one of the most intense emotional moments ever in computer games.I recommend this game to anyone who likes games with a good storyline, great graphics, lot's of nerve-racking action,  and a cinematic experience. Also don't forget to listen from time to time to this game's godlike soundtrack, you won't be disappointed at all.My only gripe with this game, in my honest opinion, is that the camera doesn't always follow the protagonist, and that you're able to 'walk off the screen', in a manner of speaking...

												It's ok for a game to be artistic.  It's not okay for ""art"" to pretend to be a game when it doesn't contain any modicum of decent gameplay.This game is a walking simulator, however, there is no content or story.  You simply march an old woman up and down a graveyard once.   A clever artist might have worked out some reason for the woman to be there, but they don't even bother with that.While the developer will stop making coffees for a moment and rant about this being some precious ""art"", and while they might even be right, if it is art, it's not very good, and it certainly isn't a game.    There are many examples of walking simulators that do have a compelling story or artistic experience (Dear Elise is a good example), but that's missing from this. As such, it's impossible to recommend.			"

												I saw the game for 1€ and bought it because it sounded interessting. I really should have read all the information around here because there are enough signs that say that this ""game"" is not good.. well this isnt even a game.It is a shame to call this a game. This is more like an example for tryhard ""art"" - pure nonsense. It is not emotional, it doesnt have a ""deeper sense"", it doesnt have a good atmosphere or a message.How to ""beat"" this game:1) Start the game2) Hold the ""W"" key for around 2 minutes3) When you reach the bench, turn around and sit down4) Listen to a horrible song and die5) The end (you have to close the game via taskmanager..)Seriously this is just a scam like Bientot lete and I stop here because I already wasted more time to write this review than someone needs to ""beat"" this game. Btw I tried to survive the game several times but it seems that she dies every time.			"

And if you don't find the video interesting or ""fun"" (really? it's not fun? aw, I was really hoping it'd be fun to hobble around a graveyard!) then don't buy it and then complain about the few bucks you spent on it. It is the most accurately advertised videogame of all time. It's totally cool if you don't like it, or hate it even. But don't call it a rip off. And for the record, I think it's totally awesome. even if only to be a really cool way to listen to an awesome song.			"

												When I started ""the Graveyard"" I didn't have high expectations. I was a little old lady in a graveyard, not great right? I thought I'd explore to begin with. Turns out you can't do that. The camera doesn't follow you off screen and with slow walking and tank controls I thought I'd lost my character and had to restart. I managed to get back on screen again and made my way to a bench. So far I've been playing for 5-6 minutes and I've literally walked to a bench and sat down. Then old lady starts looking around aimlessly. This goes on for maybe 30 seconds untill she keels over and dies. As if that wasn't bad enough, some terrible German pop music about people dying starts playing. Then nothing. Just watching some old dead ♥♥♥♥♥ on a bench and little birdies occasionally landing then flying off untill finally I get bored and have to open task manager just to close it. I'd have a very hard time recommending this game to anyone, I genuinely think I've found real graveyards more entertaining.			"

												It's hard to call this a game. It's a piece of art, or it's intended to be art I'd say. It only lasts a few minutes. You walk an old lady to a bench, in a graveyard, and a song begins to play. That's it. The old lady can die as well but I haven't experienced that (yet). It's weird, it's twisted, it isn't fun. If you look at it like some sort of art game, then it still isn't fun, but you'll probably understand why they created it.[Rating: 52/100]			"

												I walked gingerly to the bench and sat down. A horrible song played and the old woman died. I think it was the song that killed her.Next play through I turned right around at the start and exited the graveyard. Game ended; I have cheated death.

I wasn't expecting much in the way of gameplay, but you can only really go up the path. I tried to go look around the rest of the graveyard and since... the camera doesn't move with you, if you can't get back you need to restart the game.

												The game's a minute long, thus causing all the controversy. If you can get if for less than a buck, it's a short reminder that people still care about the artistic side of games. If you want a ""game,"" then you're in the wrong place. The credits theme takes longer than the whole story. That said, it's not anything the game itself does wrong. If any of this made sense, put it at the bottom of your wishlist and consider it if a sale put's it within the margin of 0.99 you don't care if you see again. There are superior games you can get for free, but I still respect what it did in our short time.			"

												I myself am quite a fan of interactive works of art. The Graveyard is another one of these creative ideas that features a story (in the form of a song) and two different endings, so to speak. However, I wouldn't so much recommend this game by itself (I got it in a bundle from a dear friend of mine). At five dollars, the experience is too short to really grip me into the story it's trying to tell. As well as this, there's no way to exit the game while in fullscreen when the old woman dies. I had to alt+tab out and close it manually. While the old lady's walking animation is quite smooth, the graphics are still not as pleasing as you would expect such a short game to be. The birds even pass through the building, not to mention her eyes are kinda creepy and lifeless, but not in a really good way. Don't get me wrong, I still appreciate The Graveyard for its creativity and attempting to bring about emotion in the players, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you can get it for a better deal.

												ROFLMAO. I swear this game made me roll on my belly with laughter. FIRSTLY !!! That Old Hag is the slowest moving bug-eyed Hag in the world! Talk about turning 90 degrees in like 10 seconds. SECONDLY !!! On my first play through she friggen fell asleep on the bench. PERMANENTLY !!! Man she must have been so bored of that weird ♥♥♥ song. THIRDLY !! I've had AAA games crash on me so many times I really don't think its wise to friggen terminate the game by ending its process when that Old Hag sleeps!If you buy this game, you basically buy it to support the developers. And I have. I can only hope that if I ever come out with a brilliant piece of software, whether it be my KnubAction website or an Indie game, that Tale of Tales developer extends me the same courtesy. Especially if I give them an exit button !!!			"

												For the sale price of <$2, if you're into video games as art, grab this.  Its regular price of $10 is, IMO, far to much.You can get and play the demo for free at the Tell Tale Game websites - the only difference between the demo and the full version is there is a % chance the old woman can die.  The act of dying does seem to better punctuate the game then the regular ending, which is to merely exit and end the game - but I dunno.In any case, demo or full version, the game is literally 10-minutes of play.  Its worth it once for the right individual.			"

												The Graveyard is a very short ""interactive art"" game in which you walk through a graveyard as an old woman, sit on a bench, and listen to a song.The controls are simple, but the woman's movement is very slow. You are unable to explore the graveyard because invisible walls block all paths except the one between the gate and the bench. The camera only faces one way, so the character can be obscured by a grave if you try leaving the main path, making it unapparent that you are futilely shuffling into an invisible wall.The game is intended to be atmospheric, but making the movement slow and the graphics being entirely greyscale does not achieve the intended effect. The graphics and audio are lacking, and while the song is interesting, it feels out of place.SPOILERS:The old woman dies while listening to the song. There is no indication that she's dead aside from that she slumps over more, so I spent several minutes after the song ended trying to figure out why she would no longer move. There is no way to exit or restart at this point, so I was forced to use Alt+F4 to quit the game. "

												Do not buy this game.  Even as a piece of art it is sparsely of merit and the creators of this ""game"" have elsewhere expressed contempt for video games as an artistic medium.  The Graveyard is Tale of Tales' little inside joke that allows them to have a cheap laugh over how willing a gamer is to pay $2-5 for a game just because it could be labeled as ""artistic"".			"

												I just wonder if it needed me at all... Possibly could have just been a video. All I could do is control her walking very slowly, which basically ended up with her walking into an invisible wall because she only goes to the graveyard with the intention of sitting down, not wanting to look around or, say, visit anyone she has lost. You could start rambling about deep meaning you found in the game, but I'm pretty sure you can do that with many things.... for free. Pretentious stuff, perhaps an artsy project for school or something they decided to try to get money from. Luckily I only got it in a bundle, so can just hide it from my library and forget about it.I can appreciate things without action or explosions, and I didn't expect it to be a game or anything long, but there was no story here at all and the artwork and music was actually pretty rubbish. Isn't that essential for a good atmospheric experience? I know it isn't exactly new, but it is poor even for 2008. Perhaps it is about time it became free to.... ""play"". I don't think Steam is really the platform for this kind of thing.Plus the old lady didn't even fall over when walking backwards. ;)			"
