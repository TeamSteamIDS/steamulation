												+ Stylish graphics+ Fun to kill targets in all kinds of different ways+ Plenty of scenarios+/- Certain traps can only be placed on certain spots, no complete freedom+/- Pathfinding problems can result in frustration; not always clear where a target will go to when he's alerted or when a trap is placed in front of him- Secondary objectives not always clear- Collecting teeth is an useless objective which hardly requires any effort- The music, oh my god, the music[Rating: 77/100]			"

												The concept is neat, but each scenario is samey, and difficulty is derived from trial and error that comes from floaty and kinaesthetically displeasing physics. Menus are fine, and the visual style is neat, but audio is best muted. Kill The Bad Guy is about figuring out exactly what the developer wants you to do, and no deviation from this course is permitted. Don't let me completely dissuade you, though - if you're genuinely interested, download the demo before you buy. I'm sure there's some audience out there for this, but I am clearly not it.			"

												TL:DR - Game starts good but after first 20 levels game turns into frustrating experience mainly because of the camera.Game got a neat idea - kill the baddie and makes it look like an accident. There are some original(use tree as catapult and load a dead dog on it) and generic(run them over with a car) ways to kill them. Art is neat. With black are marked the stuff you can use and civilians,cops and cameras for which you have to look for. With yellow is baddie and rest is white. Game offers 66 lvls in total(60 story,6 bonus lvls) . So far so good.Now when comes to the bad stuff ... well.Camera ... camera is terrible. You can't change the angel,you can only zoom in and out and often because of that you will often encounter miss calculation or missclicks. Controls - well I used mouse only while playing and can say that .... some stuff is way to sensetive to clicks which may force you to restart the level. When you click on your ""catapult"" you cant cancel it to do something else . It's just like chess, you play what you touch.Line of SIght - Well, every cop,civilian and camera got wall hack. Even though there is a button to show the line of sight of everybody it doesnt really matter when comes to buildings. Hell, cops and civilians can sense stuff from quite a far while the baddie barrely sees whats right in front of him..Fast reflexes - some puzzle requires quite a lot of precision and fast reflexes .. well gl with that , its doable but after a lot of fails...Humor - game tries to be funny but falls flat with just few of the baddie's description that may make you giggle for few seconds , rest are just blant or taken from LotR,SW and the likes universes just to fill the spot...Overall if you got the nerves go for the game, else skip ...

												Kill The Bad Guy is an indie puzzle game that revolves around assassinating targets using objects in the environment whilst remaining undiscovered and depicted in a simple, understated artistic design with plenty of dark humour. Though the game suffers from some key issues you’ll still manage to squeeze a few hours of good old fashioned puzzling fun out of it even if it is an incredibly slow starting game. This is a puzzle game that puts you at the heart of revenge murdering individual targets who are more often than not based on real life offenders.The objective of the game is rather self-explanatory. In each level you must kill a bad guy in various, unusual ways. The game comprises of 60 of these bone shattering, blood splattering levels. For every level there are ways in which you can manipulate objects within the environment to bring about your target’s doom. At the start of every level, a fairly amusing profile about your intended victim which tends to include details of their crime and a name that vaguely points towards somebody in real life like ‘KimDotKom’, in reference to Kim Dotcom, or ‘Oscar’, in reference to Oscar Pistorius. After reading your target’s profile you’re then dropped into a white environment with black objects such as cars, ropes hanging on walls, steam vents and pianos that you can pick up, rotate and combine. You’re given very little guidance on what to do from here, except for the first few levels, so instead you have to work out what will kill the target. By selecting dark coloured objects you’re shown a large array of arrows that point to where you can place objects, such as atop buildings or anywhere on the ground. Objects that can be combined are coloured green picking up one of the constituent parts so it’s not particularly challenging to work out what goes with what.There are very few controls other than picking up, rotating and combining items but after you have managed to pull off your mission,  camera controls allow for a cinematic execution of the target. The camera can switch angles to get the best shot but it does come across as a rather pointless feature. During actual gameplay you can, rather helpfully, pause the game and look around the area but objects cannot be manipulated meaning that, when you decide what you’re going to do, you need to do it quickly. As you progress through the levels you’re not just exposed to new challenges like the police and cameras, there is also a pretty significant increase in the variation of objects you’re given to assassinate targets. It must be said, however, that the first ten levels of this game are by far the worst of them all. Truthfully, I was amazed that I even progressed beyond them and discovered that the game actually contained something challenging and interesting. The initial levels are intended to be tutorials that ease you into the mechanics of the game. Instead, the experience is painfully dull and excessively lengthy. Never has a ‘tutorial’ chapter dragged on so slowly and uneventfully. Thankfully the game opens up after a couple of hours play and you’re exposed to more than one way to kill your target as methods gradually become more complicated. The animations of your dying target do become a tad more varied in that they fall over when they are electrocuted but overall there’s not much difference between driving a spear through your target’s head, dropping a car on him and crushing him with a wrecking ball as, either way, he ends up as a bloody smear on the pavement. In a game where the method in which you kill your target is designed to be the be all and end all of the gameplay I would have expected more death animations such as a crushed, flattened body or some pierced limbs.The game has some degree of re-playability as each level have secondary objectives that offer some basic tasks: catch the tooth of your fallen victim, kill them on the first day and find a hidden passport. The only interesting additional objective is to kill your target in a specific manner as the rest are repetitive and restrictive. The passport tends to be in locations like beneath cars or objects and hidden within buildings that become transparent as you pan over them. By completing these unimaginative challenges you gain stars which count towards unlocking a bonus level at the end of each chapter. These bonus levels are, ironically, quite a bit more interesting than the main game.As a final note I found that the game’s humour often borders on the tasteless as there are sometimes very graphic descriptions of real life crimes such as those perpetrated the Columbine killers that some, if not many, may find uncomfortable. Generally the profiles of your targets are humorous covers of less invasive crimes such as fraud and embezzlement but when the game describes in graphic detail the crimes of the monstrous Albert Fish then the vibe of what is supposed to be a carefree, slaughter orientated romp is very quickly killed and is instead turned into something much darker and not at all light-hearted. Whilst the game starts off slow and simplistic it quickly develops into a more robust murder simulation with some fairly imaginative solutions to the dilemma of how to discreetly kill your target. I particularly enjoyed the rather difficult task of luring your target to a particular spot or changing the path they were following by quickly putting obstacles in their way without them noticing. The level of difficulty scales as you play but even when the game becomes more complex there are moments where it comes across as pointless and repetitive.I would recommend waiting until the price has dropped but if you enjoy flippant murder simulation games with stark graphics and environmental manipulation then perhaps you’ll enjoy this more than I did.

												Although there is a lot of blood and killing, this game is really a pretty tricky puzzle game. There is very limited freedom in your options how to kill the guy, most often an obvious and a less obvious solution. But when you solve it it's very satisfying to see the guy splattered all over a wall, floor, car, whatever. The puzzles can be pretty challenging and sometimes a bit unclear. To fully complete a puzzle you probably need to retry it a few times, especially to get the second objective. Which can be a bit annoying.+ Original style / gameplay+ Splatter bad guys all over the place+ Lots of puzzles+ Dark humor- Puzzles can be a bit unclear- Obnoxious soundtrack in menu (personal)- Pricetag a bit highAll in all a funny puzzler with a very original style.

Fun...But Not for Too LongThe idea that you can manipulate the world around the bad guy to kill him is amusing. However as the levels progress, they get somewhat repetitive and it feels like you are doing the same this over and over again with little variation. However, for all those that enjoy the game and are not bored within an hour or so there are plently of levels to complete which provides for a substantial gameplay time.There are gameplay elements that make this game somewhat frustrating to play. For example the camera doesn't rotate and you can only zoom in and out and this makes it hard for timing and perception purposes.For the full-price that this game is asking for i would say that this game isn't worth it however if you get it discounted and you are interested in this sort of game then it is just a little bit worth picking up.

												Kill The Bad Guy is a strategical action game where your main goal is to kill the ""bad guy"" . Well when you start a single player in this game, you will find here a lot of  levels to complete.  The levels are grouped in some ""stages"" after complete a that stage levels you will find that a difficulty a bit grow more than before, for example you will find cameras what should avoid etc. Every level you can complete in different ways, but try always do even more bloody kill to reach a bigger high score. Also you will find here a collectible things like a passport or tooth  and secondary objectives. Also in a game you will find a multiplayer feature with 4 different game mode: Serial Killers, Capture the flag, Godfather and Gang Supremacy.The game graphic looks simple, but the style looks nice and well fit to the game. You will not find in a game too much sounds, but hey are okey. So my verdict +leaderboards+challenging+various possibilities to finish level+interesting ""bad guy"" bios+simple but nice graphic+multiplayer+steam cards and achievements -sometimes second objective can be too foggy-not the best camera views So i think if you are looking for a some fun and you are like that games where you should thinking a bit, also you fell a challenge to beat even bigger score, this game for you. A base price a bit high, but at sale when its get a bigger discount can be instant buy.			"

												Even though I do not (personally) recommend this game, I do recommend to those who find this appealing. I highly recommend buying on sale as stated price does not feel worth it. Kill the Bad Guy has been on my wishlist for a while. I like games where there is an overhead view of everything and seemingly anything can be manipulated. Kill the Bad guy is a puzzle type game where the player can use one or more objects (by combining them) to eliminate the target. The game doesn't change in any sense beyond that, you are buying a puzzle game where you will have about 60 levels of killing the target in certain scenarios given certain objects. Adding a steam workshop or some sort of community involvement probably would have added another layer of re playability to this game. Objects are selected and have to be moved by clicking the move icon (obviously). It's not quite drag and drop, but more of click, click, and try clicking over here to see if they combine. The indicating icons above objects help diversify what can be connected with what. What is neat though is that multi-player was given in the game. Once the game is done, there isn't really much else, but from time to time multi-player is worth coming back to. Just sucks if your friends don't have it because there is a shortage of players. The game is good by premise, but I feel it could have been better. Adding a community mod behind it, allowing for customizable levels (or a level builder), maybe even custom items would have been interesting. Mini-games even could have made another impact. Multiplayer definitely does give it a backing now and makes it worth a second look. Re playability isn't critically high, but it's somewhat there. As a standalone game the rating is 6.25/10, as an Indie RATING : 6.7/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C Sounds / Music C Replay-ability C Overall  CScreenShots : Setting up a killYou can still manipulate people after you kill themSlingshot to the dome Ratko got a spear to the chest "

												A really neat little puzzle/strategy game, with multiple ways to complete the objective of, unsurprisingly, killing the bad guy. To give you an idea of its quality as a time-waster, I've only given it two play sessions and am somewhere around level 60.Most of the 'bad guys' are based on real people or famous fictional characters, including Saddam Hussein, Freddie Kreuger and even Oscar Pistorius. It's kept fresh by the addition of obstacles to getting your target such as roving witnesses, security cameras and bodyguards who also need to be taken out.The only frustration I've encountered has been in the emphasis on making a lucky shot with a spear shot from a makeshift ballista or with a box falling from the roof of a building. You can spend a good long while planning your moves, only to have them scuppered by the fixed perspective making it incredibly difficult to tell where you shot will go. These occurrences are few and far between, however, and you can speed up time and restart instantly to quell the anger they conjure.			"

												Kill the Bad Guy is an idea that sounds great on paper, but lacks the proper execution to be any kind of fun. Players are expected to figure out how to kill the bad guy by combining and interacting with various objects within a level. The main problem with this game is that the behaviours of each individual object isn't immediately clear, which prevents players from being able to efficiently plan a strategy. Add to this that the bad guy never shows a clear direction or path, and the result is a game that fails in making the player feel clever in any possible way.			"

												Interesting concept and quite fun for a few levels. However, two things kinda ruin it:- the lack of camera rotation- the inability to turn off moving the screen around by holding left clickEspecially the latter is irritating, since you activate stuff by left clicking as well, and many objects require a precise dragging motion within a specific area. The later puzzles require some absurdly strict timing and it's way too easy to miss and move the screen by mistake, making you restart and shout profanities at the screen.			"

												I really like this game, and I’m not sure why.From the moment you boot it up, Kill the Bad Guy looks, feels and plays just like a mobile game. The interface is blatantly designed for a touch interface, the art is minimalistic but in a way that looks like it was only made that way to run on mobile hardware, and the levels are your typical “get x number of stars”. If you judge it by it’s cover, Kill the Bad Guy is just another shoddy mobile port trying to cash in on Steam.Yet it’s not. It’s really fun! Each level you must assemble a Rube-Goldberg type trap on the fly in order to kill a designated bad guy. It is certainly nothing complicated or revolutionary but I really have been enjoying my time with it.Pick it up for a buck or so and you won’t be disappointed.			"

												I usually enjoy puzzle games, but this one was just a pain. The bad guy's behavior is inconsistent(maybe a timing thing?) which really screws you when you need to make him walk to a specific part of the map. Sometimes he'll see a barrier and walk a different direction, but sometimes he'll notice it and still walk past it.The camera is another big issue for me. Click and drag moves the camera, but it also does all your interactions, so you have all these conflicts when it gets to the point where timing is key. I'm sure you could do something about it, but I just don't have enough interest left to try anything.Nothing is all too intuitive. You end up spending a majority of your time going through trial and error until you find something that works.I didn't even bother with the multiplayer mode, so I can't speak to how that is.			"

												You do exactly what it says on the tin. Kill the bad guy. Each level has a map with a target you must kill. You have to use available items on the map such as lawn mowers,cars or a spear fired from a catapult. Good points:-Fun light hearted game. -About 60 levels plus a few bonus ones you can unlock. (I personally liked the Lemmings tribute)- Seeing your dastardly plan come together resulting in the bad guy splattered across the street is always satisfying especially as you get to watch a replay afterBad points:- This game is really more suited as a mobile game and can be a bit awkward to work with a mouse- It'll only provide a few hours entertainment max.In any case this game is good for a few hours of over the top fun.

												This is a cool, slick, puzzle game that reminds me, in a way, of something like World of Goo.

You get extra points for being particularly inventive, and if you get caught then you lose the round.This is a fun, [darkly] whimsical and cynical game.

												The concept behind this game is simple. The title says it all. There is a bad guy who you have to kill by any means possible. This game has a simple to use mechanic which makes it entertaining and fun. I put 102 minutes into it which is probably about the extent of what I see myself getting out of it. It is a good mildly entertaining game. I don't see it being replayable. It can get a bit bland. The creative concept behind it is good and cool. Everything is kept simple. You don't have to put a lot of thought into it and it is great for a laugh every so often. Graphically I think the game could use some textures. The models are black and white with red blood effects. and basic colors on some main items and explosions. Aside from that everything is white for the most part with little to no textures. I know this is the style of the game and it is how the developer intented to design it, but I think it would look a lot more lively if they took the time to actually texture it better.The game was good for an hour and fourty minutes of mindless entertainment I will give it that.Rating: 8/10			"

You can't really do what you want, and there a not much ways to kill the bad guy. You often find yourself thinking : I want to kill him like this, but you have no other option. All the ""bad guys"" are the same, no specific behaviour form one to another. I don't play multiplayer, and I can't remember if devs were talking about the multiplayer mode when I bought it years ago...A good game, but very very repetitve.

Basically there are 66 levels, (possibly more for all I know) which has a sort of angry birds type of system, where every level you try to complete the object (kill the bad guy) and earn all the stars, (five to six for each level.) You must kill the bad guy in each level by making it look like an accident and trying not to get caught by civilians, police, cameras, or the target himself. It's very much a puzzle game, where you must think of a way to kill your target with what the level presents you. I feel like this game is sort of speaking out with how our government treats criminals, by treating them better than they deserve, when really they just be killed rather than try to weasel out of their consequences and live peacefully under government protection. Lastly the music, the music is also pretty good, surprisingly. It's alot of fun and definetely worth the 15 dollars.			"

												It's one of the mmost brutal puzzle games I have played. Strategy game is not something I would call it though. The game is simple kill the bad guy. You get a scene with some options. These options can be combining stuff or be creative with some stuff to either impale, smash, run over, burn and a lot more the bad guy. Interesting art style Decent game playBlood and gore could have been made a little bit better and more intense. I mean it looks good, but its to bad that there is so much blood and when you look at the body it has taken no damage. I would recommend this game to people who like puzzle games. To people who is more for the action thrilled game with intese combat and that kind of stuff. THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.

Interesting puzzle idea, but suffers from high repetitiveness and slightly finnicky controls. Not recommended.Kill The Bad Guy has an interesting premise, with you trying to use the few interactive elements in this puzzle to eliminate a person in such a way to make it look like an accident.I found the game fun for about an hour, before I got really bored. The levels give you not too much creative freedom. Usually there are usually only one or two ways to kill the bad guy. There was so much potential there!The controls are a bit finnicky, especially when you move sliders and try to do precision aiming with them.What stopped me playing the game any further is the high repetiveness of the levels. The just feel all the same. Even more so, because I have to do exactly what was planned by the devs. This really takes out the fun of this game. "

 Controls are a little clunky but they can be overcome. Minimalist asthetic, the look is cool. Tonnes of blood. Some puzzles can be pretty tough to figure out, partly by design and partly due to obscure and strange associations.A bunch of fun and well worth the price.  If you are still not sure, try the demo.7/10			"

Note: This review was written and published before the inclusion of the game's multiplayer feature and thus it is not mentioned throughout.Watching over a man in a garish yellow jacket and a bullseye mask while rigging various death traps conveniently placed into his path, one might feel like a god. Granted, a god that will ultimately be faced with ending the life of a being lesser than itself in order to proceed, but a god all the same.That's the basic premise of Kill The Bad Guy. It's a game where you'll be doing little else than what it says on the tin.Certainly there's some degree of enjoyment in the act of killing what the game builds up to be one of many comically exaggerated abominations toward humanity. Whether it be smashing them with an oncoming vehicle to see their body flying off into the distance or diverting their path so that they just happen to pass beneath a sign sharp enough to decapitate them. The array of options afforded to accomplishing the core goal varies from level to level, with some feeling almost depressingly empty at times.What the game lacks in an abundance of diversity, it attempts to compensate for by offering a stylized presentation and a (sometimes dark) sense of humor. The spare use of color in the world opens up the possibility to have memorable death tableaus, with the previously white surroundings often becoming awash with the blood of a given bad guy. Think of it as a literal take on the opening credit sequence from the film adaptation of American Psycho. Much of the game's intended humor comes in the form of flavor text provided for each of the game's 60 or so bad guys. Many are parodies of real world figures (Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Justin Bieber, etc.) with equally fictionalized takes on their criminal acts or atrocities, as the case may warrant.For all its style, humor and simple yet deceptively complex premise, Kill The Bad Guy suffers from a number of flaws. Chief among them being a woefully inadequate and frustrating camera system, an interface that often hinders more than it helps and AI that seems prone to random outbursts.Overall, Kill The Bad Guy is interesting, violent to an absurd degree and often challenging (though at times for the wrong reasons) but becomes repetitive far too quickly. Some questionable design choices and lingering bugs aside - you have a game that, once finished entirely, won't leave you with a strong desire to replay it.			"

												The review I did in full @ http://www.heypoorplayer.com/2014/06/killed-bad-guy-watching-porn/Well hello kiddies! Are you looking for a fun game that marches to the beat of a different drum? One that allows you to use that big ‘ole brain sack of yours to punish the evil doers of the world? Are you willing to operate above the law to get these guys? Well that is exactly what Exkee’s Kill The Bad Guy game will let you do. It’s already out now on Steam for PC, Mac and Linux. What is even better is that it does not even require really big balls on your machine to run either. Which is great for those who may not get into much PC gaming but would like to have a few fun little titles on their machines to give their controllers a rest and work out their underworked lonely mice that some of us seem to forget about. It crosses genres a bit in being a rag-doll physics based puzzler/strategy game…..Oh and I was dead serious I did kill the bad guy while he was watching porn…I really liked this game a lot and it brings some really good things to the table. Ok now upon first booting up the game I was treated to a really catchy hip-hop title track for the menu screen which made me crank up my volume a little higher, and the background music for levels continues the enjoyably catchy trend with a down tempo number that’s a bit reminiscent of some of the tunes you would hear in a 60s era spy flick which sets the mood very nice.The game is really pleasing on the eyes too with its really nice monochromatic silhouettes of the buildings, yellow shirted villains, innocents bystanders, surveillance cameras, as well interactive objects are all rendered completely black, and last but not least the oh so satisfying red blood stain left after you do your job proper. The graphics are simple but in my opinion its a good way. When you put them all together you are upon first glance are viewing what appears to be a harmonious utopia that is of course until you leave the town painted with the blood of the guilty.Ok. So let’s start to get a bit deeper into the game. There are 60 main missions and 6 bonus missions to unlock. Each mission has 5 objectives: of course there is the primary objective of killing the bad guy, a secondary mission you have to figure out by a clue given in the pre-mission dossier/or for those who aren’t good with riddles, through random experimentation with a levels interactive elements, kill the villain in the first day of the operation, finding the villain’s hidden passport in each level, and final objective is to quickly catch his tooth which goes airborne usually really far and very fast when you kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The game can be controlled by the mouse exclusively but you can also control via keyboard with a default secondary layout or configure your own control preferences. The first few missions are relatively simple with very obvious ways to take out your target and usually very quickly. Before each mission you’re a presented with a dossier file on the bad guy in which you are targeting. This may seem a bit odd but this was my favorite part of the game to be honest. Each mission file was written very cleverly most times parodying vile people pulled right from news articles and tabloid both current and past with very effective and humorous tongue in cheek humor (and since I am a bit of a news junkie this really made me happy). Then after a completing a slew of missions you a treated with a cut scene advancing the story and reminding you of your purpose. Once you begin finally start the game you will quickly notice the bad guy strolling through town and will be travelling a pretty repetitive path (though a few times he changed it up randomly which caught me of guard) through that particular part of whichever city he or she may be hiding out in, and if he leaves before your masterful plans of assassination are able to be put in motion and you can’t taking his life a day passes…and you have to try again which means this objective is now lost. Fear not though because you can easily repeat every mission with your unlocked achievements already still unlocked for you in your menu screen. The first few missions also occasionally give you some hints on how get stuff done, interact with objects or on how to control the game, as well as what the icons in the gameplay screen do. Like clicking on the eye shows you the bad guys field of vision, which is important because if he you constructing something he thinks is even remotely dangerous or of suspect he will quickly flee and you will be rewarded with a mission failed screen. Other interactive icons allow you to pause the game and take a look at that particular map to try and make your gameplan, there is also a speed up time icon which is set at 1x by default and can also be toggled to 2x and 4x speeds. The display up top features an icon of the bad guy which when clicked immediately centers the screen on the missions target, there are also icons that indicate if you have achieved you alternate objectives.As is with most games the further in the more complicated it becomes to take the bad guy out, as well as more and more interactive items become usable to kill your target. Remember in each mission you are trying to make it look like an accident so keep that in mind. Eventually after you complete a good amount of mission innocent people begin to show up wandering through your target sites, police are on patrol, surveillance cameras watching, and the Bad Guy’s bodyguards must never suspect you…If any of these see you take the bad guy out it’s an instant fail the mission.For those gamers who are into being an exhibitionist there is the ability to upload and share your favorite kills with your friends and the whole damn interwebz if you so desire. In fact right in the settings there is a direct sign in option to Twitch for those who use it. Other community features are that the game has are Steam Achievements, Steam Leaderboards, as well as Steam Trading CardsIt is the perfect game when you only have a very small window of time to get some gaming in. Most levels can be finished in a few short minutes. You get to have some fun, kills some time and quickly run off to do what you must. You not left having to run off and be on some huge plot cliffhanger wishing you could have watched that 10 minute cinematic cut scene and having had venture through that dungeon which seemed like it took half the day to get the super laser sword of doom.Ok….now for what really irked me in this game. There is really nothing in the game that tells you what the interactive objects do minus a few sparse exceptions…or what objects needed to be/or could be combined with other ones…and there were a few times I got very annoyed and spent way to long trying to figure out how to activate a trap or what I needed to combine to what to get the job done efficiently. And this happened every few levels pretty regularly. This really held back wanting to play for long periods of time as I was becoming somewhat frequent for me. There some missions I would end up wasting multiple days on me trying to get items to do things they were not even capable of doing. Also there were some traps I couldn’t really identify…so I had no idea what I was supposed to do with it. And it is not because of it appearing too small on my screen. I am playing on a monitor that is very large in 1920 x 1080 on the highest possible graphics settings here.So the game isn’t perfect but it is still a lot of fun. It’s a great little time killer that will make laugh and some perhaps if you are the faint of heart wince a bit. It’s also pretty entertaining to watch as well. A few of my pals sat here and laughed over my shoulder for some of the kills for quite a while. I do hope that some of my gripes might be addressed in an update patch perhaps in the future if the team is able.I gave the game 3.5/5.0			"

												Let's be honest, with the current price tag this game is a bad dissapointment. Basically it's nothing more than a puzle game and not a creative killing game. The background of the victims doesn't mean a thing either, which would have been a nice addition if you could use their own crimes against them.On the other hand, it's well made. The graphics are good, the sound is acceptable and there's a bit of replay value. Not much, but there's.Would I buy this game again, with the information I've got after buying and playing? That's a bit of a paradox, but no, I wouldn't buy it.The reason for it is the price and the plane puzzling aspect of the game. I was hoping for a little Garry's MOD massacre style game, but, that's not going to happen.			"

												Did you ever wish you could be god? Or the grim reaper?That you could punish bad people?Well, here's your chance.Bad guys are in the streets and you have to kill them BUT it has to look like an accident.So block his road, make him take another one, pour some gasoline, shoot something to ignite the fire and watch the bad guy burn!It's like an episode of final destination. The target will be smashed, burned, cut into pieces and a lot more. It's your decision!Pros:+ nice graphic style+ good gameplay+ good difficulty level+ achievements+ trading cards+ fun+ blood+ direct stream to twitch possibleCons:- Sometimes the angle makes it more difficult as it is.Give it a try, especially when it's on sale!

												This game was the reason I paid more than $1 for the recent Humble Weekly Bundle, and frankly, I am not too thrilled about this fact.Maybe I should start paying attention to the preview videos and not automatically assume that a game will be fun after skimming through the product page and seeing ""7/10 – Gamespot"". (IGN weren't available for a quick 11/10 quote?)The gameplay is incredibly shallow for a game that can be roughly identified as ""Rube Goldberg""-style. You'd think the game developers would seize the opportunity to use dark humor wherever possible, and sure enough, they did... In the corniest  way imaginable...God forbid anybody buys this at the full price...P.S. The title/theme song... -_-			"

												It's a puzzle game where you try to kill the bad guy with rube goldberg-esque methods. It has a great visual aesthetic and soundtrack, but is hampered by a few design issues. First, this is a mobile port with touch-oriented controls that could have improved with pc-centric controls. The camera is locked into an isometric position, meaning that it is sometimes hard to line up the traps to score a kill. Lastly is that the NPC view fields are bigger than the UI indicates. Several times my kill was seen by a civilian or camera that should not have been able to see it. I reccomend against this unless you are not deterred by poor controls.			"

												This black humor puzzle game is quite repetitive: in each mission you have to ""kill  the bad guy"" by means of some object, or a combination of objects in the scenery.You have to set up a trap and in later level you have to force the bad guy to fall in the trap when no witness/CCTV is watching (also you must not kill anyone but the bad guy). The problem with this game is that is not so hard to figure out how to set up the trap, but - because of cartoon physics and poor controller - you may fail to actually make the trap work. This become more and more frustrating in later levels.			"

												THE GAMENEGATIVE: The game is too short and is always really restricting your liberties : you can't even chose how to kill ""the Bad Guys"", except in the multi-player. Also, the multi-player has loads of bugs, kind of freezing and loads of aura-kills.POSITIVE: The concept of the game is not so bad : you need to create your own justice and kill all the bad guys. You have a little selection of languages and the game is not hungry in memory.THE GRAPHICSThey're not bad but not so good. White & Black are the most used colors in here. Only the blood and ""the Bad Guys"" are well made. Even with an high perfomance engine...CONCLUSIONOnly buy this game at the special offers, if you already know (a bit) the game and if you're just going to play for maximum 5 hours. After that, it's really boring.			"

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. I think most people wil be disapointed in the game at full price.However I still recomend the game. If you catch this game on a steam sale for $2 or less or as part of a humble bundle you will enjoy it for a short period of time.How much you enjoy it will depend on your pain tolerance. There is a lot to like here. The concept is funny and the overall design though simple is effective for what is being conveyed.Where the game falls apart is the controls and the almost random quality of the levels. Some will be so stupidly simple you will be done in seconds. Others will take you 10 minutes to figure out what you can and can't click on. And they aren't in any particular order. You'll be faced with interesting and satisfying followed by frustratingly hard followed by brain dead simple and so on.The music also gets tired and repetitive.If you like puzzle games this is worth picking up on sale. There's a couple hours of brain teasers for the average puzzle player packed into this. And for the hardcore perfectionist or over achiever there's secondary objectives you can bang your head against for even longer. Oh and if you don't like puzzle games, stay far far away. Though the screenshots and pictures may make it look like there's a world to explore: there isn't. It's a moving puzzle box that you have to solve with traps, not an open world of any kind.Anyway I paid under $1 for it as part of a humble bundle and enjoyed it for almost 2 hours which is what it took me to finish all the levels with the most basic requirements. I'm not enough of a perfectionist to try and play through them for all the secondary objectives.			"

I only played this game for 10 minutes...and I will DEFINITELY be playing it again.GameplayDeceptively simple! With varying degrees of difficulty, you will catch on quickly - or you will think you have, but it's so challenging to get everything just right to get a level completely finished.  This leads you to play through a level then play through it again. Why did I only need 10 minutes and three levels to write this review? Simply put:  This game is a lot of friggin' fun.  It's simple, but very cleverly designed and tricky at the same time. The LooksThe graphics are simplistic, and in this case it's not a bad thing. Some games give me motion sickness or assault your eyes with very convoluded graphics. Not the case with this one. The animation is elegant, you can clearly see everything in front of you, and yet it still makes you laugh every time you kill the bad guy. The title is apt. Fun FactorThis is one of the two strongest points of this game that I'm going to make - the fun factor is so high, not only from the descriptions of the bad guys (garbage collection and hazardous waste disposal), but to the screams when they get crushed. As I said, I may not have played it very long yet, but I'm keeping it installed - I don't do that for very many games, so if you look back here in a week, chances are I will have played it for longer. The game is easy to pick up, as I said before, but challenging to master. The learning curve isn't steep, but it is challenging enough to make you think and concentrate. The SoundtrackIf you look at my other reviews, you will see that I often critique soundtracks of indie games, and games in general. This game has a soundtrack that makes it worth the full asking price. I feel that strongly about this one. The soundtrack is fantastic, from the opening theme, to the field recording ambient sounds, to the secret-agent style ""win"" fanfare. It a modern twist on classic tropes that really add to the atmosphere and hilarity of the game. The soundtrack music, the sound effects, and the atmospheric ambience gets a flat out 101% A+ from me, and I'm very hard to please when it comes to this.  Conclusion  I'm going to choose this as a curation for my group, because eXkee definitely deserves the exposure. My library is gigantic, and it can sometimes take me awhile to get around to playing everything. I wish I had played this sooner, because I highly enjoy it. Easily, 9/10, and I look forward to seeking out more titles by eXkee. If the graphics, gameplay, and unique take on classic set ups is present in a fraction of them, I will consider it money well spent. Go buy it, play it, turn your speakers up, and enjoy. Or else, you might end up being the bad guy. Absolutely recommended.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, it was so much fun at the beginning then it got more complicated and i like that, i see people complaining about it which is dumb, they wanted this game to be easier which is ridiculous but anyways my main issue is that the game has some bugs in order to get some achievements and that it's really frustrating, the worst achievement is the one where you have to play the game 35 hours, i completed the game with all the stars before that time, that was fine, i had to farm the rest of the achievements, i finished farming the achievements and according to steam i have 40+ hours, ok ok, ill try to get a better score in some levels but now i been playing this game for 47 damn hours!!! no achievements, im sick of this game i wish i never bought it!

There is no real puzzles nor strategy, as you just have to try again and again. It get interesting in some point, but you will get bored after an hour.No voice over. No soundtrack good enough to make you continue playing. Its like you are hearing something from another application.physics is clunky, you might fail or succeed in same way.

												Kill the Bad Guy is a physics-based puzzle game in which you try to kill the bad guy  without scaring him off and do it in the shortest amount of time. There are different objects to use each level to set traps with, leading to his demise. The first few levels are kind of fun, but the game gets repetitive real quick. The graphics look nice, controls well, but it just doesn't do enough to keep me entertained. Its not a horrible game, just not for me. 5/10			"

												Honestly, i thought this was guna be good from the trailers, giving u multiple and hilarious ways of killing the 'bad guy' making it to a sort of 3d flakboy game. Except this is nothing like that, this is a puzzle game where your given a door and told to unlock it, and the single key is on the table right next to u. There is no challenge to this other than trying to see what an object will do, which after the first few levels, u get what will happen. It is suppose to be try and find a clever way to kill the 'bad guy' and each time u dont manage it takes another day to do so, except u can restart the challenge at any point no reprocutions kill him first day easily coz uv already seen that theres one car and he walks in front of it at which point u rev the engine.....done. This isnt creative and interesting its a very very bad 'puzzle' game where its already solved for you, might as well get  a childrens dot to dot thats been filled in, would get more enjoyment out of it than this. I serious do not recommend this to anyone, not even people looking for an easy game to pass the time because there is nothing to this, its boring, simple and plain. even the levels are just white buldings with white floor with 3 black objects represnting things u can move which are the only things to do in order to complete the level. This is seriously bad and i hope no body is fooled into buying this game			"

												First I want to say the point in the game is to use interactable items in the environment to do something to kill the bad guy. Ex. starting a car to crash into him, or swinging a wrecking ball into him.I'm afraid I just don't personally LOVE this game, mostly because its levels are just REALLY hard. It will often give you items and doesn't tell you very well how to use them, and sometimes you don't even know you CAN use them. Because of this, I can't really even get past the third level.Of course, there IS a way past the levels, it's just extremely hard (to me), and I dunno what I'm doing in this game, so what I've said is all I can tell you. I would suggest downloading the demo to decide for yourself. I just jumped ahead and bought the full game because it was on sale and looked good.so 6/10 wud smash a dude with a wrecking ball agin			"

												Update----------Quite funny that the developers felt inclined to vote my review down (en mass) on the basis that they thought it was their god-given right to have a higher score just because it was an indie game. Well I'll tell you right now that you can ♥♥♥♥ right off! Being categorised as an indie game doesn't automatically entitle you to any privileges.Indie games should be created in such a way that they incorporate lots of insightful little things despite them lacking the necessary funds, and if you disagree with the fact that in spite of this I'm still critical of what is essentially a terribly boring little game, then you are seriously disillusioned and deserve absolutely nothing from this.Original review:Thumbs down doesn't necessarily make this a poor game, but all things considered there are more negatives than positives. Kill The Bad Guy is a quirky physics-based puzzle game that's interesting at first, but which gets terribly boring very quickly.Good points:- Stylish graphics- Fun gameplay (for the first hour)- Lots of levels- Quite funny in partsBad Points:- Not always clear what needs to be done- Counter-intuitive because the artistic (though admittedly bland and sparsely textured) levels inhibit the player's ability to relate to the real world references jokingly made within the game; the player cannot be endeared towards it when the targets all look the same- Music won't be to everyone's liking- Controls are totally rubbish and also counter-intuitive. Tip to the developer - play Kingdom Elemental for an idea on how it should roughly be done- Real world references may be in bad tasteMy video review:

												Not what I really imagined.It gives the impression of being able to do any singular act or multitude of acts to eliminate a target in a variety of settings, when in reality each level is more or less staged with usually no more that two possible ways to kill the target. Most often, only one real way.On the upside, I've heard there's an insane amount of levels, the banter about each target before the level is decently funny, and finally, there are some difficult-to-spot collectibles that add gameplay.All in all, I payed like a dollar for it during Summer Sale and even regret THAT. I would have rather put it toward another game.			"
