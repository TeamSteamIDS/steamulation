												[Edit: Formatting]If your grew up in the 90s and you had a decent computer, chances are you had played or at least heard of a game called The Incredible Machine. It was a game that asked you to, for example, toast some breads using bombs, lasers, switches, conveyor belts, etc, in a Rube Goldberg style. The idea was novel and the game contributed to hours and hours of fun, even though I was too young to understand much of it.Then few years later, another similar game called The Incredible Toon Machine came out, which from what I remember, added a few animals like Al the cat and Sid the mouse. It was not officially part of the series; everything looked more cartoonish, but I still spent even more hours blowing stuff up. I was older (therefore wiser), and it was still in the 90s.Toon Machine was the last game in the series I played. Fans like me have waited many, many years for a remake of this classic game. Imagine my joy when I saw Contraption Maker on Steam, made by none other than the creators of the original TIM.The game itself has over 100 official puzzles, not to mention the plethora of user-made puzzles on Steam Workshop. The developer continues to update the game with new stuff, and the puzzles are challenging. They may seem easy in the beginning, but as you go through them, especially in the medium and hard section, you may find yourself pulling your hair when you cannot toast those breads after 20 tries.In short,* if you had played The Incredible Machine and loved it, you will very easily love Contraption Maker.* if you (god forbid) had not played or heard of TIM before, but for some reason you like toasting breads with bombs and lasers, you will very easily love Contraption Maker.* if you had not played or heard of TIM before, and don't like Rube Goldberg machine, then I regret to tell you that you are missing out the fun and want to thank you for reading my review anyway.[/list]As an extra motivation, you will get two copies when you buy now. Give it to your buddy and let them toast some breads!With bombs and lasers! "

												Many years ago, PC gaming was different.  Electronic Arts was still the young Anakin Skywalker of gaming, not yet the Darth Vader of corporate exploitation and greed.  You had to learn DOS, to manage your EMS and XMS, and to properly set the jumpers of your sound card (if you had one) to match the IRQ settings in your config.sys.  And your 150 MB hard drive had more space than you could ever fill.In those days I played ""The Incredible Machine.""  And it was.  Incredible, that is.  One of the earliest sandbox games, it gave us a canvas for infinite creativity that was loaded with personality and possibility.  Then they made some more of them.  Then TIM just sort of disappeared.Now it's back.  And even though the game is no longer (capital i) Incredible, it's still just as incredible.  So if you loved the early 1990s original, buying this should be a given.  If you're too young, or just weren't paying attention, and missed The Incredible Machine, do yourself a favor and buy Contraption Maker anyway.  It's a great time to jump in.  It's a puzzle game for people who don't like puzzle games, as well as those who do.  It's great for young children, older children, and very, very old children (i.e. ""adults"").  It's an exercise in creativity without a point, just creativity for its own sake.Here's the basic premise:You normally [do X mundane, manual task] with [Y amount of effort] in [Z amount of time].  If C = Coolness, completing tasks the normal way would be C/100.  But if you could automate [X task] by spending Y+E amount of Effort in Z*1,000 amount of time, would C go through the roof!?  Yes!  It WOULD!  So if X = ""turn on a flashlight,"" Y = ""press a switch,"" Z = 0.25 seconds, and C = 0.1 (which is to say ""hardly cool at all"")... well, let's just say by adding a mouse, a bowling ball, a laser, some rubber bands, a hundred feet of pipe, and a boxing glove you can make turning on a flashlight the coolest thing you'll do all week.

								The classic The Incredible Machine game is getting a reboot!Contraption Maker is played exactly similar to the TIM series. You solve a puzzle by placing certain parts in the work area and try to do things such as popping a balloon, getting a person or mouse home, or even completing a large list of objectives involving cooking appliances.Did some official puzzles and know how the game works? Great, now you can create your own puzzles or automatically solving contraptions for the whole Steam Community to see. Anyone who was a fan of the orginal TIM games will certain enjoy this reboot. Even though the pyhsics aren't the same and most parts have a redesign. This game will for certain bring back those wonderful memories of having Mel being eaten by Edison Crocodile. *Edison's snicker*			"

								The puzzles seem a bit simple so far. As a player of the incredible machine, however, it's still well worth the full price of $15. BUY IT AND PLAY IT NOW!Steam workshop support means that even after the game is complete/released, the community can continue to create puzzles. I only hope they add some more parts for us. I don't usually say this, but even a series of cheap (read: $1) DLCs would be welcome here, with more parts and puzzles after the game is released. A limited number of parts means a limited amount of replayability.			"

I said I would never write another game ""review"", but the option to  publish your recorded game directly to Youtube or download it and edit for Youtube is great.There is also an extra copy to gift to a friend ( 2 copies 1 price )I am sure I will be playing this offline on my laptop when  I am away and cannot acess the internet.

												The original creators of The Incredible Machine have returned to bring a childhood favorite back from the dead. SO MUCH YES.The Incredible Machine is a physics puzzle game. It's not just just any physics puzzle game, though; it was the first! Before Scribblenauts, before World of Goo, before Garry's Mod, even before all those crazy flash games on Newgrounds, it was The Incredible Machine that let gamers discover the joy of physics sandbox chaos. Many hours of fun were had feeding tiny children to alligators and dropping huge piles of cats onto trampolines. The puzzles themselves were sublime, teaching foresight and out-of-the-box thinking in ways that were unheard of at the time. I'd go so far as to say that The Incredible Machine 3 is probably my top pick for best puzzle game of all time.There have been clones and copycats over the years with varying levels of quality (Bad Rats, anyone?), but now you don't have to settle for imitations! This is the same game as it was 20 years ago, only with a new name and a fresh coat of HD paint it so greatly deserved. All the old machine parts are back, puzzle size and complexity is UNLIMITED, and Steam Workshop integration means that the world can see the puzzles you make (rather than just whatever friends or family you could trick into playing your custom puzzle). The music is almost as good as the old soundtracks, and just try not to shed a tear of nostalgia when you clear a puzzle and hear ""whew!""The interface still has some annoying kinks to work out, and some of the animal animations are atrociously ugly, but overall this is an amazing effort and deserves the time and attention of any puzzle gamers, especially those who enjoy programming-style games.I'll tell you what, I'm really loving this fad of ridiculously old puzzle games being brought back by their original creators. So besides this, we now have Chip's Challenge back as Chuck's Challenge, DROD is still going strong, Shadowgate just got a modern remake... what's next? Boulder Dash? LaserTank? Dr. Brain? ...Oh my god, Dr. Brain. Somebody please bring Dr. Brain back. Get a kickstarter going or something. Now. I'm serious.			"

												I bought this game because I enjoyed ""The Incredible Machine"" when I was a kid, and since then, these kinds of games have always appealed to me, although I was never able to find one which matched it in quality. This was on sale for only a quid, so I took a chance on it. I was amazed at its quality: The music is great, the mechanics were excellent, the UI is nicely designed and the graphics are nice as well. I was shocked, I did not expect this game to be good.I then looked up the company who made it and it all made sense. They're the same people who made ""The Incredible Machine"" in the first place! I was so impressed by how good this game is that I picked up another 5 copies to give to people in the future. I really, really hope they do a big DLC. They do free updates, but I'd be more than willing to pay money for a lot more puzzles. Not even new components, just new puzzles would be fine. Steam workshop integration is a huge bonus and means that you never really run out of levels anyway - I just prefer official ones as they're more consistent in difficulty and quality. Achievement integration would be hugely appreciated as well, this game has potential to use achievements in the way they were intended: For doing crazy things which the game doesn't actually require you to do at all.Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone.

								I remember playing The Incredible Machines in my school days. I really enjoyed the game back then and I always wondered why there are no modern games like that. Well, now there is Contraption Maker. Only now it's my 6 years old son who has spent more than hundred hours playing it and will surely spend much more.This game offers exactly what that old classic offered - you can solve pre-designed puzzles or create your own. Since this is not the finished product, there are not too many pre-desined puzzles, although more are being added as the time goes. The creation part however is already a lot of fun. Conclusion: this game is well made and I trust it to become even better as development continues. My son loves it and I respect it for helping develop his creativity and problem-solving in a fun way.			"

												There was a time, I swear to you this is true, that ""video games"" were ""core gamer"" without knowing what that meant, intelligent, puzzling, and awesome. Games are still awesome. In fact they have gotten riduclous in their awesomeness. However, what I like isn't the same thing that I would let my child(ren) play. Thus far Contraption Maker is definitly part of that Venn Diagram. Overalapping old school ""spiritual succussion"", intelligent puzzle, fun animations, and some ""core gamer"" sensibilities. Build the perfect rube goldberg. Free the mouse, Feed the dog. Just don't do it simply....use a laser, a floating ballon, some switches, maybe a pulley and a treadmill. Sound the least bit interesting? Then you know you're in the right place.			"

												Do you remember those really entertaining contraption games when you were younger? This game tops them all. Contraption Maker is developed by the same people who were behind the legendary The Incredible Machine series, it brings back those awesome memories from over 15 years ago where you really had to test your imagination to accomplish the goals set out for you. I'm really glad to see a successor to The Incredible Machine and that the team behind Contraption Maker are still capable of doing what they do best. With the addition of the Steam Workshop, Contraption Maker has tons of content available to provide several hours of game play and gives you an opportunity to test your creativity and share it with others.When you pick up this game, you get an additional copy to do with as you please, I gave mine to my youngest brother as he used to play the original as much as I did.

												Contraption Maker is the brilliant successor to the nostalgic Incredible Machine series, and it proves itself rightfully so. Contraption maker not only modernizes what was already an outstanding concept, but expands on it even further. The puzzles that were presented have been challenging, but fair all the way through. The developers say you'll find those big ""aha!"" moments while thinking through each contraption instead of relying on pixel perfect placement solutions, and they are absolutely right. This is a puzzle game done exceptionally well, and with the ever present make mode there is so much more you can create. This is a perfect game for veterans of Incredible Machine and newcomers alike; if you enjoy Rube Goldberg inspired puzzles and wacky contraptions then you will fall in love with this game easily.These are just personal suggestions myself, but I believe if Contraption Maker were to add more content in the future, I would highly suggest some things like a wacky voice over guy like in the original installments, as well as include the music from the older games, such as Return of the Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions.

												Finally a successor to the The Incredible Machine (TIM) series! If you played TIM, buy this! If you like puzzles, buy this! If you like throwing cats with deadpan faces off the screen, buy this! Even without going on sale, the game has quite a bit of content you don't have to worry about not getting your money's worth, unless you're not into this type of game at all. I got this for the equivalent of 0.50 USD during Summer Sale 2015. That is such a freaking steal that I am now a professional thief.Mechanics:There are many new parts that were added in this game. Just to name a few, you now have Tinker the dog, as well as many variations of Tim (Sledding? Walking? Snowball-throwing?). The variations in Tim, in particular, makes sense as Tim used to just be the cannon fodder that you threw everywhere with boxing gloves, springs, anti-gravity pads, as well as getting him stuck on a blimp, all with the aim of getting him back to his house. This increases the number of ways you can throw cats with deadpan faces off the screen.Many parts can now be adjusted to have their area of effect changed. For example, the scissors used to be something that can only be placed horizontally, but now it can be rotated 360 degrees. You can also choose at what angle you wish the kettle to blow an object. All these improvements combine to make the game deeper and more flexible.You also no longer have to struggle with placement of objects. There were some puzzles where you had to adjust your objects by the pixel so that they would get contact in the exact right spot and respond to each other. That's no longer the case here. The hitbox is bigger now, which does not make the game easier, though it does make it much less frustrating. You no longer have to worry about the stupid candle not being in the exact right spot to launch the rocket. Also on the topic of mechanics, the addition of a fast-forward button is simply genius. There have been many times in TIM where puzzles take more than 15-30 seconds to execute in its entirety. Combined with the earlier-mentioned problem of object detection, it can be extremely annoying. This solves that problem, and can also save you time if you're a veteran player wishing to blow past the easy levels. Art and Sound:This may just be the nostalgia speaking, but The Incredible Machine series had a very engaging soundtrack, whether it was the MIDI or the upgraded non-MIDI version. CM's do not stand out particularly as very good compositions, and there are a few pieces of music that are slightly grating (like the main theme). Having said that, I must qualify that CM's soundtrack is actually decent, just not as good as TIM's.Next, the art style of CM is very different from TIM. While TIM goes for a clean and flat look (likely an artifact of the technological restrictions at the time), CM has a more ""shaded"" style of art which is very obvious on certain objects like Tinker the dog. I slightly prefer TIM's art style, but I think the departure from that art style is an attempt to distant the game from the original series, which is not a bad idea at all. What developer wishes their game to only be referred to as a clone of another game? I still find the new art style a little jarring, but I'm sure it's just a matter of getting used to it.TIM had its own system of map sharing that was later discontinued. Now that CM is launched on a reliable platform like Steam, I think it's safe to say that custom map support won't be an issue further down the road, which will mean there's a whole lot of content out there even after you're done with the original puzzles. Community engagement is also at an all-time high.Miscellaneous:After all that, CM does have its own shortcomings. The level editor has categorized all the objects with the aim of making it easy to find parts. However, imagine my annoyance when it took me 5 minutes to realize that the anti-gravity pad was actually not part of any of the categories, and had to be accessed by viewing all the parts.The game has also decided to opt to include a zoom and pan feature. This is more likely an accessibility feature than anything else, however, the OCD in me is very disturbed by the fact that you can pan the level even without zooming, and you end up with black borders on the side.Summary:In summary, despite some questionable decisions, CM has made many refinements to mechanics that TIM got wrong. Fast-forward, more consistent object interactions, and almost-assured longevity of the game due to the its community makes this an easy recommend. I give Contraption Maker a 8.5 cats with deadpan faces out of 10.It is a pity CM was kind of an under-the-radar release. I look forward to seeing CM flourish as its own series.			"

												When I was a kid, I loved that old predecessor of this game. So I decided to pick it as soon as it is on a sale (basically because I doubted the quality of the game. The mechanics are old and trusted but still... I was affraid to see a soulless clone). Happily, this one brought me a crazy level of excitement and (even!) laughings! The game is awesome and catchy. Once I laucnhed it to test for a while, I realised I have played like 80 minutes or something. And Contraption Maker didn't bore me at all. The missions are set in a very clever way, so each one is a bit harder then the previous, but not too much. You actually learn to play it step by step. The puzzles are interesting and (the main thing!) really really different. I guess their puzzle designer is a nice guy with a good sense of humor. Besided, every puzzle has some kind of a plot, so you even start to sympathyse some characters (My fav is Waldo, what a gorgeous cat!).The game is simple and exciting, it is very light and kind, reminds me the most childish looney tunes cartoons. The music is awesome, and the controls are very intuitive. The only thing I noticed is a small little difference between designs of some elements and characters, but that's not a problem at all, just noticed.I've picked it for 0.99 on a sale and even recieved an extra copy to give some of my friends. I believe it would be an awesome present.Hardly recommended. If you are lucky to see it on a huge sale, take it without any doubt. I am not a fan of puzzle games, but this one is awesome even for people like me.			"

""The Incredible Machine rethought""Contraption Maker is a physics puzzle flashgame as a remake of the famous game series from the 90ies. It contains all the cool stuff from before and even more. You solve puzzles mostly in a chain reaction with mechanics, aerodynamics, electrics, optics, explosives and hamsters in a running wheel - yes hamsters to reach the goal.They also developed some unique characters like Toolman Tim, Waldo the cat, Tinker the dog, Dozer the bulldog and Milton the mouse. The puzzle description stories are sometimes quite funny to read. Contraption Maker is an unbelieveable huge package of physics puzzle stuff. There's really a whole bunch of content to discover, like 220+ official puzzle levels Seasonal puzzles In-game workshop + loads of generated user content (puzzles & contraptions) In-game solution movie record tool + link to your Youtube account  Puzzle programming language editor for complex logics ... and it's still raising. Most fun was to find the goofy solutions on some levels. So the game is definitely full worth its price.			"

The game is not intuitive. So you will want to start off on easy and learn your way to medium.You will discover there is more than one solutions to each task.

Can do and did. Also, you can check out the ""developers"" solution to compare after you have completed a puzzle.The graphics are kind of...elementary...but the game play more than makes up for it.

Early Access Review
								Whether you like the great feeling of solving seemingly complex Rube-Goldberg puzzles or simply having a physics sandbox (of sorts) to play with, Contraption Maker is a delightful addition to anyone's Steam Library. Even in its Alpha state, the game already has tons of building parts, many of them from the legacy The Incredible Machine series (also developed by the awesome team that made this!), and a few new ones, too.Some parts are still lacking proper art, but that's not something you should worry about - Contraption Maker is still in development, and many things in game can't be considered 'final'. Moreover, I think the developers have stated that skinning support will be available at some point in the future. Anyway, it is at gameplay that this title really excels! Playing with explosives, blimps and even alligators is completely safe here, not to mention plenty of fun. :)The new Alpha releases have brought a significant amount of content to the game, since the first one. New parts, bug fixes, some amazing pieces of soundtrack (which is great, as the original The Incredible Machine had excellent tunes) and even a working multiplayer mode! I see lots of potential here.All in all, would I recommend this game? Heck, yes! This is the kind of game I'd want my own kids to enjoy.Well, maybe if you really HATE puzzles and Rube-Goldberg machines you should stay away from this. Otherwise, do try Contraption Maker, it will be worth every penny you spend on it.			"

												This game is simple but fun and can get quite difficult. You start off with a stage with some goal, and some parts to help you make a contraption to reach that goal. Pretty simple stuff but it can get quite involved trying to figure out what exactly to do. The eureka feeling of knowing what to do and getting to the goal is always a great one. Well worth one's time if you enjoy these kinds of puzzle games.			"

												True to its predecessor, Contraption Maker is the modern incarnation of The Incredible Machines franchise. The core gameplay mechanics is faithfully preserved perhaps to a degree I would call that lacking in originality. Nevertheless, with the support of Steam Workshop, thousands of user-made puzzles constantly added give the game tremendous value and replayability. The devs are even kind enough to let it go on 90% off sale almost non-stop and give an extra copy to you once you have bought it. What more can I say? This is truly an unbeatable bargain for hours of fun for nostalgic gamers and families alike.			"

Early Access Review
								Whereas the Crazy Machines series (good in its own right) is best thought of as a reimagining of the classic The Incredible Machine series, Contraption Maker is a straight-up reboot of TIM.  Nearly everything from TIM2 (or 3.0, etc) is there, featuring an interface that'll be second nature to any old veterans of the game.  It also adds in a few new parts here and there that take better advantage of a more robust physics engine and some graphical and design improvements you'd expect for a modern version of an older game.Definitely worthwhile for any fan of the TIM series.  And even in its current unfinished state, well worth a look for anyone who wants to have fun designing virtual Rube Goldberg machines.			"

												Interested in a physics domino effect puzzle game: Do Y, to change X, to start Z, to finally perform Q type of puzzles? If so, or if you enjoy solving puzzles then check out Contraption Maker.Being familiar with The Incredible Machine, I picked this up to reminisce and have some fun with puzzles. Besides, a two for one!? That's great.For me the puzzles didn't get challenging until hard difficulty. Perhaps I was younger, however, I remember The Incredible Machine puzzles being much harder. Therefore, the previous difficulties seemed to just take time to put the pieces in place.Play time included about 8-9 hours for me to finish all the official puzzles. Played some of the Editor's Choice community mods and puzzles. There certainly is much more content if you factor in the community puzzles. However, one challenge is that the game fails to keep a progress of what community puzzles you've solved--unlike the official puzzles.With all that said, it's a great game, and I recommend it. Perhaps a 8/10. Support the developers if you'd like to see more of these types of options.Certainly have some fond memories of The Incredible Machine, so I'm pleased to see this released!			"

												Long ago, when I was but a wee lad, I played a game called The Incredible Machine as part of my schooling. Hours of my tutelage in the basement computer lab of my school were spent in blissful abandon playing that wonder of a game, comparing my elaborate constructions to my equally-enthralled pubescent minds, We were gods of all creation, and in our experimentation bonds of eternal friendship were erected alongside the craziest, most Goldbergian of useless designs. It was a fire of friendship that flared, roared, and fizzled away as we slowly grew apart.Now, in my twenties, apart from those pre-pubescent paragons of pointless perfection, the fire has been rekindled. This game is whimsical and childish enough to make you remember those happier childhood days without pandering to you. I experienced some minor technical difficulties (including a persistent drone on the title screen), but nothing to make the game unplayable. It's a lot of nostalgic fun. Get it when it comes on sale.			"

												It's an amazing game, akin to The Incredible Machine. With 140 official puzzles and 100 different parts available, you can create a huge variety of puzzles or just contraptions, should you prefer to do so. Furthermore, the Workshop integration ensures a vast amount of user-generated content is available as well.Short: If you liked TIM, you'll like this. I requires some creativity, but it's pretty fun to assembly complex machinery.The 1.0 release of the game is in comparison to the Early Access version very stable and has seen a lot of thorough testing which means you're getting a very mature title now. They've done a great job polishing the UI and the parts' graphics in the recent months.			"

												I played the original games in the 90's and had alot of fun with them.  I think Jeff Tunnell found a great niche and am so glad his Spotkin made a new one.It is okay, but feels like a phone / pad game, which is okay, but lacks something.  Multiplayer is an add-on and I am not sure why.Got this in a bundle and am super pleased with it at that level.  Not sure it is worth full price, unless you get the nostalgia of the series and are happy to see the king of the genre return, in a sea of weak pretenders (see some of my reviews of the copies).8/10 in a bundle5/10 at full price for long-time fans			"

												I did play TIM series decades ago and it brought back a lot of fun memories. The puzzles here, however, seem less thought out than TIM puzzles, and many of the levels (including hard levels) were easily beaten by exploiting the set up thus making the objective trivial to accomplish. It doesn't seem the items were used to their full potential to create a complex system either (I don't recall the trampoline being used at all).Many old TIM items are found here, there are new ones, but also some that don't exist anymore. One I do miss was the monkey on the bike where you pull the shade down revealing a banana then it would start pedaling, which is similar to one of the new items in this game, but without the ability to cancel the pedaling by impact i.e. dropping a cannonball on the monkey's head.tl;drI bought this game for $1.50 and it came with 2 copies.Puzzles were enjoyable but not very challenging.Replayability relies on the community as far as I can tell.7/10 (+2 Price, +2 Enjoyable, +1 Nostalgia, +1 Removed the pointless score system TIM had, +1 Ability to share puzzles with community)			"

												9.1/10 - A nostalgic Idea Executed Perfectly.Contraption maker is an Ode to Rube Goldberg and those amazing invention books we used to read as children. The puzzles are really fun and can be extremely challenging. You have to rely on a series of chain reactions to accomplish the puzzle. There are 54 tutorial puzzles, a campaign, a few thousand community maps and the ability to create your own contraptions. I’m still trying to get the multiplayer function to work. I will update you with my findings.It's worth the full $7 for sure! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												The ultimate Rube Goldberg Device maker. If, like me, you are fascinated by overcomplicated devices, this is the game for you. It has over a hundred puzzles, where an incomplete device is presented and you have to add pieces to reach a particular goal, and once these are completed, you are free to make your own contraptions or puzzles, or get many off Steam Workshop. However, it is quite expensive, so I'd recommend waiting for a sale unless you know you'll love this game.			"

**The written version:**I have to say that since the moment I discovered there is a remake of Incredible Machine being made by the same peeps that made it way back I was excited like a little baby and also cautious, because we all know how the remakes/sequels/etc. go right!?I fired this game up, a beautiful bright colourful menu with awesome music greeted me. Well this is starting great. I had little to no read about this game, haven't prepared and I just went for it as it was in my library. I fired up the tutorial sessions, and oh boy.. nostalgia punched me right in my face.I did finish the tutorial level in about 30 minutes, not letting my eyes go off the screen for a brief moment. This game is just addictive and plain fun. It's like 2D Gmod with awesome stuff like lasers, cannons, cheese, and much more. You didn't play the original Incredible Machine? Well no worries, you don't really have to! This game is great on its own (and even better if you know the original). The redesigned graphics are awesome and well fitting (apart from the cat animation that seemed weird to me), the music is creative, funny, positive and evoking a sense of playfulness. Everything is .. great!But thats not all. Its not just a polished refurbished Incredible Machine. THIS THING HAS WORKSHOP! You can create contraptions and puzzles for other people to play, and there's already over a 1000!!! That's something absolutely great and adds up so much more to this game and genre! This is something that was not possible during the time Incredible Machine was released and its just AWESOME.And that's not all! There's multiplayer! YOU CAN BUILD STUFF WITH UP TO 7 FRIENDS! Holy cow. I haven't had the chance to try the multiplayer out yet, because my friends don't own this yet (I will make them), but oh boy thats something I'm so much looking forward too.Are you looking for a game that can bend by your logic and creativity? Do you wanna create fun machines that act complicated but do silly stuff? Do you wanna laugh? Want a game for the whole family? Want something that you fire up at any time and you have something to do every time? WELL THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! (And that's not even the whole list of questions!)Pros+ Cute graphics+ Cute physics+ Workshop!+ Multiplayer :3+ Funny!+ Great music.+ LOT OF CONTENT+ Friendly and dedicated developers!!!!!!! (One of the VERY FEW successful early access games!)+ Nostalgia all the way! (if you played the original)+ For any age.Cons- Addictive (OH GOD IS THAT A CON?! Nah)			"

												I've never played The Incredible Machine, so no throwback memories for me on this one. The puzzles are very fun and creative. Although, the ""Hard"" puzzles go from a good challenge that's really fun to staring at the screen, placing random objects, and hoping for the best. I would say that these last puzzles aren't family friendly because you'll probably swear a lot.Once you finish the main puzzle sets, there's always the workshop puzzles, or you can make your own puzzles and/or contraptions, which means limitless gameplay.It would be nice if there was an option to return to where you left off rather than having to scroll through to find your first unfinished puzzle.

								I remember spending hundreds, if not thousands of hours of my life playing the original ""The Incredible Machine"" games.So when I heard that the original developers were remaking it, with a fresh coat of HD paint and a new - and impressive-  physics engine, I had to buy it.So far, I'm not disappointed - Quite the opposite. I'm giddy with nostalgia.If you played the originals, and found them to be as enjoyable as I did, you'll adore this game.Even if you didn't enjoy them, you should give this a shot.It is still in beta, which means there's plenty of bugs to find.

								Do you remember a game called The Incredible Machine, where you had to complete some Rube Goldberg machines, created by Jeff Tunnell? Have you wondered how it would be like if it was made today?Well, this is it. It's the same game, where you complete Rube Goldberg machines, created by Jeff Tunnell and all. The difference is that's updated to today's technology and there's much more stuff to play with. It's full of puzzles to solve, just like before, but now you can make your own ones and put then on Steam Workshop.Every little detail of this game was crafted to be enjoyable. The physics are just right, the animations are eye candy, the puzzles are fun to solve.Simply speaking, the purchase of this game is mandatory to TIM fans.			"

												From the creator's of The Incredible Machine comes this gem. The art and sound are closely based on  the original's physic toys. The gameplay is fairly intuitive and there are usually multiple solutions. Most levels you will be given an unfinished Rube Goldberg Machine and access to several parts needed to finish it. It's your job to figure out where they go. Later levels have red herring items that shouldn't be placed on the machine. Sharing and making your own challenges is easier than ever before, and you will never get through the ever growing community section if the main levels fail to scratch your itch. Lots of fun and much more focused than other sandbox games. However it's somewhat low difficulty in the end.			"

												Contraption Maker really met my expectation - definitely worth the purchase especially I get an extra copy to share to friends.Quick facts for those too lazy to read on:+ TIM's successor with upgraded engine and physic+ Lots of new stuff to play with (parts, scenery...)+ Make mode for custom puzzle creation+ Steam Workshop (Share your own / play community's puzzles)+ 2-key pack (Great for gifting friends / do giveaway event)+ New content still coming everyone once in a while- Not working properly on small screen (Laptop users may find this bothersome)- Drag 'n drop replaced Click 'n drop, needs time to get used toNow it's full review (WARNING: Wall of text up ahead!)For those who are new to the party, Contraption Maker is your Rube Goldberg puzzle games - you are given some parts to fill up in the contraption to achieve specific goal(s), and it's up to you to work out how they connect with each other. Tutorial levels are a good start to get to know all the parts, and the puzzles get harder and harder (and trickier) as you play through Easy, Normal and Hard. The best part of CM, just like original T.I.M, is that you can create your own puzzle / contraption, and with Steam Workshop, you can even publish them for other players to play. Community work will definitely keep this game long live even if the developers stop updating. One more thing, unofficially, you are even allowed to texture/sound mod CM to your heart's content (Though, part's physical won't change, just their appearance). I've heard that the developers intend to make it Steam Workshop friendly in the future, so custom skins are another new thing we could expect.Contraption Maker hasn't changed much comparing to The Incredible Machine - if you love T.I.M, you will love CM as well because they are quite similar, and CM is made even better with new parts, physics and interface, something you definitely can't find with $15 for 2 copies pack. Of course there are some changes and tweak there and now (Such as you now have to drag 'n' drop parts and click on them to see additional options), but I guess we can get used to it in no time.Given that CM has just left Early access, there are still some problems with minority user bases (me included, which is why I will state here). This game will not work properly on small monitor (Under 1280 x 720), so if you are using ancient LCD like me now, wait till you get a bigger one first. As mentioned, the change from drag 'n' drop parts and click on them for additional options can be a little annoying when building contraption / puzzle - if you won't zoom in, you may not be able to select the part you want to as the game just lock to whatever part near it instead. Finally, there are still some issue publishing contraption / puzzle to Workshop - unfortunately, a single ""Failed"" messenger won't help you much, you'd have to play around with your invention until it gets accepted, quite frustrating.However, despite all these minor setbacks, Contraption Maker is still a very good puzzle game, whether you are T.I.M fan or not. Especially recommended for those who likes to play with friends, and Multiplayer Online is a great feature as well.Update: 2-pack offer is back, stated deep in the description so you may miss it. You can now get an extra copy for your friends like in 1.0 release.Update #2: After a rather random recommendation on discussion forum, I never thought the devs actually put back the ""Contraption Maker is a 2-copies pack - send the extra copy to your friends"" at the Purchase window. This just shows how much they actually care about the game and us customers :DUpdate #3: Those who keeps whining for Achievements, they are out NOW, so if you still refuse to buy Contraption Maker, I really can't think of anything to convince you guys further - come on, give the devs some support, really!

								You get older as a gamer, and part of getting older means you've played certain styles of games over and over again.  Think back to when you were a kid, though: some of the simplest games had the power to delight and amaze.  Some of the simplest games were so powerful that you could let your imagination wander wherever it could.  The original The Incredible Machine was one such game.  And unlike many of the remakes and sequels that have come out for other games over the years, nothing has managed to capture the joy in this old gamer's heart quite like Contraption Maker.  Contraption maker is not just the spiritual successor to The Incredible Machine, it's an updated version in all but name.If you played The Incredible Machine as a kid in the early 90s, the gameplay will be entirely familiar: you solve puzzles by building Rube Goldberg machines.  These could be as simple as cutting a rope and letting a balloon fly away, or activating several hamsters to power generators connected to conveyor belts with bombs on them.  The jadded gamer might find some of the puzzle challenges too easy, but let go of that cold heart of yours, and let your inner child come out to play.  It doesn't take too long to get a feel for the multitude of new gadgets, balls, animals, gizmos, pullies, rockets, and whatnots that this game has to offer, and once you've got that little bit of learning under your belt, go nuts and create your own machines or puzzles.  You may not have Mel Schlemming to send to horrific fates anymore, but you do have the aptly named ""Tim.""  You can also add backgrounds to your machines or puzzles, allowing a further creative touch.Contraption Maker is a lovely update to the original The Incredible Machine.  Let yourself be a carefree, creative kid again while you play this gem: it will melt your heart.			"

												I was interested in this game because of a fondness for The Incredible Machine and when it went on sale for $1.49 for a two pack I couldn't resist.  It's a great puzzle game plain and simple. The easy puzzles are insanely easy but do a good job of introducing the various contraptions in preparations for the medium and hard puzzles. I haven't played for long yet but was able to knock out about 25 easy puzzles and 2 hard ones inside of an hour or two and had to post about the already excellent experience I've had with the game.It probably won't capture one's interest for huge chunks of time and I can see where a hard puzzle can get frustrating and cause someone to put the game down for a while but all in all its a great title for some casual brain stimulation and at the current sale price it shouldn't be missed.

												Contraption Maker is everything you would expect a modern version of The Incredible Machine to be, taking the original premise and thoroughly modernizing it for today’s market. The puzzles, parts and free form creative mode will all be instantly familiar to long time fans with newcomers to this series being able to pick it up in no time. It’s still shaking off it’s beta status with crashes and funky behaviour peppering it’s otherwise solid execution, something that I hope to see remedied in the not too distant future. Personally I think it will make an absolutely fantastic tablet game, one that the current generation of 10 year olds will remember as fondly as we do when it comes to The Incredible Machine today.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/07/18/contraption-maker-ah-to-be-young-again/ "

												Contraption Maker is the newest game from the guys that made the Incredible Macines seriea of games. There are a lot of new elements and almost all the puzzle pieces from TIM returns. There is a lever creater with support for making levels cooperatively online. The game also has steam workshop support, so sharing custom made levels are easy. There are less levels then TIM had, but the workshop makes up for this. The biggest difference is the new graphics and the new physics system. This makes the game very fun and even allows for solutions that was never intended. Recommended for all puzzle fans.			"

												The spiritual sucessor to The Incredible Machine, with the same quirky humor and sometimes ludecrous solutions, is here in the form of Contraption Maker.The game revolves around you assembling Rube Goldberg machines to perform otherwise trivial tasks, like activating a can opener, or guiding a mouse back home.  This gameplay requires you to think outside the box for a majority of the puzzles, which makes solving them all the more satisfying.  Anyone can pick up this game.The sound design is amazing, from the music to the sound effects.  A lot of love was put into keeping the atmosphere as similar to The Incredible Machine as copyright would allow.  Everything sounds exactly the way it should.In my opinion, the game's best feature is the Steam Workshop compatibility.  With it, you can share machines you've made with everyone who owns the game, so even if you complete all the built-in levels, you can still enjoy the game.With all of this said, I love this game (My playtime is deceving).  It's fun, and well crafted, taking everything I loved from The Incredible Machine and improving it.This game gets my Seal of Recomendation.  It is a must-have title.  If it looks like fun to you, odds are, it will be.  Pick it up, even at full price.  Not to mention, you get two copies for less than average price.  Put your thinking caps on.			"

								The system specs for this game say Windows XP but I found it ran fine on Windows 7. I used to have a game called ""The Incredible Machine"" on my old Pentium 90 (!!) many years ago. It was like a 'crazy inventor' contraption maker sandbox/puzzle game. In it, you solved puzzles along the lines of putting some cheese down to attract a mouse to move along a platform with a hole in it, just before the cheese. Just before it could reach the cheese, the said mouse would fall down the hole onto a switch wuich turned on a fan pointing at a ball perched right at the end of a platform. The fan would blow the ball onto a trampoline placed just underneath that platform. The ball would then bounce up off the trampoline to trigger another switch which, when triggered, would activate a conveyor belt with a lit candle on it. Just above the end of the conveyor belt was a rocket, which as soon as the candle reached the end of the conveyor belt, it would light the rocket's fuse and the rocket would take off, thereby solving the puzzle (phew!).At the beginning of the level though, some of the above mentioned components would be missing and it would be up to you to choose the objects and place them in the right places to get the contraption to work properly and fire off the rocket. That was just one example of many puzzles, getting more complex and using more and more varied parts to make up some quite involved and ingenious contraptions.This is the successor to that game, made by the same developers. Contraption Maker Is one of the cleverest and ingenious puzzle games out there. It also has a sandbox, as well as the pre-made puzzle levels, where you can make up your own weird and wonderful contraptions using as many varied and different objects as you like, making them as convoluted and complicated as you like. You can then upload them for other users to try and solve, giving this game almost infinite replayability. They've even just added a multiplayer mode and as this is still a work in progress, there are even more features bound to be added. At the current price, this game is a steal! If you are a puzzle game fan, buying this is a no brainer and is up there with the best of the genre and yes that includes Portal 1 and 2 providing you can overlook the fact that Portal was 3D whereas this is in 2D - now there's an idea for a sequel; a 3D Contraption Maker! As it stands though, it will run on even the most modest of PC's.I can recommend this game without hesitation. So what are you waiting for?			"

The only added bonus is that now you can have community created content, so you have virtually endless puzzles.That being said, I don't know.. I guess I've outgrown it. The puzzles feel too easy and or obvious now. I guess it would make a great gift for a young teenager ( about the age I played TIM! )It's not a bad game, but it doesn't feel like it has improved anything over the original. I think most of the object are basically reskins of old ones ( the hamster wheel, the ropes, the see saws... all were in TIM )I dunno. I'd get it on a sale or something. :3			"

It's all physics based and if you like Angry Birds and/or LEGO you will probably like this.  You get to build crazy contraptions, throw things, blow things up.  Can you say ""Rube Goldberg""?			"

												I never had the chance to play The Incredible Machine when I was younger, but I always wanted to! It has met my expectations. I'm a little sad that this isn't more popular, so I bought a few copies for my younger friends. We really need to show the current generation what good games are like. Graphics don't last, and the good memories gained from special FX fade as technology improves. You will remember engaging gameplay though!			"

												""A remake of The Incredible Machine? Aw man, I always wanted to play that when I was young!""In short, Contraption Maker is a puzzle game about making Rube Goldberg-type machines to solve some sort of problem. Put the basketball in the box, get the tool guy home safely, feed the dog, break the lamp, fire the rocket. Simple enough, right?Well, it falls into one of the problems you typically run into when making a sandbox puzzle game: Each puzzle typically has either one blindingly obvious solution, because all of the other possibilities have been prevented at great effort, or it has several solutions, each more convoluted than the last, and the player is likely to come up with a solution which is radically different from what the puzzle designer intended. Often a solution which doesn't resemble the intended one, and which typically doesn't use most of the parts made available, or which exploits something the designers never considered.All fine and good, right? The whole point of games like this is to come up with a creative solution. The game even includes a video recording feature so that you can make a video of your favorite solutions and upload them to Youtube.Well, except that sometimes the ""solution"" is not entirely clear, and because of this, the player may end up spending time solving the puzzle only to find out that what they thought was a ""solved"" state is... not? And there aren't any hints of any sort available in-game to help guide players towards the expected goal.I play puzzle games for the sense of accomplishment I get when I figure something out. Or to learn new tricks when I'm forced to give up and check what the ""official"" solution was supposed to be. After completing most of the puzzles in this game, I never once got that sense of satisfaction. I always felt like I was fighting against the puzzle designers, not figuring things out on my own, and as a result I found myself more and more prone to using cheap tricks and underhanded techniques to bypass what the puzzle designer no doubt thought would be clever contraptions. I viewed playing the game as less ""What's the next puzzle I get to solve?"" and more ""Well, I paid the money for it, I should probably finish it.""Finally, of course, I mentioned inexact objectives and that I only finished most of the levels? Well I ran into one level in particular which stated a fairly simple goal(put a pair of jack-o-lanterns in a cardboard box), but upon completing the objective, I found that the simulation continued running, refusing to give me credit for solving the puzzle. There's also one puzzle I was only able to solve using a glitch in the physics engine, and consiquentially my solution worked exactly once and was not reproducible(since each simulation run is subject to some randomness). I've come to expect a higher level of quality from the free puzzle games I play, let alone the ones that I'm willing to lay down cash for. Physics glitches should never be valid solutions.Also one of the songs sounds like an old west saloon remix of Maralyn Manson's ""The Beautiful People,"" which I thought was hilarious.			"

This is an incredible physics sandbox/puzzle game that allows you to make amazing Rube Goldberg inspired contraptions involving explosives, cheese-chasing mice, lasers and mirrors, zombies, bowling balls, alligators, falling cages, derigibles, antigravitation devices, and much more.I've been waiting for an Incredible Machine title to come out for modern machines, and this is almost exactly that!  The only difference is an easier-to-use interface, upgraded graphics, and more parts to make crazy contraptions.  I was extremely thankful to find this game and I hope that the team gets lots of attention for this release, the same way that their previous games were some of the best creative puzzle games of the 90's.I highly recommend to anybody with a creative bone in their body.

												A great game. Guys who were children at the TIM machine era - nostalgia & old memories. It's a kids' game basicly in my opinion(Well, TIM machine was meant to be as well). On the positive side: The graphic is sort of cartoon one, which I like it. Bunch of new tools and other stuff compare to the old game.Multiplayer is nice, you can set your own level and controlling everything. You can also download plenty of new levels that you can play in. There are also sort of creating level tournaments which is a nice add. Cons:- All the levels are easy!!!!!!(Inlcuding Medium and Hard ones) it seems the creators got lazy making really hard ones- No more multiplayer options that could be nice(Complete a level in X time)- For people who prefer nice graphic it would be terrible- Still mainly for kids(Nothing against it, but people got old since :)- Not many levelsOverall: I would say it'd be worth buying at a much lower price(I bought for 1.50$ when 90% discount)It should be a 5$ game at the max.

												Contraption Maker is a simple looking game, and it is. But it also isn't. That's the beauty of it. This game can be as complicated or as simple as you make it. The entry level puzzles are quite easy, but the advanced ones do a good job at making a person think. And if that's not enough, you can create your own puzzles and contraptions to amaze and astound your friends. If you enjoy puzzle games, or tinkering with machinery, I think this game will be right up your alley. It's a game for kids, and kids at heart. If you're looking for fast paced action and top notch graphics, this will definitely not be the game you want to play. But if you're looking for a game that will exercise your mind, and help you exercise your problem solving and logic skills, this is a game you'll definitely enjoy. I'd rate it 193024902 falling bowling balls that shake a hamster cage, thus waking up the hamster and making him turn a gear, that in turn runs a belt, out of 200243717.  "

I played through all of them without realizing they were tutorial levels and just thought the game was super simple.

								Games like Contraption Maker kind of speak for themselves. You're given a selection of parts to complete an unfinished mechanism, in order to complete a certain objective. The physics engine here is perfect, but the game itself is currently very short (granted it is an alpha.) Contraption Maker isn't focused on it's official levels, but rather its level maker. That being said, the editor mode works perfectly and there's a lot of things you can do with it.Whether you like it is based on your opinion of the physics/puzzle genre; if you like it, this is essential; if you don't, stay far away.

												If you've played any of the Incredible Machines you'll feel right at home here. While the core game itself is just more of the same old TIM (this isn't a bad thing) the inclusion of the Workshop and Modded gameplay really expands on what you can do. I remember being a kid, making custom levels, and having no one to share them with. Now that isn't a problem! Any puzzle fan should pick this up.			"

												If you liked the old Incredible Machine games, you probably already own or know about this, but it's still worth mentioning. Created by the developers of the original TIM, this Rube Goldberg machine-building puzzle game is dripping with value: high production quality, hundreds of levels, Steam achievements (for those of you who care about them), easy custom level tools & Workshop support, and an MSRP of 7 dollars for two copies. There's also online multiplayer, which is probably why each purchase nets you two copies in the first place.Recommended, especially for parents who want something constructive they can play with their kids that isn't Minecraft or Roblox.

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Logic   The Incredible Machine   Over complicated solutions to easy tasks   Physics Puzzles   Level editors/customisation If you've ever wanted to mess around with Rube Goldberg machines, then this is your chance! The premise of the game is to create riduculous, complex machines to achieve a simple task. Your machines will have knock on effects - a ball rolls along a conveyor belt, which knocks into scissors which cut a rope which drops a bucket and so on.The puzzles get very difficult as you go through, so you will need somewhat of a logical mind to figure them out. The real fun for me comes in the level editor where you are able to create your very own Rube Goldberg machines rather than just place a few items in to complete an existing machine in the main game.If you love puzzles and don't get easily frustrated then grab this game now!

												It's pretty enjoyable even for people who don't generally like puzzle games.  There are a staggering amount of official puzzles (I'm nowhere near finishing them all) of varying difficulties, and most of the ones I've played are great.  There are also a ton of community-made puzzles.  Some of them are really good, and some are terrible but funny in their terribleness.The most fun part for me was the level editor.  You can make your own contraptions and puzzles using all the parts in the game.  The editor is a little awkward, but generally easy to use.Most annoying part of the game is the bad UI.  The actual game mechanics are really well-done, so I have no clue why they failed so badly with the UI. Exiting a puzzle should take you back to the page number where you found the puzzle, not the main puzzle page.  There should also be an in-game way to search through the puzzles by name or author, how does this not exist?  These are really basic features- it makes you wonder if they actually tested anything outside of the puzzles/contraptions.But it's still a really fun game, or else I'd never put up with the other stuff.  It's very satisfying to create a convoluted contraption all just to accomplish the simple task of, say, turning on a blender.			"

												I honestly didn't have any expectations for this game and got it for $1 so take the review lightly.When I first tried it out I felt overwhelmed by the UI and couldn't figure out how to work anything, so I gave up after 10 minutes and left the game to collect dust. A couple months later... I decided to give it another try since I wanted to get the trading cards to sell and I didn't have anything else to do. Coming back to the UI, I found that it has tutorials (made by the designers I think) that explain some of the chaos and I was actually able to figure out how to work the contraptions. I love puzzles so I went straight for the premade puzzle selection and ended up thouroughly enjoying them. For the puzzle-solving alone I can recommend this game and I bet kids who like puzzles would also enjoy it. There's a custom mode where you can make whatever you want and share it with the community and vice-versa for whole other set of play time.[Graphics - Good]: It's simplistic but emphasizes the objects and activities of the contraptions themselves since that's the point of the game. It's fluid and not computer intensive.[Sound - Average]: The music was a bit grating so it can be turned off and you can listen to your own personal music if you want. Sound Effects are fitting, everything has a sound of some kind both by themselves and when they interact with other objects.[Difficulty - Good]: Some contraptions are easier to figure out than others and I assume the community made ones would be real challenges. Again, even kids could enjoy the game.[Replay - Good]: There's not really an end to this game, but it has enough content to last you awhile. Lots of premade puzzles and contraption making to be enjoyed.			"

												The charm of Contraption Maker is that, like The Incredible Machine before it, it provides a fairly self-explanatory framework in which to create and solve a variety of puzzles, ranging from the mundane (pop a balloon) to the esoteric (fire a series of lasers in order to make breakfast, clean the house, and feed the dog and cat and mouse and crocodile and bear). It's good, clean fun for everyone that also challenges you to flex your mental muscles as well, both on developer-made as well as community-made puzzles.Some people will make claims that the game limits you by only giving one way to solve a given puzzle. Hardly the case, if you ask me. I solved more than a few puzzles with thinking so far out of the box that the official solution bore not the slightest resemblance what I ended up doing, and the puzzle still had the good grace to acknowledge my solution as valid because I accomplished the objective it demanded with the parts it provided, even if I didn't use them remotely like they were intended. This is clearly not a 'one answer and only one answer' game.Does it have flaws? A few. The plug system takes a little getting used to (since the game now rather aggressively plugs in parts for you), and a handful of parts are a touch too loose in definition--the free rotation of smaller parts or walls isn't bad, but it can be a bit of a chore to line up some parts just right without relying on the snap-to function built into the game. I also miss the old music from the old The Incredible Machine days, but that's just auditory nostalgia on my part.All in all though, a lot of fun for thinky folks. A cute little game that brings back good old memories while remaining accessible and affordable in spite of a few minor hiccups.			"

												Great Game. I played The Incredible machine at school when I was in Grade 1. It was removed by updated software after grade 3. Even though I have not played it since then, I have always remembered it and on multiple occasions, tried finding its successor. My first virus came from a bad copy of TIM. Just recently, I found this, the true successor to TIM, this game. I have been playing it off and on for the past few months and it is great. There are many levels to do and new ones are created and published through steam. You can even create your own contraptions or levels.Right now I am creating a machine that plays ""music"" by operating. It is very early but it already sounds good.There are a few bugs when it comes to resizing the screen size or getting the screenshot though. "

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Logic   The Incredible Machine   Over complicated solutions to easy tasks   Physics Puzzles   Level editors/customisation If you've ever wanted to mess around with Rube Goldberg machines, then this is your chance! The premise of the game is to create riduculous, complex machines to achieve a simple task. Your machines will have knock on effects - a ball rolls along a conveyor belt, which knocks into scissors which cut a rope which drops a bucket and so on.The puzzles get very difficult as you go through, so you will need somewhat of a logical mind to figure them out. The real fun for me comes in the level editor where you are able to create your very own Rube Goldberg machines rather than just place a few items in to complete an existing machine in the main game.If you love puzzles and don't get easily frustrated then grab this game now!

												   This game is the successor of ""The Incredible Machine"" series and is made by the same team. They didn't really improved the concept as much as port it and adapt it to current day standards. Gameplay consists of building crazy contraptions and chain reactions. The puzzles for the most part are more fun than difficult; you'll usually have a sense of the solution by the existing pieces and the parts you have to place.Rating: two cats, one bucket.Recommendation: for casual players of this genre.http://pixelloot.com "

												It's a very fun puzzler.  The game is very much like the old one and i still love it.Cats, mice, cheese, robots, lazers; this game has everything.  It's really easy to grasp the mechanics of and the puzzles slowly progress.  It's not so easy that a toddler could beat the entire game but it's not hard that you'd need a master mind to complete the game.  That doesn't mean that it won't get hard though.  I would play this game more but CSGO and GMod exist so... D:  That and Call of Dudes.  It is very fun though and puts you in a gr8 mood.			"

												If you like visual puzzles and games with proper physics, well almost, you'll enjoy this. I've got into a habit of doing one or two medium level puzzles a day. It gets me into the right mood for doing other online studies I'm doing. The cartoon, 2D animations work well and there is a good variety. The puzzles are the cascade type where by one action will trigger a chain of other reactions to achieve the final goal. The puzzles start with a few contraptions in place and you have to fill in the gaps from the range of contraptions provided. There is also a sandbox whereby you can build your own cascades and publish them online. Very good value at the sale price.			"

												This is definitely one of those ""guilty pleasures"" types of games. The graphics are pretty childish, along with most of the tracks, and yet the non-rigid puzzle design of the main game alone is pretty entertaining and addictive. There are a lot, and I mean a LOT of maps where you can ""cheat"" a solution with 3-4 pieces, most of the time exploiting the physics when a prop lands on the diagonal surface of another prop you place. Doing things the ""right way"" is its own fun, but there's a certain thrill that comes when you realize you broke the intended sequence -- and I have no doubt the devs left these in for two reasons. #1: Those ""aha"" and ""take that, game!"" moments are both equally enjoyable at the right time, but also #2: the main emphasis is on the creator (I think I got 4 popups suggesting I go there before they just gave up), and allowing players to think outside the box trains the player to fully utilize the creator when they're ready to move away from the puzzles.In any case, it's a goofy little Rube Goldberg device creator that's family friendly, and a nice little time killer. At the very least, pick it up for its uniqueness. My only complaint is the music gets repetitive after awhile, though it's definitely a nice throwback to comic tunes that could've easily existed in Rube Goldberg's era.			"

												The original The Incredible Machine was one of my favorite games when I was a kid. TIM3 was the high point of the series, but to me the Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions was a big let-down and a huge step back. Also, having tried some other remakes of my old favorites, like some of the new Worms games, I was more than a bit sceptical on how this game would turn out. Luckily I was worried for nothing! I find the new TIM.. I mean, Contraption Maker, every bit as good as its best predecessor. The easy puzzles are, of course, really easy, and there's a lot of them, but you can skip to the more difficult puzzles whenever you want for the added satisfaction of solving them. You can also pick any one from the pre-made 200-300 puzzles, so you won't get stuck without being able to continue.There's also, of course, the free building mode, where you can create your own contraptions and puzzles, and share them via Steam Workshop, which is nicely built into the game. There's a good amount of parts and people have been constructing some pretty great things. What's more, there's even support for modding.Warmly recommended for anyone into puzzle or building games.

								At this time Contraption Maker is very much unfinished.  That said, it's already easy to recognize the tried-and-true essentials of  The Incredible Machine. I'm honestly not sure where this will go, but even if it doesn't go beyond a remake of TIM I'll be glad I bought it.			"

												I bought this in 2013. Where does the time go? Probably the same place as the original Incredible Machine series, but oh well.So now that it's actually had time to come together, I can safely say this is the new, proper successor to The Incredible Machine. Parts abound, the new physics engine feels more realistic, and a bundle of new parts and part interactions means all sorts of interesting new puzzle opportunities. Vertically oriented scissors! Tie ropes to a bunch of stuff you couldn't before, including platforms used to precariously balance other objects! Create a recursive assembly line with part manufacture and disposal points! Expand the playing field to a theoretically infinite size, and build as much as you want! It's a real gem, and I regret putting it off for this long after the first phase of Early Access felt so chintzy.In some ways it does still feel oddly chintzy. The aesthetic of many of the parts very much rides the razor's edge between ""smoothly designed"" and ""cheap looking"", and some of them seem to have a terrifying size disparity. The interface screams ""mobile game"", even though it's PC-only. Some part interactions still feel like they're completely missing sound effects. You'll get a popup asking if you want to follow their Twitter. There are typos in the news on the title screen. There are visual bugs here and there, and the Camera Animation Tool is, while clever for presentation, one of the most infuriatingly buggy tools I've worked with.But you know what? It is the best game yet for making some got-dang Rube Goldberg goodness, and it's criminally cheap to boot. Some of the golden standouts of the 80's and 90's are really finding new footing again, and this is one of 'em.			"

Most of the fun is not from figuring the answer to the puzzle but finding a different one from the developers.

It's all because making the contraption is so much fun, it can take a lot of time, but every time you use it the feeling that everything was worth will explode from your inside.It's really fun and i recommend for those that like sandbox game.You can play with friends to build the contraption or play on single player solving puzzles.10/10Good images, sfx's and low price you will get two copies.

												As a life long fan of The Incredible Machine I was excited at the prospect of the original team coming back, even going as far as buying two copies when the early access first became available. I have come to regret this choice after speaking with the developers and receiving a rather rude response in regards to the lack of a 32-bit Linux build. Long story short if you dont run a 64-bit build of Linux, 64 still being the minority in the Linux world due to it not being as necessary, nothing will be downloaded and the game will in turn not launch. They have no plans to fix this so if you have been screwed over get your steam refund while you still can. There have also been a number of launch issues on other platforms in which the team has no longer proactive in fixing.Beyond this there are still a number of TIM gadgets from the newer games that are missing.My best advice is track down a copy of TIM: Even More Contraptions instead, the team seams to have really bitten off more than they could chew with Contraption Maker.

												This is quite a lot of money for a game I can play better versions of online for free. Not only that, but it seems the ""official"" solutions are the only solutions. Take ""Sibling Rivalry 2"", one of the early levels. You can solve the puzzle a different way, but the game doesn't accept the solution as valid as the victory condition programmed in isn't the same as the one presented to the player. Sadly, it does not get better from there. Even the hard puzzles are incredibly easy and contain wholly unnecessary elements to provide the same obvious hints as earlier levels. Usually these sorts of games try to draw out the player's creativity. This game was lazily made with a single solution in mind, without interestingly building as the game progresses.			"

												I've only played this for a brief while, but as a fan of the Incredible Machine franchise, I'd say this is a worthy successor for the most part. If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the art style is rather off-putting and at times it even confuses me, to the point where I can't tell what I'm looking at (which is horrible, because the original games were designed so that you could understand what most of the objects did by looking at them). Secondly, while I don't necessarily think the original games had amazing music, the music they have here is rather bland at best, to annoying at worst.But obviously I wouldn't be giving this a thumbs up if I didn't think it was worth it. Compared to all the contemporaries that have cropped up in recent years, Contraption Maker is a wonderful return to form for a series that has long been neglected. The game mechanics are good, the interface takes a bit of getting used to for a TIM veteran but I've grown to like it.If there was a way to create custom assets and different music libraries for this game, I would be glad, because virtually everything besides the underlying mechanics sort've lets this whole package down in a way. Not enough for me to hate it, per se, but I think the difference here is that I can play the old TIM games for hours on end, whereas this game I need to pause every now and then and wash my eyes.

												Contraption Maker is a retro style problem solving puzzle game where you move assets around to solve the challenges. The pros are the game is an enjoyable experience that gives a decent amount of tools to play with in order to create/solve puzzles. The cons lie in that the content provided by developer in terms of ""challenges"" are relatively easy and serve more as a tutorial than anything else. The game is therefore relying on the player to create an intrinsic enjoyable experience. Fine by me, I give this game a tentative recommendation, it certainly isn't for everyone, but for fans of the genre or those seeking a quick casual experience, it will satisfy those needs.			"

												This game suffers by providing too much content to play with.  There are so many different objects that remembering what all of them do becomes difficult.  There are 54 tutorial levels!  That's way too much!The intro puzzles are unbearably easy to the point of pure boredom.  The more difficult puzzles all have multiple solutions, each more convoluted than the last.  I don't think I solved a single one of the advanced puzzles with the ""Official Solution,"" which you can only view after completing the puzzle.I still wasn't getting any enjoyment out of this after 2 hours of play and completing levels across a smattering of difficulties.

												Granted, I never played Incredible Machines, but I played Crazy Machines 1, 1.5 (both), 2 and Elements.And nothing dissapointed me more than this.I also know this isn't supposed to be a successor of the CM series, but they're basically the same.Pros:- Fine artstyle / graphics- Runs fairly well (no optimization issues, etc)- Workshop support and multiplayer- Some rather interesting objectsCons:- Horrible UI and UX- Many objects are very dumbified, I mean cmon, a switch that delivers electricity?- Looks more aimed at children, while necessarily not a bad thing, maybe an additional ""theme"" would've been neat...- No borderless windowed mode- No bonus for using less objects than you haveAll in all, I'd rather stay away from this, even for the price of 1,04€ for a double pack. :/			"

								The team that created the original Incredible Machine® is bringing all of the Rube Goldberg craziness to the modern age. The final version will have you Solving puzzles involving ridiculous chain reactions full of hamster motors, trampolines, alligators, cats, and so much more. Everything you loved about the original game is back and improved with a new physics engine, high definition art, and new parts and programmability. Currently the game has 100 official puzzles, and over 100 community creations. Steam Workshop integration allows you to share your creations with the world. Cooperative play, sub-assemblies, mods and more are coming soon.			"

												Sheesh, where do I begin... I have had a sort of a love-hate relationship with this game over the many hours I have played it. It can be frustrating, highly annoying and it can cause serious tilting at certain points but you cannot deny the fact that this is a well made game. While it can be tough at times, at times it's simplicity can be overwhelmingly inventive. And to top it all off, it allows the users to showcase their own creativity.Therefore I say, if you have those steam currencies to spare then go buy yourself a Contraption Maker and get yourself some. 8/10 for me.

I thought i would be like 1v1 who ever uses the most things in their contraption wins you have 5 mins GO! Thats what i thought it would be like.... It does give you 2  copies of the game one to give to your friend. The problem is none of my friends would like this game. So i just used it for trades. This game is ok but like i said its like an app on your phone... It gets boring after awhile. If you brought the price down i think more people would buy it. Heck the only reason i bought this game was to play it with my friend who just got it and even then she didnt like the game.

Early Access Review
								I have a windows release of the incredible machine, something more recent than the shots shown in the video here, and I must say it looks more modern, with its pixels and all, than contraption maker. Yes, I see that the electric plugs connect automatically, and the wals and conveyor belts dont snap to huge squares any more, but whether that is an improvement seems ambiguous to me. No way to really edit anything substantial in the workshop has been demonstrated. Joins of different types of walls (or simply two pieces of wall) are not implemented (the original game's joins were absolutely spectacular)in short, the graphics right now are worse than the windows release of Incredible machine, and other sprite games of the period, for example Creatures 3. Looks more like something that would be on an iPad with microtransactions, such as Mega Jump. Perhaps the gameplay will be gradually expanded, but so far between the inferior graphics, the iffy controls, and the unnecessarily free positioning, I recomend the original over this. And it doesn't look like the visual style is goign to be fixed.I was reffering to this version of the game - http://resource.mmgn.com/Gallery/full/The-Incredible-Machine-Z5CC.jpg "

												Don't buy it. This should be a free demo. It only has a few tutorial levels and then it stops. It has no playability whatsoever, and they expect you to create levels.Don't get me wrong, the online features are there, but there is no campaign, no challenge, nothing. I completed the tutorial in 20mins and now I'm left with nothing to do.Trying to get a refund.			"

												It is an awesome remake of TIM game series. I am kind of fan (First played TIM when i was, like, 5 years old, original ""The Incredible Machine"" was one of first games I ever played. Then there was Incredible Toons and TIM: Contraptions much much later)Pros:- Some new elements. Most elements are same as in TIM2/3, tho.- New puzzles- Same atmosphere- Sometimes the updates come. Gives hopeCons:- The game is buggy. Sometimes it is just broken. Overlapping parts and false triggering, no right click copy in sandbox puzzles.- Physics engine is wacky. Sometimes you can move a block on the left of the screen and whole system will behave slightly different: say, a ball on the other side of the screen will bounce differently a bit.- Most puzzles are too easy. Some are easily solveable different way (kinda cheating), because of wacky physics engine, bugs or just puzzle designer did not think that instead of using 20 details to turn the switch i can just place a ball over it and turn it using single detail- The community seems to not be moderated. Workshop is full of achievement spam or just ""test-test-test"" puzzles that are not actually puzzles.Anyway, I recommend this game to anyone. It is awesome.			"

												Anybody who grew up playing DOS games and/or puzzle games will probably remember a little game called ""The Incredible Machine"" and all of it's sequels. Puzzle games that revolve around making a Rube Goldberg machine to complete very simple tasks. The puzzles were difficult, very 'outside the box' and so satisying to pull off.Contraption Maker is created by the same people who made ""The Incredible machine"", and it's not just an update or a re-make/re-imagining of the original, there so many new bells and whistles (sometimes literally) added to the original formula with new gameplay mechanics and UI improvements that it is now more accesible than ever.Contraption Maker isn't just The Increbidle Machine, it's The Incredible Machine +. There's so much that has been added that I would recommend this to anybody even if they just have a passing interest in the puzzle genre of gaming. It's vibrant, fun, and can get very difficult for those who can't think outside the box.			"

												If you played Crazy Machines I, you'll love it. If you played Crazy Machines Elements, you will also like it. But if you own Crazy Machines II, then you'll still like it. but probably will switch back to CM2 at some point in time, because it has way more features and tiles. But since this game is still in development, buy it anyways, because it's very innovative (Toolman Tim, Critters, Steam Workshop, ...) and hopefully there'll be many updates to add more content. Also, if you're done with the few developer levels, you can always play an infinite amount of Workshop Puzzles, or just build your own Cat-Juggling-Deathray-Shooting Machine and upload it. I definetly recommend this game to everybody, independant whether they've played any Crazy Machines game before or not.			"

												I have some mixed feelings about this game.  Having grown up with the original Incredible Machine trilogy in the 90s, I may be pretty biased when I say this game doesn't hold a candle to its predecessors.  But, I can readily say the community sharing through steam workshop makes this game a quite enjoyable experience nevertheless.  ANd the fact that this game exists makes me happy on its own.If you haven't played the original games, I urge you to go play them because they were phenomenal.  If you have played the original games... well, this is about a fitting tribute as I could hope for for such an obscure series.			"

												If you remember games like The Incredible Machine (or Sid and Al's Toon Factory), then this is more of the same fun and Rube Goldberg-esque construction gaming you missed when Sierra and Dynamix became a name for Vivendi. Use fans, balls, lasers, animals, and the ever-present hamster cages to complete objectives and contraptions that make sense only when you see them in their working beauty.Also included are sandbox and puzzle construction modes, so that you can create your own useful and multi-step cat scratchers and nitro explosive reactions and share them for the world to see.

												It's The Incredible Machine with better graphics. I'm typically not huge on nostalgia, but with a niche genre like this, it's an instant transport back to the 90s. Not to say that's all it is; the simple addition of guidelines, shown as a dotted line and a shadow image, will show where an item will fall if left to its own devices. Items falling, rising, shot out of a cannon... it removes the tedium of moving an item a pixel at a time and hoping chaos theory will do the rest. That alone makes it well worth it.Plus, Waldo's meows gets my own cats to dart up and look around. Unintended bonus!			"

												Way back, in the 90s, there existed a game franchise for the PC made by Sierra called ""The Incredible Machine"" or TIM in short.The gameplay was pretty much the same as this game and it was one of the best puzzle games of the time and maybe beyond that.More on the gameplay.Each level consists of a goal you are trying to achieve.For that, you are given some items which you can use to achieve that goal.Your job is to use these stuff appropriately to succeed.Of course, you can cheese it at times but it's way more satisfying, finding the proper solution to a puzzle.

												Ehh... this is serviceable, but the physics are a bit wonky sometimes. The difficulty curve is good, overall, but the obscenely convoluted puzzles at the end of the game aren't really fun to solve in the slightest due to the physics engine. Though there's definitely more than enough of them, honestly I feel they could've done well to cut down on the number of official puzzles because I don't see what user puzzles can really add to the game after so many official puzzles, it feels like all ideas have run their course. Music's obnoxious, too, turned it off in like 5 minutes. Not too expensive though and it's decent fun for a bit, the middle of the game has some fun, challenging puzzles and I did enjoy this, just not a huge fan. Also the last tier of puzzles made me stop playing for a while so I hardly remember a lot of this anymore, oops...			"

Not as much character in this game as it seemed there was in its great grandpa: The Incredible Machine. But the game works well. It is fun! Plus, if you can't get enough, there's even community made levels which can be very fun and creative. And if you are creative enough, you can make your own puzzles.

												Did you play any of the Incredible Machine games as a kid? Did you spend hours and hours in the puzzle editor trying to make ever more elaborate puzzles to stump your siblings and/or friends?  Good news, then: they may be calling this a ""spiritual sequel"" to the original, but this isn't just like TIM -- it is almost EXACTLY the same game. Which, in case it wasn't already clear, is a good thing.For those unfamiliar with the original, read some of the other reviews that are already here (tl;dr -- Rube Goldberg machine builder). They made a few changes in the decade or so since the old games, but they're all pretty much quality-of-life adjustments. The graphics have been updated, the physics engine seems to be more sophisticated, and the interface is far more user-friendly (electrical cords visibly auto-attach to nearby outlets, lasers have an indicator while you move them around so you don't have to keep turning your machine on and off to find out where they're pointing, and light/wind sources similarly show you how far they extend). More importantly, almost all of the parts from the old games made it in, and they've added some new ones! A timed laser repeater and a beam splitter for even more elaborate laser mazes, physics-enabled domino blocks, and a programmable ""part creator"" that spits out a stream of objects and will probably result in endless absurd shenanigans. Oh, and an egg. The egg is important. (Also, they've released free Halloween and Christmas updates with new parts!) Finally, the addition of community content naturally means that you have access to tons more puzzles than there ever were in the original games. This is just one of those classic games that makes perfect sense to update for the current generation, taking advantage of better computer hardware and Steam's platform for sharing player-created content. An old favorite that's even better than it used to be. Totally worthwhile.			"

												This really is like the old Incredible Machines games, even down to the selection of parts in many of the puzzles. It follows the same logic (or arguably lack thereof in some cases), and does encourage you to draw on knowledge from various areas, such as mixing primary colours. This allows it to work well for both adults and children alike, and I suspect its target is children supervised by parents for help with the harder puzzles. And trust me, there are ones even adults will likely have a head-scratch over (I know I have at times!).My only real gripes are that the controls are a little iffy, particularly with placing parts. The menus around items are not context-sensitive so it can get frustrating when placing items in certain areas, as you can't access the menus properly - you have to rotate somewhere else before putting the part in, as an example - which means some puzzles require more clicks than they need simply because there's no allowance made for menus going off the screen. The game also does seem to hold your hand a little too long, with many of the first puzzles (even past the first 50) being a case of 'clone/mirror the other half of the screen' or 'fill the obvious blank', so it can get a little tiresome early on.But do continue. It's good.			"

												It's a new Incredible Machine game. With 200+ official puzzles, workshop support and an improved physics engine.If you have played any of those games, play it if you could do with some more puzzle solving and contraption making. If you haven't, then go play it! Rube Goldberg's classic comic strips[www.rubegoldberg.com] and the developer's Youtube channel should help explain the appeal better than anything else I could write here.			"

												I had The Incredible Machine: Even More contraptions and I absoloutly loved it, and when I found out the same developers had made a new Rube Goldberg-esque game I couldn't wait to play it. However I was sadly upset to see that the two games are almost identical despite being 12 years apart! There are hardly any new features, what appears to be less levels and less heart and soul put into the game which is apparent in the graphics and content.I understand I haven't played all the way through it, this is just my initial feeling. And I won't tell you to not buy the game as it will provide quite a while of entertainment, i'm just disappointed that the game isn't what I was hoping it to be,			"

But if you own Crazy Machines II, then you'll still like it. but probably will switch back to CM2 at some point in time, because it has way more features and tiles. But since this game is still in development, buy it anyways, because it's very innovative (Toolman Tim, Critters, Steam Workshop, ...) and hopefully there'll be many updates to add more content. Also, if you're done with the few developer levels, you can always play an infinite amount of Workshop Puzzles, or just build your own Cat-Juggling-Deathray-Shooting Machine and upload it. I definetly recommend this game to everybody, independant whether they've played any Crazy Machines game before or not.			"

												Fantastic remake. I bought this on sale for 74p and it even came with an extra copy for a friend who is already obsessed with it. Contraption Maker retains the gameplay of the original Incredible Machine with a few added mechanics thrown in like zombies and snow sledding. The added online functionality is a great way to expand the lifetime of this game, too.One thing I will say is that the new wacky soundtrack felt very odd to me, so I downloaded the original Incredible Machine songs from a random site (in original .ogg format) and modded them in myself. They go into the assets > music folder and MUST be renamed identically to the files you are replacing or else the game will not recognise them.The nostalgia is strong!			"

												If you ever played The Incredible Machine on Windows 95 or 98 (TIM for short), then you will already know what this game is like.  TIM was essentially a kids game with some cool kinetic trap making that allowed for adults to have fun playing it too.Contraption Maker was fun.  I have two downsides that are pretty much entirely subjective.  First, the graphics are bright and cheery.  That would seem like a positive for some, but for me it's like looking at a rainbow that is moving.  It gets slightly irritating after awhile.  Secondly, I felt as though the game attempted to be more on the funny side rather than the serious side.I don't know who their target audiece was, and I felt that the game might be too complex for kids, and too childish for adults.  With all that being said, I would ultimately recommend this game.  It is fun.  I put sunglasses on for the colors, and I am happy that such a game still exists.  Maybe a few kids will latch onto it, and maybe a few adults will relive nostalgia.			"

												Ehh... this is serviceable, but the physics are a bit wonky sometimes. The difficulty curve is good, overall, but the obscenely convoluted puzzles at the end of the game aren't really fun to solve in the slightest due to the physics engine. Though there's definitely more than enough of them, honestly I feel they could've done well to cut down on the number of official puzzles because I don't see what user puzzles can really add to the game after so many official puzzles, it feels like all ideas have run their course. Music's obnoxious, too, turned it off in like 5 minutes. Not too expensive though and it's decent fun for a bit, the middle of the game has some fun, challenging puzzles and I did enjoy this, just not a huge fan. Also the last tier of puzzles made me stop playing for a while so I hardly remember a lot of this anymore, oops...			"

												I happily give this game a qualified thumbs up.At first, I found the game extremely pleasant; the graphics are bright and cheery and the music is wonderful. Figuring out how the various doodads work was initially pretty stimulating. But after the first hour or two, the initial charm had worn off and the puzzles weren't as satisfying as I would have liked. Then I tried the sandbox; for whatever reason, as an adult (and a programmer) I found this initially pleasing but not very satistfying.But the kids! I have a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old. They don't play a lot of computer/video games, but they LOVE this one, and I LOVE letting them play it. I really enjoy watching them play and talking with them about the choices they make.			"

												This game is an accurate tribute to The Incredible Machine--those of us that remember it back in the 90's. It is a wonderful sandbox game in which you have to use the tools available to you to complete an objective. It is very much a puzzle game and it makes you think.   "

												I have some mixed feelings about this game.  Having grown up with the original Incredible Machine trilogy in the 90s, I may be pretty biased when I say this game doesn't hold a candle to its predecessors.  But, I can readily say the community sharing through steam workshop makes this game a quite enjoyable experience nevertheless.  ANd the fact that this game exists makes me happy on its own.If you haven't played the original games, I urge you to go play them because they were phenomenal.  If you have played the original games... well, this is about a fitting tribute as I could hope for for such an obscure series.			"

												I had The Incredible Machine: Even More contraptions and I absoloutly loved it, and when I found out the same developers had made a new Rube Goldberg-esque game I couldn't wait to play it. However I was sadly upset to see that the two games are almost identical despite being 12 years apart! There are hardly any new features, what appears to be less levels and less heart and soul put into the game which is apparent in the graphics and content.I understand I haven't played all the way through it, this is just my initial feeling. And I won't tell you to not buy the game as it will provide quite a while of entertainment, i'm just disappointed that the game isn't what I was hoping it to be,			"

Not as much character in this game as it seemed there was in its great grandpa: The Incredible Machine. But the game works well. It is fun! Plus, if you can't get enough, there's even community made levels which can be very fun and creative. And if you are creative enough, you can make your own puzzles.

												Did you play any of the Incredible Machine games as a kid? Did you spend hours and hours in the puzzle editor trying to make ever more elaborate puzzles to stump your siblings and/or friends?  Good news, then: they may be calling this a ""spiritual sequel"" to the original, but this isn't just like TIM -- it is almost EXACTLY the same game. Which, in case it wasn't already clear, is a good thing.For those unfamiliar with the original, read some of the other reviews that are already here (tl;dr -- Rube Goldberg machine builder). They made a few changes in the decade or so since the old games, but they're all pretty much quality-of-life adjustments. The graphics have been updated, the physics engine seems to be more sophisticated, and the interface is far more user-friendly (electrical cords visibly auto-attach to nearby outlets, lasers have an indicator while you move them around so you don't have to keep turning your machine on and off to find out where they're pointing, and light/wind sources similarly show you how far they extend). More importantly, almost all of the parts from the old games made it in, and they've added some new ones! A timed laser repeater and a beam splitter for even more elaborate laser mazes, physics-enabled domino blocks, and a programmable ""part creator"" that spits out a stream of objects and will probably result in endless absurd shenanigans. Oh, and an egg. The egg is important. (Also, they've released free Halloween and Christmas updates with new parts!) Finally, the addition of community content naturally means that you have access to tons more puzzles than there ever were in the original games. This is just one of those classic games that makes perfect sense to update for the current generation, taking advantage of better computer hardware and Steam's platform for sharing player-created content. An old favorite that's even better than it used to be. Totally worthwhile.			"

												If you ever played The Incredible Machine on Windows 95 or 98 (TIM for short), then you will already know what this game is like.  TIM was essentially a kids game with some cool kinetic trap making that allowed for adults to have fun playing it too.Contraption Maker was fun.  I have two downsides that are pretty much entirely subjective.  First, the graphics are bright and cheery.  That would seem like a positive for some, but for me it's like looking at a rainbow that is moving.  It gets slightly irritating after awhile.  Secondly, I felt as though the game attempted to be more on the funny side rather than the serious side.I don't know who their target audiece was, and I felt that the game might be too complex for kids, and too childish for adults.  With all that being said, I would ultimately recommend this game.  It is fun.  I put sunglasses on for the colors, and I am happy that such a game still exists.

												Freaking awesome game. I remember playing incredible machines when I was in grade 3 and it was the most educational thing we did apart from dissecting owl droppings. This game builds on top of that universe. Record your amazing solves, create levels yourself, share levels with others, and it's not a very expensive game, especially on sale. I could spend hours playing it. I got it today and I've played 2 already, which is unhealthy since I haven't actually had a lot of time to play, that and I had to come on here to ragelove it with a lovereview.

It's been easy enough for them to understand and I've got as much enjoyment out of watching them try to figure out each level than I have had actually playing myself.I don't know if I would recommend the game at full price (I'll modify my review after playing more) - but if you can catch this on sale - definitely pick it up.

												The ultimate Incredible Machine. Many new gadgets, perfected user interface and well-designed (mostly) puzzles. I loved the original games as a kid and I love this sequel as well.My only complaint goes towards the music. Some tracks are too aggressive for a puzzle game and also too repetitive and annoying; soon I had to turn it off.			"

												My kids (ages 2 and 4) and I have loved this game.  The game successfully continues in the spirit of the original Incredible Machine.  The difficulty scale is good until some late levels that require just absolutely perfect poisitioning of objects.			"

												Who liked ""The Incredible Machine"" will love this.The puzzles are lovely and very detailed. There some incredibly tough nuts to crack, especially amongst the ""rated impossible"" ones. Unfortunately one Steam Achievement is broken at the moment, so I couldn't make this a perfect game.If you're looking for at least ~30-40h solid puzzle fun -> Buy this game!			"

												If you remember games like The Incredible Machine (or Sid and Al's Toon Factory), then this is more of the same fun and Rube Goldberg-esque construction gaming you missed when Sierra and Dynamix became a name for Vivendi. Use fans, balls, lasers, animals, and the ever-present hamster cages to complete objectives and contraptions that make sense only when you see them in their working beauty.Also included are sandbox and puzzle construction modes, so that you can create your own useful and multi-step cat scratchers and nitro explosive reactions and share them for the world to see.

												Anybody who grew up playing DOS games and/or puzzle games will probably remember a little game called ""The Incredible Machine"" and all of it's sequels. Puzzle games that revolve around making a Rube Goldberg machine to complete very simple tasks. The puzzles were difficult, very 'outside the box' and so satisying to pull off.Contraption Maker is created by the same people who made ""The Incredible machine"", and it's not just an update or a re-make/re-imagining of the original, there so many new bells and whistles (sometimes literally) added to the original formula with new gameplay mechanics and UI improvements that it is now more accesible than ever.Contraption Maker isn't just The Increbidle Machine, it's The Incredible Machine +. There's so much that has been added that I would recommend this to anybody even if they just have a passing interest in the puzzle genre of gaming. It's vibrant, fun, and can get very difficult for those who can't think outside the box.			"

												Good throughback for games I played back in the day. (90s). I played the incredible machine back then and had a blast, I was 11 I think. Saw this and had to buy it for nostalgic reasons. Puzzles are really easy for an adult (Most of them anyway) but it's still pretty fun.If you've got a kid, I think they'd love it.			"

												Great game.. You can do ANYTHING in this game.. If you want just have a fun, you can make stranke chain reactions on your own or with your friends.. If you are about to learn coding, its great also.. And if you are good at coding and you want to try something logical with object in 2D, this is (in my opinion) the best engine.			"

												I recommend the game...  But only for smaller kids.I find it, as far as user-experience goes, rather immature. Icons overlap, moving can be finnicky and annoying. For a game that's centrered around moving tools around, resizing and rotating them, I would expect a lot more effort to be done.The graphics/sound/music are mediocre. They work, but they are certainly lacking, for examply the legendary ""Sid and Al toons"" game was much better in that department.So I do recommend it, merely because I have a lot of fun playing with my son (5yo).

												I played the The Incredible Machine when I was a kid and loved it. Being able to play this with my daughter brings back so many memories from my childhood. The early puzzles are really simple, but I think that's good for the younger audiance. Later on they can get pretty challenging.			"
