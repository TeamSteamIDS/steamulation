												Well, I wish I could have enjoyed this game but at level 3 of the tutorial, game requires the use of mouse wheel in order to complete the level. Why force the use of mouse wheel? No idea and no real rationale behind it. Developers could have simply implemented the use of two keys for the same results. Or could have supported gamepad. Though luck: my computer is a laptop. Couldn't move forward in the game. Game specs don't specify that the use of mouse wheel is mandatory. Refund requested and obtained. So beware before buying this game.			"

												This game is a lot of fun and reminds me a lot of those oil and water dripper games that I used to really enjoy as a kid.  The presentation is nice and the fluid physics seem to be pretty spot on.  They react how you expect them to react and do so reliably each time which is important for physics based gameplay like this.  It seems like it would be a simple concept that would be difficult to find challenge in, but the levels do up the ante as you progress.  Very early in I was presented with a few that really had me scratching my head a bit.  But they weren't so difficult that I left the experience frustrated.Most importantly, the dev is very responsive to the community and you can tell they are very passionate about the game.  I had a small scoring issue which I posted about and got a reply within hours.  The bug was not only fixed within the week but followed up on in the comment thread by the dev to let me know.  It's a pleasure to support devs who are so active with their community and willing to fix things even when they can't replicate the bugs we're seeing.  It's a refreshing change from so many of these unfinished or bug-ridden games that release then wallow for months without updates.  Well worth a purchase if even just to support those qualities that we should be looking for in game devs.  It doesn't hurt that it's pretty fun to boot.			"

												This game has the basics of a good game, with some interesting ideas of mixing and gravity to get all the liquids to their targets, but has many downfalls that make the game terrible. The main issue is that some of the levels seem to be impossible to complete, mostly mixing issues where the base liquids you need to complete the levels are not present in the level.A step below that is on tar levels where it is horrendously difficult to get all of the tar into the jar due to the shape and stickyness of the tar. Some other flaws that make the game trivial are the lack of limits on pulling and drawing. I don't know how you are supposed to manuever the boxes to locks, because I just pushed them with the infinite platforms you can make. After that is the infinite pulling ability you have, combined with the previous fact lets you complete any level by making buckets and then pulling any liquid from bucket to bucket as necessary.The sound is also fairly low quality, music getting repetitive and if there's a lock on the level you have to hear whatever machine sound effect is used over the music for the entire level.

												Bloop Reloaded is a very colorful puzzle game in which you will use the physics to solve several levels. This game has very nice art as you can see from the preview screenshots. The concept of potion-making, the art and the music combine to yield an atmosphere that is also quite joyful. It will make you want to play some more, even when you are struggling on a surprisingly not-so-easy level.Regarding the learning curve, I think it would ideally need a bit of tinkering, and that's actually the only negative point I've seen in the game so far. This is also probably one of these things that are too difficult to fix on an already-released game, but I hope the developers will take their customers' opinions into account for their next game.The progression between some levels was a bit weird, although you can just avoid playing these and play the next ones if you're stuck. But let's be honest, 1. I prefer playing the levels in the order they were supposed to be played and 2. it's not so much that the puzzles are difficult, it's more that sometimes it can get a bit tricky to do exactly what you plan, especially when the fluids manage to flow to places they weren't supposed to be able to go to. I've been building more barricades than a revolutionary while playing Bloop. The physics of the game can be quite unforgiving... In particular, there was one level I spent what felt like almost half an hour on (the first level where you're supposed to mix the star-potion with the blue shiny potion) because the potions kept leaking to the bottom of the level in quite fascinating ways. After these somewhat-30 min, I thought I was reaching more complex levels, but it still ended up being followed by a few 30-second levels. This is a bit weird in term of learning/difficulty curve (but I still had fun trying to figure out what was happening with these crazy potions flowing everywhere except where they were supposed to).Anyway, except for these one or two levels that seem a bit out of place but still manage to teach you valuable information for the rest of the game and increase your barricade-building skill level by 25, this game is a really nice one that I would recommend to anyone who likes physics-based puzzle games. The developer probably tried hard to give a real identity to their game... and they succeeded. Bloop Reloaded really is a nice game, with both great gameplay and amazing aesthetics.			"

I was supplied with this key by the developer, this however did not affect the review. All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWBloop ReloadedThis game is similar to classics like Lemmings. You guide an oject to an objective. The main difference between this game and Lemmings is that while Lemmings deals mostly with a programming aspect to guide the objects to the objective, Bloop Reloaded uses physics to guide liquids. You must create platforms to guide the liquids to the bottle, avoiding hazards and sometimes mixing to liquids to get an end product. Aside from the pre-level setup of platforms, the player can use the right mouse button to pick up and move quantities of the liquid.═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros The ambient music is greatCons The mechanics are poorly explained The right mouse button mechanic defeats the puzzle aspect of the game Instead of a cooldown for the right mouse button mechanic, you must hunt down and left click on floating ojects to gain more time that this ability can be active═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game suffers a few design flaws that make it less fun to play. Being able to pick up the liquids and move them around defeats the need to solve a puzzle. If Lemmings allowed such a function, the game would not have been as successful. The fact that this ability can be active for a certain amount of time and then be recharged hurts the gameplay. Having the skill slowly recharge would make the skill more interesting than having to switch tasks to find the skill recharge items. It plays like two distantly related minigames that are expected to be perceived as a whole game. I really like puzzle games for their need to plan out how to complete a level, but the right mouse button skill negates the need to really plan for anything.3/10═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !

Bloop Reloaded is a decent puzzle game with a nice concept, colorful graphics and fitting music. Its goal is to brew potions and fill the test-tubes using your drawn lines or carrying mechanics which could use some improvements, however, I still found it pretty enjoyable.6/10 "

“Once upon a time, in an unnamed fantasy universe there was a shopkeeper, who was out of potions. And it was a pretty big deal sine he sold nothing but potions. Guess what, you are the shopkeeper! At least for now. End of story. I’m an extremely untalented storywriter. It’s better for both of us if I just shut up now. Seriously.”Let’s have a moment to appreciate the developer’s honesty and humor on the story-telling. Bloop Reloaded Is a Puzzle and Physics game that includes: a lovely art style and very encouraging animations. The gameplay involves you doing various tasks, such as: Moving fluids to their designated potion bottle - creating a path for the fluids to slide into their bottles - at harder levels, it will include obstacles too. My personal favourite was the level with the gravity field.The controls are minimal and easy to understand. Players are informed of what to do in most, if not all levels and given clues to their objectives. There should be no question or confusion for the most part.Art and graphics is one of the highlights to this game for me. The splattered effects and animations gives a funky feel to the theme, along with the fluorescent colour schemes. The gradients and mixtures you would get from mixing two colours is one that I find entertaining to witness when playing. There is also the messy aspect too. When you place the blobs onto the opening of the bottle: don’t be surprised to see some of the fluid oozing down on the sides and having to pick them up again. That, with other unintended leaking and spills.The game play is also accompanied by light-hearted music, which alternates time to time as you progress through the levels. You can expect to hear a lot of splash while you move or drop fluids and they hit a surface. The game does fulfill the audio aspect for the atmosphere of the game.To wrap things up - You can say that I have a ‘chemistry’ with puzzle games. Hence, why this game caught my interest with the theme design. It’s simple and stunning. I recommend playing Bloop Reloaded. "

												Can't reccomend this game. Concept is decient but some of the game mechanics is rubbish. The ""pull stuff"" mechanic of the game moves it from a puzzle game to a frustrating trial and error game. Additionally the fact that you have to recharge your pull force makes this mechanic even worse.			"

												The visuals are very nice, with vivid colors and surreal landscapes, though it can be hard telling what counts as a foreground object and what's merely a background detail.Unfortunately, everything else about this game ranks between ""mediocre"" to ""inept"". The music is the same unimaginative minimalist orchestral stuff you hear in every other puzzle game these days. The gameplay itself is cluttered and confused, with clashing mechanics (the ""click and drag your water to the target"" mechanic is just astoundingly awful, and the ""click these random blobs to refill your click-and-drag meter is jarringly out of place and seems to serve no real purpose), and the level design comes across as thoughtless and random, like playing random community-generated maps in other games.If the devs had stuck to what works (building platforms on surreal landscapes to guide water to the target) and focused on designing levels that were thoughtful and shaped along a natural difficulty curve, this would be a fun little casual time-waster. But this game is a good example of ""more is less"", and the asking price of $9.99 drags it down from ""mediocre"" to ""hahahahahaha absolutely not"".			"

												This is not the worst of the great plague of ""indy"" low effort 2D platformers, but it most certainly is one of them.This one has you bouncing around a lot effort set of platforms (seriously guys get over the retro 2D platformer design, it's been done).   This game doesn't make 2D platformers better, but it does make gaming worse. The difference? You can draw some lines and change the layout slightly - basically like tablet games have been doing for about 5 years.  Nothing really new. Props for support for 4K.  Slops for low effort, boring platformer with no imagination, crappy controls, grabbing your HOTAS and assuming your throttle, stick and pedals were plugged in so you could play a low effort platformer (seriously wtf, l2gamedeveloper).  And locking your controls to that HOTAS and not letting you change away from them.  So very bad.Do not buy, waste of money.			"

												(This review is brought to you by Indiegala.  Thanks, guys!)Is...it bad that I recognize the main menu theme as the narrative music to the hentai game ""Magic Shop""?Bloop Reloaded is a physics game similar to Trine (Wizard mode) and Beep, except it has no on-screen character.   The gameplay is simply about filling flasks and keeping various liquids separate while fusing other liquids by simply drawing line platforms and levitating liquids to their respective targets.The difficulty of Bloop Reloaded is medium to hard, depending on if you want to 100% it or not (You WILL have trouble on the final level) and you may be busy between 5 to 8 hours trying to beat/complete this particular title.Problems with this particular title include plenty of typos (2 levels have the same name), difficulty balancing in various areas (last level has crappy physics).  You might also find yourself bored/frustrated with this title.  Make sure to play in small bursts...So...do I recommend Bloop Reloaded?  Yes, but only if it's for a massive discount since asking price is way too much ($10).   $0.50-$1.00 will be much more appropriate for Bloop Reloaded.  Although I do recommend it, there are much better games that you can purchase/play instead.  Buyer beware:  Replayability is severely low.5/10  A short-lived, over-priced, liquid-based physics puzzle game involving frustration and precision.			"

Just a bad variation of Bloop - which is bad game anyway.It's bad game because... well... it has even worse tutorial than Bloop... I wondered how to restart level and I tried ""R"", checked ""ESC""... no... it's the same button you start flow of ""liquid"".Whole thing about ""physics"" here is that liquid... but hell, you will have to pull it to higher ground with it's ""epic"" mechanic of pulling it - which makes game tedious, cause you will try to get those liquid parts to specific place, having to use pull multiple times... and to refill that power you need to click some stones that appears when it runs out...The good thing would be graphics... maybe? And if game was good, it would be useful to have Level Editor, but in bad mechanically game... it's redundant.			"
