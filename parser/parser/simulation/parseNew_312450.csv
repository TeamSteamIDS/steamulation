Note:For full disclosure, I have never played any of the Panzer General titles (which seems to be the point of comparison for most players). Instead I will review this game based on its own merits.TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Order of Battle: Pacific is a Turn-Based Strategy Game (TBS) developed by The Aristocrats and published by Slitherine Ltd. It features the classical hex-based gameplay with a dynamic campaign mechanic and technology system that changes depending on player choices and game style.Play either as the US-led Allied Powers in their desperate attempt to fend off the invading Japanese Empire and liberate the lost Allied territories or, on the other hand, play as Imperial Japan and alter the course of history as you lead it to ultimate victory over the Pacific theater of World War II.PROS:+ Graphics and art style is well suited for the genre+ Streamlined gameplay but with enough complexity on the game mechanic to give it depth such as, but not limited to: Supply Chains Flanking Terrain difficulties Unit Fatigue Unit Experience and Reinforcement mechanic 'Digging-in' / Unit Fortification Range Penalties (for ships) Maneuvers and Evasion system (for ships) Fuel system (for planes)+ Lengthy campaign time for both the Japanese and the Allies+ Dynamic campaign with secondary objectives that yields both benefits and consequences on the up-coming battles+ Unit variation with different skills and attributes+ Satisfying naval combat+ Relatively accurate historical campaign scenarios+ Hotseat multiplayer supportCONS:- AI has suicidal tendencies such as, but not limited to: (Note: I played on Difficulty 3 on my first playthrough and 4 on my second) Forcing 1 health units back to into battle where perfectly healthy units could have taken its place Not reinforcing wounded units Abandoning tactically advantageous / well entrenched positions- Bug that causes substantial FPS drop after the AI's turn (solved by simply saving and loading)- Limited hotkeys- Multiplayer is limited to 2 vs 2- Tutorial is a bit lacking in information (though it was presented in a really good fashion)- No Godzilla unit if you're playing as JapanNEUTRAL:-/+ No undo button (the game will require you to think before you act. 'Touch-move' as it is called in chess)-/+ No voice acting during the campaign briefing.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes highly RECOMMENDED for strategy fans and World War II game fans.  Order of Battle: Pacific is a deep hex-based strategy game that features a lot of strategic and tactical complexity that results in a satisfying experience.  I can RECOMMEND this game even at full price since the $39.99 or your regional equivalent price tag is well worth the game time it gives you, however, if you feel that the price is too steep, then wait for a SALE and purchase it if the price goes down to $29.99 or your regional equivalent.--------------------------------------------------------- Like our Reviews?

												I would like to start off with saying I  a form of dyslexia  from a head back tramua I received in 2004  so excuse the grammer and spelling ,with this being said I want give this game a fair honest review .  I am the person when reading reviews I look at how long the player played the game , amount of games as well as how many reviews . I have been wanting this game for 6 months or more but could not afford the full price . I pay for my games do not get them in exchange for a 30 minute play and possitive review. Okay first seen a lot of negitve game reviews about FREE Game and all you get is the ""Boot Camp ""  on steam I did too . But since I play a lot of the games from Matrix I subscribe to the news letter ,They stated you get the first senerio of every DLC or base game . I deleted local content here went to Slitherine  down loaded there version , Bam got all the first senerios .and a Steam code as well as registerd copy from them . I forget the marine mission but was nice fast good learning mission . You get  Pearl Harbor  in the WWII pacific campiagn , You do not do to much but learn some movement  activation of air fields then you get to dog fight , you get slaughterd  But save a battle ship at least one . It takes you into the next mission as you set up says need to buy this DLC .Okay what they did was brak up the game give you a tatse of it lowered prices on the different campiagns now offered .I bought one the WWII pacific  it follows the major battles . I am about 4-5 mission into the game still learning and redoing the mission for 4th time on easy . This is much like a board game before computers you need think out your moves and replacments renforcements ,upgrade as well . you get only so many and depends on the mission also . The game follows real time for new Items you can deploy .  Now I like turn based startery games ,graphics are 9/10  the game and developers  try to balence game play with real life /game life .example  people have complianed about dive bombers being able to bomb drop several times until fuel runs out there is a counter saying how many turns you have left before you need get back to a friendly landing site ,if not you start losing planes until they all go down. They (Devs) explian this in the forum on the web site. I am still learning all the little details this game  has to offer, such as a button you slick on the chosen unit to rest/sleep . when not in front line this is handy to simulate a Hot meal and shower . My dad was in every major engagement as a marine . They were almost always short of supply ,medical, weapons  Supply plays big part in the game make sure you have good supply for the ZOC  in combat areas .  I seen some compliants about a poor AI ,  saying units attack for no reason under manned will lose . Hey this is the Japanese Marines  fanatics . Play more then one senerio and find out the unit that just charged you . well you WON  but you got no rest suffered  a ""shock"" rating  used vauable supply for your attack.  now you resupply for a turn meanwhile the AI  moved in fresh supplied troops into the gap  you lost the advatage . I found out the hard way keep your resource points up and units ready in reserve . You get beaten just by not being able to throw in 1-2 units of fresh troops for others to R&R .another gripe I read you can add units any place Nope  at the starting point and in cities areas that have enough Supply to support them . exception are Marine Raders and airborne . they do not suffer from supply penilties . they are not cheap but when you need keep a couple to get in behind the Japanese to mees there supply /I could go on and on  this game is not COH2 or the assult squad serise , RTS game it is not . not meant to be It is the old style board games you played with your dad when growing up before computers . The computer does the math , and has a tuff AI system that you may not under stand why you need do this !! because later in the war it will make life easier .Example . I saved a few Battle ships at Pearl damaged but afloat . Surprise  at Coral sea I got one where there was not one in History . It gave me the advantage I needed  to win , not just a draw Needed take two jap carriers I took out 3 and some heacy capital crusuers damaged the  Yamottoe (SP)  from 10 yo a 2 so it will not come into the game for a long time if it does at all . Okay  sugestion down load from Slitherine to get all the free stuff regirster here  . Play it sleep on it then pick out one DLC you like for 10 bucks on DLC cannot go wrong  You will also get a few Mods free installed  ""Battle of Britian ""by devs Oh it looks really simple a senerio maker . you can even submit battles to the forum sorry for ramble Just hate negitive reviews when the person plays it for less then a hour or does not even  ? where are the rest of free dlc stuff Bob C Crazy bear Flutes			"

												Look at the people's reviews with high hours played - including myself who has 555 hours booked on Steam plus I was a beta tester for most expansions  booking over another 100 hours.  This is an outstanding turn based war game and the next generation to Panzer General and Panzer Corp.  If you want a great war game with realistic rules of supply and logistics that nevertheless do not bog you down in minutae - this is it - excellent play on land / sea / and air.Also highly recommended for military veterans who want a taste of the authentic.  ( such as me - retired Royal Canadian Engineers )On the other hand if you are looking for another FPS, something with tactics a 5 year old can understand or just anything with ""free"" in the description please look elsewhere.Look at this face - did I ever lie to you?  I rate this game as 9 / 10 and getting better			"

												Probably the best hex turn based strategy game. Really I did not think it was possible to improve upon Panzer General mechanics, but with brilliant supply system, changing scenario conditions and secondary objectives that allow for changes in how the battle goes (need more of these!), events (again, more of this), true FOW (my planes flew over that village saw no one, now my infantry rides the truck and gets ambushed - brilliant) - the game is a gem. Sure it needs more polish, it should not be so hardware hungry with this level of graphics but there are no ideal games as there are no ideal people. The only minus is the way developer may handle DLCs - I hope you guys dont run too greedy - keep adding additional free stuff or set the price of DLC to 5 bucks, this will do you more good at the end mark my words.

												This game was unexpectedly slick! Well done!!! Take this game engine and remake the Steel Panthers series and then you'll be on to something!! *edit* 8/18/15 After beating both main campaigns I can say that the scenarios were interesting and very well balanced and designed. With a few of them I had to restart 2 or 3 times to get a force mixture that would allow me to win, but it was fun and not tedious. Many scenarios are really long, upto 60 turns+ and after a few missions I realized that the longer they were the more fun I knew I was going to have! Played it long into the night and even first thing in the morning it was the most fun I've had since Panzer General 2. Hats off to the devs hope to see more from them!			"

												There are very good reviews that have come before mine, and many have composed their reviews with the Panzer General series in mind. For fans of that series, please do read those other excellent reviews. In my review, I'll attempt to cater to World War II history buffs out there, who have not tried any of the Panzer General titles, but are likely fans of the more mainstream Sid Meier's Civilization V.As  a Civ V fan and someone who has always been fascinated by World War II, I love Order of Battle: Pacific because it takes the best elements of the excellent combat system in Civ V, and enhances that experience further with certain mechanics that we all wish we could have had in Civ V. By the way, did I mention that this game focuses on WWII? And did I mention that this game is set in the Pacific Theatre of Operations -- a theatre largely (and sadly) ignored in the World War II game genre?Here is a list of some of the major, familiar combat mechanics common with Civ V that contribute to this excellent simulation:Hex-based (making maneuvering and placement an important element of your strategy)Effects on terrain on movement, cover, defense, efficiency, line-of-sight, etc.Unit stacking rulesFlanking bonuses/penaltiesSimulation of embarkation, disembarkation, river crossingsSupporting fire from nearby unitsZone of control...and here is a list of some of the major combat mechanics we wish we had in Civ V that further enhance the overall experience:HEXES CAN BE CAPTURED! (true Civ V fans know what this is about)A well-simulated supply mehcanic/system (and unique rules for land, air and sea to boot)... and caputred hexes come into play here as well!!!The effect of supply accesibility on units' combat efficiencyMines can be laid (and can affect everyone, even the original mine-layer)More evident effects of entrenchmentMovement affects efficiencyA service/combat history log for individual units!Unit renaming and personalizationSpecial rules for special forces/recon units...and many more!In summary, for those of you who loved the combat system of Civ V, but have also been craving a game where you could just focus on combat strategy (and World War II strategy at that), this is the game for you. The added combat elements and mechanics enhance the overall experience even further, and make this game a must buy for World War II history buffs and turn-based strategy game fans out there.Don't get turned off by the (seemingly) steep price tag on this game, it is well worth the money you will pay.

												Okay, let's get the white elephant in the room addressed first. When the game was ""Order of Battle: Pacific"" it was a product you bought (or bought a pass to, knowing Steam's EULA) and had a couple of DLC. No issue.Then came the rebranding of the product and the misnomer ""Free to Play"". It's ""Free To Try"", as you play the Tutorials and the first missions of each Campaign (DLC). First off, the Tutorial is a Campaign in itself, though the enemy is labelled as OPFOR from your own side. Doesn't change the fact that you are fighting to win large maps, and atste of each DLC is generous.So, in a way it is ""Free To Play"", but to the entitled gamer this is offensive. They want a free game - complete. That's just not going to happen, guys and gals.Next thing is the comparison with firstly ""Panzer General"" and it's successors, including my favourite ""People's General"". Let's face it, these titles broke new ground for PC gamers and will never be bested (except for ""Panzer General 3D"", which was devicive on release and is still an acquired taste).So closest comparison really is ""Panzer Corps"" with it's trainload of DLC. ""PC"" to me is more a puzzle-based strategy. Once you've worked out the solution to the maps, you'll never replay them. The maps are also very large, on the whole with a plethora of units. Grand Strategy is the go with ""PC"" and it might not appeal to evryone, epecially with the puzzle-based approach.""OoB:WWII"" doesn't take the puzzle approach but is pure tactics, and less Grand Strategy. Having played all the games mentioned, and many, many others I enjoy ""OoB"" far more than ""PC"", but that's my personal taste. It's fun, it's hefty with all the campaigns and thre is much scope for all of WWII, including the lesser known theatres (""The Winter War"" was a brave and excellent choice, as the Finnish struggle is far too neglected). It is an improtant one in that it showed the world, Germany most importantly, that despite it's size the Soviet Army was largely ineffective.A top game (and I love the ""Battle of Britain"" free Mod), and while not perfect (what is?) if you're a strategy gamer you should find hours of fun to be had here for a raction of the price of a board game with the same breadth.

												Order of Battle: Pacific is quite simply, awesome! I have been playing war games for a very long time now, {over 25 years} and I can honestly say that this gamr, Order of Battel: Pacific, is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games for the WWII era. All of the best features of the Panzer General/Pacific General series can be found here all rolled into one nice little package. I have always loved turn based war games, but found that you usually got your choice between great land battles with awesome units, and a smattering of small sea skirmishes with wimpy naval and air units {Panzer Corp/Steel Panthers} or you go heavy on the Naval units with token land battles and very basic infatry/tanks {Pacific General}. In Order of Battle:Pacific you get both: great land combat representation AND a killer Naval/Air Corp to compliment your force of ground fighters. With over 550 units represented, fans of Army, Navy, and Air corps war games are sure to find something to love. All core units level up and stand a chance of gaining a commander through a random chance generator {ala Panzer General}. I like that, I always have where war games are concerned. It gives you a feeling of story and a real attachment to certrain units as they level and gain heroes/commanders. It's the hallmark of good game design and programming like this that really puts you into the game and makes you feel like you are a part of the story and not just watching it unfold. OoB:P really shines in this area. Also, they have made some long over due improvesments to TBS wargaming.For one thing, after you have clicked on a unit and ordered it to attack an enemy unit, you no longer need to wait for the graphic of battle to play out before moving onto another unit and another battle. Simply click and battle as fast as you like! And the sound FX are AMAZING! They will maintain the current battle noises AND incorporate all other ongoing battle noises as you go! At one point, i had artillery, tanks, infantry AND a dog fight involving a Navy Wildcat vs. Japanese Zero all being rendered at the same time! It truly sounded like a battle was taking place. Also, the sound FX for each type of unit are different according to the seperat specs of the unit. An allied Bearcat sound different that a Wildcat, and a Zero sound different that a Corsair. Even the bomber sound different than each other. so do the engine sound of a destroyer, cruiser, and battleship. They are all different! I dont know who did this, but it must have been a massive effort. And it is just another reason OoB:P draws you into the story so completely. Finally, there is one really nice touch that will appeals to WWII historians like myself: anniversary DLC. On the dates of some important WWII events, OoB:P will release anniversary campaigns to be played comemorating the event. The most recent being the Battle of Britain. At this time, I have not played this expansion, but feel confident it will be up to the same high standards as the rest of the games content.Overall, as I have already stated, Order of Battle: Pacific is the pinnacle of WWII turn based strategy gaming. A true Grandslam homerun for The Aristocrats and Slitherine Ltd. Well done my friends, well done indeed. "

Posted: July 8, 2016
												A note - the game is ""Free to Try"".  It's ""Free to Play"" only the tutorials and a sample scenario of every campaign, with individual purchase of campaigns.  Essentially, a free demo with the ""real game' as DLC. (Although you can choose not to buy the more expensive original game and only buy the later DLC campaigns if you want.) As someone who plays both the ""absurdly complex"" hardcore strategy games you need to spend 10 hours reading the manual to even start playing and seemingly-simple-but-actually-deep, colorful strategy games like Advance Wars, I can say this fits into a comfortable middle-ground that is approachable, yet not quite as goofy and gamey as Advance Wars. (So no, you can't block a panzer division by keeping a plane on the one bridge to your base since air and land/sea units are on different layers.) This game has definite ""I'm tired, but just one more turn an- oh, God, does the clock say 4 AM?!"" potential.  The game really does lean more the ""Advance Wars"" route, with the clear-cut unit types and one-unit-per-tile (excepting air units flying over land or sea units) that generally have rock-paper-scissors vulnerabilities to one another.  Battleships cost only a few times as much as destroyers, which are on par with infantry units in cost.  Expensive tanks are countered by cheap AT guns that can interrupt attacks against neighboring units while on the defense, but are severly vulnerable on offense and generally just eaten by infantry.  Unlike Advance Wars, where Infantry was just there to capture towns, infantry are totally viable and actually a highly deadly unit since they are more generally flexible and don't have a whole class of units designed specifically as their counter.  More than Advance Wars, the game also has an ""efficiency"" score that really serves as a combined/abstracted organization/morale/supply meter.  Artillery, strategic bomber, and naval bombardment all deal less direct damage than they disorganize/demoralize the enemy for your infantry to storm in.One thing that the game does very well in comparison to many other ""serious"" hex-based historical strategy games is incorporate land and sea forces into the same battles fairly well.  Land units can spawn their own transports at ports, and sail to beaches to land and invade new islands, a somewhat gamey, but highly strategically interesting prospect.  Along the way, they're at the mercy of naval units, which are also capable of heavily bombarding coastal emplacements when not fighting for naval supremacy. This game also features ""core units"", which are units you keep from scenario to scenario in a campaign, gaining experience.  You can even rename them, which I highly recommend doing, as having your favorite tanks and ships (named after your dog or friends or favorite fictional characters) pull through the war with elite status makes it more enjoyable. It also makes moments where the unit is in real trouble far more tense, and keeps you far more invested in the well-being of your troops in a game that otherwise tends to prioritize speed of advance over keeping your troops in a cohesive state.With all that said, there are some weaknesses; The AI doesn't rely upon a single general strategic script that is rather sophisticated like they do in Advance Wars, instead, units are assigned to individual scripts that tend to be extremely single-minded.  On scenarios where you are on offense, the AI often just sits in place and waits for you to come and swarm them, with the exception of the units that really need to sit in place, the AT and AA guns that bizarrely are super-aggressive and break out of their entrenched positions so your infantry can obliterate them more easily.  Likewise, the game relies upon giving you very limited units, but letting you repair them with absurd ease, provided you have the cash.  Since you have a super-low unit cap, however, once you've deployed your units, there's literally nothing else to spend that money upon, anyway.  The naval combat in particular feels like it needs a rebalance; There's almost no role for cruisers at all.  Battleships are just clearly better at ranged surface gun battles, and cruisers aren't significantly less expensive enough in comparison to battleships (especially in the ever-so-crucial unit cap department) while they are significantly less effective in combat.  Destroyers redeem themselves with sub-hunting, torpedoes, torpedo-blocking, and cheap repairs to justify themselves, but cruisers are left in the cold.  And when I say ""cruisers"", I mean ""heavy cruisers"".  Light cruisers aren't even available for purchase!  Too bad if you're an Atlanta or Agano fan, they aren't there.  Likewise, if you're a naval buff, you'll find that many units become ""obsolete"" and removed from the lists of purchasable units when they really shouldn't be.  Having the air force phase out the A5Ms for A6M (zeros) makes sense, as does making new infantry units come equipped with the year's latest model of panzerfaust.  Ships, however, weren't so easily replaced.  If you want a Fubuki, you better buy one in the first mission, even if you can't really use it there, because it goes obsolete by the second mission!Logistics exists, although I'm not entirely sure why. It is nearly always a non-factor since you have a super-low unit cap and essentially always start out with more supply than you need for your whole army, and then are sent out to capture more cities that expand your supply more.  It would only matter if you used paratroopers or landing craft to outflank the enemy by taking towns and using supply ships and destroyers to supply the troops as they became established... which the game's scenarios basically never allow to be a sane option.  It feels like a totally wasted oportunity, since this game does combined forces combat so well, but fails to capitalize upon it with true land/sea/air combined scenarios, instead splitting them into a ""naval battle before the landing"" scenario and then a ""land battle after the landing"" scenario, and skipping the landing portion entirely.   (I say this not having played the Marines DLC yet, however - that may change things.)			"

												I'm not sure why this game is getting such positive reviews.  I'm a super fan of Panzer Corps with over 400 hours of play.  This game on the other hand, which should be similar is not very good.  The AI is ridiculously non-existant and should be called artificial non-intelligence.  The enemy litterally dosen't respond to weak points in your lines, it just plods on to objectives and does so poorly. You can easily just sit out of sight range and destroy carriers and ships with little reaction by the enemy. The game does allow you to change the difficulty level, but that doesn't change the AI, it just give them better combat multipliers to cause more and take less damage.Other issues I've encountered: - The amount of battles to gain any XP to improve your units has little effect through most of the campaign.- Recon units don't gain XP.- Tactical bombers lay waste to ships, but do little to nothing against just about everything else.- You are placed in situations where they have a large amount of slots for units to control, but you have don't have the money to buy even close to enough units to use the slots (early on in the campaign).- damaged ships dont fight at reduced capabilty, ie why should a BB or CV with 1 hp, be able to perform everything a ship at full health can?I have only played the campaigns as thats what I bought the game for so maybe the AI is better in the scenarios.Bugs:- US engineers destroy a bridge and the game locks up. I've actually had the Japanese campaign not respond after winning scenarios and it requires you to restart the whole campaign, only to have it do the same thing later in the campaign.- Land planes on ship and when they take off the unit is flying around, but a ghost of the unit takes up a spot on any carrier it lands on taking up aircraft space.I really want to love this game, but it seems to me like it's still in Beta.

												Aside from Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon, I was quite unfamiliar with the Order of Battle games. It wasn't until I saw the Morning Sun expansion, which involves the Japanese invasion of the Chinese Mainland, that I realized I need to play these games. I have not regretted one, single hour. Order of Battle is a wargame in the same vein as the Panzer Corps games so veterans will feel right at home reqqing in troops and trying to overcome superior AI to complete objectives that vary from Defend these Points, Wipe out this many units or simply take these cities. You have control of an absolutely ludicrous amount of units for each faction which allows you to customize your force, from battle to battle, in whatever way you choose. Are you more of an Air General who likes to command squadrons of aircraft to bomb enemy positions and maintain air superiority or are you a more aggressive general who focuses on overwhelming tank assaults to capture objectives? I'm personally the latter. In all seriousness, the unit variation between each playable faction is downright impressive. If you've played WH40k: Arma, you're probably familiar with what I'm talking about and it should be said, the unit variation is one of this game's best features. I also love the focus of the expansion being in the rather ignored Japanese Invasion of China before and during WW2. This allows the devs to really bring a more unique view to WW2, especially since you play as the Japanese. Order of Battle: Pacific also features a completely new and updated graphics engine that is full of great animations, burning tank/plane carcasses as battles drag on. This is a huge improvement for me over Armageddon because the animations really bring the battles to life. What's better, if you're not a fan of it, you can even switch to a more classic 2D mode through the options menu. There is also a campaign in the game which is were you'll be spending a majority of your time. The campaign doesn't really allow you to choose where to fight except in a few rare occasions, it's more of a mission to mission set up. However, units are persistent and units depleted at the end of the last mission will be depleted at the start of the new mission but will also be more effective than just requisitioning inexperienced units.I only have two complaints in regards to the game. The first being, some of the missions feel like they drag on for far too long. For example, the first mission in the American campaign was kind of drag and it might be because Pearl Harbor isn't exactly untread territory. It also feels like that the AI calculations can eat up large portions of time inbetween turns and this feels like it lengthens a missions required completion time to double. Some may find that to be a negligible complaint but for me, it's a really nagging one. In summary, this is a blast of game and I'm glad I got the chance to experience it! I truly cannot wait to see what other expansions are released for it. I wouldn't mind seeing some more ""What-if?"" scenarios either.Gameplay Footage:

												I've been following this game for over a year and am happy with my purchase. It's basically Panzer General in the Pacific with better graphics AND:-Generals with abilities that affect the unit it is attached to and those around him. You can switch which unit he is attached to at the beginning of each scenario.-Specializations that you can unlock-More random events-choose which objectives to pursue from a predetermined list at the start of each scenario. You can gain cool abilities from some of them and cripple the opposing army, but   you won't always be able to complete them all. You will have to make tough choices as to which objectives you want to (or can) complete.-Much needed supply line mechanic-More strategic air and sea battles. I'm just diving in, but can tell you that there are slight variations in the mechanics of different units and situations that add to the strategy.I was initially concerned about the length of the game, but can happily report that I'm only into the third mission of the training campaign and already have enjoyed several hours of play time. It really is a nice game and right up my, ""point and click/ strategy"" alley. It keeps to a successful formula and builds on it. Like Panzer General and Panzer Commander before it, you can:-carry over units from one mission to the next (including their damage/kill stats).-gain veterency and upgrade units-attach generals with special abilities (in Panzer General you gained a random hero, which would attach himself to a unit who gained veterency. But the hero would be stuck to that unit. You couldn't reassign him like you can a general/captain/ace in this game).The only downside is the price for a game like this. While other Indie houses are charging around 20 bucks for similar titles, The Artistocrats are partnered with Slitherine. This means a chunk of the profits have to be split with another party; thus the higher price point. Unfortunately, this means that this really solid game won't reach as many people who haven't played this type of game before...at least anytime soon. They will all wait until this dips to about 20 bucks.  By then, development on a new game will be underway and the funds needed for future updates and dlc won't be as great. I really hope I'm wrong about this because it's a fun game and I'm looking forward to additional content!			"

												(I have played this game outside of Steam, so don't be surprised I have so little time on it in here)This is a very, very good game.It follows the tried and trusted rules made famous by Panzer General but expands them and introduces stuff like supply lines, sonar, torpedos, encircling etc. without being too complex.It features very nice graphics, sweet animations and two beautiful campaigns.Everything just feels ""right"" about this game, most of the buttons are where you would expect them, the info is there where you want it and it is very intuitive. Sure, there will be some minor bugs, but it feels very polished already. I am sure I am going to have a blast with this one.So buy it and support this developer, they deserve it!			"

												It is really sad so many people are giving negative reviews for a a free starter that gives you an introduction to the real game.  Check out the reviews for each campaign and you'll see real reviews.I absolutely 100% suggest people get this game it is fantastic.  Just remember it is basically a demo with a tutorial to let you see if you like the concept of what the game entails.  It's a great idea for war-games with a minimal crowd to give them a shot at trying outside of a full and proper (separate) demo download.			"

												Just found this gem. Don't know how I missed it before. Am an old-schooler who played Panzer General (Remember the old huge boxes games used to come in at Electronics Boutique, etc?) and later Panzer Corp. If you liked those then you'll like this one. All the moreso given the derth of these kinds of games these days...It's turn-based. Thank God.You play through a series of scenarios with some carry through based upon special objectives from previous scenarios (so you can improve your situation in the future if you did well in the past--like take out the other team's cruiser which will not be there to bother you in a later mission).You can assign special commanders to units, Units can get experience over time which can be maintained or diluted depending upon how you replenish their depletions. You can even have your entire force improved with other strategic bonuses that are earned. It's all good stuff you'd expect. Some new aspects over Panzer Corp and others of the like:Red line showing your front moving and indicating what areas are in and not in supply.Supply ships and supply depots which once captured take a little time to kick-in but once they do you can move up deployment points and get additional supply points for existing troops.These are realistic additions that make it play more like a real war than a computer game. Very interesting. Graphics are nice, but I'm not as needful in this regard as the kiddies today.I only have two issues with it being about 7 1/2 hours in (which puts you in the midst of the final battle apparently of this free ""bootcamp"" demo):1) They did a great job of including both 1 and 2 button mouse control schemes for the interface but I am still sending units to the wrong place every once and a while (something that can't be undone due to fog of war exposure). This may actually be MY issue stemming from my time playing some other game with a different scheme but maybe they can help fix this somehow. It's frustrating when it happens, and like I said it might just be my issue but I can't think I'm alone in doing this.2) the DLC breakout is a clear monetization strategy and I think it will only hurt them. Make a discrete game and charge a fair price for it. For example: European theatre, Pacific theatre. Boom! Two games $39.99 apiece and put them on sale periodically. It's not rocket surgery. This DLC business is just making everyone cynical. We didn't have any of this back in the day. Wanna see someone who knows how to still do business who wants to incorporate DLC? Look to is it Triumph Studios? The Age of Wonders III people. They are the gold standard in Turn based. Follow their lead.Recommended. This is a free demo. If you like turn-based you must try it out.EDIT: I should add that I have not played this game enough to fully evaluate the AI.			"

												I must admit I was somewhat wary of trying OOB: WWII due to some of the negative reviews.  I have been playing strategy/hex games since Panzer General and Norm Kroger's Operational Art of War series, and I must say that playing this game did my heart a whole lot of good.  Modern graphics and animation breathe new life into the genre, as well as a supply system that makes sense and is easy to grasp. For those that play Panzer Corps (myself included) there are some features that will be familiar, but also many more that make the game more robust and realistic than Panzer Corps is at times. The base game is free to download, and includes a bootcamp campaign and sample scenarios for some of the DLC campaigns which will cost you a few dollars.  This is by no means a bait and switch, as many people who have written reviews seem to think.  This is actually an extended demo with a generous amount of content which allows you to get a great feel for the game before deciding whether or not to purchase.  There are a couple of issues which need work on this otherwise fantastic game---1) The game can become very choppy and slow even on machines which exceed the minimum requirements.  Hopefully in the near future the devs can work on optimizing the coding.2) Artillery is quite weak, although in this game its stated purpose is to disrupt enemy efficiency rather than kill them.  Bumping up the killing power slightly would make artillery far more relevant in the game.  As of now, I do not deploy artillery at all unless I have extra command points.9/10  All in all, it is a solid, fun, and addicting game that is well deserving of a try by any strategy fan.   "

												This is one heckuva turn-based strategy game. Veterans of the genre will be impressed by the eye-candy and depth. It's essentially Panzer Corp: Combined Arms reworked to be pretty and have a supply system that makes sense and adds a new dimension to the classic gameplay. Newbies to turn-based strategy will be shocked by the accessibility and learning curve - I can't think of any turn based game easier to learn, but harder to master.As far as the whiner reviews, ignore them. This is worth a try, and if you didn't get what you paid for ($0), that's a statement of your character, not the game.			"

												There's a lot of mis representation in the reviews for this game.  Firstly it should be noted that the 'mixed' reviews are people complaining the game is branded as F2P when in reality it's just a tutorial mission that is available.  I feel that's unfair to the actual content of the game and the reviews should reflect that.  If you don't want to pay to play the game after the tutorial, fine.  Do that.  Don't give the game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review based on your expectation for free content.Since I'm sure most everyone reading this is a fan of the Panzer series, this game is by the same developers as the redux'ed Panzer Corps.  Here's the cut down no filler review.-Game adds a supply system that feed units from nearby towns similar to Unity of Command but without range restrictions.  Instead each unit uses X supply, and connected cities or beached ships provide supply.-The units are 3d animations but are painstakingly slow even at max speed, so combat takes too long.  It's a nice fresh coat to not have the left and right facing effects from older panzer games.-The below reviews complaining about units not doing damage clearly haven't read the manual or understand about having the proper combined support units.  Support class units provide assistance to nearby units, it's important. -There's a more leanient amount of turns than Panzer series for objectives, and most maps have more intricate objectives than just take over the cities. All in all this is a very improved version of the Panzer series formula, with campaign point modifiers to improve your playstyle over the arcing campaign. It's an easy recommendation, but at the caviat of the content of the game is over priced.  The Devs should be ashamed for over charging for that, but the reviewers should check their privelage and review the actual game and not their ego's being damaged for it being listed as F2P.  The winter sale has all the pacific theater on sale for 20 bundled, which is easily worth the value.			"

Verdict:Buy now! Buy on saleSave your moneySummary:Order of Battle Pacific is a fantastic strategy game with satisfying visuals rarely seen in a game of this genre. From ships sinking to planes going down, it's the little touches that are icing on the cake in this game. The game itself stand strong on it's strategy elements, taking your army to war it's up to you on deciding how to spend your resources to get the job done. Do you spend more and build up a strong tank force, or do you put those resources into your air force - you decide.As with the likes of Panzer Corps you take your army from one scenario to the next in the campaign, with the benefit of the unit will have increased its veterancy through combat experience. So when you lose a unit it feels like a real loss and not simply cannon fodder (which arguably is closer to the actual WWII treatment of the common soldier).The interface is clean and friendly, the devs are responsive and actively fix bugs and if you are willing to put some time in to play through the tutorial you will be rewarded with a fun and satisfying gaming experience.This game is fantastic if you are a fan of the genre, but even better if you are new and just looking for a great strategy game - Order of Battle: Pacific will scratch your itch.Overall Score:9.5/10The Good:Great visuals for the genreStrong tutorialInteresting setting (Pacific War) not often explored in gamesDeep gameplay but it doesn't over complicate thingsThe Bad:Although visuals are great for the genre, newer players may find them blandSteep price tag (which tends to come with the genre and niche market)The Ugly:N/A "

												Order of Battle: World War 2 is a turn-based strategy game developed by The Artistocrats and published by Slitherine Ltd. It was released in April 2015. It is set in World War 2 and there are multiple paid DLC campaigns that unlock new settings based on 'What Ifs' in the war. For instance, Winter War is a paid DLC that covers Finland. Order of Battle primarily is free to try, and this means that with the free version you can play the boot camp tutorial campaign and try the various paid campaigns. Furthermore, if you want to play more campaigns you need to buy them and if you want to play multiplayer you need to own at least one DLC.   Gameplay  Order of Battle incorporates fun strategic and realistic elements. Notably, there is an excellent supply system which alters the course of battle. For example, if your army controls one island and want to invade another island, you need supply ships so when you gain a foothold on that other island you can resupply and build units. But, Order of Battles' basic premise is turn-based hexagonal combat. This is very similar to the Civilisation V game in which you build units, capture territory, and move using a turn-based system. Each faction also has specialised units, which relates to the realistic aspect of history. These units, such as the M1 Stuart Tank, have special abilities and obviously are stronger or weaker than other units. For instance, tanks are stronger then infantry. Tactics are essential to outsmarting your enemy and this is also apparent with the enemy AI, which can easily outsmart you and cut your troops off from support. Lastly, I adore the mission completion system. Specifically, in mission two I captured both island checkpoints, but did not complete the optional objective of destroying an enemy submarine. This resulted in the enemy submarine appearing in the following mission, providing a very realistic tone to the game because in war, if a unit retreats he will regroup with the rest for following missions. Overall, I really do like this fresh take on the strategy series through an alternate history turn-based style game. There are multiple consequences to think about, such as whether you complete all objectives, or where you should move onto the map. In other words, choices and tactical thinking matter.  Graphics  Order of Battle features beautiful artwork. The artwork is cartoon-like, which I compare to the upcoming Civilisation VI. The idea of the artwork is that with a more friendly approach to characters and the UI, it allows for more information to be presented to the player in a simple and non-cluttered way. Furthermore, I believe the cartoon-like graphics showcase the brilliance in map design and elements within such as the terrain, the landscape, and even friendly or enemy units.   Conclusion  This is a very good game. I enjoy the gameplay and the alternate take on history through campaigns in various settings. I like the game mechanics in how balanced they are, but also how game mechanics affect the overall game. There are a large amount of units that differ with factions, meaning things are not repetitive, rather each faction feels fresh. The UI is user-friendly and the graphics fit the nature of the game. My only negative with the game is the lack of a free portion. I do not like I have to spend minimum USD$9.99 to play a major campaign or even just play multiplayer. Personally, it turns me off. In saying that, as a mild-loving strategy fan, I highly recommend this game to strategy fans. Furthermore, as I am not one to put hundreds of hours into strategy games nowadays, I do not see this as an everyday must play game, therefore, I recommend the DLCs on sale.As a side-note, I understand I have only played this for about 100 minutes, but I was quick to grasp the game mechanics and overall strategic gameplay style.  Rating  7.5/10  Pros  	- Turn-based gameplay that feels fresh and smooth.	- Beautiful graphics that balance land, units, and information on screen.	- Variety of units that separate factions.  Cons  	- The lack of free content due to the dependency on paid DLC.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Wonderful game. I brought Panzercorps but this is way better.  I'm playing OOB nonstop. Where with Panzercorps, I play only in short burts. I especially like how Order of a Battle implemented supply. Think Unity of Command. Gone is wasting a turn to resupply in the middle of a fire fight like in Panzercorps.  It's abstracted out. As long as you keep your lines,  you are good to fight. The animations are wonderful too. You will be suprised how much enjoyment a well animated unit brings to the game over a static one. The sound is very good as well. The background ambience is well done and mixes well with the great sound effect of the battles. The two knocks are, it is light on content compared to Panzercorps (But  they just  released free dlc and more is on the way).  And the other knock is there 's no steam workshop support, so scenarios made by the community are harder to get, than if it was. Still a great war game that has a lot under the hood			"

												Have not been able to stop playing this game since i bought it.Solid Pacific War Game, maybe ""lite"" by some war strategy game designs.Makes up for it in ease of play, the counters, explosions, sound effects are great, I'm used to Nato symbols, this is much better, much nore immersive, with naming of units you will become attached to them and try to keep them relatively save.Playing on Captain level 3/5 on AI scale, the AI does not always make best use of units, but still fun.Some complaining about naval combat, may not be used to having to search out the enemy in the vast pacific ocean.Also Subs having to find there own Sonar targets works vey well in my opinion, should not be changed.Be careful would be purchasers, you may SINK a lot of time into this one. Campaign as the US is solid so far.System should definitely be expanded to other theatres of war. Had to drag myself from game to type this review.			"

												This is a fantastic wargame. Ignore the most recent bad reviews from the spoiled brats who want to get a full game for free. This is an awesome beer 'n' pretzels type wargame of the same style as the classic Panzer General but it's far, far better. It's even a level above the more recent Panzer Corps which is also a reimagining of Panzer General. This new version allows you to play the Boot Camp campaign which is 4 or 5 scenarios plus the first scenario out of each DLC which currently stands at 4 so you should have about 8 or 9 scenarios to play for the price of free! Give the game a shot-you won't regret it at all.			"

												Order of Battle: Pacific (OoB:P) has one advantage and one advantage alone over competing titles like Panzer Corps, Panzer General and all the other hex strategy games: The revolutionary supply system. The hex field where a unit is or moves through belongs to the player of that unit. That way you can establish areas that are under your control. If a supply source (a town or a supply ship) is within that area, then the units are in supply and can fight at their full strength. When you cut enemy units of from their supply source by moving one or more of your units through the area, that connects their area with the area of their supply source, then their effective combat strength drops radically. This gives tanks e.g. their realistic operational combat value to cut off enemy units and start a battle of encirclement and annihilation. This is great. This is what I had been waiting for in a game for decades. It opens a completely new dimension of strategy.Sadly, this is the only advantage OoB:P has to offer and there are so many disadvantages that wear this great feature down.The waiting time during the enemy's turn:My PC is using an OC i5, 8 GB RAM and an SSD, along with a pretty good graphics card. The waiting time during some turns can be up to 7 minutes. Attention: I'm not talking about a situation where the enemy has 20 units in close combat with mine and needs to figure out a good tactic. I'm talking about where I can see ONE enemy unit on the map and the AI takes 7 minutes for hidden movement in the fog of war. I've read about other player's who claim to have waiting times of 20 to 30 minutes during each turn. A typical battle lasts about 25 turns, but 50 turns and more is not uncommon. To be fair, 7 minutes is, in my case, the absolute maximum. Most times the AI needs maybe a minute. But when these spikes happen, then they come in a row.Predefined tactics:This is - by far - the worst. It's what made me uninstall the game. The developers obviously don't trust the players. They have a very narrow idea of how a battle should be played, e.g. in which order strategic objects should be captured, where a player should send his units and where he MUST NOT send them (or else he will be punished by, and I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, SPAWNING huge amount of enemy troops right before his troops to bash them back where the developers think they belong). Other means how this is enforced are, that the player may not bring specifc CORE units into battle or that he's limited to a very small force until he captures a specific location. There are very often AI controlled units in battles, that fight on your side, but which move at scripted events or times to directions that you can't influence, e.g. they wait for 15 turns and do nothing and then move to attack a small island on the map even though you've already cleared that one out. Result: You've waisted time to clear that island (which was supposed to be attacked by the AI controlled allied units - without telling you before) and now you don't have enough time left to complete the rest of the (secondary) objectives, so you have to restart the battle. Because of this, I had to restart about 3/4 of the battles that I've played. It's extremely frustrating.Stupid and cheating AI:I could put up with the extremely long waiting times during the AI's turn if the AI was smart. But it isn't. I had moments like ""Oh no, if this unit moves two hex to the southeast, then it will cut of my units."" But no. Never have I witnessed one single smart move of the AI but A LOT stupid ones. The AI does two things: A) Attack the weakest unit or the one that has already taken the most damage and B) move to the closest victory location. That's it. A higher difficulty level doesn't mean a smarter AI, it just means better combat multipliers for the enemy (more damage to your units, less damage to theirs). The AI also cheats like hell, e.g. an enemy planes uses its maximum range to fly right next to one of your planes, which is at a location where it's guaranteed that the enemy has had no vision, to attack said plane. Fog of war exists only for the player. Exit points on battle maps:This is really the last straw. At some border locations of the map are ""exit points"" where you or the enemy can move units to and remove them from battle. That may sound like a good idea at first, when you have spend all your supply points but realise that you actually don't need a certain unit, so you move it to an exit point and then bring in a better unit from the reserves that helps you more in this situation. But in the campaign, these exit points are exclusively used by the AI to remove - without any need or warning - units from battle that are part of secondary objectives. Like ""Shoot down 5 air plane squadrons"" and after 15 turns or so, all enemy planes are suddenly ""gone"". The most absurd situation was when an enemy carrier literally vanished at open sea in front of three of my torpedo bomber squadrons. Secondary objective: failed. WTF??Ammunition resupply:The resupply system that I've mention in the beginning is good, but it's very, very oversimplified. Your units are either in supply, or they're not. This decides whether they can fight at full strength. You don't need to supply your troops with ammunition, like in Panzer Corps or - heaven forbid! - like in Battle Isle, where you had to control supply units to bring ammo and fuel to the front. The only exception are torpedo bombers and submarines that work in a very strange way: Their torpedos simply ""respawn"" after a few turns. I adore the feature that let's you cut off enemy units from supply, but the rest of the supply system is oversimplified. Bugs:I had no crashes, but several very serious bugs that forced me to reload a scenario up to eight times. I've read that other players encountered even more bugs and had several crashes.Bad modability:It was promoted that the game would be open to modders, but as far as I've read this isn't true. Several critical game files are only editable with unusual special software and there isn't any interface to activate mods in the game except for mods that are distributed directly by the developers. All in all OoB:P was a huge letdown. Some problems may be fixable but the humiliating spoon-feeding regarding ""what should the player do and how can we force him to do exactly that""-attitude of the developers seems to be something that can't be fixed with a patch.

												A great game. It offers an interesting look at some of the less explored theatres of World War 2: the campaign in the Pacific and China. A new DLC has been announced that looks at the Winter War.The game is visually and mechanically very good. The map is extremely easy to understand and the flow of operations is quite clear. The mechanics are quite familiar to hex-based wargames, but the addition of supply and fatigue mechanics make the game deeper and more interesting. I've been through all the campaigns (some more than once). I'm looking forward to the new DLC (and hopefully more interesting campaigns down the line).			"

												I really enjoyed this game, even as the free demo for the limited time I have played it.  Very solid play style and not loaded with crazy graphics to hide dry game play.  Missions are not a cakewalk, but not frustratingly complicated either.  Try the demo, it was definitly worth the time for me!  Now i know, ""This sucks, you gotta pay for the packs!!"" is getting kinda old, but lets be realistic.  People make these games to make money so dont get all Emo when you have to pay for something.  I will say the packs are pretty expensive though.   Makers would increase sales if they cut prices, but i will be waiting for a sale to get me some.			"

												As someone who has played Panzer/Allied/Pacific/People's General and more recently got into Panzer Corps.  I loved PG, and PC even more so as they seemed to balance the game a bit better as well as add kool scenario triggers.Order of Battle (OoB) also does this and more.  When I first started playing it, I was getting slaughtered as I was thinking like I was playing PC.  You have to change that.  In OoB you have at least twice as many turns to complete your objectives, so patience is needed.  Gone are also the complete slaughtering of units from over-strength units.  I'm ok with this.Also it does a better job at limiting the # and type of units on the field.  Not knocking PC, i love that game as well, but you can play 30 Tigers/Panthers on the map if you choose. This game breaks it down by air, sean and land and every unit is given a value.  Ex. Infantry 2-3 +1 for transports, small tanks 3, med 4-5 and large 6.  That way you can't have 30 massive tanks on the map.  There's also a lot of little things like terrain that they make it harder for larger tracked vehicles to manuver on.All in all, if you like turn-based ww2 games, this is one of the best! "

												Don't read, just go buy it.You're still here? Ok, let's talk about OoB:P. It's simply the best example of a Panzer General-type game since the original (and it may be better than those revered titles). The game is rock-solid and the production values are high (love seeing the troop animations when fighting). But that's not what makes this beer-and-pretzel wargame great. There's three things going for OoB:P that make it the gem it is.(1) Combined warfare - sea, air and land. There are so very few games that combine all 3 of these together into a workable package. Most games of this type focus on Barbarossa or Normandy where your Navy has no real application. OoB:P's focus on the Pacific allows them to focus on all 3 and they do this very well. Some scenarios are navy/air only and some are land/air only but most incorporate all 3 into one large package. As such it offers you some wonderful opportunities to work some combined arms scenarios which other games of its ilk do not. (2) Units - Not too many and not too few. Some games have an overwhelming number of units where it's difficult for the player to keep up. Others have very few units where the game is too limited. This game has a pretty fair number of units and thus you can select the ones that work with your style. My inability to effectively use anti-tank units correctly mans that I don't have to deal with those and instead I can use heavy infantry or light tanks.(3) Scenario Construction - I saved the best for last. Dear Reader, you probably already know there are many games that play similarly to OoB:P. Panzer Corps, for one, is widely recognized as a very good game. In my opinion, this is where OoB:P beats the competition. I always had a difficult time in PC because I felt the maps were too small for the number of units present. The game turns into a giant slugfest with no room for manuever and thus the scenarios become very much a puzzle and less strategic. Conversely, OoB:P's maps are quite large and there's room to move. The opportunity to flank and even attempt wide encirclements are possible. I have yet to play a scenario that felt constricting. It's the careful crafting of the scenarios that make OoB:P the great game it is. The only real complaints from my standpoint is the lack of a branching campaign structure and no voice-overs to introduce the scenario (boring text). Simply put, go look at the hours played in the other reviews. It's not uncommon to see 100 or 200 hours played and thus the game represents a massive value for your money. I'm currently over 20 and I'm not even done with the first campaign. I could easily see myself putting in 100 hours into this great game. So if you're still reading, it's time to get off the pot - go buy this one because you won't regret it. The price may be higher than other games but what's another few bucks if you get double or triple the value (and gaming time) out of it?			"

												Old school board gamer (Vintage Avalon Hill nut) here.  I was looking for something computer-based that matched the look and feel of Squad Leader and boy did I find it here!  Still working through Blitzkrieg, but posted this review anyway. Ignore the whining from the people looking for a ""free"" game.  I downloaded it, tried the Pacific Basic Training scenarios and was hooked.  Bought Blitzkrieg right away.  This is a fantastic game.  Very well thought out in terms of strategy and concepts like supply, unit recovery, movement, etc.  The graphics are excellent.  Why are you still reading this?  Buy it!			"

												I have been playing wargames since the Avalon Hill days...Jutland, Squad Leader, Wooden Ships and Iron Men, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich...Just to name a few. I can honestly recommend this game to WW2 turn-based enthusiasts. I enjoy the fact that I can always come back to the game after a while and make my turn. NOTE: You may think the game is a pushover at first or you may go into it completely serious, calculating every move you make to the finest detail, either way, ignore the AI's ability to turn it around and bite you in the rump at your own peril. AAA+++Highly Recommended 9.5/10ADDITIONAL NOTE: I bought my wife a brand new unlocked iPhone and I was supposed to go down to get her a wireless plan the first thing this morning. I woke up at 7am and my Order of Battle was still on my computer from last night; ""Oh, let me play a turn or two and then I'll go to Verizon to get her iPhone all set up."" It's 1:31 in the afternoon now. The only reason I quit was because my fleet ran into waters that were heavily mined and radar picked up sea and air activity headed my way. Maybe they will be gone when I get back :)			"

												This game is a poor substitue for pacific general or  panzer corps the game is heavily tilted towards the AIs favor as secondary objectives espcially in the later game become near impossible as you will have many units thrown at you at all times and unless you play a scenario in a specific way the game will punish you  for it. The linearity of the game is what kills the game as their is little to do to counter the scripted events that become increasingly lost. Overall buy anythiing but this as it is a frustrating linear mess that tries too much to rely on graphics and 3D interface than it does interesting and unique gameplay.			"

												Bought this on the strength of the FTP which is essentially 4+ demos rolled into one,  Having played and enjoyed both Panzer General and its often forgotten successor Peoples General i have to say this game comes closest to capturing both the spirit and feel of both games and manages to Improve them. In a way its a shame Pearl Harbour is the first level as of the scenarios i have played (up to midway so far) it is by far the most Gameiest. To unlock all the secondary objectives you have to use your units in both an ahistorical and counter-intuitive way.Get past that and things improve considerably, The game makes good use of scripted special event triggers to make you adjust your strategy on the fly, plus the AI doesn't just sit in the fog of war waiting for you to activate it or throw ground units blindly forward hoping to grind you down with attrition, if things are going badly it will pause and wait for its heavy guns to come forward in support. Watching the AI come up with strategies to overcome your defences in the scenario Bataan is uncanny,one time i managed to eliminate the AI engineers, and lay a minefields to channel units into a killing zone only for the AI to send units through the mountains, terrain it had previously ignored to flank me. If you liked PG give it a go			"

												I haven't played many strategy games, but I got this one because of the Winter War DLC (few games have this interesting theater). I'm completely hooked now. Without DLC, there's about 10 hours (probably less for hardcore strategy enthusiasts) of gameplay in the Bootcamp campaign, plus the first mission of every DLC campaign, plus an entire Battle of Britain free DLC campaign. It's certainly not lacking for free content. I played through the Boot Camp campaign first and had a great time. I hadn't wanted to buy the DLC in case I didn't like strategy games, but the Boot Camp campaign convinced me I'd love it.I'm now playing through the Winter War DLC and, at this rate, will be getting the other DLC later too. I'll wait to leave a review for them until I've finished them, but I consider it well worth the $15 I paid already.The units are interesting and feel different from each other and other nations, it doesn't seem like a ""puzzle"" like the few other stategy games I've played (it feels like there's a lot of ways to win, rather than finding the exact combination that will win), the sound and visual design is great, and the game is very fun for me.I'd elaborate more on what I like, but really, you've got 10 hours of free content (ignoring the free DLC and first campaign levels) to figure out if you like this game or not. If you're interested, give it a try.			"

												Don't be fooled by the bad reviews of people who doesn't even bother to understand that you get a very good and long-lasting FREE campaign here; you also get access to every first mission of each DLC's campaign. You can try the game extensively FOR FREE and decide if it's for you before shelling-out on the full scenery's dlcs.Simply amazing hex turn-based wargame indeed. It's similar to classics like Panzer General and Steel Panthers, maybe even better in certain areas.			"

Posted: May 1, 2015
												I highly recommend this strategy game as a military geek interested in Imperial Japan, their weapons, and ""what ifs"". This game allows for exploration of those what-ifs by land, sea, and air. It's a great package with depth but not crazy in-depth cryptic detail that requires you micro-manage mundane details. It has enough ""stats"" under the skin of an easy to approach GUI that make it a good wargame as well. No ugly or abstract counters to represent your units, either. The graphics here are quite pretty for the scale. Think of 6mm scale wargaming. It's a huge step up in terms of scope, polish, and feel from other Pacific-focused turn-based wargames I've tried over the years. I feel a bit sorry for the competition. It's also approachable even for players of RTS titles - and not just grizzled grognards (who may find this game a bit TOO pretty and approachable!).It includes a scenario editor which I am sure I will use for Japan v. Commonwealth scenarios, though DLC is promised by the developer, we'll see. I think they made a solid game to start here, though. The campaign I've played for the Japanese so far is great, though I did dial up the difficulty one notch after the 3rd map.1. The turn-based system/engine is engaging and fun, the graphics up to par for a game of today (which is not always the case for turn-based wargames), and the sound effects are great.2. This is one of the very few games you will find that let you play Imperial Japan with actual ground invasion scenarios, not just Japan on its heels after it lost crucial battles. The perk system makes playing them unique as well - and there isn't an exact match for every vehicle in-game for the other side, keeping things realistic.3. The Japanese troops are well done, as well as US troops and stay true to the era, allowing you to upgrade equipment as years go by. The initial US forces look much like they did after the US was pulled into the war.4. The variety of vehicles is great, and the pace at which they are introduced by year avoids vehicle overload. They have a very good representation in the game, and several that may be new to people who think Japan is only about Ha-Go's and ""Zeros."" There is a cool one - the Type 91 Sumida armored car, that can convert for rail or road use just as the vehicle did historically.5. The scenarios and objectives are what makes this game shine, along with the ""doctrinal abilities"" or perks and ""special events"". A turn-based game where you have no time-based objectives can be a real slog and a bore as you slowly grind it out -- but add in ""you must capture bridge X in 10 turns"" then add a reward for achieving that objective? Great stuff and adds tension. Also, since units go from campaign to campaign and gain experience, you will want to keep them alive and keep them from losing too many men (replacing with greens). One more thing - while you can deploy many vehicles, you need to watch how you use your money - you can't just keep pumping out troops like Company of Heroes or something.6. Another VERY cool feature is that your enemy's vehicles - like Battleships - that were not taken out in a prior scenario will come back to haunt you. So the scenarios are dynamic like that.Nitpicks:  Some of the controls are not intuitive at first - a few buttons for the 'next active unit' and how to purchase untis for deployment - but once you get the hang of the menu / UI those things are really all that's not immediately obvious. Again, this is not Hearts of Iron!Airplanes need a place to land - so don't blindly buy non-carrier aircraft before you are certain you can take an airfield.  Summary:All in all this is what I wanted when I envisioned a game that let me play and change history as Imperial Japan - or as the US to try things from a very different angle. Playing pre-determined maps of Guadalcanal is not my bag, but you could also play as historically accurate as possible as the US or Japan and see if things work out the same!I do recommend turning the difficulty up one notch as I mentioned above -- I found it a bit too easy in the defaullt setting, but it can be changed between scenarios in the campaign. Will be interesting to see how many optional objectives I can hit with it dialed up a bit.			"

												I have played Panzer Corps quite a bit. This game is similiar in play but more challenging. I really enjoy this game more since you have to think a more carefully before moving units. It adds new, or improves on, tactical dimensions including: flanking and encirclement bonuses, unit suppresion, in and out of supply conditions, as well as concealment and entrenchment. Engineers can plant and remove minefields and blow up bridges. Keeping supply lines open and preventing flanking adds additional challenge. There is not a back or undo button, as far as I know, which makes you think carefully before moving your units. The scenarios provide unexpected bonuses for achievements. Scenarios have varied and multiple goals to keep gameplay interesting. Money to purchase or repair units is a bit too low for my taste, I've used the editor to add more money. This can be good since it forces you to make tough decsions like determining unit repair priorities. I would prefer an option that allows you to select different levels of earned income in between scenarios. There is not a file browser tab for file import on the editor. You have to copy files from the Program Files folder to the My Games folder, edit them, and then move the edited files back in to the Program Folder. Once the scenario objectives are met there are not any incentives to push forward and capture other cities. Even though they are not objectives they still should provide a reward. This could be money or even a surprise bonus: hidden gold, extra unit, new leader, etc. I have nearly completed Winter War. It did not provide Unit Specialisation, maybe I did somethehing wrong. The scenario 12 folder, 12_Viipurinlahti, does not contain the required text english, .png, and .scz files to play that scenario. Overall it is an awesome game! Panzer Corps now seams flat in comparison. I'm looking forward to playing the Blitzkrieg and other follow on versions.			"

												I've never played Panzer Corps, so I can't review the game from that angle.  As a computer war game, I'd say this is an enjoyable, somewhat light offering that does a good job with what SPI used to call chrome back in the days of paper and cardboard gaming.There are quite a few elements that make the game feel almost like an arcade offering, such as having torpedo planes ""reload"" in flight, and getting rewards in the way of upgrade/reinforcement points for capturing objectives.  To my eye, the simple 1 through 10 step ratings of units seems un-grog, To balance this, traditional concepts like zones of control, bonuses for supported attacks, and supply considerations are present.  It's an odd balance, but with the relatively pleasing graphical presentation that does a good job of imparting the right PTO flavor, it works.  It feels enough like a serious war game to give it a little heft, despite some of the lighter elements.  No one is going to mistake this game for a Grigsby monster, but it's not a History Channel offering, either.Replayablilty seems a little suspect, but there are secondary objectives that will allow for slightly different outcomes.  It could be argued that between the boot camp, US and Japanese campaign and multiplayer options even a once through would give enough game for the asking price, but without knowing how moddable the basic package is I can't say it's going to give endless hours of service without growing stale, but that's asking a lot of any game.I'm having fun with it, the learning curve isn't too steep for the casual wargamer, and it's substantial enough to make you feel like you are playing a ""real"" wargam while being light enough to keep things moving right along.  Reccomended  as good casual fun for the serious grognard, or as a dip into deeper waters for those who think of Risk as being pretty complicated.     "

												After about 30 hrs of gameplay, I am not sure I can reccomend the blitzcrieg DLC.  Although the combat animations are lively and fun, the fundamental game mechanics are not. It should be said that I have hundreds of hours of panzercorps and PG2 under my belt.  The missions are very long and complicated. On regular difficulty it is very difficult to build a ""core force"" that really qualifies as a kampfgroup, because resources are so scarce. Many times I would be an hour or so into a mission and find that without x unit the mission cannot be completed, only to start over. Leaders are earned for units only by completing optional objectives which can be very cumbersome.  Although the flashy animations are pleasant and the sound design is quite good in the OOB engine, circling back and replaying a scenario a couple of times is just not that fun.   I think the OOB engine is better suited to smaller scale engagements rather than the large scale conflicts covered here.			"

												I had no high expectations when I read ""Free to Play"" and I certainly didn't expect much content in the free version, but to my surprise the scenarios that come with it offer a lot of variation unit-wise and location-wise, from land battles on various ground, to air warfare and large sea battles.Those free scenarios alone will probably give you at least 30 hours of fun, if you are a ""What if""-guy like me. In case those aren't enough you can buy the full campaigns at a fair price.Pros:+ Much variation for a free game+ Decent AI+ Easy to play, not so easy to master+ Much better than ""Panzer General""+ Good manual+ Nice graphics with 3D map, there's also an optional 2D ""old-school"" view+ Nice sound and music+ Very stable, no crashes yet (Windows 10 x64)+ Comes with a scenario editor+ Free community-made scenarios and campaigns available+ The price of the DLC's is ok, I have bought the ""Morning Sun"" campaign, but haven't tried it yetCons:- I have played it for 8 hours so far and have found nothing yet that annoys or bothers me.

												OMG what can i say this game pulls you in right from the beginning tutorial missions. As you progress through the missions the addiction gets worse(or better depending on your point of view lol). Each mission takes a couple of hours or so, but it's hard to just play one and stop kind of like eating potato chips can't stop at just one chip before you know it the bag is empty. Thats what happens with this game kind of makes time stand still and before you know it the whole evening has gone by. This game is full of serious strategy and decent Ai that really challenge your decision making skills . I really hope they make more DLC for this because it's a winner. If you like war games then buy this one for sure its a superb addition to any war gaming collection( right up there with gary grigsby's war in the east/west). If you are not sure whether to buy it i can almost certainly guarantee you won't be disappointed and you'll be glad you did. As the saying goes "" WELCOME ABOARD!"" BTW the more i play this the better it gets.			"

												Had the game for a while and played through the US campaing of the pacific and part of the Japanese side.  I recently came back and continued the Japanese campaign including the pre Java naval action scenario.While I agree some of the complaints are valid, overall for the money it is a pretty well done compact game.  You do have to take care of units as you only get  certain amount of operational points to use and limited new units to select.It is definitely not War in the East or War in the Pacific but it isn't meant to be a game that plays real time over several years with extreme detail and micromanagement.  I look at this game as one to introduce new people to the genre and being made to allow you to learn a bit of tactics and have fun without all of the micro management of many games on the Pc or on the table.As for crashes I read about, I have never had a crash. The game does seem to slow a bit a certain times but I can save and come back days later or play to the end of a scenario without any real problems.If you want a simpler, tactical game to get your feet wet or just have smaller sessions, go for it.   You will not have to get your friends together several weekends in a row to finish a game... "

												So I have been playing strategy/war games since there were only board games - my first game was Panzer Blitz in 1972.  I have played quite a few strategy/war games since then and I would say that this was one of the most enjoyable games I have played.   I like the balance, not too easy and not discouragingly hard, you sweat a bit when you win and sometimes you don't.   Like that air, navy and land are all integrated.  Have played both campaigns - the Japanese campaign reminded me of a strategy I used in USN back in the eighties.  Lots of good fun.  Thanks			"

												I purchased the game.  I purchased all DLCs ... and I will purchase all FUTURE DLCs.  This game is phenomenal.  A little old school hex, a little Panzer General/Panzercorps and a little Unity of Command.  My sleeping hours have shrunk due to this game and I have bags under my eyes, but the challenge of completing a scenario a little bit better because it carries over to the next keeps me coming back for more.  Tough to find a Pacific theater game like this and throw in Winter War and the upcoming Blitzkreig addition and my smile only widens.  Here's to a Tobruk/El Alemein and Monte Cassino in future updates.  HIGHLY recommended.  Cheers!			"

												Order of Battle has to be one of if not the best turn based strategy game ive ever played,it has alot of the famous battles and some ""what if"" scenarios too with a wide range of units to choose from. The editor is fun to play around with and easy to use too to make you own scenarios to play with/vs ai or with humans.			"

												I remember being seven years old, lining up hundreds of little plastic soldiers, and recreating the battles I heard my uncles and grandfathers talk about.  My plastic soldiers stormed the beaches of Iwo jima, fought to the death on Peliliu, and heroically saved the free world from tryanny.  This game, for me, was a throwback to those halcyon days.  But not in simplicity - quite the contrary.  This game is complex, but not overwhelming.  Hundreds of unit types.  The Ai is quite good, and will exploit your mistakes.  Beautifully presented.  Engrossing and engaging.  Overall an amazing game.  You get to control land, sea and air.  Coordinate attacks.  Reel from counter-assaults.  Cringe as your best units are thrown off the beach.  Feel the excitement as objectives are captured by your battle weary soldiers.  As you can tell, I'm quite impressed with this game.  Probably one of the top three I purchased in the last year.  And the devs are helpful and active.  They also release some free DLC, such as the Battle of Britain.  Overall, a great game.  I look forward to what the devs have in store for us in the future.			"

												Checking the reviews i was surprised at the amount of negative ones people had given this game.I can agree that the free to play is sort of mis leading as to the fact its just a demo mission/tutorial,but i feel thats why there is so many negative reviews and comments about and not about the game itself.But if you are willing to pay $60 for a AAA game then this is a steal, you are not forced to buy all campaigns and nor does having certain ones effect your skill tree/stats in the ones you dont have, for $50 you can buy 3 stand alone campaigns, all of which are different and require different tactics. If you are a fan of Hearts of Iron or Panzercorps you should give this game a try, If you are a history nerd or war buff you should also try this game out! "

												This is a fantastic WWII strategy game, they spent a lot of time and thought in each of the 700 different units, campaigns, AI etc. I've been really into these games from YE OLD axis and allies board game days. I've finished several campaigns and will try to find the time to finish the rest. Why are so many people rating negative because its costs $$$ to purchase the game? Do you rate movies negative if they charge you to see it? Out of respect of such great developers I've purchased all DLC content even before I have the time to play it. Need to support great developers not punish them with nonsense reviews.Keep up the great work guys and looking forward to more DLC content!!!			"

												Absolutely amazing game similar to Panzer General/Panzer Corps, but with some changes that will bring new mechanics, units and contents. If you played the old Panzer General (or the more recent Panzer Corps, or any other clon), this game will be a step forward in almost all aspects. But be advised, it's hard, really hard... This seem to be a hardened version of Panzer General/Panzer Corps. Well, to be sincere I feel a little dumber myself since I had really troubles to win some scenarios in the US campaign. You must be patient and learn from your own faults, learn how to handle every single unit and their pros and cons, learn how to take advantage of terrain much more than in many other games, learn that sometimes you can only hold positions or even retreat your forces, and even learn that sometimes deploying some mines it's much more effective than hold positions with ground units. I consider that this game it's not heavily based simply on luck (dice rolls) like many others, this game depends on your ability and I must recognize that sometimes the AI was better than me. Sometimes you will be outnumbered, sometimes you will suffer desperately lack of resources, sometimes the time will be your worst enemy... but honestly this game it's really great, is a must. 10/10.

												I highly recommend the basic game (Rising Sun/US Pacific): Grade A. It covers the highlights of WW2 in the Pacific and is fun to play as either Japan or the US. You keep a core group of units that can be upgraded over time. Units include land, naval and air units. Even a nuclear armed bomber is available at the end.  As for the rest:Battle of Britain (free mod): Grade F. Not worth the time to describe all the problems because it is unfixable. I recommend not downloading it because it creates an extra step in starting the game. (You have to pick between the basic game and the mod). Rising Sun: Grade C (meh). Could have been so much better if I could play as the Chinese. What if China had been well led and had received the right equipment? Not much challenge to win as Japan. Some scenarios are badly designed requiring a rush to take objectives that otherwise would be very easy. You can win the entire campaign without ever buying armor or aircraft.  Russian pilots flying for China and no American Flying Tigers? Some scanarios are ok, but overall not as good as the basic game. US Marines: Grade D. All of the scenarios have short time limits because otherwise it is just a matter of time to win. New units include the Buffalo Brewster, a piece of crap airplane. The raider unit is good, but is wasted because the islands are so small there really is not much need for recon units. (They can't take territory and end up getting in the way.) If you want a heavy weapons platoon, (you really do), then you have to pick an army unit because the USMC does not have one.  In fact, you could play the entire game with army units. Why is this called ""US Marines""? At least 1-2 of the few scenarios came from the basic game with tweaks, and not much was new or interesting. Kind of a rip-off. Not recommended.  Winter War: Grade D. I played the first (free) scenario, but did not buy this one. The Finns just do not have an exciting army; no aircraft, no ships, and fairly poor armor. The Russians would be unstoppable if not for the dumbing down of the AI, Russian tanks can't figure out how to go around poorly armed infantry. That may be historically true, but it is not fun. Not recommended. "

												Starter reviewI did not write that much reviews lately but a game that hooked me almost 4 hours after starting it for the first time deserve some extra attention and of course a reccomodation.Wargames are a new terrain for me. I played and still play a lot of fantasy turn based strategy and tactical games and was looking for some more tactical and strategical depth in my games. That way I found Slitherine's website and I warn you if you love the genre and visit their site they have much to offer.Problem with some of their games is that you can't start them right from the box (the digital box in my case) because they have some complex mechanism which you only learn by doing a lot of reading in their manuals.Honestly I think this title have most of the depth like in the other Slitherine games. Lot's of units stats. Lot's of different stats depending on the terrain, type of unit and flanking support. Lot's of choices not only in land units but in air and naval units as well. Commanders which you can attach to your troops and core units you can take over from mission to mission.As I said I'm a noob with this kind of games so this review is certainly not a good review for the more experienced wargamer. But because I'm new to the games and it was so easy to get into this game I decide to write one.I really hope that other people like me looking for a Slitherine title and want a complex game start with this title.It's really not easy. It's not a downgraded version or a casual game but it comes with a really clear tutorial and an interface as clean as the one in Panzer Corps. So it's somewhat easy to pick up for starters.The bright map, the nice unit models and the informative interface are helping a lot to discover the depth of this game. From start you can choose two campaigns (3 actually if you choose to buy the new DLC Morning Sun released today) and can download a free offical mod DLC from within in the game if you choose to only buy the base game.Besides of that you find a boot camp which is a small tutiorial campaign. In this campaign you get all the advice that you need but you are free how you play the game. This is nice because you can try to do the secundary missions or just the main mission and it's not only reading and clicking but actually playing while you learn.Performance is ok on a mediocore PC on Windows 10 (dual core, 8 GB and 2 GB AMD graphic card) when I set the graphics to normal/good. You can even use high graphics and bloom effects etc. but I found out that after finishing the mission the game lags in the menu and some textures on the unit models dissapeared when I pull the settings too high.You can grab the first DLC for free within the game and the second DLC with a campaign where you play as Japan is between 10/15 euro which I think is acceptable because it offers a lot new units and designed (no skirmish) scenarios to play.As the first Slitherine game I get into I'm happy with this choice and I hope they keep working on the game in the future.Thank you for reading.

												OVERALL 8/10 (as of June 2015)One just cannot resist the temptation and compare Order of Battle: Pacific to Panzer Corps even if that would not be entirely fair as ""Pacific"" is a beast on its own and should not be seen as a mere expansion of its illustrious predecessor. It is a ""simple"" wargame as Panzer Corps and uses pretty much the similar approach in terms of movement, core force build up, and, obviously, combat. So, if you enjoyed Panzer Corps, you will like this one as well.PROS: There are some serious improvements over ""that"" game:+ Experienced units have advantages, yes, but nothing too overboard, so forget about killing off a horde of enemies with a single 5 stars Tiger tank.+ Supply! oh yes, supply is very well done in this game, almost its finest point. You don't just need a clear line to be in supply, but also enough supply to keep your units up and running.+ Air and Naval combat is vastly improved (yet still very simplified).+ Units have several distinct abilities that make all of them useful at some point (not just limited to engineers building bridges, but also commandos not needing supply, some tanks hunkering down and so on).+ The AI does a decent job at hunting down weakened units and is not an utter fool when on the attack.+ Maps are detailed and terrain is critical to plan ahead+ Some unique events happen during scenarios that force the player to change its strategy along the way, making it for a more dynamic experience.CONS- The hypotetical scenarios (like, invading Tokio by sea) are a bit too unrealistic.- Unit balance is not there yet: Japan built 300 tanks during the entire war, mainly deployed in mainland China. Considering each tank ""unit"" represent a number of tanks (how many, we don't know) I'm positive I've destroyed three times the entire Japanese WW2 tank production in 12 battles.- Some units are in dire need of an overhaul: you just cannot reload torpedoes on torpedo bombers while flying (plus Devastators were a total disaster, as Midway showed).- The nice ""dynamic path"" (one scenario outcome changing the next scenario that was so critical in Panzer Corps) is gone, now everything is very linear.- Commanders are far and few in between, allowing for little diversification.The potential is there for a great platform to be used for pretty much any scenario from 1940 to 1977, some game mechanics are really nice, and most of the things that need ironing (an ""undo"" button, unit balance, a way to get rid of the animation, magically reloading torpedo bombers in the middle of the ocean, AI constantly attacking infantry entranched in the jungle and so on) COULD be easily fixed (if there's a will to do so).All in all this could become a standard for simple wargames with very minor changes.I would not suggest the DLC way to expand it as everything important about WW2 in the Pacific is already here, but I could definitely see the same platform used to cover the Mediterrean in WW2 (pretty much absent in the 200 scenarios of Panzer Corps), Korea, 'Nam.

												Order of Battle: World War II is a free to play game, but has optional DLC campaigns that you can purchase for around 10 or 15 or 20 dollars, all totalling up to around $80 (at the time of this review, SEP/04/2016) not including tax. I do advise waiting for a sale if you want all the campaigns, but you can still enjoy about 3/4 hours of play time per campaign.But, for the main game, it's more of a sort of tutorial with it's main scenario ""Boot Camp"", that will explain how the game plays and how things work. This will get you, perhaps an hour of gameplay if you're a quick player. With Boot Camp finished, you are able to select the currently released campaigns from the singleplayer menu. However, if you do not have a campaign, you can click the desired campaign and it will give you the option to either purchase the campaign, or try the first mission of the campaign.Each of the missions will give you about half an hour's worth of gameplay if you're particularly quick, but the campaigns feature a little more then a dozen more missions to enjoy, with optional secondary objectives to complete that will affect future missions along with five levels of difficulty, all of which help increase overall replayability.Should you purchase even ONE of the campaigns, you will be able to download community-made scenarios and multiplayer maps without further charge. But, again, it can only be accessed IF you purchase at least ONE campaign. It doesn't matter which one.Now, with this being a Free game, I recommend giving it a try and seeing if you will like it. If it doesn't seem like a game for you, there's no money lost and you can uninstall it no problem.I should mention that sometimes, when there's a lot of effects going on and a lot of units are on a map, it's possible for the game to have heavy frame drops and input lag. Not a major problem with turn based games, but it can lead to motion sickness with frame drops and skipping. Lowering the graphics and effects should help with this issue.			"

												As has been said good remake of panzer general / panzerkorp. Good selection of units in keeping with the time line of the war and a nice touch that your core force is carried throught the campaign. I like the fact that units can do more for example destroyers can launch torpedo attacks as well as gun attacks, crusiers can attack aircraft, aircraft can be equiped as either torpedo or dive bombers and actually have to land at an airfield to refuel and arm during which time they can be attacked by ground units!! Engineer units can lay mines build bridges and more importantly blow them up!!!Nice to see the inclusion of some specialist units with their own skills such as commandos and marine raiders. These little touches take the game to the next level and make it even more playable than previous games. I also love the fact units can be named by you, a nice addition that makes you more attached and careful with your core units. The only downside i can see is the price , nearly £70 all in. Don't get me wrong i love the game but that is pricie. That being said i have all DLC because it is so playable.(got the first batch in a steam sale) :-)			"

												Although I like this game and have played through all the far east DLC I have found Blitzkrieg a bit frustrating for the same reasons as some other reviewers. Unlike it's predecessors Panzer general , which I have replayed tons of times, and Panzer Corps you just don't get enough core units. I know the Russians had a lot of troops, but so did the Germans in the key areas they chose to attack which is what Blitzkreig is supposed to be representing, Also things like zero quality infantry attacking your experienced tanks across a river in the open inflict 3 or 4 points of damage, that you never have enough prestige to replace. Do the same to one of their units and you get slaughtered. I like supply rules that make you wary of pushing units forward unsupported but once again you never have any units to defend your supply lines and push on to the objectives. Good game, but not quite great.			"

												This is a quality turn based strategy game, it reminds me more of ""Commander the great war"" than of ""Panzer Corps""  everyone seems to compare it to. not that it's a bad comparision, it is pretty close. it holds the same high quality as those two titles, I would say it is an over all better game, but it is a bit more in dept than these two, it is not more difficult, it's just a bit more you can do because it have more different units, you can deploy air land and sea units which gives this game a bit more content than Commander but it is just as easy to get into. I was able to play the game whitout even looking at the tutorial. there are no micro management in this game and if you are a beginner to strategy games you will probably not be disapointed. personally I would like to see a bit more micro management but the game is still very good. and even seasoned veterans would have fun. the time between turns are also very fast, it is almost instant, not at all like Commander which is a good thing. this is the best strategy game I have seen in a very long time. kudos to the developers. it is worth the full price. there is not more to say really, it's a solid game, if you are into war games you can't go wrong.

												I normally do not get very Excited over new games, or game systems. Having spent a good deal of time in combat units, and playing Army versions of simulations of all kinds it is not often you see something that catches your eye. Order of Battle: World War II is that eye catching thing. Many of the elements have been used before, just the way, and crisp look of it makes it a joy to see, and play.All the great elements are there. Turn based, for of war, unique units, Artwork, Game play, plus an effective AI. I have only played the base game with its tutorial, and found that for a basic gamer it may be a little hard to just jump in and understand all the concepts being presented (then again I am constantly amazed by my pre-teen grandkids). For the occational to hardcore military game player it is at a good level for both. The AI was what made the game play the most enjoyable. Unlike other game that add tons of units to ballance game play, make special rules, or give the AI total vision this one seems to behave more like a person would, Well worth the time to check it out.If anyone donates the rest of the mods I would love to check them out ;-)			"

												This is going to be a two-part review.  The first part (this one on July 3, 2016) will be brief as I have not played this game much.  But, I want to compare this game versus Panzer Corps (the spiritual successor of Panzer General - which as an aside, truly the biggest difference I think is that they removed PG's overrun attribute for tanks which truly was just a bit too much).  By the way, since I'm editing this just now, I have to say that I have put many an hour into Panzer Corps.  Truly a great game for which I will do a review here on Steam at some point if all goes according to plan!As far as this game (Order of Battle) is concerned, so far I say ""It is a winner"".  Looks like it has more depth, but of course, in the end that remains to be seen.But, based on the time I already have it, I heartily recommend a purchase.  I'm glad I made mine!As an aside, I started this game off on the Japanese offensive campaign (can't remember actual name just now), and one thing I'm curious about is if I prevail all the way through on this campaign, will I win?  You know, as Japan.  This will keep me playing for awhile even if the rest of the game begins to diminish......Until, next time fellow reviewers.......(Go Bills!)			"

												At first I didn't think I would like this game and hesitated for months to buy it.  The format of linked  scenerios to make a campaign didn't appeal to me as much as complete determination (like Pacific War).  That end up not being the case.  I have enjoyed over 50hrs of this game thus far.  The game is foremost remembered to be a game.  It was well done with good game design.  I have thus far played as the Americans and the British in the included mod Battle for Britian.The gameplay is simple,quick, and fun.  Resource supply is easy and quick to understand.  I had no need to read the manual even.  The interface gets the job done.  A well done piece of programming. New units and technology kept things interesting as I progressed through the scenerios.I would recommend this game, especially as the summer sale rates.			"

												A very accessible and modern take on turn-based wargaming for all WW2 hex-enthusiasts out there, with just the right level of complexity. Additional content is constantly being added, not just in the Pacific theatre, now also in Europe! Completely free to test a good deal of it, and then you can buy only the content you like best.			"

												Fantastic turn-based game even without the DLC. Easy to learn, plenty of units to choose from each with their own traits and if they don't get destroyed they remain in your force for the rest of the campaign. Also, they can be upgraded to better units as they become available which is something missing from many games like this. Maps are well designed and you're free to tackle each mission however you want. There's also an editor so you cam make your own scenarios or download content from other players. If you've ever played a game called ""Glory of Generals"", you'll like ""Order of Battle: WW2"".Works great on my ancient iMac 2012 with 512MB GT 640M graphics card, even when I turn all the graphics settings up to max!

												This game seems to have been designed specifically for me. It is a real joy to play. The only problem, as has been mentioned, is that the AI occasionally takes too long to think what it's next move should be. When it happens, there doesn't seem to be a good reason for it...seems like it can take longer even when they have few units on the board. All the same, don't let that stop you from buying this excellent game.9/10...would be a 10/10 if they fix the occasional slow AI issues.			"

												Best turn based WWII strategy game I've encountered. The supply system is simple and effective, a nice addition. On the harder difficulty levels it can be very challenging. Crashes now and then but with autosave every turn it's not too annoying.It will get expensive with the DLC, but it's nice seeing new content regularly and that's the way of things now.			"

												This is a very well executed and fun wargame.  It's similar the Panzer General series, so if you liked those, you'll enjoy this.Edit: I've played this game now for several hours over the last few days.  And truly, I cannot understand many of the negative reviews.  I've found that Order of Battle gets beter the more that you play it.  If you don't spend some time playing it and discovering the many clever and innovative nuances of strategy available to you, you may miss the immersive and addictive gameplay I've recently discovered.  I'm back to playing a wargame well into the night and next morning just like I did in the mid '90s with Panzer General.  I find my self replaying the same scenario over and over again to try a different approach, something I find missing in the recent Panzer General remakes by Sliterine where the options available for attack seem limited and contrived.  Well, not in Order of Battle.A great game that is easy to learn but hard to master.			"

												A very good re-make of the classic Pacific General, even though the scenarios are a bit different. There's some differences in rules as well, so it's not a plain re-make as such. But if you're looking for a game that resembles the old classics in the Generals series made by SSI, this is a very good choice. What from beginning was a game centered around the pacific war has also evolved to become centered around World War 2, so I'm expecting that with the base game, you'll be able to pick up DLCs in the future that will span over all parts of the war, not just the pacific. In fairness, this is a nische game though, more for the strategy gamers, but it has some streamlining compared to the old General series, that make it a good game for those who want to try out a strategy game as well.Somewhat high priced modules (DLCs) reduce the overall recommendation of this game, but still a recommended game for anyone looking for a remake of the old Pacific/Panzer General.

												I've never played such perfectly designed game, and I've been dicking around with games since before the internet. It is well worth the time of anyone who grew up on Panzer General. Everything about the spiritual ancestor has been carefully improved upon to create a truly fantastic experience. Carrier/sea gameplay is a nerve racking experience -- but in a good way. The AI is very good and will keep you on your toes even at the highest difficulty level. Indirect fire on heavy infantry is an awesome change. The intuitive but deeply powerful supply system removes a lot of the PG cheese and adds value to units -- like strat bombers -- that always seemed to lack a role. The UI guides you to the information you need to make the right decisions without obfuscating, hand holding or getting in your way. I've gotten around 300hrs out of this game and I've only got one of the DLCs + the original two campaigns. I've beaten the America campaign and gotten most of the way through the Japan and China Invasion campaigns. The value for dollar is insane. I can't wait for them to get into the European Theater of Operations and the Eastern Front.  "

												The game is very good, so I recommend it on the basis of its quality. But let me also explaing how it went: the game originally was sold at full price and included a Japanese and an American campaigns, exactly what you now find in the Rising Sun and US Pacific DLC. So, buying those two DLC now is exactly the same, as far as price and content go, as having bought the full game with the old pricing model. All the other DLC you see, those are expansions and were not included in the original game.So, all those people leaving negative reviews? They aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, it seems.			"

												If you are a WWII history buff as I am, you will enjoy this game, In-depth strategy that is geared to the realism you would expect from the title.  **Updated** Sino DLC, simply adds to the depth of play and will certainly give you the expected War Gamer experience. I will say the one AI bug the really should fix, the AI is allowed to move/attack and replenish a unit all in the same turn, which of course the player cannot do, you can move and replenish , but not move/attack and replenish, so its kinda a cheat for the AI.  It for sure adds to the challenge but really is unfair to the human player.			"

												 Okay, short backstory: I've been playing the genre since Panzer General, despite being very little when it came out. Got my first computer at the age of four in 1995, played games with my old man, and I've just never stopped playing the genre.  During the years, there's been additions to the not-so-huge genre ( what do we call it? Turn based hexagonal world war two strategy?). Most have all just been pretty much just remakes of Panzer General / Allied General, without bringing much new content. OoB:P does.  The setting in the Pacific! Finally! It does not feel like a remake mechanics-wise, everything is a little bit smoother and smarter than it used to be. It does feel like a ""lite"" version sometimes, but it works and it's fresh. The graphics look nice for the genre. I also like the unit abilites (mine-laying, bridge-blowing/repairing, Banzai-charging, Torpedoes etc.). If you ever have liked the genre, you should buy this game. It's excellent. And if you are feeling interested about this type of games, this could be an excellent starting point, as the tutorials and tips help you out a lot if you need it, and everything is smoother and easier to get into than in previous games. Only had time to play 8.8 hours so far, but I've enjoyed every second of it!  And just to mention, there is probably a few bugs still here and there, but the only one I've noticed is one where when attacking with the Japanese, some allied units (defeated ones) do not disappear but instead get bugged into the hex, sort of. VERY rare (two times in 8,8h), and has not been a real problem in any way as the unit is in fact, defeated, or at least almost destroyed. Both times it's been Dutch AT-cannon units. I do expect this to be patched, and in general the game runs very well.9/10, I rarely give out 10/10's :)			"

												Did I like it? Not really. Would I reccomend it? Sure. Order of Battle: World War II is a fantastic game, and you should keep in mind that this is more of a demo -- not a f2p game. As the developers have stated, they need a source of income and we should actually be glad that they didn't make the choice to implement microtransactions or some blatant moneygrab just so that you could play some other levels.Personally, I was expecting something more of a mash-up between Hearts of Iron and Civilization V. I liked the looks of it, and I thought it was an interesting concept and since it was free I gave it a shot. After doing the first level I think that I was expecting something different than the game turned out to be. However, if you are looking for a turn-based strategy game set in World-War II, this might be your cup of tea. I thought this would include things such as research, real production (not to scratch on that but it was pretty much just a buy this troop and place him somewhere system, no real production going on (like in Hearts of Iron, for example.) I also would have reduced unit scaling and made there be some more units but that last bit is much more miniscule.I look forward to seeing where this game goes and maybe one day I'll give it another shot. Currently, my stance is that I don't like it, but I would reccomend it because some people might enjoy it. It just wasn't for me but it *is* a good game.			"

I am playing a game now which I am just about winning and 2 huge Japanese naval fleets have turned up which renders this game over. Ok, I could play out the remainming 30 turns but I will not win. The maps are too big and simply do not need to be so massive inmho. To be fair, there have been good moments and I have had my monies worth in gametime but I do not like some of the scenarios. Spending hours trying to get past a particularly nasty battle is not fun for me. Others will disagree I am sure and they are entitled to their opinion but this game is off my playlist now. Shame.

												Order of Battle: Pacific is a good interperetation of the old WWII turn-based strategy game, PTO, from the classic Nintedo era. It has all the historical units and the turn-based tactics from the original game, but with more modern graphics and a nice overall feel to the combat.The game features many fun scenarios that approximate the famous battles of the Pacific war. However, one glaring ommission from this game is a true sandbox campaign where you're given command of the entire war effort from start to finish. This games' idea of a campaign is to string along a series of individual missions and carry over some units from one battle to another. That's pretty disappointing to a fan of games with an actual strategy layer like the old PTO.Overall, it's a very promising game, but the lack of a true campaign limits replayability and dampens my enthusiasm for playing much more than a few missions.

												I enjoy the ease by which this game is to understand. It becomes like chess. Chess is easy to understand but extremely complicateed when factoring in all the possible combinations. Negative reviews appear to be from people that expected this to be free. I guess they may not understand costs and that those costs need to have revenue with margin to be able to continue in business. The free part simply means that you get to try one of the campaign scenerio's for free and if you like it, buy the DLC. No game is free, you have some costs. Be it time, material or to actually be competative, you need to buy something provided by the game producer.  This game has literally hundreds of hours of playability. So take the cost and figure the amount of hours of playability/replayability and I bet you will find this is an extremely cheap form of entertainment. The game is relaxinig and entertaining, not overburden with stats and charts. Again, think of this game like chess.			"

Prefer storming the enemy? Deploy tanks to overwhelm the enemy. Prefer a slower war of attrition? Deploy artillery units that slowly chop down the enemy.-Good dev response - Many issues that were common in the beginning stages of the game development(I have been there) have been fixed speedily.-Opportunities are limitless. If you prefer to stick to the tropical warfare of WW2, try the US Marine Campaign or the imperial Japanese takeover of the Pacific. CONs:-Yes, some of the campaigns in the game require you to pay for DLCs in order to play them. But when I first got the game, know that you had to pay $50 just to play the US and Japanese campaigns. At least now you actually get to try it for free(the tutorial). -Multiplayer support is little to none at times. Sometimes, finding a game is impossible. -Gameplay does get indeed, repetitive. Or if you just prefer clicking on enemy units over and over again, then that's your deal. Overall, it's a great game that I really do enjoy playing. I own all the DLCs except the most recent(Blitzkrieg) and I plan to purchase it in the near future. Once again, yes you do need to buy DLCs in order to play the campaigns, but remember that the game originally was $50 just to play the American and Japanese campaigns. Lastly, if this game seems boring or dull to you, don't bother playing these types of games. It's just not your style.			"

												A really nice game! Mechanics are quite similar to Panzer Corps with some changes. Of course this game focuses on naval battles and maritime invasions. In comparison to Panzer Corps, the grafics are quite good.Pros:-Accessible yet challanging wargame-DIfferent types of battles (Air, Sea, Land, Maritime Landings, ...)-Newcomer friendly learning curve (a good wargame to start)-Grafics are funtual and charmingCons:-No skrimish (campaing missions can be replayed as scenarios)In a Nutshell: A really good game if you like Panzer Corps or if you like to get a bit into wargaming!

												Order of Battle: World War II is honestly one of the better free to play strategy games I have played as of late. I feel like anyone interested in a free to play Strategy game should give Order of Battle: World War II a look. Turn based gameplay, multiplayer, a pretty large selection of units, all these things make for a game that could be pretty fun. I dont have that much time with the game yet, but I recommend anyone interested give it a try, especially now that the game is free to play.			"

												This is a very good game.  Plays much like the Panzer General/Panzer Corps series, but with much thought and improvements to naval and air power.  Anyone familiar with Slitherine's Afrika Korps expansion to Panzer Corps will see similarities in the linear campaign pathing and mid-scenario events.  Gameplay is tactical in an operational environment, meaning your units do not represent combined arms brigades, rather pure all-tank, all-infantry, or all-artillery type units.  This is for fun and has a ""beer and pretzels"" aspect to the gaming.  On the macro picture (strategically), the game is pretty realistic, however. The player must strike a balance between caution and deadlines to reach objectives.  Move in too fast and you will encounter ambushes.  Too methodical and you will run out of time.  This is not the cakewalk of the Panzer General series, and every scenario can be lost if the player is reckless.Also, scenarios are long, as in epic.  Some are 60 turns, I think one may have been 100 turns.  100 turns!Overall, a great game with solid replay value.			"

												Here's what I love about this game: very simple to learnseveral difficulty settingsfair AI (doesn't resort to cheap tactics or cheating)good interface Overall, the sides had a decent balance and the campaigns unravelled as you would suppose. The military generals/heroes didn't feel like they contributed anything positive to the game, and I'm still trying to figure out how some units are even worth having at all (PT Boats are like tinfoil targets with no teeth). As well, the Power Ups awarded after some scenarios didn't really help as much as I'd hoped, but perhaps I chose poorly for my gaming style. In fact, the only gripe I have is the last power up for the Japanese - the Kamikaze. Don't pick Kamikaze. They do only ONE damage at most to any unit regardless of the situation. (Shouldn't the kamikaze sacrifice a life for a life?)Very fun and addictive turn-based play that will have you playing scenarios over and over again just to get ALL the objectives and optional goals too!

												EDIT - They have fixed most of the issues and now it really rolls. I went back to Panzer Corp and after adjusting to some of the rule changes again just rolled there. The PzC/PG games that I enjoyed seem quick and less fun. There is no blowing up 7 plus strength in one shot, well except for a nuke at the end! It take more thought to break through. Supply/efficiency is very important. One scenario in the campaign will easily take an hour or two. The Battle of Britain free mod was fun. I highly recommend it. 9/10 now.ORIGINALIt has the base in the old panzer general/panzer corp with some new concepts of supply, commanders and efficiency. It is fun for what it is, a beer and pretzel game. I am probably biased because I loved the Pacific theater. I would love a deeper campaign tree, but I really can't argue with the unit database. Choosing which units to buy when they could possibly be not able to be used in other scenarios makes you think twice at times.Are there some issues? Sure, but it is a solid start. I look forward to the next patch or two to tweak some things and future DLC.			"

												I've played through 3 of the tutorial games, and my initial response is WOW!  This game is easy to learn, but then again, so was chess.  Like chess, strategy plays a very important role.  A lot of it is simply getting there with the most, but to truely destroy an enemy unit that's running away, you need to outflank him.  The graphics are outstanding, and the learning curve is not bad.  The best way I'm learning is just playing the tutorials.  And having a blast doing so!			"

												""Order of Battle: Pacific"" is far more than ""Panzer Corps"" in the Pacific. There are some really cool new features that make the feeling very different. For instance supply is based on a general system of controlled towns and supply ships, not individually anymore. Combined with ""borders"" of your territory a quick push into enemy territory feels and plays much different now.Plus units now have command points (bigger units more command points) and you have to choose which units to bring to a battle - divided into land-, sea- and air-units. That makes it impossible to play killer-airplanes all the time.I personally like the bigger share of naval units and major sea battles.On the downside the AI is still struggling with human intelligence. Carrier based bombers fly without fighter cover (often the fighter plane is there, but two hexes apart), enemy offensives are easily stalled by cleaverly placed mines etc. To benefit the AI it seems that FOW does not really apply to its units. So enemy planes will most often kill off heavily damaged squadrons in the fog and the AI never walks into mines.There are two campaigns - US and Japan - with only one path. No more major and minor victories which change the course of war, but secondary war goals that generate boni like commanders, extra-resources and weaker enemies in the future. I like that approach cause I played for decisive vics anyways. Especially the US-campaing plays quite easy in the end - maybe turn the difficulty up.Commanders (heroes) are less powerful than in ""Panzer Corps"" and can be re-assigned, injured and made POW. I like the little black-and-white photos of events during battles and on the campaign map. Gives the game more feeling.I can recommend this game to every fan of turn-based grand-strategy games. There are some minor bugs, but these don´t feel to bad. Curious to try out the multiplayer mode. Semper Fi!			"

												After 20 hours~ playing I can't say I would recommend Order of Battle.I was really enthusiastic at start and the game was very enjoyable for the first few hours I tried it. The boot camp campaign, which comes for free with the game, was really entertaining to complete but it sadly gives a biased glimpse at what the actual campaigns ( that you have to buy everytime a new one comes out ) and the whole game actually are.First, the game is riddled with bugs that have been reported by many users but were never fixed or keep coming back and break the gameplay. Here is a few that I experienced myself:- Sometimes, especially in naval combat, I can't move some of my units because the game mistakenly thinks I already did.- Frequently, I can't seem to be able to place my core units during the ""placement phase"" of a mission despite seemingly having enough supply points ( which are required to deploy units ) to do so.- Sometimes, the appraisal of a combat outcome will be wrong. The preview of an outcome is displayed as numbers indicating roughly how many enemies the units of each side will manage to take out. Sometimes, even despite the preview indicates that an enemy will be defeated for sure following an engagement, the said enemy unit will just make it out alive with one ""health point"" left. I genuinely think this happens, if some conditions are met, as a poor way for the devs to balance the story mode.- The game features a mechanic of ""efficiency"" for each unit. The more your units goes through a battle or has to walk accross difficult terrain, the less efficient it gets. The problem being that sometimes, for no reason, some of my unit's efficiency will drastically run down even though I'm engaging much weaker and much less efficient units. I also think this is a poor attempt at balancing the game.- The musics are broken; often, when returning from a mission to desktop, the background music will keep on restarting every second.And the list goes on and on. But it really clicked to me that I woudln't spend any more money on the game when I realised that the dev themselves genuiely broke the game. Upon the release of winter war, they decided to change the balance system to make the new campaign ""more realistic"". This had the direct effect of breaking all the previous campaign by making most situations unfair or some objectives irrelevant. Here are a few examples:- Upon reviewing the balance system, the devs greatly reduced the artillery units ability to do any damage. Consequently, artillery units perform poorly on any unit, in any situation, and in addition to having a really poor range of movement ( you are unable to tow artillery units or move them in trucks... ). - The anti air simply has no effect on most air units. Trying to build an effective ground to air defense will never be worth it as it will cost you too many supply points making you unable to deploy critical units.To cut it on a last note, the game also runs poorly for no clear reason. On any mission, after playing a while, low framerate will occur. I couldn't find any clue as to why this happens, since changing the graphical settings won't have the slightest effect on my framerate and also because this happens as the AI is seemingly not running ( low framerate at player's turn as well ). The problem seems to be more recurrent on maps featuring lots of water. To anyone wondering, here is my specs:Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4720 HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz 3.60GHz16 Gb Ram DDR3L SDRAM ( 1600 MHz )GTX Geforce 960M - 2 GB GDDR5 SDRAMx64 windows 10So the game obviously suffers optimization problems.I would recommend the game if I felt like the problems the old campaigns are going through were going to be addressed but sadly I don't think this is going to be the case. This game is full of great design ideas and it could be one of the best turn based strategy game out there but it turns out to be a huge disappointment.			"

												My only excuse for not recommending this game is that I really don't like itAnd the idea that they are going to produce a series of games which are supposed to be historicalI find a bit depressing as they aren'tAnd yes I know its an addiactive beer and pretzels fight- fest but the mechanics seem wrong for this sort ofgame.1. Being able to build and deploy any old unit as you see fit and drop it into the battle   Fine if this was fantasy but in reality if you has a marine div you had marines maybe one tank unit and that's it here you can buy loads of tanks 2. Why can you mix marines/ heavy infantry / gun armed half tracks ... marines were in one div and infantry in another they had set oobs this is all wrong3. What scale is this ? I can buy 75mm armed half tracks as a  unit ? surely they were PART of units so what are these squads .. but they cant be the scales wrong4. Planes .. you can buy them where they have nowhere to land so they buzz around and hopefully you capture an airfield errrr that s realistic then5. Planes again .. they don't go out and bomb and torpedo like they should ,,,they just buzz around til they run out of fuel   ... and if they use a torpedo they have to RELOAD .. um what happens there exactly 6. Bombs are more effective on small ships ... they were quite effective at midway on carriers I ll stop now but if this had been a fantasy game who cares but as a simulation of ww2 its garbage.. period But then again I am an old board wargamer who likes hexwars precise units and VR designs wonderful detail so you can ignore me unless you are interested in simulating something real			"

												Properly done, thorough, detailed without being pedestrian, this is the sort of computer wargame I often long for and very rarely find.  Graphics are precise and attractive without being the reason for the game entirely.  The AI does a suitable job so far (only a few hours played, it may get stickier).  I've enjoyed the turn based but still pacey gameplay, and the mechanics are simple and effective.  This manages to combine different branches of the military together well, and I find the control point mechanic - which limits the number of units you can have on the map by military branch - very effective in forcing different strategies upon you but not leaving you feeling railroaded.  Really enjoying it.			"

												Great panzer-general-like (or pacific-general-like, both apply :p) tactical wargame. After 9 hours, I just finished the tutorial campaign, taking my time to achieve all secondary objectives, it's a long time since I had some much fun playing a wargame :)A little more in details :+ solid gameplay, a bit generic/usual for this kind of games, but with a few nice innovations/twists (flanking, officers, engagement distance at sea and so on)+ supply ""management""+ a tutorial campaign (but see below)+ upgradable core units which follow you through the campaign+ secondary objectives can have some impacts on the following missions+ nice graphics and animations, good sounds+ good manual, clear and precise- the tutorial is a bit on the short side regarding explanations (reading the manual is thus strongly recommended), and on the long side regarding the length (as I said, it took me 9 hours to complete it, even if it was by taking my time, so to speak)- music does the job, but remains very  generic- frequent slowdowns when it's computer turn- I wish there was some cohesion bonuses (keeping formations at sea, keeping infantry ""groups"" together), but nope (probably a bit tough to simulate at this level)- I think the supply system could have been better- no move undo : on a couple of times, I messed up (clicking too fast) what I wanted to do ... in such a case, you need to reload the last save : an undo would have been nice as long as you did not bump into an enemy.Overall, the cons are very minor, and it's a very pleasant wargame to play, definitely recommended !

												Light enough for the casual gamer to enjoy, but challenging enough for the veteran wargamer.Much refined compared to Panzer General / Panzer Corps, yet retaining the same enjoyable game mechanics.Pros- nice graphics- also runs well on low end rig (full tutorial tested on i5 5200u with HD5500)- great to play on a tactical scale - like fighting on Guadalcanal- supply system- flank system- fun- community scenarios!Cons- strategic maps less well adapted to gameplay - Midway IJN AI just went up and down on the edge of the map- limited variety of units (some historically important ship and aircraft types are missing)- generic units- generic look- generic capabilities- no 2d counters- unhistorical- on i7 4790k 16gb I ran into slow downs during Midway IJN sub hunting routineBasically loving the game.The limitations are not game breaking.Although the developers boast hundreds of units, the count is inflated because of subtypes.Also many types are generic, whereas many interesting historically important units have been left out.However the way OOBP plays it matters little, it is the history nazi  (not a rivet counter mind you) that demands more unit variation. If they can do this for Warhammer Armageddon, they can do it for OOBPNot a game changer, but certainly a lot of fun and worthy of further development.The recent addition of community scenarios is a step in the right way.8/10 - GOODEDIT:Just a BIG THANKS to the Lordz* for their recent addition of the Battle of Britain update!!Really superb scenario, a lot of fun while still following historic patterns.*The Artistocrats - my bad!

												Excellent game IMO. Far deeper than the Panzer Corps series which are simplified by comparison (and hence even more over-priced), which is not surprising considering they're just re-issues of Panzer/Allied General from many years ago (showing my age here).By contrast this is a much deeper, and much more rewarding game, forget just panzers and think the rest of WWII, though if you're a saddo who can't play unless he's got toy panzers, then blitzkrieg has been released just for you!I bought this for all the excellent Pacific theatre games and the Winter War DLC. The Pacific has been especially well done and there is much more use of sea and air power than in any previous game of this genre I've played. The Pearl Harbour scenarion is historically spot-on too, which bodes well for the rest of the game.  Graphically it's beautiful to look at too, more importantly it's addictive to play and you'll find yourself just wanting ""1 more turn"" for half the night if you're not careful.It's turn based, and I find myself preffering this kind of wargame these days, much easier to control and think things through without having to click like a madman all over the screen.Grab the entire Pacific orientated DLC for a cool 40% off right now too - you'll love it. Most of the moans I've read here are actually based around the price and the cost of DLC's, well guys get used to it because it's the way all games are going like it or not. At least the devs are developing and adding to the game and giving us more of what we want. Move with the times because at the end of the day it's for them to make money...One request for the Devs; give us a British campaign in Burma - that campaign was the only one that lasted the entire war non stop, and the Japanese were still on the offensive in 1944 too. The war with Japan wasn't just in the Pacific...			"

												Plays nicely, has a very retro strategy game feel, graphics remind me of Civilization 3. One small problem, the title acts kinda like click-bait in the sense that, yes, its a FTP, but....... only the ""tutorial."" They should label the game as a demo, as its free content is only the tutorial and requires additional purshases of campaigns to really play the game.  - I do like that I can download it on my school tablet without admin access.--I TAKE FULL RESPONIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES (If any) FOR DOWNLOADING IT ON MY TABLET--			"

												Firstly this is NOT A FREE TO PLAY GAME. Its a DEMO. Do we really have to be so deceitful now? Why not just list the game for a price and then list the option to download this game? ""Demos are typically released by the game's publisher to help consumers get a feel of the game before deciding whether to buy the full version."" Which is exactly what this version does.Ok the game is nice, the flanking mechanics and seemingly simple yet strategically diverse gameplay is quite nice. But the prices of the DLCs and thus the PRICE of theACTUAL game is too HIGH for what u actually get. For that same price there is a variety of AAA games that u could acquire, or for a lower price u could ge a variety of other indie games that offer the same if not more.Just had a look at the total cost of all DLC's together, making this game a total cash cow. Maybe for people rolling in money this is a viable game, but for someone that needs to spend their money carefully i dont see how this is a viable option			"

												I keep waiting for bugs to be fixed and maps to be added but the devs just keep on spewing out more DLC to fill their pockets and not even adressing the real issues of the game. Maps are so bad that only one is playable online (The Fork) the rest are poorly designed.Some other critical issues:- Paratroopers are broken for multiplayer.- Boot inactive player function is mostly broken, and if it does work, the AI or allied player does not take over, ending the battle anyway. This means if one of the 4 players quits, the whole battle is over.- Very confusing system for adding new maps, good luck finding the right one, versions are confusing and conlicting.- Very few players for online battles.- Chat system ingame is broken, all enemy transmissions can be read even under the private message system.- No control over who joins a game, and no possible way to communicate if you place a password for others to join unless you talk in a previous game.- Absolutely no patch bug fixes of any real significance. Just dump the next DLC, ignore the problems and move to the next cashcow.Game has potential to be fantastic, one of the best multiplayer turn based games ever, but its just being left to rot by the devs, a real shame. Untill we see some real bugfixing changes i wouldnt reccomend this game to anyone.			"

												If you want to play the game you'll be DLC'd to death.  All the playable campaign's in total are $105.94 CAD.  Doesn't that seem a little expensive for one game?  The game seem's pretty great over all and something that I know I'd have a ton of fun playing but I just can't justify spending that kind of money for any game at all.  What this game should be, is a free playable demo and then the full game for $30.  The pro's is that this game is axis and allies on PC.  The only real downside is the cost of the game.			"

												Pros:  - Free bootcamp campaign (three scenarios which take 3-5 hours to complete but only has a limited range of units)- Nostalgic throwback to Panzer/Allied/Pacific General- Finally, a decent WW2 turn based strategy - Multiplayer supportCons:- Cost.  This is the killer.  At the moment it costs $80 US for all five campaigns, which is about the same as any new AAA game.  In my opinion I would rather shell out for something with a bit more 'production value' than a 2D hexed based game that clones the general look and mechanics from a game I remember playing in the early 90s  - Some unit models are indistinguishable (aircraft in particular look the same)Personally I want to love this title but would recommend waiting for a sale.

												A game I would really appreciate a 'meh' option.  While the basic play is good, the strategy is there, supply lines are a good touch (though it's not entirely clear how supply lines work).Ground combat is decent.  Air combat is acceptable, though uninspired.Sea combat however is aggrivating to the extreme.  Routinely you can have a full strength Cruiser attack a destroyer at barely 10% and do no damage, yet said destroyer can wreck your forces.The sea combat tutorial is far from a training session, it's a full fledged combat misson with no real instructions, just a lot more ships than you have and a serious desire to take you down.  I started with 12 ships, first turn the enemy attacked me with 7 from one direction and 4 from another. And this is only a fraction of their forces.The developer clearly thinks being vastly overmatched -and- outnumbered is a good definition of 'challenging'.  I gave up after being overwhelmed twice.

And that IMO is some of the best DNA you could have for this type of Strategy game. It also comes with what looks to be a very nice scenario editor.  There are some small bugs that I've seen(graphic related), but nothing major, par for the coarse for v1.0 software IMO.  I'd buy it again for sure.			"

												Almost everything I want out of a turn-based WWII game.Review update:I bought this game prior to the change from Pacific Theater to WWII overall/the F2P/DLC shift. I am very happy with these changes. In not gyping me of what I had paid for so far, the devs showed respect to the existing player base, and the move offered both the chance to expand the player base as well as taking a hex/TB strategy game format that was excellent and expanding the scope of the game. I immediately purchased the DLC that wasn't comped to former payers, and I'm eagerly waiting on the future releases. As a hex/TBSformat fan, the presentation/depth/execution of this game is the best digital offer I have seen since Robert E Lee: Civil War General 2(not available on Steam, but out there for the war gamer for free at various outlets), although excecution similarities abound. If you are looking for a TBS wargame (WWII especially) with less depth than Hearts of Iron, but with more of everything else than anything else, this is the game to invest your time and money into.

												TL,DR: Okay game, Not-Okay advertising and payed content.Seems like a fun game, at least in the tutorial. Anything else needs purchase of a DLC. I cannot recommend a game that doesn't even provide a single campaign for new players. You are ""free-to-buy"" any campaign, which is fine for me, as long as i can at least play one of those for free and then decide the game is worth spending money on. As is, it's only like clickbait, luring you in with ""free-to-play"" and as soon as you start trying to enjoy the game you have to spend money.I do not know how long those campaigns are, but 10-15 Euros seems like a steep price for a game without videos or voice actors for any part of it.

												Quite simply a better version of the Panzer Corps system. If you liked that, you'll very likely enjoy Order of Battle: Pacific. The inclusion of air and sea units really mixes up your tactical options and makes it feel like a whole new game. You can soften up land units with your ships before doing a beach landing. The addition of supply also adds another new layer and something to be considered. You can't just charge ahead into enemy territory without risking being cut off. So, a bit more of everything without tipping over into being bogged down by too much detail or too many dry and unnecessary mechanics.I'd say this is very much a game for those who like the idea of wargames but are put off by the larger scope of the more traditional and more 'serious' type of wargame. When you get right down to it, it really is just a medium weight puzzle game with a military coat of paint.While I like Panzer Corps, I always felt a little intimated by it. Strangely, while being slightly more complex, OABP feels much more accessible, more varied and more immediately fun. Strongly recommended to those who like the idea of wargames but don't want to cross over into the deep and serious territory. Easily worth its full asking price.			"

												This game does for Pacific General what Panzer Corps did for Panzer General. It  updates a classic game to a more robust and rounded game. There are a few things that seem odd at 1st but once you learn the system it works well.   Pros:  Units are different with different capabilities. Engineers can  place mines, remove mines, demo bridges, repair bridges. These may seem like trivial things but in some games they are vital to your success.Different air units are capable of different things . IE there are 3 types of fighters, each excels at one thing  but can do all 3 just not as well as the unit that is made for doing it.  Units gain experience and can be upgraded as new equipment is usable. You may add a  Heavy cruiser to your force pool in 1942,  and then as the game progresses upgrade it to a retrofitted model. This is very historical as the TOE  changed drastically as the War went on. At the start of the war the main AT gun for the US is the 37mm  by the end of the war that gun was far outdated.Leaders. These are gained by doing certain things in a mission. They may be  for naval, land  or air units. Some are for just the unit they are attached to, and some for units  in an area. Supply is vital. Units are effected by being out of supply or under supplied. Learning to use your supply ships in an invasion is vital.  you cannot just run all your units ashore and have them functioning as normal. As you capture ports and  cities  it allows you more supply, but it takes a few turns to  be full effect. Some units are Supply resistant   or  ignore supply (recon) Reinforcements are triggered by completing certain things in the game.   Cons: No undo button. Yes this is true BUT. The game auto saves at the start  and the end of each turn. So if you really goof up you can always reload the game and do it over. ( I know a lot may not like that but it is an option)Game needs more content. There is the training tutorial which is 4 missions. And 2 campaign games  Allied and Japan, each with 12 missions that must be played in a set order.Game has some flaws, but the Developers are very active and respond to posts in the Steam Forums. They just did a patch  on the 15th that fixed a lot of the flaws. Overall  Overall I agree that the game is well worth the price. I have war gamed since about 1970. This game has a lot to offer.I have played Panzer General, Pacific General and Panzer Corps. This game is the best of them.			"

For future reference... I'd love to see a much larger sandbox mode including the entire Pacific with each nation starting with its prewar holdings. Leaving which ports/bases in the Pacific to attack open to my choice and timing. Similar to the old school game Pacific Theater of Operations from the SEGA and SNES platforms.			"

												It's a very good and entertaining strategy game of the turn based genre. I'd say it feels like I'm playing Panzer Corps in a 3D mod (I remember, also, the good times of Advance Wars - just the feeling). It's very good to see that there are people out there who like, program and promote this kind of games. I just wish my macbook pro 2010 was more powerful for me to play the game in a better resolution and with more fast AI. I suppose that can interfere in that too. An advice for the developers and people of Artistocrats: do use the lua programming language for AI. It's fast and very easy to use that way. I think it was made on Unity, so the AI must've been made on top of Unity's common languages. That's more CPU demanding, I think. Yeah, I'm a programmer and I love games that are tactical like that.

												Sure the base game is free but it limits what you can play and do thus forcing the player to buy the dlcs which are around the 20 dollar range, all i can say is greedy greedy greedy. That being said it has a 25 turn limit to finish your mission which for me makes me rush and make mistakes, its a challenging game and its both fun and fustrating, so if you like games that make you feel rushed, challenge your limits and enjoy grand stratagy games, this game is for you if not stay away.also greedy greedy greedy devs.			"

												I like everything about this game with the exception of the trains, there needs to be some form of affirmation that you want on a train, as once on you can't fight and you are a very easy target. I would accept an option to turn off trains as I rarely am interested in taking one. Haven't got any other complaints about the game, it is an excellent turn based game. It does require a pretty good computer to handle the thinking process, but has an option to pause the game when you're off doing something constructive.			"

												Order of Battle is a great game, a nice fresh look on games like Panzer Corps and Panzer General. If you like or love these games this one will give you a little bit modern look while honoring the old mechanics mostly. - The game has a fresh supply system that gives you the chance to isolate enemy units in pockets without supply. These units cannot get reinforcements and loose a lot of fighting power. - Experience looks a bit useless at the start but while playing some more I started to note that the extra stamina (not fighting power) that the experienced units have makes them less likely to retreat and they less easy loose there fighting power due to 'tiredness'- In the free part of the game you can try the first scenario of all campaings. I read some comments that the game was not really free, well, luckily these great game designers charge money for the great contents. With the money they will eat, feed there family and make more great games. With the DLC options you can choose the campaigns you like. I my case I prefer the ground combat over sea battles so I won't have to pay for the campaigns I don't like, bravo for this solution.- The graphics can be 3D or 2D (Panzer Corps like but more fluid and nicer). 3D is fun but I like the clear view of the 2D graphics.- The scenarios are reasonable challenging (for me) on normal difficulty. It is fun to try to win but also finish all secondary objectives. These objectives give you nice extras, like a special unit, a commander or just more cash, which you need enough off.-  In some campaigns you also get to choose a specialization after winning a scenario, nice touch. I read they will make the system even nicer, give you the option to spent specialization points in stead of having to choose a certain specialization (of two) at a certain moment, seems more flexible and even more fun.All in all I played this game for more than 100 hours without even noticing that I played it much, that's a plus as well.I focused on the Marines expansion first, which is an Island hopping affair. Smaal islands filled with a lot of units sometimes. It can be a little frustrating, walking in a wall of units and bunkers with your brave marines, but it gives the right frustrating feeling. You want to pass these bunkers but it takes a long time, there are snipers everywhere, you loose your speed, get hamered.. it's like it should be. Second choice was the Winter War DLC, filled with Finnish sky troops. These scenarios are more open and they give you a lot of opportunities to catch teh Russians in small pockets and destroy these units, if you manouver well. Distinctly different from the Marines DLC.I recomend this game very much, after 100 hours playtime I like it more than at the start. Now go play it! :-)			"

												Since the free-to-play tutorial is basically a four scenario mini-campaign, it's worth reviewing it in detail. Things may change later, once I get into the paid content.Order of Battle follows in the footsteps of SSI's Pacific General, just like Panzer Corps did for Panzer General, and it too fails, albeit in a more original - not necessarily better - way.Gameplay is basic hex turn-based strategy, player earns something like Prestige used for purchasing units, units gain experience and can be upgraded, larger emphasis is placed on naval battles, objectives hexes must be controlled in order to achieve a degree of victory and to provide supply. What could go wrong, right? A lot, it turns out.There's a bad feeling right from the start. Units have a nice 3D look, but not the terrain (compare to PG 3D). Someone thought it would be cool to have the player reminded at all times that THIS IS A GAME, hence the map is shown in perspective with clear-cut borders on a black background. Hmm, maybe just display the map full-screen or throw in some fog/clouds to mask the edges? The strategic map is completely useless as it doesn't show which of units have moved/fired; um, greyed-out icons anyone?Full spider-sense kicks in by the time you start managing your core army. The units' stats don't include the spotting range. When upgrading, stats can't be compared because the highlight keeps switching to the newly selected unit. As for the enemy units, no way to check their stats except by memorizing them since selecting one switches your view to the terrain. During deploy, you have to click an unit in order to see if there's a commander attached to it; you can detach a commander from an unit but can't attach it to another one unless said unit is already deployed.Odd gameplay options are all over the place. If an unit able to capture a victory hex passes through it, but doesn't stop there, that hex will be captured regardless. On the other hand, recon units - which only have two moves? - can't capture anything?!? There's no option of using a train (like in Panzer Corps), instead it's done automatically. In a particularly inspired idea, there's no Undo Move...An unit can move and fire later, but if it fires first then it cannot move. If it forces a retreat, it can advance in the vacated hex, but only if it does so at once, otherwise it loses this option (called Advance Move). Very bizarre: exact same move is done automatically when clearing a minefield, which puts your unit right where you least want it. I thought clearing the mines was done in order to open a path for other units to move in, not to expose my engineers to enemy counter-attacks. O, forgot to mention that engineers are also pioneers now, which perhaps explains why they're virtually useless at laying bridges. Consider this:Engineers: Turn 1 - move onto river, turn 2 - make bridge so that other units can cross the river.Any other unit: Turn 1 - move onto river, turn 2 - cross river.Spot the difference? Yea, me neither.In the same brilliant vein, destroyers can use the sonar... if not moving; or move and not use sonar. As for the subs, they feature an useless command that says: ""Surface to recharge the battery"". Rather pointless, I daresay, in a game where naval battles feel and play exactly like land battles, with units chipping off one another hit points with no specificity whatsoever. Pacific General had different types of damage against ships, even including critical strikes that could sink a capital ship in one hit. I wonder how could they do it back in 1997 and not in 2015?And with the naval units we've reached the true raison d'être of OoB: the Pacific campaign. When thinking of this theatre of war what first comes to mind is the idealized image of task forces, carriers surrounded by various warships, forging ahead through stormy... Er, scratch that: throughout a scenario, weather stays the same. This is a giant step backwards, as Pacific General had night battles and changing weather. Then you find out that planes on a carrier can be upgraded - wait, what? (In fact, units can be upgraded everywhere: one nice absurd touch occured when I found out that I could upgrade a Jeep on a road to a plane...). Or that, for no valid reason, only one plane per turn can be launched (and can't move after), while several can land in the same turn. A torpedo bomber needs - in flight - a three-turn wait before re-using its torpedoes (cooling time for torpedoes on subs/destroyers might be explained, but on planes?!?). Better use dive bombers then, but wait: there's an enemy plane right over the target. Fear not, it will conveniently move aside to let your bomber take its place. Once you're done bombing you get an extra one-hex move for your plane in order to let another one attack too, which is cute - but only if you don't move another unit between the attacks. Why can't planes be re-supplied at an airfield occupied by one of your units?!? One more extremely annoying feature (they even warn you about it during the tutorial): the more damage a plane takes, the harder it becomes to destroy. Even if there's a reason for it, it makes an already frustrating gameplay even more so.Frustration was a harsh reality in the Pacific theatre, where land units were extremely difficult to assault, dislodge or destroy. That was the idea behind combining experience and overstrength in Pacific General, but here the latter is missing. As a result, scenarios usually 40 to 60 turns long feel a lot longer and become boring. Expect two or three turns of coordinated asssaults to luckily (and in OoB combat outcomes are much less prone to randomization) force a retreat. However, again there are some baffling options here, such as why support for an attack must come from units in non-adjacent hexes (it's called outflanking support, if you're wondering); or why artillery doesn't support defense, even when adjacent to the defending unit, while AA and AT do. Capturing hexes that supply your army is a nice idea, but poorly implemented, forcing the player to constant number juggling, thereby detracting from the game itself. Furthermore, it works in a rather counter-intuitive way (what hex would be better for that supply ship to move to?). Another nasty side effect is that units operating behind enemy lines are very nearly useless because they're constantly out of supply. You'd think that such a style of play is ill-suited, to say the least, for the much more fluid European battlefield, yet the designers saw fit to release a Blitzkrieg DLC instead of focusing on more elaborate Pacific campaigns. Pacific General's two campaigns offered bonus USA/Japan invasion scenarios and alternate paths. Here everything is railroaded, with the same predictable outcome.Be warned: the AI cheats. In the third tutorial scenario, there's an enemy battleship that spots any subs in its range of fire (that is six hexes; a sub only moves three); in the fourth scenario, an infantry unit retreated two hexes. Still, a more accurate AI assessment can be delivered only after going through at least an entire long campaign.About the editor (which is generously unlocked only if you buy a campaign): it's only accessed from within the game, on an i7 it loads in 15 seconds, it boasts a needlessly convoluted UI (you can't even browse from it) and no Help file. Just compare it to Panzer Corps' almost perfect editor.Despite the recommandation, I strongly invite you to play OoB, since it's free and it offers a perfect experience upon which one can decide if it's worth spending money on the game itself. Plus most (if not all) the problems described above are something that one eventually learns to live with... probably. Definitely not worth full price though: same as with Panzer Corps, a 50% discount should be fair enough - for starters.			"

												EDIT AFTER 2.4.0 PATCH----Its good to see that devs still work for issues of the game and even better that they are communicating with players. There is an improvement in case of performance with 2.4.0 patch BUT (unfortunatelly, I really wish to say the opposite..) the game is still not playeble unless you play another game at the same time. AI plays some turns really fast but some turns still take 10-15 mins. (it was 20-25 mins before patch) I also restarted the campain in case of any save game issue, but 7th turn of the pearl harbor mission took 12 mins for the computer turn. (this is the smallest map of the game) I am using a new mac book pro so it couldn't be a performance problem. And the game crashed enentually after playing 1 hour which is a new case.So if you are not really crazy about WW2 games, I still can not recommend the game. In case of kindness of devs I will fallow the patches and change my review if they solve the performance problem...----its a commodore 64 speed game! commodore was a great thing but 30 years ago!it could be a good game if you didn't wait for 10mins for the computers turn.don't waste your money and time... really crazy.STEAM IS FULL WITH FAKE POSITIVE REVIEWS!

												have just played the tutorial missions, was quite challenging on hard setif you own ""Panzer Corps"" you will recognize the similar gameplay, its the same developer of course, but with a few changes to gameplay, which some of them i like others notcompared to Panzer Corps your units have unlimited ammunition and fuel, you have to take care of a supply route like in ""hearts of iron"", despite aircraft they have a limited fuela lot of different units have a special kind of use, like heavy infantry can use mortar or the US mobile artillery can lower/raiser her gun for reasons, but this small kind of stuff did not add that much to the gameplay like it show in the first placeaircraft itself have in my opinion a big break down, you can use it, fly back to airfield and land it, repair it, deploy it again, and engage enemy again, each of these steps take 1 round, which is a uge impact in gameplay if youre playing Panzer Corps before thatonly artilliery can decrease entranchment levels, which makes no sense to methe graphics are quite nice, i like destroyed ships sinking over time and destroyed aircraft find their way on the ground, but it adds nothing gameplay wise, overall the animations are repititive, you have seen one=you know all !!to be honest i was very close to buy a DLC campaign to expand the F2P tutorial, but in the end i installed panzer corps again			"

I'd like to try the multiplayer option however I am NOT comfortable paying over 30 CAD to take advantage of something I may or may not enjoy.  For the brief time I payed this game it shows potential.  AI is a little weird - but most strat games are...			"

												This is not a strategy game.  It is a silly sleep walk through the Pacific Campaign.I have found myself after a number of hours locked into playing a repeat almost step by step of MacArthur's strategy for the US Pacific war.  This game is nothing more than a glorified newsreel, a repeat at that, of Pacific campaigns step by laborious step.  This is at best a limited tactical game, with limited interface and options.  The unit deployment and structure is weak, substandard in fact.  On the one hand I have a fleet with 10.000+ men in the ships and then some ground unts, with what looks like well, the size unknown, are they companies? battalions?  squads? Divisions?  Not clear.  The maps are really rudimentary.  This is a mish mash of a navla and close combat setup. This game is for those who merely want to see WWII tactics unfold, on a simplistic level.			"

												I played a bit of this one and from what i've played I can't recommend it. It plays a bit like memoir 44 a board game i enjoy and play often but It falls short in that the game feels very shallow and lacks depth. I definitely would have rather had a bit more history before the battles and I'd personally want someone to tell me it rather than have to read it all, it may sound lazy but it makes it feel more like a history lesson being taught and i love history!. The game really forces you to play a certain way on a lot of battles which i didnt enjoy. At first I liked the little animations the men do on the board but it got pretty old fast. I was dissapointed in that there was no way of skipping the AI turn and just showing me the events the occured against me. A lot of the time the AI's turn would take a long time because it HAS to move all of it's troops. I didnt understand the hit and miss kills in this game. It clearly shows that it will hit and it has bonuses attached to it and it still misses. I guess I want a strategy game that's a bit more interesting and has decent AI.			"

												I played the free campaign (Boot Camp) through its entirety and it was indeed enjoyable.  It is a more simplistic style of the typical turn based strategy of the WWII era, yet it has enough depth to keep it interesting. In fact, I actually find it more enjoyable than some of my more involved TBS war games as the older I get, the less time I want to spend hashing out a single turn through a campaign made up of 50 or more turns.The strategy aspects of it were pretty well done in my opinion. I've seen other reviewers complain about the AI cheating, but I saw no indication of that. What I saw was having to plan out each attack, ensuring you had better odds by unit placement and proximity to friendly units, softening up enemy units with artillary shock treatments, and attacking with flanking support. The AI knows how to do this as well, so it made for somewhat realistic battles and forced you to strategize to be successful.All in all the game itself is a worthy one. So why the thumbs down?  For one simple reason: The monitization of this game seems like a terrible one from a customer perspective. Many WWII TBS games exist out there and come with several campaigns built in. A slew of these can already be found on Steam for sub $20 / $30. Some even sub $10, yet all come with several campaigns. Slitherine has taken the ""pay for each single campaign"" method, where each campaign is $20 (with the exception of a $15 and $10 campaign). So to get 4 campaigns (where most others come with 3 - 6 campaigns or more in the product for their $20/30 pricetags) you pay $65.So using the strategy where each campaign is a DLC you buy, Slitherine has found a way to make more money than other games having many more campaigns for the price, and where others have more value as well. If these 4 campaigns all came in at $25, I feel the product would be a commensurate value to its quality at its release date. So by now, it should be sub $20 due to time, not $65.Long story short: Play the free ""Boot Camp"" (tutorial), it was fun and I certainly recommend that. If you feel the product is worth its cost afterwards, then by all means get it. I would not recommend it at its current pricing, but if it goes on sale where you can get the entire current DLC for sub $20 then I would absolutely recommend.			"

												Many good games have been spoiled with poor planning and too high difficult level. More worse is that game creators do not know much about history. Historically very unaccurate if I think about troop behaviour and weapons... The demo itself was quite okay but the winter war version was very far from truth. All the Finns had winter camouflage and skiis at real life, we had not much lorries and cars. There was 2 meter snow at taiga and temperature below -40 Degrees. Soviet troops had horses and lorries but moving with them was practically impossible. By the way, Finns had molotov coctails but flamethrower was not very usual weapon at Finnish army and at game, there were too many flametrowers all around the battlefield. Finns were not superior, we only had enviroment advance againts red army. Another historic detail is that Stalin brought troops from south, Ukraine indeed.So it looks like pacific war was converted directly to winter war addon, do not work that way...At the US Marines campaing, medium level is too difficult and for some reason Japanese soldiers are some unhuman supersoldiers, that makes playing quite frustrating if one Japanese group destroy my whole army. You loose campaing at very start because because the balance of game is incorrect. At ww2 Japan had good fanatic soldiers but fanatism is not good at battlefield. That is why Japan lost a lot of man power, fanatic soldier is not same as a good soldier.Too inaccurate and unbalanced to my taste. I regret that I bought all the parts according the demo.			"

												The game opened up with a cutscene that was well presented and promising. Halfway through the screen went black. It took me about a minute or two just to quit to the desktop. I started again. No cutscene, just black screens, grey screens and odd shades of different colours. It easier to quit to the desktop at least. One last time! I waited for a few minutes and the graphics loaded. OK. Clumsy interface, that's a shame. Feels like I'm playing a FLASH game online, but let's see how it goes. Tutorial. You need to buy the campaigns at ridiculous prices per piece. Well, let's play the tutorial. Meh. Would I have bought the game and all of its campaigns for $2? Possibly, not sure. McDonald's Jr cheeseburger would be better value probably.			"

Terrible unit balance keeps this from fufilling its potential Coming into the game I played through a bit of winter war and ended up giving up on the game for one reason. Infantry is everything in this game and this leads to no unit variety. Artillery is completely worthless, possibly the weakest unit in the game. Anti-air, pretty weak and pointless. Anti-Tank, should have spent the money on infantry. Tanks, don't get more than one and use it as a recon/mobile pioneer.I'd didn't read any guides it just comes down to infantry being absolutely the only land unit worth using, everything else on land is mostly pointless. This isn't some problem that only comes about through power gaming either. I bought some artillery and was amazed at how little it did, this was repeated again for each new unit though nothing is more useless than artillery. Aircraft provide some variety but it can't make up for the terrible land unit balance. Also embarked truck units seem way too strong. Takes out the fun of ambushes to do 1 damage to one. I've been playing this sort of game since Panzer General 1 and this is the worst unit balance I've ever seen so I do not recommend this game. My rating 4/10 with points for graphics.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, as I find the history of the war in the Pacific to be really fascinating, and I was looking forward to simulating its campaigns in this glossy format. But I've found that I don't like this game for three reasons: 1) it's hardly playable even after 9 months of patches and hotfixes, 2) the time scale for air vs. sea vs. land operations is awkward, and 3) Historical counter-factuals don't operate well in the tour-of-famous-battles format. I've tried to get into this game several times now, and each time I find my self frustrated by bugs and such until I put it down again.			"

												Up until the battle for Dunkirk I found progress increasingly challenging (on default Major setting) which is just what you want, but the \dunkirk scenario just seems impossible with too many enemy units that seem invincible, and with too few command points to either field enough units or to buy any really useful units, or indeed to keep the units on the field up to strength. Even on the easiest setting I have not yet completed it!This next comment applies to all of the scenarios - I see little point in including all the great and interesting units only to never have enough command points to put together a decent force that uses them. The effect is to turn Blitzkrieg into a walking pace slog with a few half decent infantry with little in the way of tank, artillery and air support; not quite the combined arms fast strike affair that one imagines.  It justs seem a real shame, and feels very frustrating seeing all those high strength units and not being able to use them properly, if at all. It's a bit like going into a top class restaurant and seeing all the delicious food and wine on the menu and then realising that you can only afford to buy a bowl of soup and a glass of water! Why? Just Why? What is the point?Am I missing something?			"

												Just started OOB: Pacific.  Tried a fan-created scenario first and it was ""ok.""  Then, I thought, I'd try out my 1st campaign as the Imperial Japanese.   I can't believe how puny and undramatic the opening battle of WWII for the U.S. vs. Japan was portrayed here.  Seriously.  I had about 6 planes TOTAL, plus 1 I bought.  The U.S. Navy had 3 battleships and 3-4 smaller vessels in port in this scenario.  Sorry, but I expected something more historical, along the lines of what inflamed the fires of American patriotism that day.  TONS of enemy planes sinking/damaging TONS of unprepared/ill-equipped US vessels and property.  This scenario was a BIG disappointment.MAJOR HISTORICAL ERROR:  Surely by now, someone else has noticed how the 40's-era commercial announcer says, ""Once a Marine, Always a Marine.  Semper ""feeee.""  That made me puke just a little bit.  It's FI/pronounced ""FYE,"" as in Semper Fidelis, ""Ever/Always Faithful!""  Semper ""feeeeee""?  Almost a deal-breaker, folks.The opening panel artwork is atrocious as well.  I saw what I believe was intended to be a Colt 1911 .45 U.S. military-issue side arm with some rounds to the side of it?  The artist's conception made it look more like a cross between a Browning High-Power 9mm (especially the anaemic bullets to the side of it) and an emaciated Desert Eagle.  I'm guessing that most players will be comparing this to the offerings in the Panzer Corps line and/or Battle Academy.  Of the 3, this comes in dead last so far.  It reminds me of WWI type games where it takes way too many moves to accomplish anything.Only one real game into a ""campaign"" that cost $40 and I'm having doubts about what kind of military research was done other than to feature true battles that actually occurred in history.I DO appreciate the fact that SOMEONE has taken on the conflict in the Pacific over the European theatre for a change, though.  5 Stars for that!  Sadly, STEAM will only allow you to +/- this game with no wiggle room so I must say that, at this point in time, I would not recommend this game....unless you willing to take the only offering of WWII Pacific Theatre action out there.Hopefully, I'll be revising this review in a more positive light soon.  I just wish you would have asked me some questions before this went to market.  I've not been involved in Beta testing but I have to wonder if it's limited to playability alone or are testers allowed to comment/suggest ideas.  Hmmmm....			"

												Reminds a lot of the old Panzer General games.  I like turn-based from time to time, but this game misses a few options that many others have, such as clearly marking what units haven't yet moved, or being able to cycle through units (either all or idle).  This feels like it is still in Beta.  Even the opening tutorial seems unfinished, and some things aren't even explained until you try to do them (if at all).  I will probably play a few more demo scenarios, but I really see myself uninstalling it, because as the Free version is basically a gateway to a $100 game (through DLC), it becomes even more unattractive.

												Not very good, the game's AI is scripted and it does terrible things that it shouldn't. It will just sit in one place till it is triggered when the forces that are sitting doing nothing could change the outcome of the game. I watched it several times just run away from a plane or ship with 1pt of life left when it could have destroyed it eaiily and had plenty of life to do it and take the hits it would have taken and does take anyway on the next turn.It looks and plays alot like Panzer Genarl and Panzer Corp. It just has some fundamental differences in the aftermath of battles based on what you and the AI did.			"

												This is strategy lite, at best. Playing through the American campaign, the difficulty seems to come from the large amounts of enemy untis placed on the map, rather than deciphering a solid strategy. It's a nice looking game that utilizes the Unity engine. However, some of the animations appear odd and aren't synchornzied very well. There was miscommunication between the developers and the playerbase in terms of moddability and cooperative multiplayer, which I'm personally frustrated with. Modding - All of the graphics/sounds/values are packed into non-openable resource files. It would require a 3rd party tool to open any of them. The developers have said that they wanted the game to be easily moddable - that is not the case. Panzer Corps and Panzer General have survived the time due to mods - I dont see this game lasting very long without mod support. Cooperative Multiplayer - The developers have pushed this one hard, but the reaility is that there are only two cooperative multiplayer scenarios. The developers have claimed that producing cooperative multiplayer scenarios is easy - but there is no way to distribute player-produced scenarios. Additionally, relying on the player-base to produce content is always risky. I dont anticipate that we'll see much from the community. The campaigns / scenarios are extremely EASY, with the only challenge being in secondary objectives. Even on the hardest difficulty, primary objectives are relatively easy to accomplish - and require little to no strategy.Edit - Made it to the US Midway scenario. Game stops working on turn 20.  Reading the Slitherine forums, there seems to be an issue across the board with AI freezing during their turns. The developers released a hot-fix, but it doesnt seem to work for me.This is from a fellow on the Steam forums that summed up OOB perfectly:If find this true in theory, but that the game generally tends to fail to deliver on its potential due to poor campaign design choices.The second boot camp campaign mission, for example, is a brilliant use of combined arms. You have multiple objectives spread across several islands, and the purpose is to train the use of naval units and landing craft while still making combat fundamentally come down to taking land with ground units. In that mission, I actually went for the paratrooper island first, and set up an invasion of the mid-left side of the island, therefore bypassing several major enemy installations and attacking them later from behind, where they were less well-prepared. Where I chose to land was a real choice that had real consequences, as were my choices of troop composition for landing. My choice of where I invade is heavily influenced by supply - I need to keep at least a destroyer near all my units to keep them supplied, and have to hold units back until I can take some cities to maintain logistical supply. I chose my landing point in Boot Camp 2 for having a port I could take so I could throw a supply ship into it as soon as I took one town. It meant the logistics system had SOME actual impact upon gameplay.By contrast, playing the actual standard campaigns, you have battles like Java Sea and Java Invasion as two totally separate scenarios, where ALL naval action takes place in one battle, and then ALL land combat (with a nearly meaningless capacity to bombard from the shores added in) takes place afterwards. This functionally means that this game has this capacity for fantastic combined arms combat that it NEVER LETS YOU USE. Every single sea battle is a ""sea units only"" battle, and every land battle is a ""naval units are useless"" battle where you've already landed your troops and established supply lines, thus eliminating about 75% of your most interesting choices and the depth of the combat and logistics system. When I start the Java land battle, I already own enough capture points that I have 50% more supply than I could ever use thanks to control limits. The enemy also never attacks. Logistics is literally reduced solely to making paratroopers suicide units and detering splitting your army's strength to try to outflank with a landing you really don't need since you're better off concentrating your firepower, anyway. That is to say, logistics exists to limit the strategic possibilities, not expand them. If you try the default strategy of just massing your units and going forward, logistics is irrelevant, but logistics exists to make any other strategy too difficult to be worth trying.The same goes for the second mission, Invasion of the Philipines - you're supposedly doing an amphibious assault, but it's really just a pure land battle. You could have played a game where you had to soften up a landing zone, and weighed the pros and cons of using air power to focus upon protecting a beachead versus going deep to take out enemy aircraft early. Instead, it's just what all land battles would wind up being about - zerg rushing with infantry against entrenched enemies that sit in place and wait for you to swarm them.Worse, it means you play through the campaign schizophrenically swapping between army and navy battles where you invest heavily in ""core"" units that sit out every other battle. Want to choose between specializations that basically amount to whether you get heavy tanks or jets? Well, too bad! Neither can participate in naval battles, and after you pick that one, you're going to have only a couple more land battles, anyway! Spent tons of resources on getting three Yamatos for that achievement? Too bad, sucker, it's only land battles from here on out, and you're now out of resources!(The Marines campaign so far seems better about this, however, in that it at least picks one force and sticks to it. I presume the Finnish forces will be similarly focused upon land battles. Still, that squanders the potential the game had for being a combined-arms game, and honestly, it leaves me wanting to go back to playing Advance Wars more than Panzer Corps.)Just look at how the actual historical Guadalcanal campaign went: Both sides were continuously landing reinforcements and supply upon Guadalcanal to the best of their ability, and Guadalcanal couldn't possibly support the troops fighting for it with its own local resources, alone. What broke the IJA's defense of the island came down to the IJN first losing aerial supremacy, and thus having to limit itself to ""Tokyo Express"" resupply runs by night, when aircraft were grounded, and eventually losing naval supremacy to the point that it could no longer sustain the losses it incurred trying to resupply the land forces. THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IN THIS GAME! OOB's rule system is fundamentally incapable of handling the concepts of needing to run ships back and forth through The Slot, it just makes more supply than you will ever need magically spawn in from cities so that naval combat never matters when you're actually working upon the land combat for an island. The whole reason I was drawn to this game is this concept of combined-arms combat, and the thought that you could see battles like Guadalcanal play out based upon its logistics and the necessity of the navy in supporting army operations. Instead, they segregate out all these functions so that the game is artificially simplified and devoid of the depth that the mechanics were clearly meant to provide. Yes, I, too, would like to see something like a Mediterranean Campaign where the battle for Northern Africa is determined not through simple tank formation, but through how many oil tankers can survive the trip to Rommel's forces, while British submarines and torpedo bombers whittle away at their fuel convoys. That is what the game could be if it tried a little harder, but it just isn't willing to commit itself to that concept. "

												FIrst thing to make clear, the reason I don't recommend this game has nothing to do with how much free content there is or what the DLC costs. There are enough free maps that you can determine whether this game is right for you without paying anything.As a Panzer General fan, I'm sorry to say that Order of Battle didn't offer much advantage over Panzer General or its sequels.  It also has a few drawbacks that ruin the experience for me. It isn't clear to me why certain units are pretty much useless, such as the sub. In fact naval combat overall is poorly done.I have read that there are no weather effects. I'm not sure of that because I only played the free maps, but they didn't include weather effects. If this is true, then why does this game exist - less features than a game from many years ago. "

												I do not rembember if I paid for Order of Battle: World War II.The game is OK, it has some new things for its genre (zone control, fire support etc), it is a Panzer General clone with inovations.The price though... The free game allows you to play the Boot Camp ""campaign""  - 3 or 4 missions. If you want to play the ""full game"", you have to buy the DLCs. ""Add all DLC to Cart"" equals 95 Euro and that my friends is something that I will not recommend to anyone. If the game AND all the DLCs will be available for 10-15 Euro take this game in consideration.			"

												Initial Impressions:- Great, really easy to understand and play.- Overall, good top-down RTS game with lots to do.- Your playstyle will overall alter how successful of unsuccessful you are.- Most of the focus on the game is the Pacific theatre. Would have preferred European theatre.- Free to play.Now what I've noticed....- Access in 'free' version is just negated to training/bootcamp missions.- Missions and gameplay can be tedious and repetative- with no progress being made.- Game itself is solid and has loads of potential. Personally, had to uninstall it because it wasnt fun anymore, and it just repeated itself or came to a stalemate. Sadly.			"

												300+ hours played in Panzer General/Panzer General 2/Panzer Korps/Unity of Command...All games which I have enjoyed playing immensely...Playing through ""Boot Camp"" scenarios of OoB was fun too until the 3rd scenario which introduced submarines...I love submarines but was dismayed when my totally submerged sub was impossibly detected and sunk in one game turn by two destroyers and one cruiser using their deck guns...Impossible because there was a land mass (i.e. isthmus) between my submerged sub and the three enemy ships...Sonar goes through a land mass ??? WTF ??? I reloaded the scenario bought 2 additional subs...And the same result except 2 out of 3 subs were severely damaged...ALL submerged with a landmass blocking any sonar...I guess sonar is magical in this game...I absolutely can not recommend this game until they fix this...I know it's a small element in the grand sceme of things...But it nullifies the effect of the US player employing submarines or wolfpacks as a major fighting force...

												There's a paywall to play beyond the tutorial, and buying this game's DLC campaigns costs more than just buying a non ""free to play"" strategy game.  If you have to pretend your game is free to get people to try it, you definitely shouldn't be able to cost more in total than games that actually cost money up front.Oh, and I don't like the damage system.  Unlike in games like the Battalion series, a weaker unit is far more likely to do NO damage, making attacking with a weaker unit entirely pointless rather than a potentially worthy sacrifice.			"

												Not free to play. Just a Demo basically. Campaigns are very expensive for what you get (very limited scenarios per campaign). Would be around ~$80 to get all of them.... AI is pretty bad. Since there arent many scenarios per campaign you lose out on a lot of the seemly cool features such as watching your army grow, commanders, experienced units, etc. Visually the game is not that great either. really nothing to offer over panzer general games and fantasy general.

You either purchase a Campaign seperately or Uninstall the game cause there is absolutly nothing else for you to do (well except back to the Boot camp aka Tutorial).

												The game is interesting and fun if you are into role playing strategy. However, only being allowed to play the tutorial and one mission from each campaign is bogus. If you aren't gonna give players a full game of content and then offer DLC then why even allow the game to be for free? I will not be buying any of the campaigns because I believe I should be given some without having to pay for them. This game is not that good to be opening your wallet for more missions. Decent game though.			"

												Very good strategy game that covers a part of World War 2 that is sometimes overlooked compared to the European theatre. The combat system is very similar to the combat in CIV 5. This is a nice feature as moves such as flanking and doing targeted advances, For example on the Luzon mission as Japan I launched a large thrust down the left flank with tanks and infantry. The graphics are nice for the kind of game. They are not going to blow you away but up close the large units such as ships look good and the maps are nice and bright. The main campaign modes have a good feature which allows you between missions to choose ""specialisations"" which allow you to gain bonuses depending on what you would prefer, this is a nice little feature for those of us who like to choose how they plan their tactics.Overall I really do like this game and being abit of a WW2 history nut it will keep me entertained for a good while/			"

												For those who love the old Panzer General style of games, this is an excellent improvement. There are lots of tiny improvements to gameplay, but for me the main improvement is the supply and efficiency mechanics. Although the basic principles of the game are identical to PG, the gameplay feels very different. Scenarios are typically not so much a race against the clock as in PG, but reward more careful planning to keep units efficient and avoid unnecessary losses (I've only played US campaign, and this is especially true in later scenarios)Negative aspects are some stability and performance issues. As to stability, I've had some crashes, although few and far between. Performance wise, the AI turn can be very slow, particularly with older PCs and in large scenarios.All in all, this is IMHO the definitive PG-alike game that falls short of perfection due to the stability and performance issues.

												Edit: After the recent patch of the game there has been a *substantial* increase in AI turn processing, which has essentially removed all reason for my formally negative review. Kudos to the developers for getting this implemented, though it would have been nice to be there in the first place! Also, the inclusion of icons to show movement mode (foot, vehicle, or train), which was previously annoyingly missing is there nowA undo move button and ""combat explanation"" screen showing figures (ala Panzer corp) would be a nice additon.That said, with the AI  turn sorted out, this game gives a very nice hex strategy, that I am once again very much enjoying. Previously:I like the concept of this game, big fan of the Panzer Corps series.I like the supply concept. I like the setting.I can get over the fact that the AI isn't particularly smart or cagey.I cannot get over waiting 7 minutes for the AI to ""think"" on its turn. Not 7 minutes of watching units move and attack, but that 7 minutes waiting for unseen ""in the fog of war"" movement to occur. I have limited free time - I work long hours. I don't want to spend that free time watching what is essentially a loading screen.Big disappointment.			"

												105 hours, I've played multi starts of US in the pacific, The Japense in the Pacific and I tried several of the first scenarios of the other campaigns. I Bought the latest expansion today and decided to give it one more chance with being the germans in the atlantic. Sadly the Game just insn't fun.  The development team clearly is talented yet they just don't make secenarios that are fun and I'm not sure who the hell they have play testing but someone is missing some pretty basic logic. Replay value doesn't come from having to play the same scenario mutliple times. Whoever was in charge of the play testing on balance forget that if a play tester plays the same scenario 20-40 times and gives feedback it isn't good feedback for someone who wants to play every scenario once.Now I know its sounds like I am complaining or maybe I just suck but when I have a bismark class battleship, 2 Heavy crusiders, 2 destroyers, all hit the same british battlehsip from the same range for 1's and 0 damage and then they hit me for 5.........and two hit my bismark when it did 1 whole damage over 2 turns...thats just rediculous. I'm not even sure why they included ""figher"" planes in the early game since the one you are first able to use well past 1939 is absolutely worthless.....is it a BF `109...no....its some garbage.I get they wanted to make this game difficult and to make people replay the limited amount of scenarios multiple times but again, the game is just not fun. They have a big opportunity here being the first to really kill the germans in the atlantic a fair chance and in my opinion they blew it. Beware if you decide to buy any of these titles understand you are just super limited in everything you do because of how they utilize supply and ""command points""If you want a good game that is fun and rewardeding to play, stick to panzer corps or battle brothers. (last rant.......while you can get commanders.....they don't even give unit medals like in panzer corps)Congrats to the devs, you guys win the how to take all the fun out of what should of been great titles in a traditionally popular time period.

												This is a very fun and reasonably realistic game. Totally recommend. Perhaps the pricing model is a bit unfortunate, which seems responsible for the negative reviews. It is probably fair to say that the content per DLC is a bit thin for the full price, but definitely a good deal when half off. On the other hand, you get a better game than you do for other games that offer more content for less total cost.The combined arms is very nicely done and most (not all) the scenarios are quite interesting. It ""feels"" right for the Pacific wars (I have not tried the Europe ones). I am a very old school hex boardgamer, and this definitely hits that spot. There are complaints in previous reviews about the naval combat, the number of units in one's core forces, and other things. I do not tend to agree -- I think those all strike the right balance between realism and optimizing the pure gaming experience.As with and operational-level game that tries to do a lot, some things are unrealistic. One turn of movement is about an hour's worth, but a company-level unit starts to seriously lose cohesion if out of supply for just a couple of turns. Scenarios have surprise events that the commander would know were probably coming in advance (so you can play each scenario as pure ""game"" the first time and reply with the intel, though you will also then be aware of things that should genuinely have been a surprise). So, not a simulation. But still real enough to seem real.			"

I found the game play easy in the meaning that I didn't have to read hundreds of pages to understand the mechanic of the game. The graphics and animations are quite decent: this is a wargame. Thank you for letting us play free as you've got a new fan of this game!

												The way they sell the DLCs is definitely not OK. The full game at this point costs £76.93 - waaaay more than a game should cost.On the other hand, if one is lucky enough to buy it on sale, and also not interested in every campaign - there is a choice of what to buy exactly. Which is what I did.Also, there is the Battle of Britain mod available for free with the basic game (which is basically a free demo, consisting of a mission per every campaign released). A free air-campaign with the free game - a good deal, IMO.Now that we sorted out the pricing and all that - the game itself. I hadn't played this particular style of turn based wargames since Panzer General in the 90s, and would not consider myself a connoisseur of the genre. However, I'm a huge sucker for turn-based games in general, or any game that give me time to think and plan ahead - even require that to win, but not overly so. And this is exactly what we get here - thinking and planning, but nothing overwhelming. Turns are limited, but on Veteran I rarely felt pressed for time, in fact most missions were over with in like 3/4 of allocated turns. But I did have to restart missions a few times, while trying to find the optimal force deployment etc - some missions really pressed that ""all or nothing"" high risk feeling to the extreme, fighting nail and tooth against overwhelming odds.That is a good and a bad thing at the same time. It feels awesome, when you manage to overpower those odds - but out of the two campaigns I've beaten so far there were like 3, may be 4 missions like this, and the rest were simple ""slowly press your advantage, dismantling one defensive line after another"" kind of deal. It feels that there are really only two ways the game (at least in the 2 Japanese campaigns) plays - either rather easy or damn hard. No middle-grounds. Visuals... very good. The game looks good and feels good. And plays smoothly on most occasions - late missions AI-turns drop FPS considerably for 5-10 seconds, then get back to normal. Sounds... Alright. Not annoying, not awesome, just enough not to distract form the game. Hadn't grown tired of hearing them either, which is a good thing for a turn-based game.Scale... battles feel small(ish). There are no front lines or massive armies - the general feeling is that you are in charge of a division-sized force, with every unit representing a battalion or may be a regiment at most. That is for the big battles. The small ones feel like your entire force is one regiment and every unit is a company at most. I like it, but others may find this unsatisfying. Land/Sea/Air... they feel balanced, and work rather well together. There are missions that involve only one of the 3 elements, two, or all three. They all feel quite satisfying to beat and I cannot say that either of the elements feels unfinished or like ""just a feature"". For me all three of them blend together well, and yet can be separate games on their own.All in all, the money I'd spent - on sale - were well spent for me. I got more hours of enjoyment out of this game, than out of most AAA-titles released in the last couple of years.(edited spelling)			"
