												I bought this game 2 years ago when it was released in early access and really enjoyed it. The problem is this is just another early access game that was rushed into full release too early. There are just too many bugs in the game right now to recommend this game as is. I will change my recommendation it a yes if the bugs get fixed.			"

												Still seems to be full of bugs and unclear documentation. Some of the buttons don't work, when you train your heros it tells you they have increased in the stat you trained in but doesn't alway increase the stat and after a couple of training sessions it seem to give you like 500% of your current stat so 100 strength becomes 500 strength in 1 go. Needs more work feels half built.			"

												So, instead of polishing the game and fixing bugs he made payed DLC? ... awesome ... it used to be the game with potential, but its still early access with all those bugs. now DLC cost 50% of the original game? its 1 of the most disappointing purchases ever made by me on Steam. with that attitude of the developer i willl never buy anything from him.Also, i have nothing against developers who want to make money. There are some games i would pay for any DLC monthly, forever. But only if the original game is DONE. Not the case here .. DO NOT waste any money and time for this ...			"

												Started out alright started to get the hang of it (Meaning I realized you get points for making money so ♥♥♥♥ everything else and focus on income) and then it crashed. Luckily the game saves constantly so I got back right where I left off. Unfortunately everything was pretty much bugged.-3 buildings were solid the rest were opaque. Toggling that option just switched the 3 solid back and forth.-Score was reset entirely for every kingdom.-All quick quests were locked agian except for 4 random ones.-Same with supplies for quick quests.-All progress on epic quest unlocks was reset.-Basically everything was completely ♥♥♥♥ed.Also if you do play make sure you wait for a hero to actually start doing what you set them to do. Some things will allow you to set multiple heroes to one building (Such as training strength). If you do this any hero who arrives after the first will be stuck doing that thing forever and you have to fire them and start over with a fresh hero.TL;DR Starts confusing, gets stupidly easy once you realize you can win the game by spamming shops everywhere, glitches out and you lose all progress.

Early Access Review
								Before anything else, let me explain the game. You own a kingdom. Why? Who knows. You build stuff (taverns, shops, barracks, etc.) in a large-ish grid of grass and trees. You attract people into your kingdom, in hopes of them buying some stuff from your shops, like your average tycoon, although as of yet it is a very small focus. The big focus is on quests. You send your heroes on certain types of quests (rescue, vanquish, deliver, etc.) in certain other kingdoms. You allot some points to certain categories, and they're on their way. Thats pretty much it. Build more, quest more. Thats kind of all it is now. Now on with the rating. First of all, if I could rate this game N/A, I would. This game is simply unstable. There are many many bugs and imbalances. The developer himself said the game cost almost nothing to make, so I truly think the game would have been shed in a far better light if he waited to release it on early access. Although it is on the right track, its hard to recommend it as it is. Here is a pros and cons list, with that out of the way:Cons:UnbalancedBuggySensory-depriving color pallette, nothing but green and brown and gold highlights the whole game.Somewhat repetative quests, with sliders that seem to do nothing (unlike the ever-important sliders in GDT) EDIT: Sliders are now gone, and are replaced with... nothing? Now its worse than before, but not stealing something anymore.Slow progression, esp. in building.Once money (sorry, 'gold') goes below 0, its game over. No exceptions or anything, just a game over screen.Heros slowly die, with no apparent way to heal them. You even get a healing potion store, but not for them I guess. EDIT: This is aparently now fixedKlunky UI(keep in mind that almost all of these cons are things that can very easily be fixed by tweaking some numbers and code, so its up to the developer to make things right, for me atleast.)Pros: Interesting and unique graphics (though they could still use quite a bit of work)Despite monotony, still quite fun. Things to research,Shops to run,Not much else to say. I recommend this game because it is absolutely on the right track. If everything goes as it is, this game will be good. I can't disrecommend this game because of unforseen bugs and unbalances. While the developer should have released it a bit later, he very well might not have gotten any playtesters, therefore not being able to find any of those bugs or unbalances. The core game is fun, and thats all I'm looking for. So overall, I'm cutting this game some slack. I'll probably only play it briefly after the large updates every few weeks or so. The developer very honestly says he will work as hard as he can to finish this game, but anything can happen to one lone developer. A caring, involved developer like this is what this game needs to be fixed. I just hope he will. As of now, the current update, wait to buy, but you eventually should.			"

 RPG Tycoon - Review Gameplay:This game features two different aspects (RPG and Tycoon, duh), which are brought together in a rather interesting, but initially confusing way. Basically half of the game happens in text boxes.You manage a kingdom, build it, take care of your people (your followers) and expand by meeting the needs of both your followers and your heroes.Heroes bring in the aspect of RPG: You use the heroes to gain gold, experience, supplies and reputation all around, by sending them on quests. These quests do have direct effects on your kingdom, but in terms of gameplay are basically a few textboxes and a progress bar. It basically brings in another aspect of management, next to the management of income, followers and overall expansion.The game was very confusing in the beginning, since you need to figure out how much you actually spend on working on your kingdom and how much you invest into your heroes and their quests. There is a big repertory on buildings and quests, so one is faced with a lot of decisions.The Tycoon part in general is filled with neat sprites, whilst the RPG part is pretty basic, yet it plays a big role in the development of your kingdom.The game also features quite a lot of bugs, which, for a full-release title, certainly is a big down.Pros:+The aspect of kingdom-management has been very well designed+Long lasting gameplay+Full workshop supportCons:-The RPG aspect of the game is textbased and very basic-BugsConclusion:The game seems to be in a strange harmony, with the graphic based kingdom management, and the text based quests, where you need to find the balance between these two aspects to be successful on your journey.Since this game is already full-release I can not ignore the bugs and they therefore also will be part of the final score:5/10 - in its current state.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I´ll be frank, sadly this game like many others are released way to early in a barely fuctioning state. I bought this game whilst it was in early alpha however little seems to have changed till them. As others have pointet out this in the end seems more like a free browser game than a 9,99 release. If you ever find it on sale for 2,50 or so and want to burn an hour or two then i guess it would be ok. But the value for money just isn´t there. Not recommended.			"

												If the words 'rpg' or 'tycoon' spark your attention, buy this game.Being one of those that sat for many hours playing hospital tycoon/ theme park/ rollercoaster tycoon/ zoo tycoon etc etc- this game sparked my attention. so i bought it. i didnt play it much at first but recently it updated and i started playing again.Its much like 'Game Dev tycoon' with building aspects, quests to do (epic quests have loot drops), team and captured town  management and a dice roll/ text parts of the quests undertaken. Quests give experience, both toward the heros that youve sent out, and your kingdom, that goes toward new building types, kingdom expansion and player stats, that affect your dice roll during quests.The gameplay is verymuch sandbox, but you can choose to undertake the general progression type quests, that give you money when youve completed a small list, which leads to another list, with more money.You can also start a custom game, where you can choose how much starting money you have, experience amounts given, etc etc...The devs are also happy to let people mod the game, and apparently its easily done... and, you can (if not a mod maker/coding expert like myself,) you have to ability to write your own quest stories and layout (not that ive done so, but still.) ...I've checked therough the files saved on the compueter however, and i can see that, the config files are also quite easily changed... so theres that too.EDIT: I have recently been in contact with a developer of this game, and they seemed very considerate and detailed within their responses. Good news.....Yes, there have been issues with bugs, but upon realising that after uninstalling the game, files were left behind, so i deleted them after searching 'my computer' and then using Ccleaner to scan and delete old files and registry files3- i re installed and the game is prettymuch working perfectly, dont be offput by negative reviews... its a one /two man team thatve been working on the game for a few years, and, through reading the replies from the devs toward bug reporting comments- the dev/s understand there are issues, and havent made any poor comments toward constructive criticism.be patient...it'll be worth it, im sure.I've rebuilt and started over too many times... its my own fault, i cant help it.

Early Access Review
								I've been watching this game for a long time now, I remember when it first came out, it looked pretty bad. I bought it yesterday and it's honestly shaped up to be a pretty good game.Dont count this game out because of it's old reviews. I've had a blast playing it. I'll try to update my review once this gets updated or upon full release but as for now I wanted to add a positive review to the list.UPDATE 12/2/15I havent tried this game again in a good while. So far I can tell the game has had alot of explanations for things added. Such as skills on your heroes. I didnt know what they really did before (or if they even did anything back then) but now you can mouse over things to see what they do. I also enjoy being able to make multiples of certain buildings. Like needing to build houses for each of your heroes, rather than just having one house that you cram all of your heroes into. IM SO GLAD I CAN BUILD MULTIPLES OF THE SAME BUILDIGN NOW! Now I can make massive marketplaces rather than only being able to have one weapon shop! This is something I wanted REALLY bad before.This game keeps getting alot better as time goes on. Though I'm sad I lost my save from for freaking ever ago, there's alot of things that changed that I'd need to learn about by playing again. I'm a massive sucker for Town management games. I love this game.			"

Might be decent with some patches but as it stands on it's release I don't think it's worth purchasing.			"

The game has come very far despite all it has been through. the new animations are good with clear tweaks to the quest system making it all better along with the idea of land that you have to purchase. where it is today, i feel like i could spend hours playing and making my kingdom the best it can be.

								So here's my thoughts on this so far. It's an absolutely great start , you get to plop down the basic buildings , learn to juggle upkeep costs with actually earning enough for your kingdom , upgrades , buildings stuff like that. The few downsides right now would be that the game tends to just freeze up every now and then , and there's nothing you can do about it. So if you're going to play this save alot and be prepared to be a bit patient as you'll only have 1 hero for a good while and he gets fatigued at times. And the other minor gripes I do have would be with the way you set the sliders for your heroes on a quest. Things like Rush , Guard , Conflict sure you get the basic ideas but it's still very much vague , however the game is in early access and I'm hoping they'll make things like that a bit more accessible to people so they actually know what they're setting their sliders to and how it affects your hero on a quest. All in all , promising and excited to see more of it! And the price point is extremely fair too.			"

								I've had this game for awhile now. Its one of those games that I want to love, but just can't.Here are a few reasons why...1. Stability is an issue even now, almost a year after Early Access opened. Funny thing is: stability has actually gotten worse2. The  UI is terrible. Confusing and counter-intuitive, you'll likely find yourself clicking around in menus trying to find things for several minutes3. The game is largely all dicerolls. Its unclear how to influence your odds4, Missions are arbitrary and pointless. There is no reason to read the text. It doesn't even tell a cohesive story5. Its not clear what the game is about. Is it about hero management or city building? And what's the deal with neighboring towns (some you're competing against, and some you're just visiting). It doesn't seem like the game-maker has a single vision for the game, but rather has a few visions for a few different games and kinda just taped them together.At the time of writing this, the game isn't worth your money (August 8, 2015). However it *is* still early access, so I might have to modify these words eventually.			"

												Was this even remotely tested?Second quick quest got stuck, hero never to return had to save and exit. On reload, achievement randomly unlocks...Tried to remove a hero home to find the outline of a confirmation prompt blocking half the screen with no way to remove. I understand and expect minor issues, but you should at least test the first two hours of gameplay unless you want mass returns. The achievements unlock, hopefully not as randomly going forward. As broken achievements are pretty much the only reason I will refund a game, I will prolly give this another shot if I see a patch otherwise meh. I feel this was overpriced, during the sale, as the flash games of my day had more QA. Loved the idea, but almost nothing about how it was implemented.			"

								I understand the basics of this game and the fact that it is in ealy access. With that said, the current state it is in I would not reccomend it quite yet to those looking to play a game with some rough edges. This game has more rough edges than a un-cut gemstone. Personnaly I love the concept of this game, but no matter what I do, I lose before I can really get started. The learning curve of this game, I would say, is much higher than need be. The fact that you start with random quests, but the same towns is also a large cause for many of my losses as I've started with three quests none of the towns have cared for, thus ensuing I would not have enough gold income to survive. I also understand that roads need to be maintained, but dirt roads, (in real life can be made by a single person walking the same path over the course of time that all they need to do is keep walking it to keep it in decent shape) costs a fair amount of gold to maintain. That simple fact confuses  deeply. If there isn't another type of road yet in the game, fair enough, but if there is (which I can't get far enough in to find out myself) then there is no reason Dirt roads should cost anything more than being built. Another problem I have is the Item system. My meele hero can have either a sword OR a sheild? and are there no class speific items such as wands only useable by spell casters (I.e. wizzards, mages, ect.)?In conclusion It's got a lot of rough edges, but I see that this game might just be a diamond in the rough at this stage. Reccomended for a easy to comprehend and play game for a good time? not yet. Reccomended for someone wanting to see a game as it developes and have fun learning the game and getting farther every update? Deffinatly recommened there.As a Gamer I ask you to make this game easier to learn and have a better interface. As a person who loves reffernces, I hope someday I can errect the tower of pimps in my city and have a hero that screws up alot of quests named Gavin the Commedian.			"

												It’s taken me nearly 18 months to finally getting around to playing RPG Tycoon, during which time it’s passed through Steam’s Early Access, had its full release and most recently released its first DLC entitled ‘Supply & Demand’.RPG Tycoon is a city builder at heart played from the perspective of a Ruler who resides over a Kingdom. For their Kingdom to prosper it’s the Ruler’s job to make his settlement appealing and attractive for heroes to visit. Heroes they can hire to then send out on quests to earn gold, happiness and fame for the Ruler’s Kingdom, so that in turn the Ruler can expand and improve their Kingdom.Simple, right?Well… no.The game starts as a simple concept, which soon spirals into a deep interconnection between buildings, heroes, gold and happiness. Want a hero? Build a house for them. Now the heroes want paid. Send them out on quests, etc. But then the heroes want paid more as they level up from XP gained from quests, and such is the fame of your heroes that other adventures now visit your little kingdom and they want food, drink and entertainment. So, you find yourself having to build a Tavern, which makes an income from the visitors. Now your heroes are tired and low on health from manner quests, so you need to build a Medical Tent.Somehow, you’ve managed to get through the first year comfortably. Your Kingdom is happy, your heroes are doing well, your Tavern has levelled up. However, your town is looking shabby and the visitors aren’t happy about the lack of decorations. They’re also not happy about other ‘things’ and for me this is where the only real issue I have with the game starts to show – there’s a distinct lack of visual feedback on what’s making visitors and your settlements unhappy.The lack of feedback makes it difficult to entirely understand how to improve your situation and stop your Kingdom going from being content and happy, to suddenly depressed. As far as I’ve experienced so far unhappiness is the only end-state in the game. Perhaps there’s a lack of money ending too, and perhaps your settlements get raided, but I’ve never actually made it that far. Three to four years in-game time is as far as I’ve managed before the sudden 0% happiness drop.A brief check of reviews and Steam Discussion group shows you there are bugs still in this game, which isn’t a crime by any means (even if some people have taken umbrage at DLC being released before old bugs have been fixed). The positive is that the game’s developer, Matt Gambell is very active on both Steam and Twitter to answer and reply to feedback on the game. So, in an environment where indie devs are often criticised by some for hitting early access too soon for a quick cash grab, it’s refreshing to be able to see an active developer who communicates with his player base and is keen to fix bugs.In fact, during the time I’ve taken to think and write about my experiences with RPG Tycoon, Matt Gambell has released an update that fixes an issue with Finance Happiness that was causing a drop in happiness rating. Yet, bugs remain, as shortly after starting a save game a few issues showed themselves including; rival kingdoms had reset & a complete game freeze.As you might expect from a title containing ‘RPG’ the game does have some basic RPG and tabletop elements to it. Heroes have attributes, which are used in quests (ranging from quick to epic) to gain fame and fortune. Yet the game lacks one essential element of any RPG or tabletop game and that’s a basic set of rules and glossary for the user to follow and understand. That’s not to see that the game doesn’t provide information, as it does in the form of hero screens and quest descriptions. It just lacks the explanation of what those attributes do, and how they’re used in quests. There’s no real bridge between the game design and the user’s experience. It’s mainly left to chance, prior understanding and just a little bit of luck.The little snippets of info and feedback that translate the developer’s thinking and reasoning behind the game’s mechanics into something the user can understanding (without giving the magic of the game away). At times I found the quest requirements unclear, and at times felt like I was guessing at what resources I should take on quests with me. Without a doubt I was guessing which slot they should go in to. On the plus side the game keeps a history of which combinations of items you’ve used on quests, so it does provide a small amount of feedback to the trial and error approach it pushes you into.I’m sure there’s a hope from the developer’s point of view that the text quest provides enough information for the user to know what to take. A similar approach is used when you’re offered a multiple choice situation during Epic Quests. There’s no real feedback or insight provided other than the quest text. So when it comes to choosing an option, you’re once again sort of just left guessing and hoping for the best. A roll check is then used to see if you meet the requirements, but the UI doesn’t actually tell which attribute was used in the roll check.So with all of that in mind I’m left feeling that RPG Tycoon perhaps left Steam’s Early Access a little too soon at the cost of detail and polish. The base of the game is there, it’s just missing the smaller details to make the game more user friendly. You can enjoy the game’s current state; it’s presentation and soothing music, certainly make it a relaxing game to play and of course with a bit of time invested you will start to understand how to play. It’s certainly a nice idea, and one I hope gets the polish it deserves to make it more user friendly, as as far as I can see that’s all it’s really lacking.A fun game, with an active developer that just needs that little bit extra to be fully enjoyable.

												The ideas are all there, but the execution misses the mark by quite a bit.  It feels like the playtesting was only done for the first hour of the game (i.e. the demo), at which point things start breaking down... guild quests that can't be completed, broken competition grounds, five people in a town with 20 stores, etc.  Even if you complete the game, good luck winning...  your 'opponents' grow exponentially, while your own earnings are capped.  Playing a full game isn't a testament of endurance, it's a mark of insanity.The biggest slap in the face is that there's DLC when the main game still needs so much work.  I don't know what the DLCs contain, but I can only assume that it's horse armor.  No horses.  Just the armor.			"

								(First reveiw ever) Before I start let me get something across, do not buy this game if you are looking for a game to play right away. Some of these people seem to forget its in early access which sometimes means theres not much content. it will be worth it if you have patience though. Ok now heres my reveiw.This game shows ton of promise, theres not alot of content right now, but hey its called early access fora reason. Each update does change the game quite a bit. You may think its a simple point and click roller tycoon crap, but wait theres more! If you dig down deeper theres actually strategy you need to put into it. EX: How much food should Philip take on his quest? Where should he stay? Oh no! They don't care for raiding quests!This games makes you think. If you truely want to get what you want out of a quest you need to test certain quests. Now on to more of the game. As of right now just wait for more updates, I am hoping they make great decisions so ill recomend it.			"

												Given the choice of recommending this game or not, I say not. However, the game isn't necessarily bad. I just found that the unpolished indie-ness of it gives it two big downsides. One is that there is way too much clicking required. The second is that there's not really enough feedback; the UI just doesn't really give you enough information to use to improve what you're doing.I'm trying to think of good things to say about it, but I can't point to anything that particularly stood out. I think the best way to sum it up is that it's kept me pleasantly occupied for the 4.4 hours I've been playing it, but I don't expect to play the game again. The flaws in the game aren't detrimental, but it just doesn't have enough to recommend it to make me want to keep playing it anyway.Edit: It doesn't help that the game is buggy. I can't figure out how to join a guild, so my task progression is halted.			"

												The game itself isnt too bad if you like repetitive clicking and micro managing, my problem however lies in the fact that there is too many game breaking bugs to be able to recommend to anyone. crash on autosave, and not being able to load a previous save game are the majors for me. There is a whole list of other bugs, some gamebreaking, some annoying that i have encountered. I really wanted to like this game and i kind of do, i just cant deal with never being able to finish it (although i did actually finish a 10 year game by doing absolutely nothing but waiting)			"

												Gameplay does not feel very smooth and fleshed out. Feels like an alpha release.Litterally from 20-30 minutes of play.Possible improvements1. Music is very high pitched. Had to turn it off. 2. When choosing quests, you can't go back to the original quest menue via a back button. So if you click a normal quest, you can't go to the original screen to choose between a normal/epic/history.3. Graphics are too simple... Needs more love/smoothed sides.4. Punished way too heavily for repeat quests. I understand if you repeat the same quest and it reduces a bit more every time, but to go from say 8 happy to 1 is a bit drastic.5. Purchases don't feel that fun. There's no sense of achievement when you add buildings.  Perhaps ability to upgrade buildings instead of just purchasing more?6. The people that come into the town don't have any character to them. They all seem bland and generic.7. Heroes should feel more personable...8. Combo history definately can be improved to be easier. Say automatically making items that don't work red. But I feel like this feature is kind of... pointless. Why do we even need to bring supplies? It punishes the player for not having unlocked the other stuff you need. I litterally only have 3/6 items I need as soon as I start the game, and that's just for the begining quest.9. I can't fully rotate the buildings. Only 2 face options.10. The heroes don't feel alive. Maybe they should express things when they are getting worse in mood?11. When the tutorial menu came on the right, i attempted to keep doing what I was doing. but couldn't. This might cause confusion for some people. Maybe semi graying out everything when it pops up so you can focus on the menu might be cool.12. On the start screen, the game menu back button is too far in the bottum left corner. I had to hunt for it. Perhaps putting it right under the actual settings menu might be useful.Just some of the things I saw. Too much bothersome for a ""full"" release.			"

												Excellent game, even in early development. It can stand to have more content (more heroes, more stories etc) but this whole idea is great, and it makes a very fun game. Recommended.Update: The dev has done a great job of adding content to the game. I believe this is a unique, and fun time-waster.8/10 - Refreshing.			"

												Good music, horrible game. half the things dont work as intended, and are glitchy as well. IE, you can pay heroes that you hire a salary of sorts. You can change this based on how much you think they should receive, and that affects their happiness. Im unable to do so. So all my heros just leave my town, which leads me to lose. Another issue: As i'm writing this review, i'm playing on my second monitor. Theres a monthly upkeep fee in the game. While i've been typing this out, the game seems to play at an increased speed, and goes and burns through the pittance of cash i had on hand, and now its GG again. Definitely not a finished game, and definitely not worth 10.99. I wouldnt even play this game if it was free on Newgrounds. Go try out the Factorio Demo and youll have a better time.			"

												Since the last time I've played the game, it has dramatically improved. Still, there are some bugs to be fixed, like some buttons or tabs not being available anymore (faded tabs/ inactive tabs) or heroes getting stuck on the map, even though they had a connecting path.The quests approach is much more fun and the upgrades for buildings are better than before.Still, I have a sense of lacking space in the kingdom and I cannot upgrade so fast because is too expensive. There are many settlements and few possibilities to obtain them all. At some point, I was at year 17 and still had 7 settlements to conquer but lacked the expansions required.I played my best and reached level 7 at year 17, so how could I possibly reach level 20 in 25 years? My oppinion os that the game is very hard, without being propery balanced. Maybe, if they fixed the bugs and didn't have problem for recognising steam achievements, it would probably worth 2-3 bucks.UPDATE: It's filled with bugs, almost unplayable!			"

												After several playthroughs of the game, I throughly enjoyed most aspects of the game. While more of the later content is there, it still has some work to do, but given that this game was self-created and produced, I fully expect updates to periodically come out (as they already have been).The graphics may be a bit simple, but concept, functions and the amount of management you can do is very immersive. There are many things to do early on and this only increases as you progress through the game. Overall, the price is very reasonable, you can get over 15+ hours of gameplay out of it and I had a ton of fun playing it.			"

Long Story Short Version:RPG Tycoon is a very promising, solid, good game at its core; with several unique & original twists & variations of the RPG, Simulation, Town Building/Management Genres, that are all nicely & effectively tied together & implemented, to make up an overall, fun & enjoyable gaming experience that youd hope for & want & expect from a game like this, that can keep you glued to it for hours at a time.  The game has come a long way since its early days, with continued support, updates & content added at a reasonable pace, with yet more work to be done & bugs that may or may not pop up along the way, but also with a diligent & friendly Dev that has stuck with it since the beginning & continues to update, modify & bug smash along the way & is routinely responsive & listens to his community.  *End LSSV/lazy/ADD TLDR version.*In-Depth analysis of the game & the Developers performance to date:The foundation the Dev has laid down for this game has always been solid & the RPG, Simulation, Town-Building/Management aspects incorporated into this game has always had lots of potential from its early days & is mostly why Ive kept a good eye on it since then.  It looked promising enough back then but I was on the fence for several months, hesitant, mostly due to the critical reviews, while still checking back on it periodically.  Eventually though, enough time went by & after keeping an active interest & a keen eye on it, & seeing continued progress, development & improvements & watching his YouTube vids, I felt like this was a guy that was truly into his work & committed to seeing it through.  So I finally decided to give in & I bought the game..played it & have had many hours of fun with it since then.Since then & along the way, many things have continued to be added, updated, improved upon & expanded; some things becoming bugged, some things unbugged; all at a consistently reasonable rate; all of which is the standard norm for Early Access games with a small team.  Its just himself & I think maybe he collaborates with 1 or 2 others.  Rinse, repeat; its an ongoing process, but one which the Dev has continued to see through on an acceptable basis.  Aside from his normal To-Do list & agenda of updating & progressing the game over time in his own visions, hes also been receptive to the posts people have made with bugs/suggestions, etc; as evidenced by the past posts from myself & others here & the change-logs & resulting game-play changes that followed.At one point, due to having a vested interest in this game; since its something very different & so nicely encompasses so many cool & different traits from other games & genres that I really like & since Ive always really hoped to see this game in completion someday; in my haste, I hadnt seen any Account activity or Discussion Forum posts from the Dev in about a month & a half, so was worried that the Dev might have gone bye-bye as too many of them far too often do, with EA games these days...but he promptly & politely responded, simply pointing out he always keeps a watchful eye, just not always from the Dev Account, which actually makes sense in hindsight.  On that note, occasionally there will be the random/rare person that posts bugs/suggestions or w/e & then a week or 2 or more goes by without a response from the Dev & that person becomes upset or says stuff like, ""Oh the Dev must not care"". etc;  Which to be fair to them, up to a point, thats understandable.  I even jumped the gun myself once.  Its not unusual...& in fact is sadly half expected anymore with EA games, for the Dev to bail on a game, or just not be at all involved with the community.  But I can personally & honestly state, thats just not the case here, to this date.  He is just one guy & has his own personal RL stuff going on, just like many of us do & works on this game in his free time, which all things considered, seems like he must generally make a point to set most of it aside, to attend to this game.  Also, he does personally respond to posts, just not every single one & not all day, every day.  I personally can relate to that, as Ive got a super busy schedule myself, sometimes too busy & have to prioritize the stuff I want to do VS the stuff I need to do, & even stopping all that to do something simple, like respond to a text or email, can add more to my plate then I can already handle at that time.  I think a lot of Devs here on Steam fit into that category, as most of them arent full time programmers/game-designers & their game isnt their main source of income.  Some Devs dont bother to read &/or respond to their customers ever, but this Dev does fairly often.  And to me, as long as that level of customer service/interaction continues & the game keeps moving forward in a positive direction as its been; thats all that matters to me & all I care about, to warrant supporting this or any Dev, that demonstrates that on-going level of commitment.Bugs:The last time Id put any time into this game was appx 2-3 months ago ( from time of this review @ Dec 17th 2016 ) & had been wanting to play the game again after the last few updates/bug fixes & try out the new DLC.So recently I was able to play several hours off & on over the last week.  Started a new game, after buying the new DLC.  Everything was running smooth & working great at first, with a few minor bugs like; every time saving & quitting then reloading save game, the same few tutorial help boxes popped up, like if youre starting a new game.  Or while paused, clicking expand land, you hear the SFX of game like it was running even though visually, the game still appeared paused.  Nothing big or game breaking at all.Some more problematic things started to occur later on tho, like upon saving & reloading, most NPCs were unhappy & leaving, with no indication there was a prob prior to saving & quitting.  To be fair, Dev has a thread stating if you have probs be sure to erase that data which Im not sure I did this last replay. http://steamcommunity.com/app/314240/discussions/0/35221584437504412/Despite any bugs or probs along the way, I have faith in this Dev, from his past actions, not just words & promises like some Devs can do.  My honest opinion is, if you like what you see advertised here from the games Vids & Description, then you cant go wrong buying this game.  Its pretty much exactly/mostly what youd want & expect from a game like this.  Its not however a super duper in-depth game.  And its not meant to be & doesnt have to be to still be fun & enjoyable.  Nor is it on the shallow end either.  Overall its more of a mid-depth semi-casual gaming experience with several aspects that are still nicely in-depth, with other aspects to still keep you on your toes & wanting to continue to play, manage, grow & expand your kingdom.Bottom line is, this games been in development for a while now & continues to progress steadily, considering its from an Inde Dev.  Depending on the current state of the game & where its at, you may experience a relatively bug-free game, or you may be in the middle of a recent content update with the inevitable bugs that follow, which TBH, yes can get frustrating.  But thinking about it... Why does one get frustrated with something in the first place, instead of just not even caring or thinking twice about it & instead just walk away?  Cuz you care about it.  Cuz you like it.  Cuz theres some part of you that has a vested interest in that thing to begin with lol.  Which is ultimately a testament & compliment to RPG Tycoon & what it does right & why its worth most peoples time even now, & especially once its 100% finished.  And which is why Im still glad I bought this game, even tho it has some polishing to do yet & hopefully a few more features/game-play additions.  I look forward to the future when well see this game in its fully realized, finished state.  ( :			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game gifted to me and decided to try it (I also had the option of using it in a group giveaway) because the concept looked interesting to me. At first, I wanted to wait until more time had passed before doing this review, but I really don't see much potential here.If you like RPG-based management of mercenary heroes and your own village, you might like this game. More likely, however, you won't.The aesthetics are okay - very simple, blocky graphics that remind me of games you could easily find on gaming websites like Kongregate and Newgrounds. The music is decent, but can and will get annoying fairly quickly. The controls are easy - lots of clicking on menus extremely remniscent of Game Dev Tycoon (GDT). Many reviews for this game point Game Dev Tycoon as a source of inspiration for this game, however, you could honestly think of this as a much weaker, boring attempt to pay homage to GDT. There isn't really a tutorial function, but everything is pretty straightforward. For some strange reason, dirt roads are very expensive to make (not cost-efficient at all), so DO NOT make any. They don't really seem to do anything either. The learning curve is minimal, but wonky. There are combinations you can do when sending your heroes on missions - for example, certain villages prefer certain missions, and every mission requires you to select ""attributes"" to put your skill points into (ala GDT). Mission example: when you send your hero on a supply run for village x, you can decide to put a few points in horses (seems to speed up mission completion time), weapons, food, and conduct (seems to do absolutely nothing). Or, you can choose to allocate points to bravado, to scouting, stealth, and aggression. Depending on how ""compatible"" your mission, selected village, and allocated points are, you will accumulate points in ""loot,"" ""influence,"" and ""damage"" (again, ala GDT).The higher your loot value, the more llikely you are to receive items (ex: weapons, shields). You can sell these all at once or equip them to your heroes (they can only equip one item at a time) for stat boosts. Influence and damage values affect how many followers you will receive/lose after mission completion. I think followers add to your money-generated-over-time, which comes from things like potions being sold at an alchemy store. You also gain renown after completing missions, which is used in combination with gold to purchase building upgrades like more buildings (many features are incomplete or locked at the moment).During missions, you will be presented with 3 scenarios (they are always the same) where you must select a ""strategy"" for your hero to use (ex: be confrontational, talk your way through, or work around it. Again, depending on what you choose and its compatibility with your selected mission, you will gain points in the 3 main mission counters (loot, influence, damage). This game is clearly in early, early access, and I strongly recommend you do not get this (or at least wait until it's released as a finished product). You cannot sell items once you decide to keep them (the sell option is grayed out, so you have to pick ""sell"" right when you complete a mission and are shownn the loot screen if you want extra gold). You can find new villages and missions with the ""explore"" option, but it just unlocks more boring, tedious artificial-game-lengtheners. Honestly, if you want to play a game like this, I STRONGLY suggest you turn away and pick up Game Dev Tycoon instead.That game at least has a lot of variety and aesthetics for you to enjoy.At least for now, wait to see how this develops (if you are really, really interested). Even if you are dying to try this, I implore you to wait until it is out of early access.Do not recommend.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

								As it is right now, this game feels like a re-skinned Game Dev Tycoon. Could be worse, certainly, but in its current state it does just feel pretty derivative. There's definitely potential to branch out and distinguish itself later though, so I'll certainly be checking back after it's had some more time to grow!			"

								First off, your kingdom's visual appeal will never be above 10% after the first 30 min of play. It goes down faster than you can send everyone on quests to make money to fill every square with decor. It's just too buggy at the moment to play. I have to Alt F4 every 10-15 min because the game freezes. Then when i reload the cost to expand is different. Sometimes heros leave and dont come back. Reloading fixes that. The quests are awkward and there is no way to let the hero go by themselves. It says you dont control them but it feels like you control there every moves exept healing and fatigue. And half the time they dont do that when they cross the threshold... Just not quite ready to be playable. I will re-visit next patch.			"

												5.5 out of 10.  Would recommend only on sale in its current state.  Needs some work and polish.  Price would possibly be justified if upcoming DLC is free or heavily discounted.This is a game in hindsight I can't see me ever paying $10 for, though the joy for me was getting this game when it was first put onto Early Access at a reduced price and watching it gradually grow with features being added (and bugs coming and going and often at times coming back again in later builds which was extremely unusual)I really don't feel this game is finished, as in I don't feel it's ready to see the light of day of 1.0 just quite yet.  It still feels like a mid to late BETA.That being said however of the time I have spent with this game and pushing through some of the most infuriating game-breaking bugs during Early Access I did enjoy the game albeit it getting somewhat repetitive in the late-game.The concept surrounding the game is great and has been tried by other developers with varying degrees of success and I feel this one lands in the middle of the road.  But even with my nitpicks and complaints I often find myself coming back to it from time to time, especially after an update to see what's been added or fixed.However since coming out of EA the joy has started to slowly slip as I don't see frequent updates being pushed out, and I have to ask myself frequently is a game really all that great if the joy I mainly get from it is BETA-testing it?   Well... yes and no, as long as the ends justify the means and the finished product is all that it can be or more.In truth though I actually look forward to the DLC to add additional content, though I'm crossing my fingers that it's either extremely affordable or free.  If it's free then I can turn a blind eye to the price of the base game itself as long as the content of the DLC holds up.  If it's $7-$10 DLC then most absolutely either wait until on sale or just avoid altogether until it hits the inevitable $1 bundle.			"

												At first I was quite concerned with my purchase of this potential game, as time has progressed I have started to notice that among my other early access games with the exception of Gnomoria and Banished, this particular game has now grown to a state where I consider it worthy and playable for an extended amount of time. I particularly am impressed with the amount of new things a hero can do while another does the generic questing. The settlements have now become far more interactive, the shops serve more purpose than just money farming, and the inventory system now seems much more efficient at relating to the player what exactly they have and what it is good for. There are quite a few things left for me to really explore in this game, however it does seem familiar to another game by Kairosoft which I also loved called Dungeon Village, but even so this game is quickly surpassing that in terms of activities and gameplay especially the questing which allows you to choose your type of destiny instead of just accepting what there is already.for my obligatory rant however, I must say that the interface and specifically the ability to click on a specific object like a dirt road to delete resulted in my accidentally deleting an accessory shop, I would ask that with the opacity option maybe a more refined targetting with my cursor is desired. Also another petpeeve i've developed is with the arbitrary award system at the end of the year. In dungeon village the village and its heros in particular are awarded medals which are actual items that can be used to improve a hero's stats across the board. I'm not suggesting that exact thing but I would prefer something other than numbers and letters at the end of the year as this just does not add anything special to the game for me in particular. Lastly, and remember I have not played through the entire game since the last update but I feel as though the random events could be more than just global modifiers maybe something more interactive or under your control or the option to attempt to control the event would be preferable than just accepting the event as is. I suggest maybe also adding something similar to the dice roll system from epic quests allowing your heros to not only quest for settlements but to have the chance to maybe protect, improve, prevent, etc options for a global modifier event. If they fail the event is worse, if they succeed they improve the modifier, if they do nothing it remains the same as it currently is. Anyway I will be returning to play this after work, and the game as it has now become and currently is, worthy of purchase and worthy of your playtime. I don't know the developer or what he is working with but I saw a pile of crap spread on an empty canvas become a beautiful painting that still needs a slight touch up. Good work man and please continue to do your best and follow your own vision more so than the people who make suggestions because in the end they bought your game because of your decisions and visions and alot of developers seem to bow down to every crappy suggestion that sounds good on paper but damages the core gameplay that originally attracted that same person who made the suggestion to the game in the first place. tl;dr keep doing your own thing, but stay open minded to suggestions that may still be useful or an improvement to your vision.Edit: Forgot to mention, I love the settlement of Threepwood, I can't put my finger on why but it seems familiar and friendly to me.

Early Access Review
								In all honesty, I was skeptical about this title...though not for the reasons you'd expect.  Most of my skepticism stems from the fact that I've played other games that promised me the ability to manage my very own kingdom...and failed to deliver.  Luckily, ""RPG Tycoon"" has been getting regular updates with a bunch of new content planned.  The game is admittedly unstable at times, though the gameplay was still fairly enjoyable.  In short, you'll be constructing buildings and attempting to attract visitors all the while sending heroes out on quests.  The latter reminds me a bit of ""Game Dev Tycoon"" in that you can move ""sliders"" across different categories before sending the heroes out.  This game has a lot of potential and can be something great so as long as the developer continues to pump out content and balance/stabilize said content.

								Okay to start off with i tried, i tried so hard to give this thing a good review. I love games like this thats why i own Game Dev Tycoon but this games seems.. lackluster, At times my game would freeze but everything was still clickable. Or quests would just keep going and would not stop or when i would have one of my hero's go out and explore the bar would stopp filling on there progress and i would have to save quit and load the game and all progress would be gone but all my fame points? Not sure what they are called but there special points used to explore and upgrade things, yeah they would be gone and i would not gain a new quest, location or upgrade. Wait until they bring out updates to fixe these stupid glitched. 5/10Will update with patchess but for now this is my evaluation.*Update review*Still had quite a few glitches, though the original one's i complained about are mostly gone, now i just have to deal with the game freezing while trying to place a building, then the screen turning red as if it had a red filter over it. Then back to an origianl complaint, i send a hero on a quest and it doesn't even pop up i sent him, no completion meter and he never came back. People stopped coming to my town so i gained no gold and the annoying task tab would not close, i also at several times were un able t expand my town because the button would not work. I stick with my original review 5/10 wait until they update it and fix itI will update this when more patches come out.			"

												This game is great fun, whilst it currently has some small bugs, the developer is working hard on ironing them out. It's easily moddable as well so if you want some more content you can add it yourself without having to learn much. I wouldn't say this game is for everyone but it's definitely worth getting if you enjoy Tycoon games or Managment games. Also the soundtrack is great.Edit: The DLC is a nice addition, it adds some more content that would have been nice to have in the base game.			"

								As updates come this game improves once again, since the first release to now I can tell the developer really cares about this game and won't allow it to fail. With tons of different buildings and quests this game has a lot of variety and replayability. A few bugs here and there but it seems all the game breaking bugs have been completely fixed. Get this game, you won't be disappointed, I never was.(Old) Thrid Review: This game is really shaping up, I am really enjoying the improvements that come along with each update! New buildings and decorations have been added with each update. Bugs have been my only problem as I have encountered some game breaking ones but that is my only complaint. Questing and town building has been updated extremely which is awesome! I am really digging this game and I'm glad I found it early so I can watch it grow.(Old) Second Review: Questing system has been updated as well as the heros! I now understand it and like it very much! Awesome that acheivements were added as well as trading cards this is becoming one of my favorite ""tycoon"" games.(Old) First Review: Pretty cool game! the quest system is a little confusing at the moment but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Recommend it!			"

								I really the premise of this game, but the implementation is horrible. Placing buildings is pretty buggy and inconsistent. The quests, which are exactly like Game Dev Tycoon, seem skewed toward three or four positive quests with the other (>10) having no positive results. Even with that, it seems like even some of those don't have a positive strategy. Put those two things together and your starting quest types and locations can really screw you at the beginning. Once you have the golden three or four, there's literally no variety. Rinse and repeat.I do look forward to seeing the game progress. There's some serious potential here.			"

												RPG Tycoon is a very deep game that tries to account for many different aspects of questing and RPG hero managing.The game is pretty fun at first when you start to discover all sorts of things to do. There are truly a really big amount of detail put into the game, from the numerous buildings, the bounty boards, leveling up, and other stuff. The game makes you feel like you are actually running a town. The music also fits with the game and the graphics are generally good enough.On the downside, RPG Tycoon is really difficult to start and buggy. There is a tutorial, but it doesn't cover the amount of stuff that should be covered, leading to the game being quite confusing. I have played a lot of games before and this is one of the most confusing to start since there is just so much. Although this gets better with time, the other aspect of it that makes the game annoying does. There are just so many bugs in the game. One of my heros got stuck on a quest forever, and one of my heros got stuck training stats forever. Because of these two things, I started to fall behind and everything went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, one of my heros got stuck sleeping forever. Some of the buttons don't press like they should and there are many parts of the game that make you think what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.Overall, not a bad game, but could use much improvement. In its current state I can't recommend it because it just wasn't that fun.Rating: 5.9/10Recommend Price: $0.99 or below			"

												Bought this as I was fancying a tycoon type game and it sounded promising. I've previously had fairly good experiences with EA games. Gave it a go and it had promise but was pretty full of bugs and I felt was pretty far from exiting EA. Unfortunately about a month later it was then announced that it's now fully released and this is basically it. Shame because it had potential, but I wouldn't waste your money on this incomplete game.			"

								First, realize you are buying a game in Alpha. Second, read line one again.Third, think long and hard if you are ok working with a big can of wet paint.RPH Tycoon has the makings of a great Tycoon game (multiple layers to manage, clear competition, and multiple metrics to review) but at this stage it is ONLY POTENTIAL. Most features within the game clearly display bugs (message boxes hopping from one side of the screen to the other, twitchy display, easily exploitable calculation issues). If you are ok placing at bet on potential then buy this game. If you don't like ""wet paint"" then your best bet would be to stay clear untill a few rough edges are smoothed.			"

Early Access Review
								_______________18th March 2015 -The game has been updated quite abit. The mechanics are more smoothed out giving more of a flow instead of the janky feeling it had in the previous version.Okay the advantages compared to my last playthrough:-The GUI has been greatly improved as it flows.- More Buildings (which makes it feel more lively)- Research (makes the games last longer)- Ability to change the length of a gameThings I still agree needing improvement:- AI pathfinding (also no clipping with buildings)- Buildings need animations to make it feel alive instead of a static picture.- More people roaming the city (instead of 1 person on screen at a time. more)- Elevation and Trees in the terrain. (The game feels too empty without that)(Elevation would also allow you to make the game more challenging so you are limited with space)- Ability to rotate the camera with the Sprites rotating with it. (Optional but would make planning more efficient)- Ability to see other ""rival"" kingdoms (This will also allow you to show off your favourite cities in a new light)Though the game is in a better state than before and actually makes it more ""fun"". Still wouldn't recommend the game as of yet.________________26th August 2014 -This game has potential. However at this current time.It isn't in a state of longetivity.Like with many tycoons the whole focus of the game is money.You start with a basic 1500 gold (sounds like a lot... it isn't)First you have to buy your first building... It's 500 gold meaning you need to hire your hero to complete quests and so on.Quests will cause damage and will make your hero fatigued.So buying a tavern and a potion shop is vital (600g a piece).After that building roads is the only way to spend your money...Just waiting for more content to play through.So at this moment in time I wouldn't recommend this game.Maybe will change in the future when the game has enough content.If i was the developer i would fix a few things.- More buildings with different effects (probably planned anyway)- Better AI of the characters.- Ability to watch a quest through instead of just seeing numerical data in circles (similar to game maker's exp system)- More freedom with control for design (so you can make a sufficient town)- The game doesn't end immediately when you run out of money (Give a week or two game time)- Explosions (Just kidding)Anyways i hope the developer makes the game better :PPlayed this for 106 minutes in total.

												This comes down to early access as a concept. The idea is to support very small indie developers with a great concept that you would like to see developed. There are countless articles in the gaming press about how studios are taking less and less chances since games cost so much to make. This means fewer new IPs or game series and the first genres to suffer are the niches like management/tycoon/sim. This is because it's a smaller audience and a group that by nature waits for sales and opportunities to buy games(trained to look for a bargain by the very games that suffer due to this emotional IQ) for less. If you want games like this your only chance is to continue to support titles like this one in Early Access. To be honest, half will turn out as garbage. A 1/4 will be an outright waste. Another 1/4 though will turn out to be a gem that guides the genre for the next few years and that's worth taking chances. For a genre that simulates business you need to follow the real guideline which is perseverence in the face of staggering odds. 9/10 new businesses fail(false but often quoted stat) and that should roughly guide you when buying EA titles in this genre. You don't avoid starting a business because your chances are small. In fact the reason you keep going is because that eventual success is worth it. Is this game great...no. However, it has good ideas and flawed execution. Common to EA and this genre. You should buy it to experience it's better mechanics and ideas. You should buy it to show the developers that there is still a market for this type of game. You should buy it to keep this developer making games. His next will be better than this. Eventually he could make the gold standard tycoon game. If you don't support it because it's not perfect then you guarantee the chances of playing a great management game go down for all of us. That's the simple fact.			"

Final ThoughtsNot recommended.Game crashed before the tutorial was able to be completed. Occasional user interface (UI) elements persisted on the screen after a menu was closed, the only way to clear the screen was to quit the game and reload. Questing is tedious with a lack of polish to the interface. The hero management interface is broken and only half the intended features seem to work. The item systems is just barely working at this point resulting in game breaking bugs and lost inventory.IntroductionThis game is a unique twist on the classical RPG formula where instead of playing the hero, you manage their city. There are no monsters to battle, but you can train your heroes to improve their base statistics, solve quests to gain followers and cash. The ability to send multiple heroes in a party on epic quests is also fun. Sometimes a sub-quest involving the vanquishing of a villain appears or substantially better loot is to be had. The town has special buildings available once a certain level of experience is obtained.QuestingSending your heroes out on a quest involves a somewhat unique screen where you have to select six pieces of equipment they will take on their journey. This is interesting at first since each piece of equipment has a priority and some does nothing to assist the quest. As the heroes quest, more equipment and missions are unlocked. Once the equipment is placed in its correct priority slot, the mission results in better rewards. Unfortunately, the next time a hero goes on the same quest, this entire setup must be repeated. It gets tedious after a while since ultimately there are 30 different pieces of equipment available and the selection screen is limited to what it displays so there is a lot of scrolling involved. Understandably, the developers added a history screen and indicators to what equipment may be useful, though frustratingly they have this on a different ""history"" screen which causes a lot of back and fourth between the two windows.HeroesThe hero hire screen allows a hero to be hired. The statistics attached to each one has no explanation to what they are for resulting in either a lookup on the internet or just selecting randomly. Once a hero has been hired, they wander the town doing nothing unless they are actively on a quest. Once back from a quest they will be tired or injured. They must be selected on the main map screen and directed to the healing facilities. The hero management interface is broken and telling a hero to go heal from that screen results in the hero ignore the command. This is especially frustrating if there are many civilians exploring the town since it is hard to find a particular hero in the crowd. However, the training options from the hero management work, so get them guns son.ItemsThere seems to be a nice collection of fun items to acquire over the course of a game. Some improve the city, some are equitable on heroes. Unfortunately some of the biggest game breaking bugs come from items. Certain city improvements (rugs and pots) can be used to improve vendors in the game. After making an improvement, the item doesn't disappear and can be reused multiple times. After nearly five minutes upgrading all the vendors millions of gold were added to the treasury every time anything was purchased. Once the upgrades to the city were finished, any items left in the inventory were missing.			"

								So far this game has a high potential for vaporwarehood, since rubes like me end up buying into concepts rather than waiting. This game is currently incoherent and plays as if it's the developer's first real project outside of their education. It's not difficult to put text on the screen or try to explain some elements of gameplay.Early Access is not an excuse to drop build 0.0.2 on the internets for money, you actually have to make a semi-respectable build before pushing your game out.

The art is from paint and many things are reused such as character portraits or models. The questing system is unintuitive and for the most part what you do doesn't change anything. Simple things like purchasing upgrades have bugs such as not being able to purchase something that requires 20 reputation when you have 20 reputation. There are free games out there at a much higher quality that don't ask for money. I can't recommend this to anyone.			"

In the Indie game boom graphics don't really hold much relevance, so this has nothing to do with graphics. I am an avid tycoon enthusiast and management simulator, and this falls short on EVERY level. Very minimal control, and little to no reward. Great premise, and could be amazing but the features need to be expanded upon. There is just nothing that captures attention, or makes me feel emotional attatchment, or reward for the investment of my time. Sorry, but I can't even play for more than 10 minutes.

								Horrid and typically unplayable. very slow during gameplay and very buggy, its a goodpremise but it freezes and crashes all the time some of the mechanics can use balancing such as the attractiveness and how fast it goes down even though you have a limited space... dont buy this game try it on demo and see first if you can because steam wont let you refund if its over 2 hours good luck			"

												ITs an interesting concept, Very blocky and it kind of hurtfull to the eyes. Its something about the size of it all that hurts. The game in it self works ok ish but thers some bugs and for instance you cannot seem to replace pathways once youve placed them in the connection spot for buildings. seemed to bug out and get a window that was partialy see through but no information when you tried to demolish a building that was occupied. Im disapointed in it. It could have been better.			"

								Waste of money as it stands right now. As stated by earlier reviews, it shares a bit too much with Game Developer tycoon, and it would greatly benefit from removing any such system and instead have heroes use specific character stats for quests. As well as random, non controllable heroes deciding to move into your kingdom as random NPCs and perhaps random monster invasions that said heroes can kill. There's much to be done with this.It needs to be something more than what it is right now to be worth 5€			"

								Listne, this game has potential to become something niche and very compelling, but at current state I cannot recomend it as of yet, and here's why.The game starts of with a lot to learn and not a lot to do. And after placing a few building and getting a hero, you need to send him on a quest, 10 times. Sand roads cost a lot in maintenance, and do not make the mistake in thinking this is a city builder, or an adventure game. As of yet, it's not a lot of anything.I'll give it a good number of updates again before I'll try it again.			"

								If the gameplay stays teh way it is, I would not recommend this game. The game is basically a reskin of Game Dev Tycoon (GDT). The Quests are the games you make, with Location/Type being console/genre. The game has a fun premise, where you create an RPG town, but the Quest system needs a major overall. If it remains as a rehash of GDT game making process, then I would never recommend you purchase this game if you have ever played GDT. There are some nice additions, like travelers who come to see your kingdom, but the Quest system bugs me so much that I cannot continue playing the game.			"

								Being a huge fan of tycoon/simulation games, all I can say is so far so good. The game has a pretty promising start for being early access and in alpha, the questing works and has quite a bit of diversity. Since it's too early in the creation process to critique the game much, the only thing I can say is that one of the downsides is that there aren't enough buildings yet. However, I can't wait for more buildings, more quests and more game in general. Just keep up the good work.			"

								This game has the potential to be so much more , and will definitely get there . The only thing so far that is a little irritating, as of august is the little to no source of tutorials for the game .. other than that it's great for an early access game for $5 ! You essentially need to maintain your own economy in your kingdom by sending your heroes on quests in order to earn ' g's ' to pay for your expenses ( heroes and buildings ) , the more successful the quest , the bigger the payout . Can't wait for missions/campaign . Thanks Skatanic Studios !			"

								A lot of bugs! But has a lot of potential!However if you're looking for fancy graphics or are annoyed by underlying systems that require a lot of trial and error to master (I'm especially talking about the sliders during quests) you might want to look elsewhere.Otherwise it's hard to say a lot because it's obviously not a finished product.  I'd like to see more though.UPDATE 5/24/15There's been a lot of changes since I wrote this review.  The entire game has been... and still is being... overhauled.  While the sliders are gone, there is still a lot going on in this game that leaves me with question marks over my head as to what I doing.  In addition there's so many messages and things going on that you don't have time to think about what to do.Perhaps one of the NPC's in the game says it best when a bubble appeared over his head that said ""You can tell this is early access"".  But this seems like an understatement.  The progress that's been made on this game is a little disappointing and while I still like the concept I can no longer recommend this game as it is.			"

								It's fun and easily addicting, but can be frustrating. Granted it's still in Early Access and has some bugs to work out. One such bug is the timer. I've had it happen twice now, where after you hit around year 12 it just stops advancing. I've also sent hero's to train and they just dissapear completly. They still exist in my roster, and says they are Training, but they are gone. Sacking 'em gets rid of them, but after spending time leveling up the character it can get a bit annoying. However, I do enjoy the heck out of this game and these few issues get fixed before official launch. :)			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this game because it was on sale (even if it's a measly sale--always wanted to play it).There's no tutorials and it's pretty much all trials and errors. Your kingdom Attractiveness is. . frankly a very stupid feature as it decreases over time which you're forced to place more silly decorations (you can't remove the ones you placed previously because it'll drop your attractiveness). At one point, my kingdom is filled with stupid crap instead of buildings.You can send heroes out to help your settlement but beware, they only like a very specific type of quest and if you do it wrong, their happiness will decrease. There's also mix and match items which isn't bad but the quest for settlements are very annoying. If their happiness is low but their risk of being invade whatsoever is high, and you send in heroes, voila, you've now lost your settlement (even if the quest you chose to help is what they like). Makes sense? No? I don't understand neither. What would've help is the settlement send messages saying WHAT they need help with instead of crappy guessing and even if right, fail regardless.Mostly everything is diceroll and you have no idea what influences it, which is annoying as hell.Sometimes you might lose your adventure through bugs (for me--he's forever in ""recovery mode"", you can't even sack him to make space).Annoying UI, if you want to upgrade a building, you have to carefully hover over it alone and then carefully make it back to the upgrade screen, if you by any chance, unfortunately hovered over one of those townies .. well then, repeat the process until you make it to the upgrade screen. Mouse hover shows stats of whatever you're hovering over.You can't redo the placement for you building if you want to move somewhere else. The map you started off is pretty small so I cramped a lot of buildings and decorations (thank you Attractiveness crap), and then everything become a giant jumble piece of crap.There's not much of things you can truly research for, after a while, it's the same thing over and over again (pretty quickly too). Overall, I would not recommended this game to anyone at this current stage.			"

								This game is far from enjoyable, it is playable, but not fun at all. There are some things that need to be changed or added:1. you have to be able to change your camera view while you're building something2. you have to be able to rotate your building in 4 directions and not only in 2 as it is now3. in ""building mode"" you need to have a reset button or be able to sell the last building you built to the full price, because right now the game punishes you for everything you build and then notice that it isn't the way you wanted it to be4. it would be nice to do things while in pause mode (minor problem)5. the hole questing system is either to complicated or not explained enough, I think it isn't explained enough because for example I couldn't figure out what the diffrent approaches really did diffrent and what stats were good for what approach6. don't use bars, numbers are much more informative7. explain why it is beneficial to assign heroes to diffrent buildings and/or settlements8. make a free mode where you don't have to compete with other kingdoms, where the goal is just to build your townTo be honest I really loath the ""competing rubbish"" in all the Tycoon games, I think it's sad that there is no other way they can make a challenge, but in the business tycoon games it at least makes sense, while in such a fantasy setting there should be something more interesting you could do with the tycoon/town builder-idea.

								This Game is Amazing. The music is very good, the graphics are simplistic but very detailed, and the compitition bewteen the kingdoms can drive a user to go farther and try to expand and grow their kingdom. However, There are many bad things about this game as well. When I say bad, I don't mean bad, I mean that could be fixed in the future and because this is an early access game and is very orginal to say the least is a very good acomplishment by the developer. The bad things about this game is that, I feel, when a user uses the arrow keys or wasd, the movement is too slow, now I have to admit. I haven't looked in the options for a change of speed but I feel like it isn't there, feel free to correct me if I am wrong. RPG Tycoon is one of my favourite games right now and Here's why. First, It's easy to get used to. You can get straight into the game and the game will teach you how to play and after 30 minutes-1 hour you know how to run and set-up your kingdom. Second, what I like about this game is that it allows you to be very creative and you can design your own kingdom however you like, but, this comes at a cost, while you are designing your kingdom it seems that you can only build on 2 sides and can only see one way. I believe this is because the camera is at a fixed postion and cannot move 3 dimentionaly, but that only limmits your creativitiy very little. Third, the implacation of a tourniment between the kindgoms and the fact that you have to have relations with other little cities that are under your kingdom, or claimed by your kingdom is very orginal, at least I have never seen this way of doing it in other games, the closest game I can think of that does this is the Civilization series, mainly Civilization V or 5, with the city states and how you can control them, but not as much as you can in this game.All in all I give this game a 8/10, however, this is excluding all of the bugs and code issues that I am seeing on the fourm and experencing myself, I am purely Rating on how fun the game is to me and how much enjoyment I can get from RPG Tycoon.

								Edit: It appears they have promptly rectified the issue I had overnight. Well played.Keep up the good work.----------Have had this game for a while now; a lot left to be desired. With every patch it takes a step in the right direction, but in its current state, It's buggy. Very buggy.If you make buildings opaque and build some new ones and hit the opacity button again, the buildings you made opaque go back to normal and the new buildings go opaque and vice versa. Then when you attempt to save and restart your game, it's even worse than before. The neighbouring land you can purchase is no longer purchasable, some of it says it is for $250 though when you click it says $2000 (or whatever It's supposed to cost again.Look, I really would like to love this game, It has the potential to do so.. but time is starting to run out in my opinion.I wouldn't pay at the $8 price point.

												Let me start off with this, this game is really nice. I've been playing nonstop for the past few hours now and it's a really smooth playing game. There is a little learning curve(bankrupted my first kingdom) but once you get used to it, it's not hard. I'll start with my first impressions. There is a tutorial that I'm guessing helps you through it(I skipped it and learned by mistake). The game starts off kinda tedious because you only have a few quick quests you can do at the start and you just cycle through all 5 until you get a few more. You luckily don't have to remember what works best for each quest because it has a history feature which shows what goes with what. The art style reminds me of tycoon type games back in the 90s and early 2000s. The UI is nice and easy to understand with tooltips telling you what each button does. I noticed a few typos but nothing a hotfix can't remedy. After a few hours the game starts to pick up because you can now start what are called Epic Quests. Epic Quests are quests that take 2 or more heroes to start. These quests allow you to get more supplies and quick quests as well as other valuable items like weapons and armor. You don't need to do epic quests just to get more quick quests once you unlock the library(I think kingdom level 3) you can research all types of things from lower maintenance costs for your buildings to more followers per settlement. Don't get me started on modding this game. It's one of the easiest games to mod. First off everything is shown in pretty much plain text(XML) and they have a whole page of the site to help with modding the game. Let's say you want to mod the UI to have a few different textures(I completely changed the color of the UI to green, which you can get on the workshop) all you have to do is go into the UI.png spritesheet change the text you want and next time you load the game it's changed. I recommend making the mod in a folder in the mods folder to make disabling and enabling them easier. Adding quests and heroes is also very easy by just adding a new line to the heroes.xml. Pros:- Easy to use interface- Modding support- Self-explanatory UI and functions- 90s and early 2000s tycoon nostalgia look and feelCons:- Few bugs- Little grindyRating:9.5/10Edit: The customer support is amazing. The new update(1.0.6) broke my save but the dev is already pushing out a fix for it and it's only been like an hour. Not only that but he also helped me through any help I needed for modding.			"

								RPG Tycoon is a really solid old school Tycoon game, the dev has been working on it regualrly which is a good sign for an early access game these days! and it's come a long way in the last 3-4 months. I'm looking forward to playing this when it's fully released. At the moment I dip in and out with each release, but Im looking forward to the full game. Some fun little eastereggs too//			"

								It's quite a good game for early access, with enough time and effort put into the game, it'll be a great game once it's finnished. I'd reccomend buying it if you want to support it- or just to get it cheap while you can. Definitly has alot of potential and I can't wait to see what it'll look like finnished.			"

								For a game this early in development, it's pretty amusing. I understand that borrowing a few of the Game Dev Tycoon gameplay mechanics for the quest system is a safe starting point, but I hope they give it a bit more of a unique flavor.			"

								8/16/2014 reviewGood first Impressions:Cool, seems like you start off with quite a large building area, must be a lot of content in this game!Oh, look! You can send heros out on a quest! SICK!Villagers can settle in your town? That's neat.Look, they bought potions from my shop! Alright!Bad first Impressions:Cool, all this building space and nothing to build.Oh look! You can send your heros to do the same repeditive quest and get interupted by a ""what now"" window in the middle of looking at your empty lot.These villagers keep coming to my town but nothing else happens? Where do they go?Look, they think my potions are too expensive at the starting price! Great!The game sure does crash a lot... wonder what thats all about.As is, I don't think its a bad game~_______________________________________________________________________________________I really want to see this game become more, more buildings, customizable heros, ect.Things I expect to see later:Builds that people will move into-Train a hero from nothing, no pre-set heros like they have now. You hire a novice and send him on quests, the more he levels you can set stat points yourself. The more gear he finds you can tell him what gear to equip-If you don't get to be the hero atleast you should have some say-so in what he does. "

								So far, all I can say is that I LOVE IT! The story and all! It was so much fun, but there was only one problem. It seemed that all of the choices I made in the outcome were random. I used the same strategy, the same hero, and the same quest, but it seems to be random with the outcome. Also I accidentally sacked a hero. Twice. There should be a warning before you sack a hero.

								The game is still in very early development but at the moment I am not finding the game to be as fun as I would like it. The game has a lot of potential and is fun for the first 30 minutes but then dies down into a game where there is nothing to do and it seems pointless playing. I found my self building a town with every single building possible and then just sending my hero on quest after quest. I was not unlocking new buildings and nothing extremely exciting was happening.Some of the mistakes were fustratingly annoying - The main one for me was the amount of spelling mistakes I saw. I understand that the developer might speak another language other than English (I hope) but the mistakes need to be fixed before the final release. There was also constantly froze everytime I went to the potion store and it would say I didn't have enough reknown (currency) when I did.All up the game needs to work on keeping excitement constant and not dragging down in 30 minutes. I see how this game can come good though in future updates (maybe adding plagues or something exciting so that you will need to work harder to keep your followers?)			"

								I like what i've seen, and for the price i payed i have recieved my moneys worth. I look forward to further updates and hope to see it improve drastically, I realize i took a risk investing in an early access project and I hope to see that risk rewarded, and as of right now i am satisfied with my purchase. There is not much to do at the moment, so be aware, however there is due to be more content as the game progesses.If you are not comfortable with the idea of investing money with the hopes of a return, then you should avoid this game. That is all. Thank you for the good work, and hopefully the game gets better. Again, i've only put in around .7 hours thus far, and it is obvious the game is in early development, and so any potential customers be aware of this. Thank you!			"

								as  of AUGUST 11, 2014. Developers, please fix the glitch where, only one quest can be active at a time, even with 2 or more heros, and all other heros leave after the one on a quest returns, i got no idea waz up wit dat. as for the actuall gameplay, it's good but there needs to be more of it, i only have one contract, and the reward is broken. there need to be more upgrades. As of now, it's good but incomplete i'll check back a while later with an updated review. p.s. devs, i could help with trading cards and achieves if needed. thank you.as of AUGUST 18, 2014. The latest Patch fixed many problems. The quest system is much better based on choices rather than sliders. I like that gold is more common ,however reputation is stupidly impossible to come by. I Also noticed that each time i reload the game i have a new list of settlements... this is bad. i understand that it's designed to be more challenging but since you gain more rep on well paired mission to settlement the fact that you can start without any good matches is annoying... it doesn't need fixed.. just wanted to mention it. as of now, I would like to see a better balance of the 2 currencies. While i beleive all early access games are crap waiting to be sifted for diamonds, i do believe i'm starting to see something sparkle.as of MARCH 18, 2015. the first thing that greets any player in any game is the title screen. it is a bit bare but this is a vaugely minimalist game so i'll let it slide... and why can't i open the new game tab? my mouse is in the wrong place!?!?! this can be fixed by carefully oppening the options menu and fitting to screen. right, so, new game. the additions of difficulty and length are much appreciated, now on to the game. i'm mixed on the fences, they do help to limit progression, but that is a double edged sword. the GUI is a lot smoother, heros have stats and abilities clearly visible before purchase. the variety of initial quests is a lot larger and epic quests seem much easier. the ""Approach"" system is much simpler, but i think i liked it better before, but the event system is a fair trade. i also think it's better for kingdoms to be added passively during quests. items have been added and loot being given by quests is very satisfying, it feels like you are really progressing from quest to quest. some sentences seem cut off such as: ""earn 500 gold from"" .the research system is much improved. with as far as i got, a lot has changed, it became more difficult to make stores, there is an end of the year report which tells you who's winning, over all it is much better and i will probably continue it in the future.

Early Access Review
								March 20th 2015 Update:So its been nearly 6 months and I thought that this is a Early Access game and 6 months should be a nice distance of time for upgrading, updating and fixing, and I can say that RPG Tycoon has seriously updated since its August 2014 edition.So what has upgraded the game?In my original review, I had said little but had pointed out that the game was broke as, and now it feels nice and smooth and runs perfectly, so far I have come across some little glitches, but none were too game breaking.Next is about how the game was originally a borefest, and it was, there was 0 to do, and now there is a lot of stuff to  do, and it feels like a true tycoon game unlike the original, and that is what makes it great now, it is a game worth time, which won't get boring in about 1 hour. And well there is still a lot of room for upgrades with that, as it shows, there is so much potential that is showing now, and hopefully it can use the rest of the time it has in early access perfectly.Last of all is how it has upgraded so well in its looks and navigation, unlike its original version which had a clunky and broken menu and lacked anything, it now added stuff which are needed, now there is some options still to be added but the important ones are  there, which is great. And also the game is actually possible to navigate, at first it took me about 4 minutes to get into the game, which was a let down at that, but now it is fixed, and takes mere seconds, even less at that, and its worth it.Now with all the positives, the game still does have problems, it does feel that is lacks buildings and size, and after a bit I felt that this stuff could've been added when after all this was a problem for people, though I understand that fixing the game was a big thing needed.So is  it worth buying RPG Tycoon at the moment?Yes it is!Over the course of 6 months this game has came from being a cluggy bit of a mess to a true and great tycoon game, which is worth £5, after all it goes to help the dev upgrade.8.5/10ORIGINAL:Though the game is far from finished, this game just doesn't have any fun to it, and that is most likely because it is very buggy and there is nothing to do, but there is still a lot that can be done while it is in Early Access, but for now i recommend people stay away from this until it gets better as at the minute it is just a borefest			"

Early Access Review
								So, for an early access game I had some fun with what was there.I managed to get almost all the buildings up ( except the 50k gold one) before maxing out my quest types. At some point I was working on maxing out the areas to do quests in, when I became unable to do more quests. That was a mood killer.Tried to fire the hero I was using and get a new, it didn't work. This game is still a lot of fun, but just remember what ""Early Access"" means.Some things for the dev should he/they see it.I placed my store on the edge of the map ( the one that I can sell items to) and the adventurers were traveling to the oppsite side of the map to buy something, and then moon walking back. While hillarious, probabley not what you intended.There's an issue with hiring more than 1 hero ( I can't) and aparently if you hire two of the same kind, then you'll get charged for two, but not be able to use the second.I was finishing up a raiding quest ( i'm fairly sure it was a raid) and it told me ""I need more null""I was more confused when it told me my stealth didn't help and I didn't have any points in stealth for the quest.I'd really like to see the ability to redo a quest you've already done, although I am hoping that they grayed out ""previous quest"" will at one point allow you to do just that.Again, I had fun and I cannot wait to see more from this game in the future. Now's a great time to pick it up too!			"

								This is easily one of my favorite games but it's as frustrating as it is fun. While I love to send my heroes on adventures and create towns, I hate the way you build up debt and lose your kingdom instantly. It's a little unrealistic. I'd like to watch my kingdom crumble and perish instead of read some dialogue about it supposedly crumbling and perishing. Anyway... It's a great game. Definitely worth the money. I don't know what everyone else is complaining about.Another thing to consider is that this is an ""Early Access"" game. It's under construction and is no where near completion. But it's still pleasurable and I love to think that others enjoy it as well.			"

								Skatanic studios commented on the old Review I left which basically warned everyone to stay away from this game, I think that was version .3 because as of version .5 I can see major improvements that makes the game acceptable from just a few minutes of playing.  This being said I quickly ran into some of the same problems that I found the first time around.+Fixed the look of the game so it's much smoother.+Makes you earn your way to a larger land for your kingdom which I actually enjoy.+Tells you what most things do such as skills, very useful as I would have thought sprint had an upside otherwise.+Fixed how hard it is to make gold+Gives you guidelines/goals to help you grow your town.+You can make your town look nearly any way you want over time.+Makes fun of it's self.  I've had someone come in my new town and even admit it looks like it's still in aplha.Cons that I'm still waiting to be fixed.-What you bring on a quest may not help at all.  I've done a combo of farm hand and peaceful village once and got a decent score out of it, though when revisiting it later it told me to bring beater weapons and twice that their magic was better.... WHAT?!  I thought I was farming not slaying.  -Still only faces places south east and south west from what I can see.  Though this is minor.-You'll want to stick on easy as it may be a bit insane any other way.  More so if you've played the older versions.-They don't tell you what the items you'll take on your quest influence or are effective with.-And the final con, for me, is the other version spoiled my taste for this game and I admit I'm simply re-doing this review as it would be unfair to SS not to try after all the hard work they put in.All in all I'd say pick it up for 5 bucks heck 7 isn't too bad if you feel like you need a Tycoon game.  Just keep in mind the game is not yet finished so something that bugs you may be fixed, speaking of bugs be careful when naming your town, you may have to restart the game due to your cursor getting glitched.

								Edit: My original review was a thumbs down. And in all honesty, it still probably would be. But I can see that the developer has really put some effort and heart into making this a better game. It's super addictive and overall a major step up. But regaurdless, it's still a buggy broken mess. From the moment you turn it on, optimization issues abound. There is no good way to play this game. Period. The only way to make the text legible is to make the windows to big that they take up the whole sceen. And as for the game itself... Tourist constantly clip in and out of the ground. When you type your name at the title screen, the text is far away. And I finally had to stop playing whenever my blacksmith shop clipped into the ground and a square over from where I placed it. So I deleted it. But the game permanatly kept those squares blocked off. So... and I kept doing this no matter where I placed the shop. Making my small area unusable (and it didnt help when I realized it autosaves every time you place an object.) So, in short... This would have made a great game to play. but not a great game to pay for. And again... thats where the issue lies. But if you just fix those bugs, you'd be golden.So just keep on trying. And... Enjoy the thumbs up.			"

I understand that the developer might speak another language other than English (I hope) but the mistakes need to be fixed before the final release. There was also constantly froze everytime I went to the potion store and it would say I didn't have enough reknown (currency) when I did.All up the game needs to work on keeping excitement constant and not dragging down in 30 minutes. I see how this game can come good though in future updates (maybe adding plagues or something exciting so that you will need to work harder to keep your followers?)			"

Early Access Review
								I like what i've seen, and for the price i payed i have recieved my moneys worth. I look forward to further updates and hope to see it improve drastically, I realize i took a risk investing in an early access project and I hope to see that risk rewarded, and as of right now i am satisfied with my purchase. There is not much to do at the moment, so be aware, however there is due to be more content as the game progesses.If you are not comfortable with the idea of investing money with the hopes of a return, then you should avoid this game. That is all. Thank you for the good work, and hopefully the game gets better. Again, i've only put in around .7 hours thus far, and it is obvious the game is in early development, and so any potential customers be aware of this. Thank you!			"

								Good for the most part, especially for Early Alpha. It's an interesting concept, and one I would like to see completed some time in the near  future. I wouldn't recomend the game just yet, unless you're looking for a good game to back on steam. I enjoyed playing this, and I can't wait for it to have a full release.			"

One of my heroes was walking around but had completely vanished as I couldn't select them for any quests etc. The heroes tab just paused the game. The quest I was in the middle of just vanished. I hate when games are allowed on early access when they are totally unplayable in any way like this.			"

Early Access Review
								6/1/15 Updated Game: Who knows anymore. New build, new bugs. Lots of new and intersting things. LOTS of new and frustrating bugs. Much of the idea of how the game played previously is gone. I ladore aspects of the new build but am remiss to comment because, like game of thrones, i suspect if i love it it will go away.4/6/15 Updated** I have to give it to the guy. Easily the most dedicated solo developer I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. He ligitimately wants to turn out and enjoyable final product that he devotes quite a bit of time to. The recent changes in my opinion, move the scope of the game quite a bit and dull it up a touch but those are just asthetic. Having watched his work and progress, i believe he will develop a balance that works. Buy his game at the price of half a movie and youll get two movies worth of time out of it with a developer that deserves your assistance. He's going to make good games, lets help him make a middling one.3/18/15  Updated** The most recent update is lightyears ahead of where this developer was previously. The changes that are being made are game benifitial and working. Game still hanging but that is hardly anything more than an inconvience at this alpha stage. The game is much improved but not enough for me to recommend you buy it. There is hope though that the game will turn out a playable and possibly fun game at the end of his journey at this point. ** Original review **The most positive thing i can say is the developer is active in the community. I cant say much gets fixed that people talk about but he adds things  then those things break. Its going to end as a mediocre 1/2 done game in my opinion. Its okay and i have played it but even in Alpha or beta or whatever stage is Give me your money while i putz around my house for the next ten years is... its more broke than many better games at or near its price point.

												I've enjoyed this game so far, though honestly a majority of the enjoyment has come from unlocking achievements rather than the content of the game itself since it's fairly simplistic once you realize how to make money on the base game.  Most games of the tycoon or city builder nature have multiple resources competing and impacting your progress, with selection of stats to grow being very impactful to your success.In RPG Tycoon, the only really significant resource is money and everything else is tiertiary at best unless your aiming at unlocking specific achievements (which is what I've enjoyed doing!).  A single resource isn't necessarily a bad thing, however there's also only really one effective way to get that resource, and that is quests.  Within a single game, you'll come across the same quests multiple times, and while it's nice the first playthrough to see what the alternative choices would get you, it gets a bit grindy.As your heroes grow, so does the amount of gold quests give.  This also keeps your settlements happy, so you don't need to choose between doing quests and having your heroes help around town since the answer is always do quests.  This results in the game getting a bit on the grindy side, but since I'm usually playing it while doing something else such as cooking or waiting for something to compile, it doesn't bother me as much as if I were trying to sit down and stay focused only on the game.That said, I liked the game though it's very simplistic (nothing really matters but money, even though the ""Grow Your Kingdom"" tasks make you feel like you might have something to do other than run quests over and over again to grind out more money.  The only decisions you really make early on are avoiding going into severe debt early on because you don't know to grind quick quests and epics for cash yet.The idea behind this game is great, but the execution still needs a bit more work and polish.I'm hopeful the game will continue to improve with updates since it's been updated rather frequently recently, so I am currently recommending it!EDIT: I also agreed with the reviews about a number of bugs that break the game, but that said when I came across an issue, it was fixed within the next update after I posted a review about it, so I can't really complain too much there.As a result, I'll be buying the expansion & update my review later.

												Very recommended for a number of reasons :-1. Very Nice music and very good quality sound to it, for me this is always a selling point for a game its nice to be able to get lost into a game and the music enables this tremendously.2. Solid gameplay and alot going on at once keeps your attention and you don't get bored3. Easy controls allthough a dropdown legend of shortcuts for each tab would be desirable.I could go on and on to be honest, i have a review on youtube which i will leave on my community page for you guys to see if you wanna see how the game actually runs. But overall i really like this game it has alot of really solid area's. It looks good doesn't cause any problems with framerates. Has alot to do and it quite difficult especially when you get further down the line and get more heroes.I hope this helps.I would like there to be more of a D&D approach to the mid quest events. It would be nice to read the event as if it were said by a dungeonmaster. Other than that no complaints well worth the price.			"

								So far with my limited experience of the game, I have learned that experimentation is key. I like this facet of the game because it allows me to sink a lot of time in to discover the perfect combination to yield the greatest results. The game is small currently, but it is only early access and I have full confidence that it will grow into something great. The price is fair as well, I can't argue 5$. It would be nice to throw in following your heroes as they quest, but I can live without. No microtransactions! Thoroughly excited to see what comes of this game.			"

								Remember this game came out today (8/4/14) and of course everyone is gonna complain they can do this and that. Well first off it is in ALPHA! So don't complain or give this a bad review since overall right now even though I have found plenty of bugs. I let the maker of the game know. That is why we got this early access. If you though it was going to be different and a full game in Alpha then you are a idiot.This game is a nice throw back to the old Sim's like RC2 and RC1 as well as Pharoh and such based on the graphics. Gameplay is a work in progress but is manageable to work around. Nothing really game breaking since this game is again in Alpha and we are here to report problems. I would say buy this game and help out and enjoy the growth of a very cool idea. For 4.49 right now can't really go wrong.			"

								I have been waiting for this game ever since I saw that it was going to be released, and so far... I love it.  The concept is great and it's the kind of game I've been looking forward to playing.  But, I ran into a glitch, when I sent my only Hero to the Tavern to lose fatigue, he kept duplicating, and it won't stop, I was still able to actively play the game, but the character kept spawning outside of the Tavern, walking to the house, and doing it again.  Plus, when I need to select a quest, there is like 10 of the same character listed.  I was hoping you fix this minor problem.  Thanks.  P.S, I recommend this game to everyone, and I bought it as soon as I could the day of release.			"

								Before I say anything else, you should know that the game is in early access and needless to say, is VERY buggy and sometimes quite monotonous or boring. With that said, the game has the potential to become a great game in time. I can certainly see this game becoming the next great PC game like DayZ or Game Dev Tycoon. Should you buy this game? Sure! Unlike most early access games, RPG Tycoon is a relatively cheap game, which is (Or if not, it will become) well worth the money.			"

 A key was provided from the developer(s) for review  First Impressions Going into this game I thought it was going to be an annoying, buggy and boring game the developer had spewed up, looking at gameplay and the reviews. Then I launched it, the first thing I realised was the beautiful soundtrack, instructional but not too confusing tutorial, and quite nice graphics (I knew the graphics from gameplay and screenshots of course). Next thing I realised was how easy it is for players that haven't played much management simulators or citys building games (like myself) to know how to play. I can definitely see myself playing this a bit more.Pros  Instructional but not boring or confusing tutorial Clear Interface Beautiful Soundtrack Cheap You have competing Kingdoms Replayability Middle Ground  Alright Graphics Says it could be buggy but no bugs so far Cons  Noobs (like myself) can find it difficult to keep up happiness and money Cannot fully rotate buildings Was rushed out of early access (says there are bugs that need to be fixed but took it out of early access) No ""Move Object"" tool Summary/Conclusion RPG Tycoon is a cool indie management simulator/city building game made by Skatanic Studios. Its graphics seem quite nice and are 3D skyview graphics which more games definitely need. The controls are pretty good however the only way you can move is with the LMB and cannot use the keyboard, which some people prefer with city building sims. RPG Tycoon is quite a fun and relaxing game to play on a tired night, and is not too hard either (but not too easy).Overall I think the game is pretty and fun. 8/10 I review games at these links!

								It's a whole lot of fun, though there are some changes I know need to happen. First, you need to fix all the bugs. This you know. There need to be a whole lot more quests. If that's going to be a large part of the game, perhaps even make a mode where you can write your own quests and submit them to a forum. Think of it sort of like spore's creature creator library. Except it works. There are a few balancing issues, and I think that the 'what you take' box for quick quests is a little... erm... what you take doesn't fit what you would use. What I would suggest instead is have you chose the items, and use them for epic quests. Have those items factor into how well you can complete the roll-challenges. (ie. You chose camping gear, extra armor, extra horses. There is a quest that, because you have extra weapons, you are able to use a hidden response where the item is then ""used"". )			"

I felt I could concentrate on the elements that appealed to me and discover the depth at my own pace. There is always something to do and always something I was working towards. Highly recommended.

								While the game is in early access it seems to be missing quite a few things that i hope are patched in with the next update. For instance, to place path's at the moment you have to constantly go into the buy menu rathher than just clicking and dragging. And at the moment there is very little in the game. But it does look like it could turn out to be quite good given time. And we all have to remember that the game is being developed by one person instead of a team. I'll probably write a proper review of it when it get's more features. But, as alot of other reviews (and the developer himself) have stated, If you aren't willing to provide feedback for the game then wait for it to get a bit more polished before purchasing it. There are some fairly major bug's i've noticed like heroes dissapearing after sending them to the tavern and, when i reloaded my game the tower of acievments(pimps for you AH fans) dissapeared and can't be rebought. But, afterall, alpha is alpha and we can't expect much at this stage.			"

								Awesome game! Alot like Game dev Tycoon in its quest system but it includes a city builder game that adds alot more! You can manage each shops items and its like your creating your own virtual economy! Im currently making a seires of this on my youtube channel if anyone wants to see what the game is like after you buy it! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwf-NS_Qj7wAIfchb-hJNg "

								It was not really what i expected so far, but the game is still under construction.It has too many bugs at the moment..This doesnt mean that i didn't like the game.For what i have seen its a bit like game dev tycoon with more freedom.The idea of the game is still great.I was waiting for a game like this for a long time.Finally you can manage a town and send heroes on quests instead of being a hero and go on your standard journey that gets boring when i think of it.And it has allot of potential, but isn't really playable because of the bugs i had.Hope they will be fixed soon so i can create a great kingdom with lots of heroes and a wealthy town with lots of visitors!!

								RPG Tycoon is early in development, as evidenced by the status board on the store page for it. There is limited playability at the moment, so I would advise against dropping your last precious $5 on it if you are looking for something to provide a lot of near-term entertainment. However, I would keep my eye on the development of this game as it has much potential. If you're interested in supporting that and following along, then maybe that's worth the $5 to you. I don't see myself playing this frequently during Early Access, but I'll still check it out every few months to see how it has evolved.Any purchase at this point should be seen as an aspirational purchase rather than something you're going to sit down and deeply enjoy, right away. I'd normally try to talk people out of such an investment in a game at this point, but at only $5, it might be worth it to you.			"

								Version: 0.1.6 ReviewAfter half an hour of play I had a great grasp on the game, and yes, it is very early in it's development and so it is still buggy and there is not much content to speak of. However, this game has great promise and is already very entertaining. It does remind me alot of Game Dev and similar titles, but it has it's own unique perks and quirks. As for it's price tag... right now I think this game is well worth the money. Due to both it's original idea and the already implemented features. Personally I am happy to back the developer of this game and am happy with my purchase. The only tip I can give a new player is to read all of the descriptions and use common sense in your judgment calls.I can't wait to see this game in it's complete form.			"

You'll find a few bugs here and there, just remember it IS an Early Access Game. Many things you can do, hire heroes, construct bulildings, send heroes on quests, explore to find settlements, very wide range of things you can do for an E.A.GAnd, its only 5$! I definitley reccommend getting this game.			"

								I will change my review after playing some other time, but for now.  [Edit - bottom]I really want to enjoy this game but.... It makes me rage in less than 10 seconds, for many reasons.First,to write the town's name, you have to take off the pointer of the namebar or it will always reset.Second, When ever I press ALT or Space, the screen gets redish and I can't get it off.Third, I can't demolish dirt paths.Fourt, I can't even get the clinic at some place because there is no '' square '' to place it there. ( I did have the place for it ). Also, when I change direction of my clinics. It bugs and make it impossible to even see the haf of it and can't place it anywhere else too.I though after a year it would have been more... fixed than this.... Please I know it is your first game but, before getting new stuff in, Fix everything so it can be playable.[ Edit ] As of Update to 0.5. Even tho loading files delete them,it really improved, in term of fixed bugs AND the ''story'' , it changed in a very good way, Everything needs to be worked out to gain buildings through out your achievements which is great, not right in the stomach. I see forward to other improvements and modification of the gameplay. Just for that update, I can say that you should buy it on sales until it's low on price, worth it if it continu that way.			"

								Mildly Dissapointed in this game for one (and just one) reason;this game is way too similar to Game Developer Tycoon.I bought this game on a whime because one of my other games isn't currently working and I was super frustrated and needed a fix and this was cheap.I didn't read any reviews or look it up online like I usually do before buying games...especially Early Access games.Initially I was enjoying myslef, a few bugs here and there (a quest that never ended) along with my town being a complete failure a few times made me disheartened but overall I really liked the idea behind the game...but something about this game reminded me of a different game....I go down to read the comments and it seems like my fears were confirmed.To any developer who may read this: You have a fun idea. Don't ruin it by behind a mock off of a different game. Don't deny that they aren't similar, because they are. It was one of the first thoughts that came to mind. Keep being origional and this game could be solid-- it's definately a solid idea.To anyone wondering if they should buy it: wait a few months.			"

I can not make it even 20 minutes into the game with out encountering a bug that completely stops you from continuing on. Also there is a variety of bugs well, from the game just locking up to features not working, so at the moment you can't even seem to play around the bugs. I look forward to being able to play a polished version of this game but fear with out support we may never see it.			"

For a beta the graphics are definately the worst I have seen.My input to the creator,Keep going! I have been waiting for a game like this for some time. I would definately like to see better AI on the hero's side with buying equipment, doing small things like recovering HP and resting (not sure if that was happening to be honest), and working with other hero's. But all in due time. For now keep going with the basics. ^_^ kudos ^_^			"

The only reason I would play this game for any length of time would be for the steam achievements and badges. Otherwise, this game will collect dust.Still, it's only $5 retail price and in continuous development. Therefore, if the objectives of the developer resonates with you, then throw $5 to the game's future development. I have no buyer's remorse, myself.			"

Early Access Review
								Brief summary of beta version of RPG Tycoon- Game is very buggy as warned, looks very promising but needs to take some pages from successful GameDev Tycoon. Elongated breakdown-Opened up my Store on steam to see this little Number pop up! Well hello little number maybe a 1 or even a lil .5. Nonetheless this game was there and as I really have enjoyed playing GameDevTycoon. I think this game can really learn a few things from Gamedev...Graphics- The graphics are good and very reminiscent of old school Runescape. Which plays in very well into the game.Sliders- The sliders don't make much sense and is very vague.. Also are very cumbersome and need some better sound effects the default Window sound is very unappealing.Knowledge in Game- When you begin the game you are very overwhelmed and yet underwhelmed. You get some basic knowledge and are confused at the same time. You have no idea about what is working within the quests (like within the sliders and what works with what also point allocation). Point allocation- The game has a bug where you can adjust the top portion of the allocation system by minusing them and have it return next quest with the points still remaining where you added them last time. Money- I had no idea you lost the game when you ran out of money and so I ended the game within 2 mins by trying to build my city in more and adding roads.. To only have the game be all like you suck GG.Visitors-Their bubbles of text get stuck behind buildings and cannot be read.Quests and making money- NOOO Clue how to make good money, felt like I’m just waiting for my quests tooooo sllllooowwwwllllyyyy produce the little change each time.. Perhaps needs to be upped a bit? or I'm just a bit inpatient, who knows probably the second. The quests also need to be clearer and more feedback is needed and perhaps a memory system again similar to GameDev...UI- is very clear and clean but needs some better animations and sound effects. Hopefully they will add in better tutorials and make the game easier to jump in. Questing- Please make the UI more fun and clear when your hero is on a quest. You get no idea why points are getting added into the certain places. As I said before game looks great, shows a lot of promise and I can't wait for it to be finished to really log in some hours. I hope they change the music to something a lil catchier, add in some better sound effects, update the UI a bit more, and clean up the game all around to be honest. Will play more, look forward to the full release. Thanks for reading my rant. (PS: I’ve only spent a few times on this game so read my review with that in mind) "

Hopefully they will add in better tutorials and make the game easier to jump in. Questing- Please make the UI more fun and clear when your hero is on a quest. You get no idea why points are getting added into the certain places. As I said before game looks great, shows a lot of promise and I can't wait for it to be finished to really log in some hours. I hope they change the music to something a lil catchier, add in some better sound effects, update the UI a bit more, and clean up the game all around to be honest. Will play more, look forward to the full release. Thanks for reading my rant. (PS: I’ve only spent a few times on this game so read my review with that in mind) "

								0.1.6 updateSo far I really like it, and I love that it is not hand holdy at all. One major concern is that the placement for the building is kinda off but I am pretty sure that will be fixed in future updates. Of course I have also noticed a few glitches like the quest counting up in the Loot, Influence, and Damage but the quest never progressed. Another is that I would be recieving funds from my establishments but it won't be counted. But these glitches all can be fixed by going back to the main menu the reloading the save, but still pretty annoying. All in all I am throughly impressed with this game and I can't wait for future updates.0.5 UpdateIt has made so much progress, I am proud to say I am backing this game. A LOT has been added, changed and modified I am glad I picked up this game when I did.			"

Early Access Review
								May I please open by saying this is an unfinished game. Early access games do have problems! Personally, I have not enjoyed the game as much as I would have liked thus far. I have played it for a decent while on my other PC and to be honest, at the moment, I would wait a while until purchase. This game borrows a lot from Game Dev Tycoon. For example, sliders for quests, points going into bubbles to tell you how well things are going and a lack of a decent tutorial. It is extremely hard to pick up and play as early on you realise gold is limited and have no idea how to get your hands on it. Anyway, the game is new to Steam and therefore forgivable. Just give it a few months before you buy.			"

								Très fan de Dungeon village développé par  Kairosoft sur I bidule, ce RPG Tycoon m'a fait de suite de l'oeil tant l'idée de départ , créer et gérer un village de RPG, semble proche. Alors certe le jeu est en  Early Access et il reste encore bien du travail avant d'arriver à un resultat satisfaisant. Pourtant je dois avouer que malgrè les bugs, l'absence de racoursis, le peu de possibilité de développement de votre village, les graphs plutot rudimentaires, le titre m'a déja bouffé quelques heures de ma vie sociale.A suivre donc ^^			"

The graphics are very simplistic, the interface isnt very intuitive.The game simply fails to point you in the right direction, so theres a lot of guesswork to be done (might be fixed with a better tutorial).The games main cycle is boring and unengaing, you choose a quest, and then get to reposition 3 sliders 3 times. And that leads you to get more points, wich is good? Or maybee bad?Definitly needs more explaining to do, the choices are very counter-intuitive, and doing stuff really doesnt feel rewarding at all.			"

Early Access Review
								**********Updated 2/10/2015**********Below you'll see my previous reviews, I'm keeping them there as the review grows, so that any who are interested can see the progress made.Just like last time, I'll list off bugs first:1: Whenever two heroes rest in the same building, one of them will get locked in that building, and will never come out. the only way to get that hero back, is to sack them, watch their avatar leave the town and then rehire them.2: Various mispellings, if those even count as bugs.3: That's it, I haven't encountered any other bugs lately.Btw, for a TL;DR version, scroll to the bottom, just before the next updated line.So how is the game different now?Quick Quests now have a unique gameplay to them, that I haven't played in another tycoon game.First you select a town, then you select a quest type, after selecting that quest type, you have a screen of supplies, the supply screen is what I can assume the influences from Game Dev Tycoon turned into, and it adapts well.You see, each town requires different supplies on different quests, so even if you do a Raider quest in town A, and get all 6 supplies matched in their correct slots, that doesn't mean it'll be the same way in town B.You also do not get all the supplies straight off the bat, while I can't say I like having those supplies withheld, it makes for a lot of replayability as you try and earn all the supplies, so it ends up being pretty damn enjoyable.The Epic quests however feel lacking in comparison to the quick quests, and I think they could really utilise their own unique gameplay, I already see evidence of how this could be achieved with the mid quest story prompts, but I'd like to see something at the start, similar to quick quest's preparation stage, but unique.I don't understand the bounties very well at the moment, I searched for a villain and afterward that quest line became unaccessible.One of my major complaints in the previous versions was the lack of feedback, this has been corrected and there's now a lot of information on the screen, The hud can feel a bit encumbering, I'd like to either see the hud size be controllable in the options, but that wouldn't need to be an exact option, many other solutions would work.The top left window can be minimized but others can not. however, the bottom left one, shouldn't be able to be minimized, I'd rather see it fade into the background when a target isn't selected. I'd also like to see the bottom left window only function when a target is clicked instead of hovered over.The top right information feed, feels rather rough, the messages don't need to stay for long and could actually be automatically deleted for you, I'm sure though that the developer is looking at this, with his own solution in mind.The rest of the hud however, is well designed, pleasing to the eyes and gives relevant information.The research is good, but feels like it lacks a lot of research, and I'd like to see it play a second role.The town management is coming along nicely, and while playing, I actually thought that it was possible to create a self sustaining town, that does not rely on the funds from your heroes.I would like to see that be a thing, a self sustaining town, but I'd rather see it as a possible avenue for development in the game that you have to specifically pursue, and not an eventuality that every playthrough will lead to.TL;DR:The game is now at a playable stage, and the game finally has a strong foundation to fall back on, that doesn't take too heavily from other games.It's enjoyable, and in the playthrough that lead to this updated review, I actually sunk a few hours into it all at once.Rating:What it is: 6.5/10What it could be: 9/10I'm excited to see the end product when it leaves early access, I believe it'd net a 7.5/10 at this rate.********Updated 18/03/2015********First off, a lot of my old points are still rather relevant, the game hasn't terribly improved, and still stands as one of the more broken Early Access games I've played.First to the bugs:I haven't encountered any of the old bugs, but now I've met some of the new ones, one of them is map scrolling, if you roll your cursor to the edge, it scrolls, simple, lots of games have that, but some times when you roll your cursor to one of the edges, it doesn't scroll the map, and you have to jiggle the cursor at the right side of the screen to free it up.Then there's the auto continue, whenever a message pops up, something in the game will happen for example: auto save and the game will continue without me, while I read, the messages are quite length in this game too, so that creates a problem.Finally autosaving also flashes the screen, which is insanely annoying.The developer has steered away from it's Game Dev Tycoon inspired system, however it's current system isn't very interesting, and is still rather cryptic, because you don't get enough feedback after a quest as to why you got a bad rating, and some times the messages get repeated meaning what could have been a useful third message gets pushed off the table by a message I've already read.The game still isn't very interesting, and often puts me asleep, Still not a fan of the art direction, and the gameplay is lacking.At this time, I do not recommend this game.4/10 for the game as is.8/10 for the potential game, that I hope it one day becomes.******First Version******First off, I have to quickly explain:No, I do not hate this game, I actually really really like it and it's concept.The recommendation is in reference to it's playability in the current build.With that out of the way.RPG Tycoon scratches an itch that I love, Management games, I've had a thing for them since I played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.So the ability to create my own RPG town, send heroes on quests and promote my town sounds like a heavenly game to me.But RPG Tycoon is still in early access, the major reason I do not recommend it is bugs, the game is at this current stage full of bugs and glitches, which is not surprising with an Early Access game, that's just early access for you, the developers are still making the game, bugs and glitches are to be expected, But at this time due to some game breaking bugs I can't recommend it.These bugs include (but are only limited to what I've seen thus far)-Duplicating heroes-Time pausing days not progressing but quests remaining open and progressing without reaching a climax.-Saving and Loading does not take the game back to before the bugs occured (not a bug, but is annoying when trying to avoid bugs)And with that part out of the way, here is the rest of my thoughts:The concept is great, I can't wait to see this in a playable state.The graphic style itself I can't say I'm a fan of, I'd like it to be different, but at the same time, it doesn't matter, I'll happily ignore that.The Game Dev Tycoon type of direction with quests is both familiar and inviting, making me wish to try the same quest multiple times, however I feel there needs to be a way to investigate these quests to get hints at what are the right and wrong choices.The music is excellent, it reminds me of minecraft but not in a way that feels bland and unoriginal, the music feels like a winner.Add in random events to the final release? that would be amazing.I can't wait to see the potential for large towns with sprawlling citizens and several different buildings like blacksmith, tailor and what not.I'd like to also request a micromanagement system with the citizens, giving them jobs I mean, and having them live within your city.I have so many high hopes for this game, and I can't wait until it's in a more playable state so I can sit down for a good while and play it.Buy it? please do! the more purchases the more funding, the more funding the quick and better the progression.

There isn't enough information on any of the hero stats to have a meaningful understanding of what's going on with them, and the building aspect is lackluster at best. Great if you can get it really cheap, say for a dollar or less.			"

								Typical early acess game, buggy and with no cherry on top. But instead of the cherry, it has potential. A lot of work has been done in the last year or so, and it is still worked on. Get this if you like tycoon games.			"

								Very addicting gameplay with tons of interesting mechanics. One of the better tycoon games out there. It brings back the nostalgia of older titles such as Zoo and Rollercoaster Tycoon.			"

Early Access Review
								Like many other reviews I give this thumbs up for potential.  The game still needs a ton of work and fine tuning and, frankly, content.On the PROS side is the basic concept.  Run a village as AI Heroes do all the adventuring.  I have no doubt the finished product will be a good game and worth the money, but I'm holding out hope that it will be a great game that is a steal for the price.On the CONS side there is a quite a bit wrong or off.  The FTL lite ""Epic Quests"" feel like random 50/50 guesses.  When it asked me to help a farmer with his pigs 4 times in 4 straight quests I said ""yes"" all four times.  Wrong each time.  However I have no idea how this matters other than XP not gained.  This transitions nicely into the overall lack of a feeling that my decisions matter other than keeping the town in net gains money wise.  2 hours into the game and I don't even read the quest bits anymore, I just pick and option at random and roll on.  100+ hours in FTL and I still read the text.The notifications are also super annoying, they constantly pop up to tell me that it is autosaving, which by the way is frequent and necessary, and to tell me a quest is done.  Of course the quest is done, I just navigated a bunch of pop ups telling me the same information.  Again, we are dealing with information that quickly becomes superflous, which is not a great trait for a resource management game to have.The bonus giving objective queue seems to run out after about 4 sets, though if I remember correctly the Dev noted that is going to be a big part of the next update.I know I mostly have complaints/critiques here, and I could probably find more.  So why recommended still? Because I really really want this game to be great, it's my first alpha build purchase and I want other people to try it out and offer even smarter feedback than I can.Thanks for what you are doing Dev, for the large amount of resource management games out there the lack of quality and non-Farmville variety is sad.  Keep working hard and making this game everything it can grow to be!			"

Early Access Review
								Version 0.61 (2hrs);On this new patch, many negative things about the 0.6 update have been solved. There are of course good and bad points to the game, however with most of the bad ones gone; the game has become very enjoyable. I would now happily recommend the game, just read about the current bugs beforehand so you can really enjoy the wonderful game of RPG Tycoon.I shall not detail you with what has been fixed as you should no longer have those issues, and so I have listed the bugs and errors that I encountered while playing this time around.Minor Isues;1) Without any load files, the load screen shows a fourth place that is partially outside the box, very minor but I like neatness	2) Maybe I did not realise how I was playing but suddenly my kingdom had 1% attraction and all three settlement’s had minimal to no “likeness”. This caused me to resort to spamming my kingdom with decorations just to keep a solid income.	3) Missing sprites when I once tried to use “bread” on a hero, clicking out and clicking back in solved this.	4) A few text bugs and issues when viewing your heroes	5) When you find multiple items with the same image, you can see the additional text of the first one, but not the second, this however is only for this moment and can be viewed normally in your inventory	6) Once when my main hero (The first to hire) went into the “Potion Store” and was finished, his name and a bar was still there above the shop, the hero could do all actions normally and this text issue only disappeared when he returned into the same shop (a few in-game years later)Major Issues;	1) Manually saved and loaded the save file in the second slot (Not Auto-Save), my first 2 heroes that were the quest leaders had returned instantly along with the 2 other heroes that were on the “Epic Quest”, however I could no longer select to do either the “Quick Quest” or “Epic Quest” as I believe the system thinks that they are still on this quest, however with no quest bar at the bottom it could not be fixed. This was a major problem so a long time in-game later I saved it manually again, and loaded it, the issue was fixed, however by then I fired my heroes.All remaining issues were found after the second loading.	2) The villainy tracker had all reset, as well the bounty level had reset.	3) The first of each quest type rewarded me with 0 Gold and 0 Followers, each quest after this was normal.	4) One time my hero just never returned from an “Epic Quest” 	5) Lag started to occur quite a lot.	6) Upon saving and leaving the game, the title screen had turned black, except from a centre square in the screen big enough to see the game was still running, however I could not click on any buttons as they were inside the black screen. This resulted in me having to change tabs out of the game, and manually closing the application.			"

												Very cute game, art style is adorable, the glitches have been mostly fixed and the very few that remain are not a huge concern to the game.Reviewed the game before in early access, but keeping it in the review just to show how far they've come!:Glitchy and time consuming. Once I bought the strongest hero available I was waiting for 10 minutes for him to do a quest,  and although he was receiving a lot of points, I couldnt put any other heroes out on quests while this was happening. Many other glitches like this occured until I just had to quit because it was ruining the game. Apart from that, it was a great concept, but it was released far too early and the bugs are just unbearable!			"

												I have such a love-hate relatoinship with this game right now. I'll start with the bad.Yes people have said bugs, but what bugs? Let me mention my two most annoying ones.1. Deleted/messed up save files. I'll go back in to play and I will be pushed back by a lot of progress and I'll forget how I got to where I'd been so I just start over which is really annoying after the 5th time. The most recent occurence could have been because the game updated, not sure.2. I would click on a character and click on their name and a box would come up, but I couldn't get rid of it and I would have to close out of the game and lose my progress.In addition to this it does bother me a bit that the difficulty curve on epic quests is a bit odd but whatever.Now on to the good!I first purchased this game I think last year? Not sure exactly. But a ton of things have been improved since then making things more logical, giving more options, and I love all of the equipment and items. Really it's becoming a thorough game.I think that this game has a ton of potential but it's still not perfect. I really suggest that anyone try this out, especially those who like time management, rpg mechanics, tycoon games (obviously), or anyone with some free time on their hands. The price is worth it.

Basic InformationTitle: RPG TycoonDeveloper: Skatanic StudiosPublisher: Skatanic StudiosGeneral ImpressionLast time, I dropped a big review here talking about bugs and more. All the bugs I said, the developers solved within the next patch. At this moment, I have nothing to go over anymore.The developers are making this game perfect. It's a lovely Simulation game where u build your own kingdom and try to grow as much as possible. Sounds fun, isn't it.It is, you can go on quests with your heroes, make your economy grow by getting some strangers drunk.Strong Points+ Developers do anything for the game.+ Great and original idea.+ Steam workshop.Weak Points- Some bugs, but solved within next patch.- Sometimes feels slightly empty.Rating 7.1/10 "

												This game is good until you get a Market and find out how cheap you can just buy land.  Normally new land would cost thousands, when you can buy it from the Market for about 1,000.  After a while you make a huge amount of money and don't even need the heroes, you can just keep adding buildings and never lose money when the month ends.  I would recommend this game, just get ready to restart once you hit that unstoppable point.			"

								At it's current state I would not reccomend this game.I bought it a while ago, and didn't like it when I bought it.But I decided to give it a try again today. At first it seemed like it was going well. Until I went to destroy a tree. Then it all went wrong.I tried to close the game, it just wouldn't close.I completly restarted steam, tried again. Nobody would come to my village. I destroyed a building as it was blocking the paths.Then my game fell apart again.There's just way too many bugs making this game unplayable at the moment.  "

								This was my original review when the game was REALLLLLLY early in development:The game is currently way too incomplete to be any fun. I love this kind of games and some of the concepts are nice, but now there is simply not enough content and feature. If it ever eventually ships, it's worth considering. Right now, don't buy it, it's too empty.--Now, I've kinda changed my mind. RPG Tycoon has definitely reached the point where it's actually a full fledged game. You start with a very small patch of land on which you can build a couple of base buildings just to attract some adventurers to send questing. You slowly build up from there, trying to attract tourists from other Kingdoms. It's a game of progressive growth with some kingdom management and an interesting questing system based on guessing what are the correct combinations of supplies to bring while doing a specific activity (original yes, fun I don't know yet). All in all, a pretty likeable kingdom sim so why not, give it a try. Now it's worth it at its price range.			"

												I like this game but atm its just not playable as there are to many bugs that make this game unplayable. IMO I would wait till the bugs are fixed before buying this game .I changed my review from a negative one to a positive one. Most of the bugs that were effecting the game play making it impossible to play have been fixed. The few bugs that are left are not entirely fatal to a game and I have only encountered a few so far in about 5 games of about 1 + hour. Still has some work to be done but its a great game none the less. Glad this gentlmen did not quit working on this game like so many game developers do . Keep up the good work Sir you're game is interesting and quite fun . Thanks !Well I again encountered bugs that stopped me from loading a presvious saved game so I could fniish my game . IF all the critical bugs were fixed in this game , this game would be bad♥♥♥♥♥♥but till then I would say pressure the maker of this game to finish it up so we all can enjoy this game to the very end ...
