												This is the story of Marsh, the kid who played it as cool as possible until the bittersweet end. Obviously, as an American, my study habits are different than that of a Chinese student. Comparing Gaokao to something like the SAT test is a world of difference. So for my playthrough of the game, I played it exactly like I do school in real life. In the beginning, I had it all. The girlfriend, Muxin, friends, and generally nothing to worry about except the first Simulation test, which was about 30 days away. There were a surprisingly large amount of activities to choose from when free time was available, so I thought that the game likely wanted me to see what it had to offer. How wrong I was. After about 30 days of a happy, cute, almost relaxing little game of high-school antics, I screwed up on the first Simulation test. After all, I had barely studied at all during my free time.The tone shift after messing up that test was jarring. The music pretty much ceased altogether, except for this haunting song that played rather frequently when I would have arguments with my dissapointed parents. Muxin wasn't the same either, as her score was rather low as well. Marsh used to be a nice kid, after all, I was the one making his decisions for the most part. After the arguments got more and more intense (to the point where coming home was dreaded), I was no longer able to study. It wasn't my decision any more, it was my character, Marsh, taking the wheel. The arguments got worse. Marsh needed to bring up the test scores, and after talking with Muxin and deciding that the RELATIONSHIP was likely the reason for the low scores, Marsh dumped Muxin after screaming at her about his feelings. I (the player obviously) had no say in this. And the arguments kept getting worse. Marsh's father eventually smacked him a few times. The game was now very depressing. After sleeping outside under a bridge, he finally slipped from all that I had made him. If China wanted him to focus on the test and nothing else, it succeeded. Marsh snapped. Test problems became his entire life for the next 50 days. Grades sky-rocketed, but all of the old characters were nowhere to be seen and health was declining.Eventually, after not eating for days, Marsh collapsed. And I was given a decision after a LONG time. Whatever I did, I picked the right thing, because Muxin, Xiaohan, and Stom saved him, and Marsh was back where he belonged. In the end, I got a decent score and had no girlfriend.This game was an emotional rollercoaster, and it's not just an ""anime game"", it's WAY more than that. I HIGHLY recommend it, and I'll be playing through it again very soon.			"

												As a Chinese student who experienced ""ZhongKao"", the entrance exam for Chinese high schools, I had similar experience.I could still recall those days when we had endless practice tests, papers, teachers getting crazy and try to raise our score (because they get more bonus...?). Parents getting worried on us, believing in nonsense extra classes, useless lectures even fake nutrients, is there gonna be an end...?And back to GaoKao, a much more serious situation than ever (however I didn't experienced this, but I could imagine). How are the students doing? Endless hell, again? This is the truth.""You have so many chances to change your destiny, but GaoKao is the only time when your destiny gets decided."" (I played in Chinese so maybe this is not the actual translation) - Ms. MeiI mostly care about the storyline instead of animation or style. GaoKao.Love.100Days is reflecting the truth of a typical Chinese high school senior (with girlfriend). This might be one of the few games that could actually bring myself into deep meditation. Masterpiece.Presentation: 9/10Easy to catch up, easy to play. Although the tutorial was given in-game by his classmate which seems to be a little bit awkward, cookie let the player to speak out his name loud in the beginning of the game is quite interesting actually, especially when you put a funny name in. Graphics: 9/10Great adapting Japanese's drawing style, however in China everyone wear stupid school uniform... Umm I said too much?Music: 10/10The only way to judge is to listen.Gameplay: 10/10Not too complicated, not too easy. But this game offers much more choices than a typical gal-game.Story/Background: 10/10The school, parents, the ambition, so much reality. Can I give more than 10 points?Overall: 48/50 "

Posted: June 6, 2015
												I've recently finished my first playthrough of this game, and was compelled to write a review. I've played several Dating sims/Galgames, but it's never been my cup of tea, so to speak. The whole idea felt interesting yet impractical, I didn't expect much from this game when my friend recommended it me. This game however, is a whole another deal.Currently a college student, the feelings of being a high schooler still lingers inside, and this game has brought it all back. Once again it hit me: the insecurities, the increasing pressure of schoolwork, the overwhelming want for some love, the struggles, and the urge to be live up to your parents' expectations, your peers' expectations, and perhaps most importantly, your own expectations. Throughout the game there come times where it was too emotionally difficult for me to continue playing and I had to pull myself away for a minute or two. You might be skeptical about how I can be so immersed into a seemingly simple game, and yes, I was skeptical about it afterwards. But if there are teenage memories that you still held dear, play this game and all those will come alive again. I’ve played countless Galgames that are simply made to give the player pleasure out of playing them. You start the game for 30 minutes and suddenly all 25 girls in the game are devoted to you. Of course, that is an exaggeration, but you get my point. This game is an entirely different ballpark: it’s realistic. Consequences come when you least expect them, and you have to work hard to pull off anything. Sometimes there can, and will be times where you just can’t do anything about the horrible situation no matter how hard you work, and that’s just the way it is. Yes, it is extremely frustrating and stressful, but isn’t that just like real life?Never have I in the course of only a few hours, experienced so many emotions. I was so ecstatic and overjoyed during the good times that I caught myself smiling at the screen like an idiot several times. But multiple times my head ached and stomach churned from stress that applied onto me through the main character’s words. When Muxin broke up with me (Sorry, spoiler alert, but this is only one out of 50 ways that the story could go), even though it’s temporary, I couldn’t stop tears from trickling down my cheeks when all these pressure from teachers/parents/myself that I’ve been enduring was for her. Heck, there are so many times when I said something in response to the situation, and the “me” I’m playing as in the game says the exact same thing right as I clicked through the text. This game really digs deep inside, and I can testify to that.Of course, there are still flaws to this game. In my opinion, I was able to be so immersed in the game because I understood Chinese. The voice acting was spectacular (even though could be cringeworthy at times, yes I’m talking about Stom), but if you couldn’t understand what people are talking about, it really takes you away from the experience. Also, multiple translation problems are still present in game. From what I remember (which is not much, since I was so absorbed), the use of auxiliary verbs felt funny, even awkward to me. For example:“Why she do that?” or “Why I need to go to school today?”Should be something like “Why would she do that?” or “Why do I need to go to school today?”.Notice without those auxiliary verbs, the meaning can change drastically. “Why would she do that?” does not equal “Why did she do that?”. I don’t have the Chinese manuscript so I wouldn’t know the real intention, but this is something I would like to see fixed, because without these little details, we aren’t getting the complete meaning behind each line here.In the end, this game blew me away. I’d dare say this game made me actually fell in love with Muxin for the duration of the game, and several days after that, even right now as I type up this review. This game definitely separates itself from the genre and stands as one of the best, if not the best. I can’t wait to play more and see what’s to come, since I’ve heard there’s a total of 50 ways that the story could go, but I’m not sure if I want to experience the emotional trauma of preparing for Gaokao again. Plus, I love Muxin and Muxin only, so the storylines that doesn’t involve her…yeah. Now, because this game is so well made, I guess I’d like to recommend the game for you, whoever’s reading this.  The thing is, Muxin is mine and mine only, so don’t do it. Please.			"

												""if brought back to the past,which way would you choose?""I was ever a senior high school student in China ,same as the characters in this game, 1 year ago.i cried when i finished the game and got the end 10,the warmth of Xiaohan.Do you know?There was ever a girl in my life,a little similar to Xiaohan. Oh,but she was not my neighbor.She appeared in front of me,like a godness,She made me know, what is the feeling when you fall in love with a girl.She made me know, if you love a girl,how happy will you feel when you see her smile.But,she also made me know, what is ""pain""and what is ""regret"".I lost her .Both of us were under the control of our parents,teachers and the Chinese education systerm.And i feared being refused by her,even i knew,she wouldn't.I am a coward.I hate myself forever.Xiaohan is her,it is my first idea when i saw the Xiaohan in screen,then I made the decisions opposed to the reality.But Xiaohan isn't her.I have lost forever.Every day without she is like a book without pages.I don't know how she is now.I lost in touch with her.But I always recall her at night. I always worry if there is a boy who will dash away her tears when she cry. I always worry if there is a boy who wil  make her laugh when she is bored. I always worry if there is a boy who will remind her of  dressing more when the winter comes.I really hope there is a boy besides her,who can look after her and give her happiness instead of me,though he is not me.To be honest,my English is not good.But I insist on setting down it by English,because I want you to know something.I don't know where you come from.Maybe US,UK or Australia.Millions of Chinese boys envy the freedom you have.So ,don't waste the freedom.When you see the girl sent to you by god.Put her hand in your hand,and say""I love you"".Don't be a coward like me.

												This game is exceptionally entertaining and engaging for Asians that had stressful public exams.People studying in the West may not feel that stress during the exam preparation period due to different education system , family and society conditions.The game well protrayed the what if you have a girl friend before public exam situation and the tricky thing is how do you spend your time. All in for studying ? All for dating? Just like those harsh choices in real life.The game content is quite rich and consists of many endings. It worths a lot more than 9 USD!!!The soundtrack ,artwork and character design is quite good. The only thing i hate about this game is the poor CV for certain supporting characters and not all the characters got their voice.Sometimes the game crashes and i have to play all over again.... So, save the game constantly.It is a good try from Chinese developer. Good Job! You have set a new standard for the industry!			"

												First, I'd just like to say that this game makes me really thankful that I didn't grow up in China. Gaokao seems like the SATs put on steroids. Anyway, I have so far completed 12 endings out of the 57 (!!!) in the game, in 40 hours of gameplay. As a result, I definitely recommend this game to people who are looking for a game that will take a long time to complete, and will provide many hours of entertainment. The storyline in the game is absolutely amazing, and so is the character developments of Muxin and Xiaohan. There are quite a few translation errors in this game, so I wouldn't recommend it for those who care so much about grammar. Completing all the routes in this game will take a lot of help from game guides, and the only really good one is pretty vague in its descriptions. If you're looking for a story-rich game that will give many hours of entertainment, or even if you just want to complete only a few routes, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

This game is great, this was the best 10$ I spent on steam so far. This game has so many endings and routes to take that it never gets old... If you're looking for a game to keep you hooked this game is for you, just do me a favor..... Don't cry waterfalls like I did. *Sigh*			"

												I was so hyped to play this VN. I've never played a Chinese VN before, so that alone was a new experience for me. But I think, like most other people who bought this game, I was most attracted to the idea of the game's sixty-one endings (that's including the ones the free DLC adds). After a couple of lucky coincidences, fate brought this game to my Steam library, and I am happy to be reviewing it today.So what do I think about this game? Well, let's start at the beginning. I'm very much used to the typical style of visual novel where all you do is pick choices and watch the story unfold. But this is a game about passing a test! Of course you'll have to study for the stupid thing! So the developers added a Tokimeki Memorial-esque system where you can choose your activities for the day in-between other scripted events. These include studying, exercising, talking to friends, equipping items, and sleeping. I don't mind this system all that much, but the randomness adds a level of challenge that I feel at the time of this review may make certain endings almost unattainable without a great deal of luck. (For the record, I did not use the official guide during my first playthrough, although I think it may be necessary to reach some of the endings.) But what's a dating sim without a story? Turns out the very first thing that happens is that you're tied to a girl named Muxin after 'accidentally' confessing to her. She happily accepts, but both her and the main character (whom I affectionately named Eisen) know that it will be difficult to maintain the relationship when GaoKao is closing in. Eisen unfortunately scored relatively low on the first mock test, and both Eisen and Muxin grew depressed. After breaking up, Eisen became a gaming addict, cutting himself off from the rest of humanity to find acceptance in another world. His friends and family desperately look for him, eventually finding him at a net cafe. Eisen receives the grave news that his mother is in the hospital, and he quickly breaks away from games to finish GaoKao. However, the damage has been done. Eisen not only lost his touch with the ladies, but he scored low on the GaoKao, just barely making it to a low-ranking university. Three months pass, and he finds out Muxin has scored love with someone else. There seems to be no happy ending for poor Eisen... ;_;And you know what makes that worse? I would have done almost the exact same thing in his shoes. Out of all the variety of canned situations presented in most visual novels, this one has the nerve to read out my future in Chinese academia as Episode 7 of Charlotte. (Obligatory Key reference, check. ;) ) And that's not a bad thing. :PWhile the ending I got at the time of this review hit me in the heartstrings, I think the journey there was just as enjoyable, especially concerning Muxin. She's an incredibly sweet character to be around, and seems tailor-made to be the ideal girlfriend. Most people come into this VN after already being dumped IRL at least once; I don't have such a medal of honor. What I can say is that it comes as crushing to see her move further and further apart from me, even after  all I did. It's a learning experience, in more ways than one. Whenever I do find myself dating in real life, hopefully I can take something away from this game.Anyway, on to the technical stuff. For a company that's only put out one VN so far, the art style looks very pretty. Every single character is well-drawn, the backgrounds are good, and the CGs are crisp and clear. The game utilizes the KiriKiri engine, a popular commercial engine used for such notable titles as Fate/Stay Night. Perhaps that has something to do with how professional-looking the game is. The UI is clean and user-friendly, the transitions between days and scenes are smooth, and it's capable of many different banner effects. After reading this and F/SN, I can see why people love using the engine so much. In terms of sound quality, this is where the game starts to falter a bit. The music feels like the kind of music you would listen to while studying: slow, calm and inoffensive to the ears, but not catchy enough to be memorable. The music is by no means bad, but compared to higher-profile VNs (again, citing F/SN and its awesome soundtrack) it can't really work outside the context of the game. The voice acting isn't necessarily bad either; in fact, it fits the characters exceptionally well. I'm no expert on Chinese dialects or social etiquette, but the tone of delivery seems a little off in some situations. The characters seem like they're speaking in indoor voices throughout the entire game. This doesn't hurt the quality of the voice acting since there is a volume slider, but perhaps I'm a bit desensitized by the outlandish, hammy screaming Japanese VAs like to do. :PThen there's the script... *takes a deep breath to calm nerves*Although it's still readable, the translation is less than stellar. No offense to the translators, but the usage of English grammar or sentence structure comes off as a little awkward and imprecise. Granted, Chinese is a very difficult language to translate to English, because there are words and phrases that just don't translate well. But quite a few sentences in this game look like they were put into Google Translate and pasted on to the script to save time. I hate being critical, but the script is the most important part of a VN!  When a native English reader has to stop reading to think about what the people are actually saying, something's wrong. I'm sure it's something that could be patched, but as it is, the awkwardly-translated dialogue bothers me the most out of anything in this VN.Something else I noticed about the script...a few terms exclusive to the Japanese language are used in the English script, when the characters say nothing of the sort. It's not exactly a problem I have with the script, but it speaks something to me about how much passion and respect for Japanese culture (even though it's a VN about Chinese culture) went into this VN...Beyond the smaller details, such as a clean, responsive backlog and autosave saving my life on a couple occasions, I don't have much else to say about this game. So, do I recommend this game? Yeah. Although the script is a somewhat garbled mess, it is still readable, and it offers a lot of insight into the social consequences surrounding the GaoKao exam, as well as an interesting, heartwarming subversion of the dating sim formula. It's worth checking out to see if your own future in Chinese academia will look bright without a walkthrough. :D			"

												Overall it’s a great VN game! Definitely in my Top 3 of all time.Thanks Devs for such a great game.- Setting-wise: 2 main females for you to chase after. One is big boobs and kinda cute, while the other is a standard sister type. Two common tastes for players. Sure you have other choices as well.- Graphically,  it’s not too splendid but very cozy and suits for the scenes.- Voice-wise, the female voices are very rich. I can’t imagine how much efforts the devs put into. So huge dialogs!!!- Music-wise, it’s decent (not that rich) and very cut into the scenes. Some orchestra among them. I like it.- Gameplay-wise, the main task is to prepare for the big exam. I think the setup is real and reasonable.- Ending-wise, there are more than 100 endings. So the replayability is very high. - Conclusion, just buy it. You won’t regret it. "

												The vocals are in Chinese, the animation style is 100% Japanese...  the vocalization *seemed* to me to be of decent quality, but I don't have much to compare it to, so I could be wrong on that.  Is a bit of an odd experience to hear the vocals w/ the Japan anime style.English translation is somewhat poor quality... that being said, I've only come across only a couple of situations where I had trouble understanding the *meaning* of what was being said.  Most of the errors are grammatical in nature -- improper sentence structure, tenses, etc.I'm not a fan of how the VN begins with the protagonist abrutly ""finding a girlfriend"".  Just didn't jive with me.  After a while, you start to forget about that, though.... likely due to the EXTREME amount of dialogue in this VN.********** this was a friends only review, but I'll make it public for now, since there aren't many other reviews (even though it's only half finished)Also altering my recommendation from negative to a weak positive for now.  Need to put in some more playing time to see if the choices I make actually matter or not (and find out how much of this dialogue is actually of significance).  I posted a Youtube video at

			First off, the game was developed in China & the vocals are in Chinese... but the animation style is 100% Japanese. Artist is probably either located there or that's just what they learned and/or...		

 that should be available in 30 minutes or so.^^ audio was out of sync.  so removing it and reuploading it sometime later.... err, actually, i'll just make it unlisted (til I replace it).   yeah, it's several hundred ms out of sync.			"

												I don't usual write reviews, but I feel like I need to.I bought this game thinking that it'd be nice and different you know, a chinese visual novel, the reviews seem pretty great, no, just no.I really wanted to love this, but everything felt weird.Muxin is your girlfriend so of course she'd be the prime girl, but then you have another girl you can date. Why when I try and date that other girl, it doesn't feel like I'm actually trying to date her because every other word out my mouth is Muxin? And why the hell does the MC just randomly start cussing out his parents? The dialog every other time the parents come on is so freaking weird! It just seems like the MC's yelling at them for no reason or the parents are saying needless things to him for no reason.And that I feel like is just a stupid nitpick, but why I can't recommend this game unless you get it on sale, is because of the translation. My God, this game probably is great in Chinese or another language but it is horrid in English! I have played A LOT of dating sims and visual novels and I forgive a lot of the grammar or spelling issues, but I couldn't even comprehend anything that was going on. And the choices I was making felt like they weren't leading to the end I wanted, until the actual end showed up, and by that point I was going to shoot myself in the head if the main character said Alas again!I feel like this was SUCH a good concept for a dating sim, I feel like it had potential, but it was not executed well enough at all. The skip everything function became my friend.I only recommend this game if you get it on sale or speak a different language because maybe it's better then.			"

												The patchy english translation aside*, this game is has a lot of positives. The storytelling and the sheer amount of content is stellar. Little choices have such a big impact, and there are so many different ways to go. The characters feel complex and interactions with them feel natural (despite the cultural differences and the more ambiguous aspects of translation). It's one of the few visual novels I've played which seems to capture the difficulty of interpersonal relationships. The tone and how it shifts, from comedic, tense, sad and bittersweet, is really well done. One of the few visual novels I've played that seems worth calling a 'novel' at all.That said, this game is difficult. I feel like I have an appreciation of how tough the Chinese education system is, because the game conveys that very well indeed. I threw Muxin under the bus and studied my♥♥♥♥♥♥off, but I still only got into a crappy local college. This game made me stress. I had to leave it alone for a week after my first playthrough because it just made me angry. Balancing friends, girlfriend, schoolwork and the protagonist's parents (seriously...they are easily the most rage-inducing aspect of the game. I wish I had played this game as a teenager, it would have made me appreciate my parents so much more) is like purgatory. Despite this all, I still want to play more. *Most of the game is understandable, if not completely grammatically correct. There are some sentences though where the meaning is lost completely. I realise that chinese to english is a pretty tough translation to make, and the sheer amount of text in this game makes it a hard task, it would be nice to see a professional translation though at some point. I really enjoy the story of this game, so being able to understand all of it would be great.			"

												Overall, it’s one of the best visual novels you can find on Steam, and for $10 full price. The large amount of endings you can get add to the replayability, and the story is realistic enough to be powerful and engaging. My first playthrough lasted me about 15-20 hours, and my attempts to get all other endings will take even more. There’s also achievements to unlock and cards to collect, if you’re into that kind of thing. I am, and the card art is really pretty. I recommend this to anyone who likes the Visual Novel genre or is interested in playing some VN’s for the first time. It’s a lot of casual stressful fun, and for $10, you cannot go wrong with that.

												excellent!!that's the first AVG game i brought in steam, and i love it!the game is pretty fit chinese teens' real lives, each characters has distinct personality,i really enjoy the story.for me, the 10th ending(i have to say this game have 50ends which is impressive) is my favourite, Xiaohan is my style and i think  our protagonist is more importent for herthe director of this game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! it's hard to choose between Muxin & Xiaohan, Muxin was under huge pressure and she didn't have much friends except the main character because of the strict family eduacation; Xiaohan's parents left her alone for ten years, she has been in love with our main character since childhood.  So at last i played this game X times and completed all good ends.......this is a game which worth to try			"

												The game is not as interesting as what I thought. I bought this one due to the recommendation from my friends and the overwhelmingly positive reviews. However, it turned out to be not quite fascinating to me.To be honest, I never experience the Gaokao and I'm not quite familiar to the last year of high school life in China. So the plot pretty much can't catch my eyes and the study function in the game makes me bored as well. To some how, it makes no sense.Music is pretty good but kind of typical galgame level.For characters, either the ""girlfriend"" Muxin at the beginning or the monitor is not my type. So negative on this.			"

												A lot of good reviews and stuff but it didn't manage to get my interest. I bought it because of the very positive reviews and because it was on sale but... god, it bored me a lot...The main girlfriend, the one with who you start, is so dumb.I'd rather to be alone than to be with someone like her.I asked for a refund because I was expecting something better from this game.

												I cannot recommend this game.I came into playing Visual Novels/Dating Sims fresh out of Katawa Shoujo (Which recieves my whole-hearted recommendation) and had high expectations for Gaokao Love based off it. These expectations were not met for me.While I like the concept of balancing a relationship and test grades/scores in a simulator type way, but the execution of this was not fun, especially when the game seemingly worked against me by auto lowing my stats every other in-game evening through random events that had nothing to do with the decisions I had made up to that point, or to things that made no sense. (Previous Year's Champion's Motivational Speech tripled my stress huh?)I understand that Visual Novels are pretty much entirely ""on-rails"" in terms of story, you can at least nudge them in different directions to change the plot. This holds true with Gaokao Love as well, but I felt extremely restricted here, even for the ten different routes the game promises. While the story's direction did indeed change, it all felt hollow as our character (and with him the story) constantly focuses on the same person (Muxin) regardless of character route chosen, each ending I have experienced made mention of her when she did not matter at that point.Because of the story's focus not shifting to prioritize other characters, they felt wasted as they were never the focus for long. While each personality is well established off the bat, I never felt like they were properly fleshed-out. If you (like me) are looking for a feels-heavy Visual Novel, this isn't the place.I got bored close to the end of each run, as each day's conversations held the same topics but with different wording...I'll be honest I have not gone though each route, but the four I have gone through has not left me with any desire to try the others...

												This game has a lot of negative points, but despite that I do recommend it.Positive: The sheer amount of routes and endings. Most routes seem to have three endings, depending on the final score of the GaoKao exam. Due to this, the amount of endings (over 50) can be a bit misleading as each set of three endings of the same route will have almost exactly the same content leading up to it, but there is still a very high amount of content to see. The price point is quite low for a visual novel of this quality and length. I expected something fairly short and mediocre such as the Sakura series which costs around the same. The story and characters. It keeps you interested the whole way through and you learn more about the various characters by going through different routes and trying different things.Unlockables are fun. You can keep items which can give you different effects between playthroughs. This can make it easier to follow certain routes.'Secret' characters. Most would expect that the only 'heroines' in the game are Muxin and Xiaohan and the majority of the routes do lead that way, but there are endings with other characters too.Negative:The translation. Some parts are completely fine, but some parts are very awkward and make it obvious that English is the second language of whoever wrote it. It's all fine to understand, but incorrect gender pronouns, missing articles (the, a) and some awkward phrasing can break immersion at times.Crashing happens. Mostly when I use the Steam overlay I've found. I've rarely had it happen outside of those times. It does autosave often but it's a pain.The lack of information. It doesn't explain what all stats do and the item descriptions are often not particularly helpful. The guides and discussion topics in the forum can be helpful, but it's not great. There are also a few minor parts where it seems like it's just wrong. Saying I did badly on an exam when I got one of the highest possible scores and things like that. It doesn't affect gameplay, but breaks immersion again.			"

												I have never written a game review on steam before.I just felt I had to share this somewhere, sorry in advance if its too personal. I bought this game a while back on sale I think, and didn't pay much attention to it. One evening I decided to have a go at it, and man the feels kicked like a ♥♥♥♥ing train.Two years back right after the end of my military service, my ex-girlfriend who had just finished her Gaokao broke up with me all of a sudden. It was long distance and I felt the cracks in the relationship, but I never expected, nor understood how the pressure from her school, parents and gaokao got to her. She helped me get through a really tough time in the army and having been educated in a stressful-but-not-gaokao level education system, I don't think I fully understood what she was going through. Coming back to the game, I could not stop once I had begun, and it was an emotional ride filled with smiles, laughter and tears. It brought back so many memories and deep feelings I had hidden within myself. It prompted me to find out more about gaokao, and after reading more literature surrounding the topic I felt I could at least empathise with the students who have to go through such an ordeal a little more. I was also able to muster enough courage to talk to my ex-girlfriend after this. We talked for a long time, apologised to each other and went through a lot of our memories and thoughts together. To me, and to the creators of this game, I believe Gaokao.Love.100Days is not just a game, but a collection of a group of people's memories. It is beautiful because many of us can relate to the situations in one way or another. It may be bittersweet and still painful to explore at times, but somehow, this game has become a way for me to explore old wounds and look for healing and closure in the future.Sorry if the review isn't focused solely on the game story or mechanics, but the theme and the setting of the game was what really struck me on a personal level, and I am sure it would do so to many others as well.

												Totally speaking it is  a nice game. Considering GaoKao in game gives me a special impression, which reminds me to that unique period. Though in my opinion it has many advantages, the disadvantages cannot be ignored.1. there are so many ends  and  choices in this game, some of them are similar during the 100 days. I will feel boring if I complete the game with the similarily ends.2. some small actions can decrease the ablilities of study, the physical strength or the pressure , for example, just falling at home can reduce so many physical stregth.However there are still some parts that I adore. I think the CV of WeiTong which is really great, just like an idiot, can easily understand his nature from the voice. And the CGs are good. The figures that this game bulid are good, everyone has its own special characterisation. The music I think is the best part of this game. The story just like the thing I write perviously is normal considering so many similar choices, which makes me feel a little boring.In summary, this game is worth to play. Hope you enjoy it.			"

												It is a game to show you that having and keeping a girlfriend is harder than simply getting the girl. Some things to note:- Dialogue is in Chinese (mandarin).- Translations are okay (I can understand the vocals and some of it doesn't match the on-screen English dialogue, but this is common for a lot of translated games.)- It mimics the Japanese VN formula, except for the part where you start with the girl.- Halfway through the game I forgot my ""girlfriend"" even existed. There's just so much useless dialogue that doesn't really progress story... - Accurate simulation game. I completely failed at keeping the girl because I chose to study instead. Game successfully proves that Chinese brainwashing runs deep - even in a video game I chose education over love. It's happening all over again!!! ARGH!!!! This is not my favourite VN, but it's not the worst either. The other big titles are all upwards of $20 so at the $10 price range, it's not half bad. It gets a passing ""yes"" simply because for its price, game length and content, it's decent/不错. 做得好, 高考恋爱委员会.			"

												So here all my idea:Firstly, the story line is interesting. For Chinese students they know how Gaokao would be like, This is a good chance for people who have no experience with it to try. There are 50 endings in the game so it worth the players to try again. Although the main story line is about 3-4 hours for first time, the whole story will take more than 10 hours to complete. Many endings and story require players try different story line to find, especially for the ""Play boy"" and ""Nice Boat"" Ending. For Otakus really should try these endings :)Secondly, graphic is amazing. The pictures make people feel comfortable. They are good work and nice art style. I cannot find any problem with the graphic. Maybe the only problem is get MORE events and MORE pictures (Greedy is good)Thirdly, game experience is excellent. Each time players try different choices the story will go to different endings, and more story content can be found. When players finish the ending all the items can be kept to next round. There are some issues in game. But it is easy can see the hard work behind the game. The designers have tried their best to make it good within the resource limitation. They are a group of people who know how to make a good game. They should be encouraged.哪怕是作为国产游戏也是应该支持的，加油！			"

Product received for free
Gaokao.Love 100Days ""Review""First and foremost, I have no experience with visual novels whatsoever, nor do I have a general idea of how to properly review such a product, but I'll try my best.  I've received this product for free, but this will not sway my opinion on this product, so this review will remain unbiased.If you're used to my usual reviewing format with a scoring system, this will have an entire gameplay section missing from it, so be prepared.Gameplay (?)It's a visual novel, don't expect much gameplay.  The point of the game is to give the player choices, forks in the road so the players can create their own story as the game progresses.  Gaokao.Love.100Days provides players with admittedly scarce dialogue options, but instead allows more freedom at the end of each day.  The player must decide how to balance studying, stress and hitpoints.  Yes, you can study until you die in this game, apparently.  The player can also do things to increase max HP.  Aside from academics, the player is assigned a ""girlfriend"", who the player must keep in touch with.  The player has 100Days to keep relationships positive, while maintaining good mental and physical health, and good academics.According to the developers, the game offers 50 different endings, but I only went with 1.Story/Lore 5/10, repetitive, strange and mundane.This story gets a 5/10 thanks to some comedic elements brought about by a single character in the game.  To be honest, the girlfriend who the player is forced to have a relationship with isn't all that attractive in my opinion and there are quite the number of filler characters in the game.  The game has its moments and can be slightly amusing at times, but for the most part, I found myself being surrounded in cringe-worthy dialogue and overall uninteresting events.  I spent the bulk of my time studying so that I would get a better score in the final test, so I didn't have much time to socialise.  That's pretty much it.  There isn't anything particularly special in the story, it's awfully realistic.  I'd be surprised if anyone expected dramatic changes in patterns in a school setting, since the school has a timetable.  The repetitive nature of the game derives from the setting itself, as the player and the rest of the characters are all students going through preparations for the finals.  To me, it's not anything extraordinary.  I live a relatively similar life so it might seem very normal to me, but to someone who's unfamiliar with the education system here and wants a dramatised and exaggerated version of it, go ahead. Visuals/Style 7/10The game has some really well drawn characters, it's all very straightforward.  I feel as if in my playthrough, some characters such as the barista at the cafe and the English teacher did not see the light of day and never really held a position in the game.  I was expecting more character appearances regardless of my choices.Regardless, this game has some really nicely drawn characters, each displaying their personality and traits, so it's definitely worth something, especially since the game is a visual novel.ConclusionI'm not quite sure what to say about this.  As a person who has had this game as his first visual novel, I can say it's been a decent experience.  The dialogue isn't all that great but it holds its own and the setting itself just seems awfully mundane, to me at least. To keep things fair, I'll abstain from a verdict this time, nor will I have a pros/cons list.  Gaokao.Love.100Days doesn't seem to be my cup of tea.  I'll probably pick up another visual novel some time in the future to improve my understanding of games like these, but overall my experience with this game can only be described as average.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I didn't find this game necessarily enjoyable. I suppose it could be fun if you like a challenge, as of course, you'd have to remain consistent on balancing out all elements of the game (your relationship with Muxin, stress, ideal, studying, health, and more) for 100 days. It's worse if you intend on getting all the achievements. One small mistake can set you back by a lot. However, I loved the graphics and characters in the game.			"

												I now have a new newfound empathy for all Chinese students.This is an incredible VN that will take you through a rollercoaster of emotions. There were cute, happy, sad, and stressful (mostly stressful) moments at every turn, while also giving some insight into the culture and eductaion system of China. It's an experience that will stick with you long after playing the game.If you enjoy VN's and can overlook the iffy translation (it can get pretty rough at points), definitely don't let this gem pass you up.

												I bought this game because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews. I feel like I would be doing an injustice, just as others have, by letting people buy this game without realizing how horribly it is translated. A lot of the sentences do not make sense, it comes out as ""Engrish"". I guess if I had looked more closely at the preview pictures I would have had more of an idea. I regret wasting money on this. It doesn't seem like the developer will ever overhaul this and fix the very bad sentence structure. I recommend looking elsewhere.			"

												Honestly going into the game at first i didnt know what to truely expect. Then i found out how deep, meaningful, and emotional this game is. It most certainly became one of my favorite games of all time through everything it offers. What does it offer you ask? Well i'll tell you.Pros:    - Tons of replayability. Im pretty sure with the new dlc there is more than 60 endings now.   - Stat managing. Adds a lot more interactivity than your average visual novel.   - Meaningful and impactful story.  Even though i myself am not Chinese and haven't gone through    Gaokao, seeing how this single test affects the characters through the game made me understand    just how heavy a subject it is and should not be taken lightly. The game portrays this perfectly in my    opinion.   - Art style. The art style is a great fit and appealing to the eyes.   - The Feels - You will feel many emotions playing this. One moment you will feel happy, the next depressed, the next anger. If you are like me you may even shed some tears based on what happens through your playthrough.Cons:   - Translation issues at times. Believe me, the story is easy to read and you can understand most of it. There are just some points where the translation is a bit wonky. Though with the latest dlc patch the developers put in, it has helped this issue a lot.(That was my only con really)I dont like giving anything a number rating, so i will just say that this game is a MUST OWN for anyone who is a fan of visual novels and wants something unique. You will not regret it, especially at the low price of 9.99 usd when you may just spend more than 50 hours on the game getting all the endings. Highly Recommended!			"

												What an absolute waste of what could have been a good game. It started good but it went horrible so fast and it just made me so mad.In the beginning I had lots of choice constantly as I could increase my skills, talk to the girl I liked and do whatever. But all the sudden I could do nothing, my skills deterioated agianst my will, the girl was gone everything and anything went down the drain. It wasn't till the last 25 days I had any choice back and by then any attempt to do anything was undone the next frickin day!This had so much potential and it felt like it was new and fresh for me in dating sim genre with options other than the girls. But no.To make matters worse I was extremely uncomfortable after the first fourth of the game as the parents became physically as well as emotionally abusive and manipulative. The chratcer that I thought I was doing a good job by keeping the stress low and doing my best in my studies became an absolute scumbag in the way he talked.			"

												Before playing this game I had no idea about how the Chinese educational system works. Now I know a little about it. So this game was not only fun but it was educational as well. However, the game is pretty grindy and not easy. And there are so many endings that I'm never going to get all of them. But I don't have any other negative things to say about this game. It's easily worth the price.			"

												THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION IS REALLY, REALLY BADI've never played a proper dating sim before, figured this would be a good place to start seeing as the reviews were so positive.The translation is laughable. Seriously, it's very, very bad. Half the sentences just don't make sense. If you're playing this game for comical reasons then maybe you'll get a kick out of it but I can't imagine anyone enjoying this seriously. I'm pretty disappointed, I was ready to go waifu fishing.Get a different game if you're looking for a dating sim because, again;THE TRANSLATION IS TERRIBLE			"

												Man...I have not completed this game yet (currently at 5.5 hours) but I needed to pull myself away from it just now. It is definitely not something i would recommend for relaxing. I feel stress playing this for too long and I'm not studying!  I cannot imagine doing this in real life. I give Chinese students a lot of credit. As for story, I kind of wish the character was single to begin with as I am not a huge fan of Muxin (in terms of dating? lol). I don't speak Chinese, but I really like the voice actors. Muxin's voice is very cute, especially her nervous laugh. Though, I would prefer being with the neighbor! (Still trying to figure that out...) The music is very nice...to be honest, one of the hours of gameplay is probably me snoozing. I played at 2AM one night and the music lulled me to sleep lol The animation is very pretty, I really like their facial expressions, Muxin's in particular. Edit:And my file was corrupted. Not sure what happened there....now taking a much needed break from it. I'll pick it up again in the future.Edit again:Its been a while since I initially wrote this review, but I figure its worth saying I immediatly picked the game back up again despite the mishap. It was easy by fast forwarding, I do admit I made some changed in my decisons :B This game was still very stressful for the reasons I said before. I chose my studies over everything unless Xiaohan was available. So because of this route, I do miss a lot of stories..I did however, get the ending I desired! In the future I will probably play again, not necessarily to date the other girls, but to see all the events I missed from studying my butt off. I still highly recommend this game!			"

												  A culture about GaoKao. A glimpse of teenagers in modern China. If you have experienced it, you are to be touched. If you have not, this is the time.   So complicated and twisted the feelings after several playthroughs. I don't really care about the endings, but they recall me of the impression of a generation. A game is for some kind of spiritual comfort. And this is it.  Even I'm only a common Chinese student, I reccomend this to all of you(CN or nonCN). You will see, this game just flows, as a breeze, a stream or meerly a whisper, to the deepest depth of your heart.    10/10			"

												When I first viewed this game, it seemed like it would be a good title to play.Upon my first playthrough, I found out how important getting a good score in the tests were and how that changes the story. At the end of my first playthrough, I ended up isolating my friends and becoming so focused on studies that I eventually ended up not liking myself. I still ended up with a positive ending, the journey good have been a lot better.I had to look up a guide in order to get the ending I really wanted.While it's not a bad game, it's not exactly great either. The designs, settings, and music are great. The characters, especially the protagonist's parents, were not as great. Some felt like stereotypes while others could have been done so much better.As for how you handle your day to day life in school and how that impacts your health and overall your studies, the premise is great, but honestly games like Persona 4 have it handled much better. Though I will give credit to the makers for trying to bring a more realistic approach to the visual novel genre with this game.End of the day, I give this game a solid 3 and 1/2 out of 5.			"

												China is harsh.If this game is remotely accurate at all, then it's pretty sad how things work over there. Our protagonist can't date before Gaokao, a national exam, because it's considered shameful, and a distraction. Didn't take long at all for me to get into the story, with this kind of setting going on.And playing through the game for however long Steam says I've played it, it's pretty obvious that the creators of this game knew what they were doing. Game goes through all 100 days with surrounding events, which flow well enough for things not to feel like it was dragging on.Translation was iffy most of the time, but I see it as part of it's charm than anything else. After the first half of the items are collected, it's mainly just studying and trying to obtain what route you want. Unfortunately, I have to say that it's extremely difficult to play the game blind.I've played through it at least 4 times, trying to play without a walkthrough, but was unable to romance whatever number of girls there are on my own. And with 60ish endings available, according to Steam Achievements and the built-in End List, I wasn't willing to.It's a great game, and clearly with a lot of replayability, but having to look up a guide to be able to romance a girl is kind of a bummer. I also found the Monitress dlc to be disappointing. Thought she was cute since she was introduced, and thought she would be a girl you could romance.The base game made it seem like you could, during that cookie scene, but nope. It was disappointing, though I guess it doesn't stop it from being a good game.			"

												First Playthrough:-Get girlfriend-Focus on schoolwork-Girlfriend ignores > dump after first mock test-Make up in cafe, only to have childhood friend trample all over girlfriend-I have to shut up through the entire ordeal-Get top-tier college on both second mock test and on Gaokao-Go to same university as childhood friend, who teases me to date her.Makes sense. I never was a person who took initative... I would feel sorry for the one who dates me #foreveraloneThe game is actually quite accurate in portraying what you choose, because I certainly didn't expect Xiaohan (childhood friend) to cockblock on me and Muxin in the cafe. The game is cleverly written, since I've seen most peoples' playthroughs are their blind-runs (not going for achievements), and relate to their lives in a sense.There are a few grammar errors here and there, but you will understand what they mean. Just as long as bad translation doesn't bother you, you'll be fine.It's Chinese voices, and I (for one) don't really like Chinese speakers... but this game makes me not feel negative toward hearing Mandarin anymore. Rather, more indifferent; the voice actors did a good job.If you enjoy the music as much as I do, go get their $3.00 OST. Support them. Now that I actually have money, support the works you like. To access the .mp3 and .wav files, go to ""Library"" at the top of the Steam Client, and click ""Music"". Took me a while to find it; you won't find it in the Gaokao game.TL;DR: Good storywriting, good voice-acting (first Chinese-dubbed VN for me, and I hated hearing Mandarin), good OST. Just bad CHN to ENG translations. And no, this is not a Japanese work.			"

												Honestly, wasn't sure what to expect playing this.After being obsessed with If My Heart Had Wings for a very long time, I've been playing a load of visual novels recently and thought this one was worth a try, and the idea of having so many choices gives it a lot of replayability.It's a game about student life that I promise was vastly more difficult than your own and kind of makes you feel bad for slacking off on homework back in high school since the students in this game do kilos upon kilos of papers every day. And at the same time, you're trying to balance a relationship that was probably destined to fail in the first place. You can focus completely on love or completely on work, or try to balance it out whichever way you feel will work best. It's actually quite difficult and reminds me of a relationship I had while in college.It can honestly get quite stressful, and almost every choice you make will have some kind of possitive and negative consiquince.The translations are of acceptable quality, but they could be much better. Sound is honestly perfect and visuals are pretty good. Could use some better writing since the most common lines you'll hear are ""... ... ..."" and ""Alas.""7.5/10. It's worth a play			"

												First visual novel I ever try... on Steam... and maybe like if we consider the type as modern(?) or at least by the fault of my ignorance I may not know when in timeline of gaming history can be approximatively located the nacency of the genre... ?I have as a minset rule to look over anything with manga-ish females plus big eyes graphic style as bottomless plonker trap pits. I've just NEVER been a books and paper mangas person. English is not my first langage and one reason I fell for the purchase of this game was in a review I've read very quickly that mentionned entertaining characters developments and patchwork english which I happened to find not difficult to quite mostly catch thanks to this.Though I once owned a Playstation physical copy of Tokimeki Memorial  that I litteraly understood nothing I was doing in and managed to play and finish its 16bits emulation version the same way, after a very painful and disinterested beginning, for different reasons I may explain later when I'll know more about this game, very surprisingly caught my curiousity and interest. Passed about two weeks slice but have to cut it for I'm absolutly not in best conditions to play and enjoy it properly.I may develop a longer review after I get to finish it once at least. Yet I think I may most probably not become a glutton of this kind of games (who knows after all? But that would be seriously one of the roundest odd changes that would ever pan out of the real life character I usually am and the kind of gaming tastes that resulted to last as my customaries) though but I startle at myself for feeling appealed to complete the game sometime anyhow.Though I imagine one never knows the level of appreciation of visual novel before to having explored a major part of it, my intuition tells me for now it may remain predominately positive.Later Edit to come: completely unknown date...

												I love this game and my rating for it would be 8/10.I gave it that score because there could of been improvements in certain areas such as the points system. You could get 0 HP at your night class after a following day and still be able to study? I'm not sure if that's a glitch. The options for the choices in the game are sometimes weird questions, but that's a good thing though. There are grammar and spelling mistakes still in the game. Moving onto the music, sometimes it gets a bit annoying in some parts. As for a few good things, it has voice acting, cute characters, and a realistic story.  The cat in the game is ugly imo.

												Wow. Where to begin...Gaokao.Love.100Days is a visual novel detailing the experiences of the protagonist in the 100 days before the major college entrace exams in China. As the protagonist, you need to balance two key aspects of these 100 days -- your need to study for the exam, as well as the needs of your new girlfriend. Along the way, you'll dictate what sort of actions the protagonist takes, as well as how he reacts to certain situations.The artwork is solid and professional, and is definitely up to par for a respectable visual novel. The characters are lively and well drawn. The background images are also detailed and rich, and the novel makes good use of transitions between locations and times.The music, likewise, is fitting for a visual novel of professional standards. For approximately 75% of the novel, the same songs are used in most situations. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though, because the songs are well composed and fit the situations they are played in. For important parts of the story, however, unique songs are used, and these musical pieces really add to the significance of these scenes.I can't speak to the voice acting, because I am not fluent, but the characters' voices were unique and non-annoying.The characters themselves are interesting and possess a good amount of depth. There are three main characters in the novel (excluding the protagonist), and each of them has a unique personality and interaction. Stom's character is hilarious, and his exclamations really add a nice comedic effect to parts of the novel. Xiao is composed, intellectual, and contemplative, and her character also adds a measure of stability to the story. Ironically, I thought Muxin, the protagonist's girlfriend, had the weakest character construction of the three, although I think it's because of the choices I made in the game (more on that later).One interesting part of the novel is the gameplay. Unlike other, more viewership-oriented visual novels, Gaokao.Love.100Days requires the player to guide the protagonist on day-to-day activities. You can decide whether to study, excercise, nap, talk to your girlfriend, etc. You are supposed to strive to balance your commitment to study with your need to interact with your girlfriend. In reality, I was confused from the start as to which direction to take. This novel is a classic case of ""♥♥♥♥♥♥on the player"" mentality, in that random events can cause you to lose attributes or waste your time. Certain choices seem like a crap shoot at times; for example, you may choose to study one night, but because you ""become pessimistic"" your studying attempt backfires and your time is wasted. There isn't much predictability in these events, either, but I was never overly frustrated by this; remember, this is a visual novel after all, and I am along for the ride, so I'm not too frustrated when the game seems to make arbitrary decisions against me.There is one part of the game that is seriously lacking -- the translations. To be blunt, the translations are a disaster. There are syntax errors throughout the novel, as well as misused pronouns and deconstructed sentences. There are also examples of poor word choice -- my favorite being one line, which a character says: ""A person is dead if you kill them!"" There are also some typos in the novel; for me, that above all else is inexcusable. Nonetheless, I am not the type of person to be annoyed by translation issues, so it didn't really affect my enjoyment of the game.Finally, the plot is... unique, to say the least. I initially felt as if there was no real choices being made in the game, and that the options the player has are merely there to provide the illusion of choice. Imagine my surprise when it was revealed that I got ending 51 (!!!). I was floored that there could be at least 50+ endings to the game.By the end, I kind of realized that I had royally screwed up in the game, as I did not have a high score and (to put it mildly) I did not do well with my girlfriend. Part of that did frustrate me, because the game is not very specific on how to do well. Nonetheless, I am looking forward to my next playthrough to see what I could do better.Overall, I would recommend this game because I appreciate the effort that went into it. I am surprised that it has such a high rating, considering my poor ending to the game; then again, maybe my failure was worse that I realize. Hopefully my second playthrough brings a more succulent plot than my first.			"

												Stongly recommonded for people who experienced Chinese ""Gaokao"", or attended Chinese schools, or those who are currently learning Chinese. However, if you really don't know what ""Gaokao"" is, you may download a trial version (only 30days available) before you buy it.			"

												After all of the overwhelmingly positive reviews I decided to buy this game. This is not my first visual novel, and in all honesty I am quite dissappointed. In the game, I studied very hard and tried my best to keep my health up, but chance events kept lowering my abilities until all my hard work was ruined. Perhaps I don't understand the game mechanics, but I expected a fun, cute, and positive game and instead got a roulette game with choices.			"

Posted: July 25, 2015
												I love Visual novels, but I do not love Gaokao. I'm barely 30 days into my adventure and I have to stop here. From a developer's standpoint the game's mechanics are interesting and fun, the problem is the creators stretched themselves too far in trying to make it too unique, which leaves both the VN gameplay, and the RPG-esque gameplay very underwhelming. The story thus far. I've known this girl two weeks and she's telling me her tragic backstory. I honestly don't care. I am not attached to her, and do not even care about her past. Nothing has happened to make me feel attachment to this character, and thusly, I don't care for her fear of the dark, her fear of animals, and her fear of failing class. On the other hand, the fact that there are only 3 ""main"" characters (aside from yourself) leaves a whole lot to be desired. Only two main girls and the plucky sidekick that tries too hard to be memorable become very stale and annoying after a week of play-time. I don't care for Stom, I don't care for Muxin, and the only interesting character to me is Xiaohan. She's the only one who doesn't have silly quirks like being a foodie, or being overhyped about EVERYTHING. But then you learn ""oh yeah, i remember, her grandma died and her parents leave her alone to live in her dead grandmother's apartment."" once again, backstory i did not care for. Story writing thus far has been extremely lazy, and disappointing. Granted, i can forgive translation errors, but there is too much conflict being forced, too much backstory being driven down your throat, and too much Stom. Seriously, he's annoying and unfunny at all times.Story and Characters:2/10The RPG side of the game is super cool, and if I didn't have to worry about balancing a failing relationship on top of it, I would have a lot more fun. What strategies can I do to make my studying better? What items can I use to get more points in English? How can I avoid being sick? All of these and more alone make it an interesting game. The only problem is I have to balance a forced storyline, and attempt to console a weeping Muxin instead of study study study like I want to. Sure, I have the option to not do that, but in few instances I was FORCED to be with Muxin, and although it is an option I likely would have taken, railroading should NEVER occur in a Visual Novel. That said, forcing me to get sick because instead of sleeping, I ran around with Muxin is extremely unfun.Mechanics: 4/10Sounds. Now the BGM is fantastic. I'm a sucker for background music. I listen to the OST of Angel Beats, Mushi-shi, and Katawa Shoujo all the time. Gaokao has a very nice soundtrack that fit with the scenery, and the voices not only fit their characters, but also sound really good. My issue with the voices are the fact that only the main characters have voices. You don't hear your own father and mother speak to you.But sound effects... oh boy... I will never get this out of my head. MREOW. Oh hey, a cat. MREOW. they just used the same sound effect twice in a row what the actual hell. *30 seconds later* MREOW okay this is lazy at this point. They can't use google to get more than one meow sound effect? If I were to hand in an assigment that used the same sound effect four times in a single sequence I would fail the project, and the class. This was unbelievably lazy, and the developers should be ashamed that they let this happen. BGM: 9/10SFX: 0/10The art of the game is very pretty, but because of the lack of characters I expected there to be more. There aren't many background images, and transitionary scenes are always so plain and unimpressive. I was also upset to see character sprites outside of school, but still in their school uniforms. OR RUNNING ON A TRACK, AND STILL IN THEIR BUTTON UP SHIRTS. Nobody works out in their school uniforms. Lazy artwork. The lack of a lot of additional sprites got me down about this game, but the backgrounds are still beautiful. Alongside that, the special scenes such as Muxin sitting on a bench petting a cat is also very well done, but there is still so much to be desired.Art: 5/10Overall, I would give this game a 3/10. Not a second passing glance, probably won't play through a second storyline, and considering how open ended the game is (50-something endings) I do not think THAT much replay value is needed or even worth it. I know of all the options, but trying too hard to take them will be too much of a hassle, and I'll end up getting an ending I didn't want. If i want to cheat on Muxin I have to talk to Xiaohan every waking moment, but then I'll lose points in tests and probably get stressed. If I want to dump Muxin and focus on tests, I might be forced to get sick again, and lose 20 points in every single stat. Those risks do not justify what I want to do, and make this game virtually unplayable. In my opinion, the developers should have developed the RPG side better, and playtested it to no end to balance it, but instead we are left with a jumbled mess of 50+ endings, not-very-interesting characters, a broken studying system, and an overall pretty bad game. I am not looking forward to finishing it.			"

I am writing this review entirely from a language learner's perspective.Pros Voices are clear and the pronouncation is standard, if a bit cutesy You can listen  to sentences again in the history menu.  There is a choice of simplified and full-form characters.Everyday languageCons There are no sound recordings for the protagonist and certain teachers.  So the game basically turns into a silent wall of text for their entire conversations.There is no option to have Engilsh and Chinese subs together.Due to the silent protagonist, I do not think this game is worth it as a learning tool, but it should be good for fans of graphic novels.

												Recommended. Voice acting is ok, I cannot understand why people down vote this game because of the voice acting, it is really subjective. Yes, there are games with bad voice acting that sounds like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but not with this game.If you like visual novels, this is a really good game, especially for ten dollars.Replayability is great, over fifty different endings? simply awesome. I would say the replayability of this visual novel is one of the best if not the best.One little problem: The game system can be overwhelming for new players.推荐。配音还不错，我无法理解为什么有人因为配音就不推荐这款游戏，配音是一个很主观的问题。是的，有的游戏配音确实糟糕，客观上的糟糕，但是这个游戏并不是这样。如果你喜欢视觉小说，这是一个很好的游戏，尤其只要10加元。再玩性非常好，超过五十个结局？屌炸了。这是拥有最好再玩性的视觉小说之一，如果不是最好的。一个小问题：游戏系统在刚开始可能较复杂，对新手不是很友好（逼我查攻略。。。）。			"

												It's a lovely game. I got a sad ending at the first time. However, I could get what the story tells. I've earned more 20 enddings now. The endings are a lot. Some are really interesting. I'm also playing this game and hope my Chinese will be improved. I'm glad to hear that the Eng Ver. will be improved, but I'm afraid that the points of some Chinese jokes will not be got easily. I cannot wait to play the new version.Though I don't think it is that much difficult to find a girlfriend in China, I've heard some Chinese friends discussing about the difficulties to get a boyfriend/girlfriend. I think, the girls or boys who set high standards for boyfriend/girlfriend are seeking for a potential better half before starting a relationship rather than trying to find a boyfriend/girlfriend to build a relationship with. Their ways are nothing wrong, but they cannot represent all Chinese, right?Anyway, in this game, I've learned ""love"" is love in Chinese culture. Of course, love has various shapes in different culture backgrounds and love is also shown in a specific way by every individual. Like Muxin and Xiaohan, or other characters in the story, they own their vision of love and life, which makes the diversity of endings. : )Those are my points. Chinese gamers who want to share your opinions with me are welcome. Sorry, my Chinese is not good enough to write understandable comments. English will be fine.			"

Posted: July 17, 2015
												It's hard writing this review. Really, not going to lie. This visual novel is bad and good at the same time, but let me explain myself. (kind of TL; DR tho, so just skip to the last paragraph for conclusion, if you don't want to waste too much of your time) (please, do note, that this is the first experience and is written after only one hour of playing the game).So, Gaokao.Love.100Days is a story of... you, being a senior student, preparing for the graduation test and getting a girlfriend at the same time.Sounds pretty basic, eh? Well, not really. Thing that got me saying ""oh, come on!"" was the fact that you are tied to the story too much. By that I mean that you can't really influence it in the beggining (even from the start you are told that you already have a girlfriend and you can't change). Maybe that's a personal thing, but in my humble opinion. it's needless and forcing a story to be told in a very narrow way, which is great for books and films, but not for video games (epecially for a vn). The choice (note: NOT including choice of ""what to do"" during weekends and night classes) is also quite rare in the first hour, and even when you get to it, it doesn't really change anything. It's just there to end the scene and that's it. Point here is, the story is narrow.Moving on it's fair to admit that characters are descent, but dialogues (at lest most of them) are silly and pointless (e.g., first 30 minutes of the game, characters are trying to talk about cakes for almost 2 bloody minutes, and it's happening in the first 2 days, too). I can understan people may enjoy it, but come on - cakes? For two minutes? And digging deeper, trying to ""explain"" a character (but, as we all aware, that's not how it works). That's the second point: characters feel weak and kinda cliche (but still attractive as characters, at least some of them).Also, do I really have to mention that your alter ego in the game doesn't have any character at all?Thirdly, (this is rather personal) characters have voices (not all of them tho, only the key characters do). This is a common problem of vn on Steam. Voices spoil the mood, because it's not anime, it's, first of all, a novel, and novel is meant to be read. In this case, tho, I'd say that only Muxin's voice is annoying, The rest of the cast is descent, but they could've been way better without any talking at all.Now, to points why I still recommend this game. The atmosphere of Spring and coming-up important exams is delivered well (in some cases even amazingly), the backgrounds are great and character's drawing is good (still better than Always Remember Me), the soundtrack is beautiful and pretty much makes half of the atmosphere. The story is silly, stupid sometimes, but rather descently written. At least it feels like I'm seeing people on the screen, not dolls (yes, Sakura series, I'm talking about you) and life simulation is descent (even though I can't help but rage why you have to pick JUST ONE option for the whole day, while in Always Remmeber Me, for example, it took some time to do that and it took some time to do this, not just IT TAKES A WHOLE DAY/NIGHT CLASS TO CALL MUXIN)Okay. So, summing up. Gaokao is certainly not the worst visual novel out there, and in the end of the day, I don't regret spending my money on it. However, it lacks what most visual novels have: an interesting setting of the story and actually interesting original characters (I have no idea how there are 50+ endings, really). Maybe I don't get it becaus I'm still yet to finish Senior year, or maybe I just don't want to replay similar-to-real situations. Dunno, but what I'm trying to say is that other novels try to put you in a different situation that you are higly unlikely to experience (such as school for disabled people in Katawa Shoujo, for that instance). Here, it's just life of a senior student. That's it (even though some endings, as I heard, are quite depressing and interesting, but I'm yet to discover that)""But Hipsta"", I can hear you saying, ""You barely played 1 hour, that's not how it works"". True that, but if I'm not interested in reading during the first hour, during my first impression, what's the point of moving on with it? As a final score, I'll give it a 6-7-7.5/10. As to ""why I should buy it?"", I'd say buy it if you want to go through a light, easy-to-read novel telling a story of a simple guy with an ordinary life. For others, I'd say read If My Heart Had Wings or Fruit of Grisaia. P.S. The opinion may change since it's the impression of just the very first hour of the game, so you might as well stay tuned.

												Even when I just started I could already feel the lead paint of this Chinese visual novel poisoning me. The plot is interesting enough though. If the stress of important exams in real life isn't enough you can simulate the experience of what it's like to have to study or face the reality of making iPods for minimum wage for the rest of your life. It's an exciting experience for certain.Most of it's broken English, but don't worry, it's pretty easy to understand anyway. This game also has over 50 different labor camps you can be sent to-I mean endings. Just to show how much effort was put in. It truly is marvelous in that it is quite a lot of the content for the price it asks.Unfortunately I couldn't bear with the broken English long enough to make it more than twelve minutes or so.Your mileage may vary but I either recommend you be able to speak Chinese or have a high tolerance for broken English if you want to give this game a try. I'm still recommending it because it's not a bad game, in fact it's quite good, but my grammar Nazism stopped me from getting through the entire experience.			"

												Well, just got done with my second ending, ohh boy I have some great luck...my first run I do bad on the first exam and later down the line am sent to the training camp and I only manage to get into a adverage college loosing all my friends. abd the second run I grow distant from muxin and get on of the single endings. This game has a lot to offfer with 50+endings and at such a cheap price. As a high schooler now the anxiety of waiting for tests was real, inclusing the fails. This is definetly a gem out of the VNs at this price.			"

												I suggest this game to anyone who is willing to go through numerous choices to get the best endings. It is a game well, worth it to buy or even give to someone as a present. Though it has 50+ endings due to how to do on the final exam of your test in the game, it's all worth the wait. I say, your childhood friend is the best of the best. That's my opinion, though.			"

												If you were educated in China, or if you are someone very interested in a slice of life of that social culture, this may be a fun game for you. Otherwise like me, you may find it rather dull. Conversations seem fragmented and run on way too long; and this is made more tedious by having to click to advance through them as one does in these kinds of games. Likewise are the transition cutscenes which--while nice looking--add nothing to the story and feel like filler. I would grade this game a C. But with better writing/editing and maybe a little design polishing Gaoko.Love.100Days could be a grade B game. A much better example of this kind of game is Sunrider Academy, which I recommend (please read my review for info).			"

												You know why this game seems to be so popular?Chinese people did not produce any good game during a very long period, and after that they start to praise every single Chinese game that is not extremly disgusting.The story is not complete. Obviously the creators ran out of imagination after using up those out-of-date classic fragments.The dubbing is rubbish. Especially the glass girl, I can't believe a team would actually hire such a newbie that anyone can tell that she has no experience of dubbing after hearing the first line of hers. Their performance can't be called acting.In the early versions of this game lots of pictures in it are not produced by the creator team but from the Internet. It's seems that they deleted them later.The musics are old-styled, nothing new.The translation is... well, as the original Chinese version's style of writing is childish and wierd, the translation is not to be blamed.I don't know if there will actually be someone out of China interestedi in this game, in case there be, I strongly advise you not to buy it.You wanna play a dating game? Go buy some Japanese ones!You WILL regret buying this one.Trust me.0.5/10			"

I like both characters that can be your girlfriend (Muxin & Xiaohan). It will either make you feel Sad, heartbroken, happy, or annoyed.. the only ones i found were annoying were the main character's enthusiastic friend. and the parents xD.If i get to choose which girlfriend for my highschool life I think it would be the cute/quiet Muxin. Cuteness is key for my interests. although Xiaohan is pretty and smart she can probably get any guy anyways xD. unless she specificly likes me >_>.10/10 Would try again. and Deal with the Heartache...until I get a good ending ofcourse xD			"

Started my second playthrough a few hours ago, and now I'm just wondering what the hell I need to do to get the ending I want. I'll figure it out sooner or later ¯\_(ツ)_/¯The biggest downside to this game is the ~30 last days.
