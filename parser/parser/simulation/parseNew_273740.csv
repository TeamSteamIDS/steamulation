												This game/simulator packs the same punch as most unfinished products released on Steam.Although I've had my share of fun with it, there are just too many faulty elements to make it sustainable.I recommend this game if the price is of trivial importance and you have an hour to kill.Pros:-The info on the Store Page seems correct.-Graphics looks alright-Scenery is nice-The music is smooth (country'ish)-The driving itself is comforting-You get to drive a truckCons:-This product probably skipped beta.-The game spits and stutters. With all settings turned way down, my gaming rig still coughs.-Physics needs work. Although driving is fun enough, there are a lot of exciting places to get stuck and crash into.-Camera view is an endless pain in the boot. There are no modes like chase-cam etc.-When you finish a mission by offloading the goods, your vehicle will most likely stop working. $500 tow fee, just to rub it in.This also kept reverting my selection of the bigger truck to the one that you start with.-AI vehicles are unpredictable and will not hesitate to slow down if you tailgate them, just to make absolutely sure that you'll either ram them or perform some spastic manouvers.-The game does indeed crash at random without spitting any error messages. Game progress reverts to last clean exit.			"

												Absolutely horrible in so many ways.  Euro Truck Simulator 2 it's not.  Doesn't even come close to a similar experience.  Wish I could get by $12 back.			"

												14,99€ for this? Really? I paid 3€ for this which I think was a bit too much but oh well, I just wanted to try it out. But 0,99€ would be a lot better price tag for this, or actually, it could just be free to play.If you can get it from somewhere for really cheap and you have an hour to waste then get this game but if you're thinking about paying 14,99€ for this, don't, just don't. There's plenty of better ways to spend that 14,99€.Pros:- Achievements- Decent music- Decent customization options for trucks (License plates, color, engine, brake and fuel consumption upgrades)Cons:- 5 unfinished trucks- License plates that you can add on your truck are massive, no license plate on the rear of the truck- Front lights on the trucks are a mess- Horrible damage modeling- Road barriers, etc road stuff flying in the air- Invisible walls - No collision on trees and street lights (You can just drive through 'em)- Some of the uphills are so steep that the first truck can't make it to the top of the hill (without any upgrades)- Random lag spikes here and there (FPS goes from 90 to 20)- Turning the rear view mirrors on in the settings drops the FPS to 30 and below- Random crashes with no error message(s)- Horrible camera views- When you finish a mission, your truck stops working so you have to call for the tow truck which is $500- Mouse is on the middle of the screen all the time (If you don't move it  to the corner of the screen)- Some of the words in the game have not been translated to English- AI drivers - driving at 5-10km/h, going through the ground, stopping for no reason			"

												The ""Extreme"" in the title refers to how bad this game is. The map is extremely small, the trucks handle extremely bad, the AI is extremely spastic, the bugs are extremely prolific and annoying, etc. DO NOT BUY, or at least DO NOT PLAY if you are a collector. At best this is not a truck simultator, its a simulation of a truck simulator.Pros: nice lightingCons: everything elseWorst offences:Trailers seemed oversized and some are extremely top heavy causing you to roll even at slower speeds (30mph). Sometimes it will just jackknife instead for something different. Turning trees off does help mitigate this, but the game forgets your settings and still places them in other areas. It seems you have to turn them off 4 times to cover the whole map.Controls are extremly sensitive and the limited options dont seem to have any affect on that. Combined with the constant drifting (which is not caused by lack of deadzone) you will often experience the problem above.Speed is slow, 1st truck is luck to get to 40mph, 2nd can get to 50mph. Speed gauge only has 45 and 90 displayed on the dial. Terrible map design. There are parts of the road that have guard rails on the edge of the lane, not the edge of the road. Combined with the 2 problems above, you will soon start driving offraod to avoid crashing and getting stuck. Driving offroad is possible since trees are only imaginary. You can get stuck on uneven ground though, or smash into a mound of dirt that is a little too steep. Some parts of the road have chunks i them as well. The roads are very limited and can all be driven in under an hour. There is an annoying section at the bottom that doesnt connect and results in driving half way around the entire map just to get to the other side. Extremely annoying when you are on the wrong side and meant to be on the other.Faulty map and lack of GPS means you will sometimes have trouble finding where you are meant to go. Part of the map is outside the map boarders so if you need to drive there, you are going blind because it wont show on the minimap. Also you will need to stop while checking the map, becasue the game wont pause. Looking at the whole map and not returning to your location, while cause the minimap to not show where you are anymore.NO SAVES: seriously, if you play a few hours and the game crashes, tough luck. The only way to save is exit the game.AI is extremely slow, except when they come from behind and smash your truck off the road. Ram the cops as you see fit, there is no penalty aside from normal crash damage. Your truck does seem to be extremely light though, so expect to get plently of air time.			"

												Graphics are horrible, very glitchy. NPC cars AI is non existant. They drive about 5-10 mph and stop alot. Only 2 camera views, no rear view. Can not see to hook up trailor. Reminds me of a bad 90's game. The game will freeze every time, normally within the first 10 min. This is my first UIG game, with I had read about them first. I was hoping it would be a good MAC Truck sim, but lt is not. I will never buy from them again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE. The first Euro Truck Sim is decades ahead of this game.			"

												I downloaded the game yesterday. After 10 to 15 minutes worth of play the game continues to freeze. It was a complete waste of money. It is a shame as for when I did play my son was enjoying watching and that is why I got the game. Like others I too wish I could return the game if there is no fix for the freezing.			"

												As a former turck driver I was looking for a nice road game. This was not a game you can enjoy. Graphics was fine but slowed down the process quality. It also has limited controls and just felt like it was slaped together to make a buck. Very dissappointed with it. not worth playing.			"

												After enjoying Euro Truck Simulator 2, I can't tell you how disappointing this title is. Even though it only cost me $3, I would ask for my money back if I could. Don't waste your $3. Graphics are circa 2000, cars drive very slowly and the center line is no passing everywhere. Only 2 camera views, in-cab and external. If you aren't perfectly centered when you hook up to the trailer it will be off to the side and cause the truck to pull to the side. As a RW truck driver I can tell you that can never happen. Don't get this game.			"

												this game is not only a supreme piece of garbage, but a greatly overpriced piece of garbage at that. not only are the graphics VERY dated, this arcade game (which they tout as a simulation, for some reason...) does not even have functioning mirrors for the inside view. the AI sucks. the graphics suck. the controls suck (i could not get rid of the dead zone for controllers, making driving a real pain in the butt). the music is alright, but on the sucks side of alright. how can i get my money back? this game looks best in the pictures above, once youve seen them all, youve seen the best the game has to offer and should really just move on to something else.

												There are games that try to be good and succeed. There's games that try to be good and sadly fail. Then come games like this, which don't even try. Honestly I wasn't expecting much from a giveaway game but holy #nal f#cking sh#t, that was BAD. I usually talk first about the bad stuff the game has, but I don't think there's much else to talk about.First and foremost, the graphics. I don't usually don't talk much about them but for some reason the dev (I don't think there were a lot of people behind the creation of this thing) decided it was cool to have anything that's 20 meters away from you blur in a really dumb way while also making any incomming traffic dissapear completely. The map, of which there's only one, also lacks much detail, has holes that lack textures and other weird crap you can think of. It also never went above 15-20 FPS, despite looking quite outdated. The truck mechanics are also not something to look up to, and being a game that's all about driving trucks, you'd think they would put effort into it. Turning is extremely sentitive, controls are crap and worse of them all, the physics will fight anything you try. Hit something? Then expect your truck to, for some reason, be unable to drive forward for a few seconds, or suddenly jump into the skies for no reason. It also hurts that the camera is controlled by the mouse, which makes the first person view a pain and even worse than the third person one.Then come the bugs. I would call it the only good part of the game but being honest here, they were only fun when I wanted to see how far I could fly with a truck by breaking the game. It gets even worse when you fly out of the map and drop down to infinity; you'll be unable to use the tow-truck option and can't get out, so you would be forced to delete any progress and start from scratch.I've played less than an hour and I got the game for free, somehow I still feel ripped off. Developers like these deserve an award that shows in all of their steam page games which warns everone about how bad they are at actually developing a game. I even made a short video about it, you're free to watch it instead of buying the game. At least it's free, instead of being priced at 9,99€ like this horrible abomination.

TL;DR Edition: Don't buy it. Think of Big Rigs but without any possible fun that game could have ever had and filled with bugs.			"

												So, I bought this game at gamestop in Italy. Since I have a really low spec computer, I check the specs and it seems to be under my requirements. So I buy it for 3 Euros thinking I got an amazing deal on a game. So when I got back to the hotel I tried it on my Laptop, worked fine, with 18 fps at lowest settings, and I couldn't figure out anything. Now when I got back, I tried it on my computer with higher specs. Doesn't start at all. I am so confused...And also, just before this review I looked at the system requirements for the game and it said Nvidia GeForce GT 240. When on the box it said Nvidia GeForce 6800GT, which was under my specs. So that's the reason then. Not quite because I cant understand how a worse laptop can run this game while the better pc can't.Now, let's get into the gameplay (Played 0.2 Hours because it was so laggy on my laptop and it was kind of unplayable). I started with a truck (as expected) and I go to the contols menu to figure out what to do and some of the words in the menu were in german so I had to use Google Translate. But it still didn't make much sense. So I thought screw it i will just use wasd for the time being and I just drove and it just wasn't good because I couldn't find the contol for camera change so I was outside the truck (Which was strange because it showed the interior of a truck in some of the photos).Overall this is a bad game and like all of the other reviews DO NOT BUY THIS WASTE OF MONEY! I payed obviously 3 Euros as you saw earlier in the review which I wouldn't even pay for this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ let alone 7 Pounds. I wouldn't even pay 1 pence for it it is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game overall.0Thank you for reading.			"

												The best way to describe this game is Big Rigs between the first two patches, because you have collision with AI and guard rails and /some/ of the buildings. You can easily drive through forests without the branches even trying to stop you, you can drive through solid buildings, you can drive through water... okay, hold on. Imagine thick woods, with squirrels playing, deer prancing, and a truck made out of tinfoil staring menacingly from the shadows. That's this game.This game is worth it for a laugh and that's it; I spent $2 on a bundle with this game and it was KIND OF worth it.Also the game uses up 2 cores and 3GB of RAM because it's a leaky mess, runs in debug mode for some reason, and on top of that, will begin to drop frames and stutter. Considering what others said, I had it run okay, considering it didn't crash.			"
