												Well now that we've hit 1.0 I looked back on my early access review and looked to see whats's changed....Not much the entire EA review STILL appliesThis game is in no way ready for primetime with the current build - it was FAR FAR FARRRR too early to be released. Extensive control issues, numerous bugs, and horrible optimization make this a buggy unplayble mess.Runs at 30fps on my GTX980 and it's not because the framerate is locked - I mean it seems like it's locked at 60 but that's not the point - it just runs like♥♥♥♥♥It looks polished but it doesn't PLAY polished and none are more frustrated than me that that's the case.A lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥has been made about the price point - I don't really mind since farming games like this has always been an EXTREMELY small niche and someones gotta get paid.... but the game needs work.... lots of work.If they can get the game running at a decent level I'll change my recommendation but as it is I cant recommend it because I don't want to play it in its current state.

												I love Harvest Moon, so I was really excited about this. Unfortunately, it caused me to have a lapse in judgement and buy an EA game. I bought it in May, and it was unplayable. I sat on it until just now, played it, and was bored in 30mins. The biggest problem I had with this game was its unbearable control issues.My disappointment doubled when I heard they're doing episodes instead of a full game. They outright admit the new format is because they failed to manage their money, and no other reason.  I regret paying a dollar for this game. I don't anticipate ever having the complete game I paid for. It's a bummer because this game could have had potential if it was in the right hands... oh well.EDIT 7/2016: Just tried to play it again for giggles. I did a new game since it'd been so long and was immediately greeted by a sequence of yawn-inducing 2 second cutscenes paired with 10 second fades to black. Great. The controls, shockingly, are now somewhat tolerable. Not much else is too different - it is still a glitchy subpar game. I got bored by day 2 and quit without saving. I bought this game a year ago and it still sucks.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello. I don't usually write reviews, but I'm writing this hoping that it will help someone else out.The game design overall for Wild Season is fantastic...feels just like a mobile Harvest Moon game.Just that overall could sell me. I bought the game and immediately regretted it. (Or at least within the hour)Within 24 hours I had refunded the game.I understand it is in Alpha (SINCE APRIL 2015 MAY I ADD) so it became very clear to me that ""What you see is what you get"" with this game. I would play an entire day, struggle to get the game to actually save, and then when my character finally went to sleep...I would wake up the following day and the day would repeat...everything I had done was erased. Random lag in areas...unclear goals. Delay lag.Overall I give it 2/5 Stars. Dissapointed. Hope this helps you make up your mind as to purchasing this game or not.TLDR; The game idea is great, but the game itself lags too frequently..causing data to sometimes not save. Not worth the frusteration. 2/5 Stars.			"

												Played the game enough to get to the end of the first episode, the devs have their priorities way out of order, coupled with the fact that they clearly bit off more than they could chew, and you have Wild Season. The game we've all been waiting for. I found myself waking up, watering plants, then going to sleep until the next day, rinse and repeat. There's really nothing else to it than that, sure you can go mining (the levels on the mine repeat themselves occasionally, including all the crap you left on the floor) but you cant use the ores to make anything like in HM games, you just sell them for next to nothing, better off spending money farming. Animals are broken, you can buy a chicken, and yes it will eventually lay eggs after it's happy, but you can't incubate the eggs, they disappear the next day, so if you want multiple chickens you have to keep buying more, which is against the point to begin with, you would never see your money back from that.Cows are useless, by the time I got the money to buy one it wouldn't give me milk, even after getting its happiness up to a certain point there was still nothing. On the last day of episode one some of your animals just randomly go missing (it even says at the top of the screen, as if it's some sort of story plot) but you never see them again, its never mentioned again, your animals are just gone.The story is what kept me playing, I love story driven games, it allowed me to struggle my way past the insane amount of incomplete, and honestly I like the story, when I was at work I would keep thinking to myself ""man I wonder what will happen next"" and I wasn't disappointed, however a game that plays similar to HM you don't expect an ominous ""TO BE CONTINUED"" in your face after you begin Fall, it's just ridiculous.As much as I played this game, and as much as I'd love to play the rest, in it's current position it is just not worth it, let alone worth the DLC. The problem is that I haven't seen much progression in this game for the past 2 years that i've watched it. I no longer see any game breaking bugs, sure some bugs that require you to save and restart, but nothing that kills your save files anymore, at least that hurdle was jumped over.Ultimately I highly suggest saving your money for now, it's not worth it and you WILL be disappointed.

												I love the Harvest Moon and Rune Factory games.  Even paid top dollar for the original SNES cartridge which I still have and can play today.  I was really excited about this game until I purchased it and actually played it.  Seems to have a lot of potential but sooo many bugs that it's unplayable.   People forget about you, things in inventory disappear, and for me the game randomly crashes when I go to save it.  Thus losing that days work.  Now I hear that they think it's ""finished"" and they want to move to episodic charging more for people that haven't purchased it yet.  No thanks..			"

Its an unfinished game and only AFTER they release it on steam do they say...Oh we are not only unfinished but we are also switching it. So you paid 14$ for a unfinished, glitchy, buggy game, nope...you only paid for part one.Developers, make up your minds. Until this game is solidly finished I wouldnt recomend this game at all.

												This game should still be in Beta and the fact that this baddly built flash game is now going to sell for around $60 ""complete"" just makes me sick.  My advice is to steer clear of it until all 4 episodes are released as they will probably get desperate for money and bring the price down to what it should be - $20 complete.  They shouldn't be turning it into a 4 part series to recoup the money they lost rebuilding and changing the game, if you made mistakes, you should wear the costsProblems :  - UI just disappears sometimes, and your stuck frozen standing there and there's nothing you can do - Sometimes keyboard functionally in menus drops off and then u have to revert to using the mouse until you are out of the menu - Quiting the game often just crashes out of it - Seeds sometimes go missing after you have bought them - when you talk to people in town they often repeat the very long winded speech they made to you for a previous ""mission"" when you are no longer on that mission - Shop keepers not being in thier stores when the shops are meant to be open - chopping large wood/stone sometimes loots nothing, it just disappears after 50 swings - planting seeds in the ""highlighted area"" doesn't always mean the seeds are going to land in the area it says it will - Beach festival : no way to delete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fish so u just have to prayt that you get good fish in your first 8 caststhe list goes on...  ill keep adding things as i see them....  i just thought i would post this as im waiting to see if the game un-locks itself so i dont have to reload the game...

Early Access Review
								As much as I wanted to love Wild Season I just couldn't.This was another Kickstarter backed game that I threw my money at the second I saw it. I've played every Harvest Moon since the first and I've been waiting a long time for someone to bring something similar to PC and when I saw it happening by fans of the original Harvest moons I was more than excited.I first tried the game in Alpha stage when it was pretty much unplayable, but the involvement from the developers kept me interested so periodically I would drop back in and try it out over and over but that seems to be my problem. If you were to ask me how the game has advanced since Alpha I couldn't tell you. The controls are unbearable, and I mean to the point you want to pull your hair out. Figuring out which button does what will put you in the mood to rage and that's before you even get into the gameplay. (It seems on the last update they've informed us they have hired two new members of the team to sort these control issues out so hopefully this could be changing in the near future)Once I managed to work out the controls well enough to input my name and such I was forced to watch the unskippable prologue bit before being led to my farm. Then the game crashed. Loaded it up again, and the game crashed on the menu screen. Now I've found crashing to be a frequent problem for this game which is expected in early access, but not being able to skip the start up dialogue makes it really, really unappealing for me. Now when it crashes before I've had the chance to save it I don't even bother trying again. Now I'm sure the actual gameplay is great, following the blogs and podcasts you can see how much effort the developers are putting into it. There are tonnes of villagers, crops, animals and what seems to be a great (and mysterious) story but I can't see myself ever loving the game.I think what I found appealing about Harvest Moon and similar games was the simplicity. Though the tasks could be seen as repetitive for boring the game kept you playing. This game seems to lack that charm.There are too many small bothersome things that bug me as I play. Having to constantly hold a button to run, not being able to change direction when running without first stopping, animations that seem to go on far too long, unfriendly villagers and the lack of overall polish in the game all put me off.My biggest problem is the game feels like it's made by an amateur indie studio. I'm sure there are loads of people out there who love this game, I'm just not one of them. For me the game doesn't feel like it's in Beta which makes me a little worried for the final state BUT I will be keeping my eye on it and I don't see it as a wasted investment because I know one day when it's released I will give it another try. I finally see why the developer of Stardew Valley has waiting so long to release his game. I think games like this need to be played in their full state or not at all and despite the fact there are a tonne of good reviews I honestly think if the game was as good as those people were saying they would have clocked in far more than 1-2 hours. I play Harvest Moon for 3-4 hours at a single time. Maybe by release Wild Season will be worth the money but right now, I'd advise you to hold onto your money and wait until it's out of development.			"

												I tried playing around the bugs, while submitting lots of bug reports, hoping that they would be fixed, and then the game was released as episode one, still virtually unplayable. It's not even a good Harvest Moon clone, let alone anything more. There are rampant spelling errors, the plot is meh, and last time I checked, purchasing a chicken corrupted your save file.If the game was more complete, and less buggy, it would be worth the current price of ""episode one"", but I didn't pay for an episode- I paid for a complete game. This is not even close. I'm definitely regretting purchasing this one while it was in early access; it never improved.It's a painfully unfinished game that's made up almost entirely of references to other media, rather than an actual plot. Unless that changes, which I don't see happening, now that it's been ""released"", I'd say it's not worth your time, let alone your money.			"

												I see a lot of people saying the game developers are horrible for making an episodic release... and then saying they will have to buy the other episodes even after they have bought the game before this announcement... which is sad and untrue.That, however, does not mean that this game does not have very fundamental problems.The developers decided to remove the game from early access due to, from what I could gather, spending all the money they crowndfunded on growing their company instead of working on their game (or maybe simply due to horrible money-handling skills).But this game is far, very, VERY far, from being even close to be completed. And all that is taking into account the fact that this is just the first episode of the game. The first episode is not close to completion. In the state it's in, it's barely at a Beta state. I usually expect Beta games to have most of the core content ready to go but in need of some polishing.In the first 30 minutes of the game you are introduced to a lot of content that, when you attempt to access, just ins't there or is completely unusable. This is the definition of a game in Alpha state.I get it developers, you need the money or you won't be able to finish the game, but there were much better ways to go about this that did not involve blatantly lying about the state of your game.

												I tried to like this game, I really did but...Nothing about the game seems finished... including the actual game. Taking the episode approch, if you want to even finish this game you'll have to pay for the inital game and then for each new episode. The entire game is buggy to the point where simply trying to play the game gets frustrating. If you progress though the story, try to do a simple dilevery quest, try to farm... I assure you you will find a bug that makes it unplayable. I can understand early release on games for a community that have waited a long time but ... is it to much to ask for the core game mechanics to be functional prior to ""release""?Finally, the towns people... I know they have a secret... I understand it is part of the story (even if you can't get immersed in the story due to the aforementioned bugs which ruin it)... I can even accept that no one is ever where they are suppose to be (I'm talking to you store owners... 9-5 means 9-5 not 10 and only 10... maybe but fridays only... one day a month) but do the towns folk really have to treat the player like absolute garbage? You move in and they quite literally treat your existance there as a crime... it's a farming sim not a maximum security prison. I have to child proof my house because I am worried my little farming buddy might have some suicidal tendencies with all the from all the abuse. It will make it very hard to forgive them when... if they ever view you as a friend. I can't play the game as it is right now... I will give it one more chance when it is complete but as of now nothing about this game is fun. Harvest Moon got it right just stick with them for now.			"

Unfortunately, the further you get, the more you uncover what an unfinished, laggy, buggy, and broken game this is.Featuring:- Horrible optimization- Severe lag issues- Unintuitive UI- Boring and/or completely pointless gameplayand yes, even,- Game breaking bugs.Mhm, not only can you find bugs in nearly every piece of the game,some of these bugs flat out stop the game in its tracks.From screen freezes to crashes, even if you still WANTED to play this game, it just isn't worth the effort of fixing it over and over, asking for support, and finding ways around the glitches in the central storyline. And you'll be happy to know, when you first start to see these MAJOR problems in the regular progression of the game, about...exactly two hours have passed. So when the point comes where you realize: 'this was a bad decision', there's no going back. No refund for you.This game is cute.This game has potential.This game is overpriced, unfinished, buggy, broken, and quite literally unplayable. I genuinely did enjoy the first hour or so, but it deteriorates quickly into the mess it kept trying to hide. Save yourself the money: do not buy this game.			"

												Despite now having an official release, the game still have running and graphical issues. When this game came out in alpha I expected there to be bugs, what I didn't expect was a game so buggy that you couldn't play it, developers telling you that the game works if you played it in quick play mode and having issues that made it so that I could play further into the game in the demo than the version I had payed for. With the official release I expected there to be significant refinement and to finally be able to play the game I had payed for. Sadly, the game still runs slow, and feels patched together, as though some areas have been spruced up and others haven't. In other words this game now feels like an alpha release. The game that was released as an alpha release should have just been given for free, as it was unplayable. I have lost all respect for this game and the developers, who when explaining their choice to make it episodic suddenly, kept referring to the fact that they need more money. I felt like this was a punch in the face when I had already payed them and had been given an unplayable game that has only just now been elevated to the point where I could call it a buggy alpha that needs testing. I would never recommend this game and advise that you steer clear from it.			"

												If you are looking to buy this game, DO NOT BUY.I started playing this game the week it was released. Since then the game has made very little progress in development. The devs seem to be on another planet, and while they have fixed a few bugs they have not focused on fixing the broken core game elements.-Tools often glitch breaking game.-NPC's are often in walls-Textures are missing-Game freeze upon entering and leaving certain areas-No tool level up-No home improvementThere are many many more problems with this game, but these are some of the basic game breaking ones that have been and still are a problem a YEAR after release. This should not be.Recently they have changed this to an episodic release (I say recent but it was a bit ago). Why would you do that when your core content is still broken? YOUR CORE CONTENT IS STILL BROKEN.Overall, if you are looking to get this game please don't waste your money. This game had such great potential. It is a shame the devs have decided to do nothing accept scrub cash from us by releasing a half baked game, assuring us they are working on it, and then never working on the game breaking issues.For now I will continue to watch and hope for a patch release that actually fixes the problems. Should the status of this game ever change, so will my review. I was really looking forward to this game, and as I said before, it has tons of potential. Devs, if you read this, please fix the current content FIRST before the release of new content.			"

Early Access Review
								Disclaimer: Received a key for review purposesOne thing you have to realize about Wild Season is that it's very much an Early-Access game. At its current state, the game is pretty buggy and needs a lot of fine-tuning. Currently the gameplay and controls are a bit frustrating. This game is a farming life sim, yet I found it difficult to work on my farm for extended periods of time because of how slow it took for my character to perform actions. Sometimes it took more than a couple of seconds for my character to pick up weeds or crops and then put them away in my bag. Even working on a 3x3 plot is time-staking. This is a shame because I was looking more forward to the farming-sim aspect of the game than the RPG/ Visual Novel aspect of the game. The controls also need to be better mapped AND/OR better noted ingame. WASD for movement was fairly easy to figure out but J K L for actions was not as obvious. This should have been told from the beginning, not an hour into the game. There are also a lot of immoveable cutscenes from the very start. I understand this is also a visual novel and an RPG so there are bound to be many cutscenes to move along the story, However I wish the game wouldn't heavily depend on cutscenes to progress. Even just letting me open the door myself when someone knocks on my house door, or entering a store and walking towards the NPCs myself would be better than waiting constantly for the cutscenes to end and for me to finally do something and move around. All the cutscenes made me feel very constrained and I would have liked the option to meet the characters at my own pace.One thing I really like about the game is the story and characters. I'd certainly like to know why the townpeoples are acting so xenophobic and what my farm has to do with anything. Some of the characters are very charming and interesting. Your task is not just maintaining your farm; it also includes building platonic or romantic relationships with your neighbors. But once again while I'd love to explore more into the story's lore and story, the poor controls make it difficult for me to play for a long period of time.I like the concept of this game, and personally I think this game would be a lot more enjoyable if the developers fixed the controls. However this game needs a lot of work. At the current stage of development, I cannot find myself recommending this game.			"

												I've done something that I have never done before on steam. I deleted my positive review and I'm making it a negative one.  I've suggested that so many people follow this game and buy it if they dig Harvest Moon.  I had a lot of faith that this game would come out okay.Now they are releasing the game in episodes.The claim is that episode 1 is a complete game.What a complete joke.  The controls are impossible to use.  There are so many glitches the game is unplayable.Do. Not. Buy. This. Game.			"

Early Access Review
								My opinion of this game:Currently it is too buggy to play. Many functions don't work properly, the controls aren't good. I would like to play more with the mouse, because the IJKL-Controlling is seriously bad. But although there are these problems, the game still has a good start:The story is really interesting, since it's completely different from the ones in the Harvest Moon games.The graphics are fancy, never seen that beautifil HUDs and GUIs.And most important: The characters are individual and they act like real people and not only like NPCs.With some more updates, I think the game will become better and more playable.

												Look, pal, I get it. You had your back against the wall, the funds were getting thinner. It was a desperate move, it's pretty clear that, but, you know, at least you could make the FIRST EPISODE somewhat playable. Even Bethesda has less bugs, AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EVEN MORE BUGS THAN FALLOUT 4 DAY 1 LAUNCH. THAT IS SOMETHINGIt's clear that the devs pulled the plug in a desperate move to get more funds, but in this case, it made things worse.I don't care about episodes, or waiting years. I can wait 12 years, no problem.But what I hate, is when a game is launched in a hurry, and is a total mess.This game has potential. A lot. But it's buried under the bugs, and glitches, and everything else.In this state, the game is playable, but you will suffer the pains of Hell if you want to get through act 1.Unless they fix this mess, I can't recommend buying this.Sorry, but that's the truth.I feel sorry for those Kickstarter backers, who thought they invested in something great.

												Don't be baited by the ""promises"" that this game supposedly bring. It's full of bugs to the point where it's extremely frustrating to even try and play it. You can't farm properly because the target box doesn't work as it should, controls are very wonky. It's missing so many elements that makes Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon, and for a game that's inspired by that, it's nowhere close to it. This game should not even leave the beta/alpha stage at all. It's so bug prones to the point where you can't play. Now with their new ""episodic"" contents or in other words, trying to milk the cows but only produce some rotten cheese while the rest is dump down the drain. This is pretty much a typical kickstarter game with what seems like very inexperience developing team that can't even remotely bring what they promised without giant piles of bugs that is game breaking. The episodes plus game total if you buy all 4 is 32$, pretty much the same as the price before the price ""drop"". I do not recommend this game at this stage at all. You don't even know if it's going to leave this stage and deliver all the episodes (even with bugs), so hold on to your dollars and wait until all of them come out and see what they fixed or haven't fix before throwing in 17$ for a garbage can where all the promises and hopes go to.

												I gave this game a serious, honest shot. It does have an interesting story, and it really caught my attention, but to be honest, do not buy it. Let me list why:1. Millions of bugs. This game is so full of bugs you would think they were a rotting corpse full of maggots. From NPCs walking through walls to text jumps to invisibile objects, even missing textures. 2. The game ends in the middle of Fall. Spoilers. You have two seasons to play, both of which are extremely boring. There is no building expansion, nothing to use building materials on, and nothing to buy other than more seeds. I spent the last 10 days in the episode sleeping, not even going outside.3. Everything is glitchy. The main menu, the in game menus, the lag of the keyboard input and mouse input. 4. The developers act like they don't really care that they sold a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game. ""We will be focusing on episode 2"". How about you refund episode 1, fix the ♥♥♥♥ing thing, then worry about episode 2. 5. No use for ores, enjoy your base level tools until future episodes, at which point they will glitch into a giant dong and go straight into your♥♥♥♥♥Seriously, do not waste your money. Get stardew valley, a game made a single person that is infinately better than this. Literally the only thing this game has going for it is the story arc. You'll even save a dollar by buying stardew. I will not be buying any other games from this developer until they stop reading from EA's playbook.UPDATE: I have since requested a steam refund on the basis of an incomplete game post 1.0 release and developers not supporting the unfinished product.

												I was one of the people who backed this game on Kickstarter because I love farm games like Harvest Moon and had hopes for it. However, the developers seemed to come across a lot of challenges and it seems they never came over them. The game itself is boring and buggy with performance issues which makes it frustrating to play. And the worse thing is that there are no updates. The Kickstarter has been abandoned since June 2016 and it also seems that it’s been abandoned on Steam.  Seems that they took the £25,000+ and god knows how much from Steam early access and wasted it. I do not recommend this game to anyone. The developers are useless. Don’t waste your time and money on this piece of rubbish, go play Stardew Valley, a well-made and more enjoyable game with a developer who actually cares.			"

I couldn't even exit the game - looking on the forums showed a dev saying to alt-f4 to exit.  That is simpy ridiculous.  Theres no menu, and the 'tutorial' bits dont actually even tell you what keys to use...  Also, this game was not made for a pc, it seems, as the controls are really dumb.  I never would have thought to use J and K for default actions.I am pretty upset at wasting time and money on this.  I hope that eventually, it will be playable, but it seems like the devs were just trying to get a money grab by releasing a game in this state. "

												Too many glitches. It's frustrating because the core concept is there.Pros:Interesting story.Cons:Episodic format doesn't work with this type of games.Awkward controls, need to open up the menu to pick up the feed instead of a shortcut, so a chore every time Dog suddenly disappeared Can't upgrade the tools yetGlitches that prevent progressing. If you have run out of seeds while planting and switch seeds, your game interface will become unplayable and unsavable. The dialogues menu take too long to pop up and take a while to load a second time.Everyone stuck together.The NPCs run around too fast.No forage items.Buy items but disappear, I bought a brush and a shear but none appear for me.Can't organize itemsSometimes villagers disappear and you need to quit and re-enter the game.Need mouse control.Fishing is frustrating.I'll update the game when they fix these problems.

												I'm not entirely certain this game even functions. Like, the jank evident in the trailers isn't just a bad framerate recording. The entire game seems to be full of that. It's a shame because it almost seems like they had the right goal in mind when it comes to paying homage to what was good about Harvest Moon, especially stuff like Friends of Mineral Town. They just did not execute, and I can only imagine this game is out of Early Access right now and placed into an episodic format because they needed to make sales to continue support of the game. I would have been perfectly content with a version that was only a proof-of-concept of competent farm upkeep gameplay, but something that doesn't even have that isn't keeping my interest with this weird theme of spooky VHS artifacts and the promise of a mystery behind the scenes.

												Not a bad game overall, but I think it might have come out of Early Access a bit too soon. Certain gameplay mechanics don't seem to be fully fleshed out, and recent posts from the dev would seem to indicate that there are some significant overhauls coming in the future. I'm left with the sense after playing through the entirety of this first episode that the game is functional but very much incomplete. I'd also note that the decision to make this an episodic release leads to a very abrupt ending which only adds to the disappointment. If the game is finished and polished a bit I might change my recommendation, but in the meantime this is a thumbs down.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review of the Early Access version of the game.My first impression was that it was difficult to get into. I had no clue what to do at first until I left the room you start in and then I met a guy called Frank who led me through a farming tutorial. After I planted some seeds and watered them I didn't really know what to do. I met a woman who asked me to leave town and then the game suggested I go to bed. The next day I still didn't know what to do...You can wander around the world much like an RPGMaker game. It seems somewhat open world and you can go and talk to people around town. There's a LOT of dialog - perhaps a bit much. Lots of clicking to read it all and you can't skip it. I got kinda bored.The interface is somewhat clunky. It appears to be keyboard controlled and there are a few action keys but it doesn't say what they are for so there's some trial and error. One annoying thing is that when planting and watering crops you have to position yourself very precisely in order to tend the farm tiles you want.I'm sure there's a lot more depth to this game further in but it didn't hold my attention long enough to continue.

Early Access Review
								Note: I got a key from the developer for beta testing.In short: I am quite indecisive about the rating. It is not bad enough to give it a thumbs down but has too many bugs / incomplete features to give it a thumbs up.So, maybe consider buying this ONLY IF you want to play this game while it is in development AND IF you can get it during a sale.+ Nice and cute JRPG style graphics+ Day and night transition.+ There *seemed* to be plenty to do (though I didn't get to do much during my playthrough).+ A lot of NPCs, which hopefully will be woven into the story.+ Interesting storyline (for me, this is the main selling point).+ Dialogues with NPCs add to the suspense. + Relaxing background music- Buggy. Eg. Invisible characters with dialogues.- Sometimes 'Esc' doesn't bring up the menu. Had to Alt-F4 to quit.- Weird one: I cannot get the character to go to sleep? None of my action keys worked.- Keystrokes sometimes do not register.- Non-intuitive controls. Should make use of LMB and RMB.- Unclear about save function. Does it auto-save? If not, where is the manual save button? Though to be fair, my game resumed from where it left off when I last quit.- No clear quests outline (so I just wandered around town).- Very pricey at $30 base price. Especially IF the devs decide to increase the price of the final product.The game is still in EA so I understand it's a work in progress and taking this into consideration, I won't give it a thumbs down. I think it has potential to be good game if and when the bugs are fixed. However, I can only recommend it if you can get it at a discounted price ($30 base price at time of writing) because I don't think the gameplay can justify the price tag. My Rating: 5/10			"

												Updating my review because they've become a bit sketchy, old one is still below. I honestly think people who are paying so much for a game, many of whom were backers for the Kickstarter who still haven't recieved their keys, deserve a bit better than this. You're far better off spending your money on World's Dawn, or waiting for StardewValley, at least until this game is finished and all episodes are released.They found more bugs while fixing the others, but pushed out the update for the others without fixing the ones they found. The new update didn't really change the quality of gameplay due to the new bugs. They're still asking for 20$ for two seasons worth of gameplay, when you can't even continue at the end of episode 1 without paying for more of the game. They even acknowledge that they cannot promise a second episode can even be released. On top of this, they're claiming to have enough money to finish the game, and then just a few sentences later asked for fully qualified volunteers to work for free on things they should have had done a long time ago.The game itself is still very much broken and can be a very frustrating experience.I have friends who design and create games, I am part of some of these, I understand it's a lot of very hard work, but this is getting to be ridiculous._____________________________It's not worth it as it is.I bought the game then realized they'd switched it to ""Episodes"" just a few days earlier. A little miffed, but I'd get over it. I should have read the game's page again before I bought it and I didn't. I've been playing it only to come to the conclusion that paid 20$ for an unfinished piece of garbage. I've played through one and a half seasons and just don't know if I can play through any more. Most of the hours clocked playing it are from when it drove me nuts so I just minimized it and forgot about it for a few days.None of the bugs they said were fixed are fixed, you don't have access to any tool or farm upgrades, it's near impossible to make any sort of money, there is glitch after glitch after glitch, it constantly fails to respond to key presses, and the list goes on and on.They failed to manage their money well and pushed the game when it just wasn't ready, insisting they didn't want to disappoint people who have been waiting for it, but I would have been far less disappointed had they just took their time and put out a finished, relatively polished product.

Early Access Review
								A game with great potential. Yes, this game is still in early access and it shows. There were a few things that I came across which I believe need to be fixed before I can fully enjoy this game.  To name a few issues , the frame rate, the characters skip around the screen with movements like a bad horror movie. There also seems to be quest updates and completions of the same thing repeatedly. One of the major issues I had was the lack of instruction or misdirection (the mayor tells you to go south east when you're meant to go south west). I didn’t know how to save my progress after putting in over an hour into the game and when it came around to planting my seeds I couldn’t get around to doing just that. I couldn’t find help in game and online has yet to post any useful information. But put a side the pixilated opening animation and misdirection of the characters and you have what will eventually be a great game. I can see this being one of those games people call a hidden gem. The story actually kept me in the game to see what was going on with the farm and why people wanted my character to leave. The music and art was good for this particular game. Of course I have to add that the game being made with Unity was a good choice. Simply because I have played plenty of games and every game made with Unity worked perfectly. As far as not crashing, freezing or not running the game at all. But to put in my two cents , Wild Seasons  is definitely worth buying , just wait until after early access. Unless you want the experience of being a game tester. Then pick it up and have fun.			"

												What I initially thought would be a lifeless hark back to the days of the Facebook farming sim is a game with story-telling potential. 'Potential' is worth remembering however, as at this 'Very' Early Access stage there remains a lot of work to be done. As it stands (on 8th Nov '15) the game is unpolished and glitch-heavy, with a 30-minute intro to boot. This makes the current asking price of £22.99(!!) a laughable tariff. Even picturing this game fulfilling it's potential as a story-rich farming sim, the price seems far too high for what you would get.TL:DR - Has potential, but steer clear until much later in development, and only with a much lower price point than £23.Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Quickfire Games "

												When this game was in Early Access I was gifted a code and asked to review it if I liked the game. I did like the game, and I left a fairly long and detailed review about what I liked and didn't like, giving the game an over all positive review as an EA game that needed work but had value and promise.Then they shipped that buggy, content poor beta as the 1.0 final version, AND made the game episodic. These are both terrible ideas, the game is no where near finished and ending a Harvest Moon type game with a cliff hanger is stupid. I updated my review but left it over all positive.Now they are trying to recruit professional people to submit CV and portfolio to then work for free on things like THE STORY OF THE GAME. They claim they have enough money to finish, but at the same time not enough money to hire the 4-6 people they apparently need to do work they have not done. Which is especially galling because this game was Kickstarted, and raised nearly $50000 two years ago. Lots of those backers never even got Steam keys, by the way. TLDR: the slow development of this game cannot be excused as incompetency, after all these years and repeated schemes I personally believe this product is produced as a deliberate SCAM and that you should AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Early Access Review
								I haven't played a lot of these games and I believe that you need to play it for a good 2 hours before you can start enjoying it. I must admit I was getting a bit bored walking around for an hour meeting characters but nothing happening. It wasn't until about 70 minutes in that the game started warming up and the story started developing. I am intrigued to see where the story goes so I will definitely have another go to see where it heads. The music is quite pleasant and relaxing and the interface is okay once you get used to it. I am a bit of an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ so it would be very welcoming to see some achievements introduced and of course cards will always boost sales and is welcomed.  So Far So good. I think you need a lot of patience with these type of games but if you like farming sims with a lot of character talk (not always meaningful) then this is certainly worth a look. I will update when I play more. I have played a lot more now and I am enjoying it more. The story is developing and my farm is looking a bit more healthier. There is a mystery running through the storyline which I am keen to know more about.			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. I love Harvest Moon, and the idea of Harvest Moon with some lurking, dread secret sounded wonderful to me.But part of the charm of games like Harvest Moon is the environment. Simply walking around and enjoying the small town. It needs to be a character, too. And there are some enjoyable visuals in certain areas. But much of the town is blank space, making it hard to navigate. You shouldn't feel lost in a tiny, homey town.Also, while I like the idea of the townspeople not wanting to have you there, in practice, it doesn't lead to them being likeable or interesting characters. This sort of thing could be used to build intrigue, with glimpses of who they really are peeking out between the cracks. But I never got the mystery-solving itch. I just wanted to leave. It's also easy to either sleep through cut scenes, or cause weird bugs when the game insists on showing them anyway.Currently, this game is episodic, which boggles my mind. A farming simulator is a time-eater. This genre is not one meant to be broken up into little bits. And after a kickstarter and early access, this game should be complete. Worse still, the game is buggy, and core elements of gameplay are still being built.I'll praise Quickfire for not giving up on the game, as they still do regular updates. It's the sort of thing where I'm tempted to leave a ""don't buy it yet"" sort of review. Because I want to view this game as a work in progress. But Wild Season isn't in early access anymore, and the game is still being debugged. And I can't recommend a game based on hope. I dropped $30 on the game before it went episodic, and feel incredibly foolish having done so. It doesn't deliver on the simple pleasure of growing lots of different crops. It doesn't feel like I've been invited or challenged to solve an interesting mystery. I don't care about the characters. The ads and information released by Quickfire make it look like there's so much to this game, but in my playthrough, it just didn't deliver on any of it. I appreciate them working hard to try to deliver their own spin on Harvest Moon, but your money would be better spent on a copy of virtually any other Harvest Moon game.			"

												I grew up with games like this so I knew I wanted to get it. Sadly it still needs the other half of the game. For a game, that's almost $20 I'd like to play the whole story or at least a little more. The characters we fun and it had it's laggy/buggy moments, The watering had to be the most annoying thing for me, though...Other than that it was ok. I'd also like to know when will we be seeing Episode 2? "

First Impressions----11/3/2015: Build 0.7.0.12----Wild Season is a very adorable surprise. I originally had mixed feelings about this game, believing it to be another run-of-the-mill RPG Maker game using a new Unity skin. However, this game sets itself apart with Harvest Moon-like gameplay elements providing a breath of fresh air in a sea of stale indie games. Be aware that this review is based off of an early access product.The story is about a young up-and-comer who recieves a ""new"" farm in a colorful community. What begins as farming sim slowly introduces scents of mystery as the entire town seems to want you gone. Not if you have anything to say about it....Current State of the GameAlthough Wild Season shows great promise and interesting gameplay mechanics, it is still full of minor bugs and absent of many fairly basic game options. Below is a list of noticeable bugs (none that are game-breaking) and important suggestions.Bugs: Mary is shown to be stuck in a visual loop going into the door next to the bar, inside of the inn. The same loop happens to Barry when he appears. The loop breaks after some dialogue ""Esc"" does not consistently bring up the primary game menu Same visual loop as described above occurs to the mayor when entering the clinic Controller does not work when keyboard is shown to choose a name Controller won't highlight a save slot unless mouse hovers over it firstSuggestions: In the inventory menu screen, visually show the active tab for controller users Include an explanation of the save feature Highlight the icons (even without an item equipped) when scrolling through the toolbar using a controller Allow a controller to scroll up and down through the Notebook Add a Quit or Save & Quit feature to the Bed menu Ensure that there won't be any possibilities of corrupt save files or save discontinuities (stated outright in the beginning of the game) Implement Steam Cloud if saving may be problematic Store the save file in a common location as many other games for personal backupsEarly AccessFor those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game mechanics to be missing. With that in mind, I would not recommend purchasing the game at this point in time unless you are able to tolerate minor bugs and an unfinished, yet growing story. However, if you do purchase this game, you will be given a chance to help the developers shape the future of Wild Season. I can at least say that I have enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to see more people get a jump on Wild Season!DisclaimerA copy of this game was provided by the developer: Quickfire Games; however, this did not bias my review in any form.

Early Access Review
								Alright, before you criticize me, I'm giving a bad review in early access because I really really gave this game a chance. I followed up on the forums, gave a bunch of my opinions, reported tons of bugs but after so long I feel I have to give this a negative review (might change in the future).I got this game because I loved Harvest Moon, as probably most of you interested in this game love too. But hold your horses, this is in my opinion, so far, a backward step comparing to HM and the future doesn't look so bright for Wild Season as months since this was released as an Early Access it is still completely unplayable. The developers said even the little story it has in so far will be remade and there isn't anything else to do rather than literaly plant things down.Months in so far and the single biggest thing people have been asking nonstop on forums is the controller support as keyboard controls have gone from horrible to bad. Still no controller support...There is nothing to do around. HM revolves around exploration of a magical and charming town/surroundings full of mystical surprises that slowly the player gets to know and unlock. Wild Season is a big emptyness with nothing to unlock or do during your days. I know this is an early access, but even as an early access you should have things to do, whats the point of releasing an early access if you're still in early alpha with no real gameplay?So basicaly in your very first free day in the game you can explore everything, talk to everyone and still won't even be night time, meaning you will have to go to bed early and all the following days there won't be any point revisiting any of those spots because nothing changes and again, there's literally nothing to do. So you use all your stamina and go rest for the next day.Updates are in such a slow pace, that in order to fix a major bug, it takes at least two weeks (probably more) to be fixed.There is a number of annoying little things you can't get around. The game itself seems very unresponsive and slow, hitbox to interact with NPCs is hard to find, so when an NPC is walking around it's almost a challenge to talk to them, can't read most signs, most NPCs are uninteresting and for me it has been more of a drag than a pleasure to play.So far, comparing to Harvest Moon, a 1999 game, the only progress I noticed were the graphics (which comes with tons of problems/bugs), in other aspects, from what I experienced, this is a step backward.This review might seem harsh, but I feel it's my responsibility to make sure developers think twice before releasing completely unplayable games so that they make some $$ and don't really deliver what was promised. So DON'T buy this game until it's fully functional and playable because there is a huge chance you will be disappointed.			"

												I was VERY excited for the realease of this game, as I had been following the game for about a year prior to its release. Sadly, the game has not lived up to its hype. The released game is simply unfinished, unpolished, buggy, and completey not ready to be realeased, even episodically. If the developers had waited until the game was actually complete and ready for release I have faith that I would have different feelings completely about it, and I am disappointed to see how incomplete it is.

												Ok... Forget this title... I got this because it seemed promising at the time, when it wasn't episodic... I liked the concept and I actually enjoyed the writing... but the game (As it stands) is buggy as all hell.... The events/writing/story feels unfinished in this episode... I'm not saying the whole story is unfinished (Which it obvious given it's the 1st episode)... I'm saying the story is unfinished in THIS episode.... It was so promising but it has this feeling like the developers were like: ""Ok, Enough of this... we'll release this as an episode and continue making the game that way."" It feels like a lazy cop out...Save your cash and go buy Stardew Valley... $2 cheeper for A LOT MORE and it's a full title! Also, the game was 98% and top on steam for a while... And guess what, ONE PERSON made Stardew (concept, art, coding, music, etc.... everything)... he did more than this team ever accompolished on this sad little game...			"

												I was able to pay through part of the tutorial then I got the sickle...and wow umm very very bad controls. it says I'm using version 1.01. Now I bought this game shortly after release on steam and just wow. Then I found the controls to be crap and said oh well I will just wait until they are fixed and I decided to play today to see if they are fixed and no. no they are not. Escape does nothing, WASD is used to move, Q not I opens inventory. E picks up items, R puts them into inventory. The hotbar selects tool or deselects it. Space opens up a pop up menu that just leasts to various menus that are extremely easy to access my pressing Q. Left Shift does sprint. Clicking things does nothing, right or left, or middle. Enter does nothing. So after .7 hours of struggling to figure it out I have given up and will check back later to see if any updates are in the making. Graphics are decent for an Indi game and story so far seems decent as well.			"

												There are so many bugs in the game that's it's honestly not even worth playing. I've completely uninstalled it at this point. I understand that it's still in development, but I've played other indev games with less bugs than this. The UI is weird, movements are buggy and sometiems completely unresponsive, you can't do much of anything either. On top of the fact that, if you bought this game during the kickstarter or soon after, you were promsied a full game, not episodes. An episodic farming simulator doesn't even make sense. I've seen gameplay of Stardew Valley and if i could get my money back for Wild Season, I'd absolutely buy Stardew Valley instead.So yeah, if you're looking for a farming game, I'd reccomend Stardew Valley or just go play Harvest Moon.

Early Access Review
								I am a big fan of Harvest Moon, so when I found out about this game I was hyped. I got my beta copy for review purpose, and went onto my journey of Wild Season. If you are not familiar with the concept of Wild Season, it is all about the farm life and having a social and love life next to it. Maintain your land, plant seeds, water your plants and harvest. Trying to earn some money, socialize with the townspeople (and of course potential mates), cook, watch tv, play with the farm animals like chicken, cows and a horse. Or just go on an adventure deep into the woods to find yourself some special herbs, to use for cooking. A recipe for a lot of hours of well spend fun if you ask me.The developers express that this is a beta game, so it was to be expected that it is full of bugs. Some of these bugs really make it hard to enjoy this game at the time. However, I am eagerly waiting for some of these bugs to be fixed so I WILL enjoy this game, because trust me, this game has great potential and I for one am looking forward when it will be released out of beta.I will adjust and rewrite my review, when the hardest bugs are fixed.PROS+ Harvest Moon Clone.+ Cheerful and cute music and graphics.+ Enjoyable storyline.+ You can play a boy or a girl.+ Stereotypical and funny NPC's.+ Friendly and helpful developers.CONS- Bugs that make the game hard to play at this time.

Early Access Review
								Options:Standard, nothing special.Controlls can be rebinded but it seems there some problem when trying to rebind them back to their default levels, the system not responsive and the game stuck for a bit without changing the wanted key or changing it with a delay. most notably the W key.Bugs:First entering the game the W key didnt work. Esc didnt give me any option menu. Alt+f4 to start over.I messed up the W key so reseted it back to default.It seems that the ESC menu doesnt work at the ""prologue"" of the game, from the point you get the farm all work fine.When choosing between options the controlls not that responsive.When going on a tour in the town, in the inn there is a bug when the waitress calls the inn keeper.And the same bug when going to the clinic.It takes time for the key to register in the game, like to plow or water the crop. making the game less responsive.About the game:The art style is anime like, so anyone familiar with that style will love the game.The controlls are meant to play the game without the mouse, need some time figuring it all, but its not that hard. Also the notebook menu needs a mouse what make it less interactive overall, switching between the 2 methods.The game is basicly farmvile RPG, You have a farm you got in some shady village and you climb your way to be approved by the people in the village and making the best damn farm ever.I played for 3 hours, and I will play even more. the story well built and the characters have their depth.The only problem with the gameplay is controls and responsivness of actions taken in the game/dialog skiping. So if the developers address this issue first hand and fix it, the game is awesome. "

Early Access Review
								Early access games always involve a gamble with your money; even with the reduced price tag, it is with great regret that Wild Season remains unenjoyable if not completely unplayable in its current state. While Wild Season may strike as a mere pastiche of the acclaimed Harvest Moon games at first, there is enough potential here to create the same addictive experience which made its forebears so popular. The graphical presentation is cute enough, but in a more imaginative approach to the genre the backdrop teases a more sinister backbone with its setting and characters.Unfortunately Wild Season is bedecked with far too many bugs, glitches and control issues to sustain any length of playing time. For those reasons alone, on top of the somewhat demanding fee, Wild Season cannot be recommended. The positive, however, is that the developers communicate often with customers: they display tireless dedication with their continuous updates, with many of the player feedback being immediately acknowledged and applied in quick fashion. The overall vision of Wild Season is assuredly fun if the developers can iron out the kinks and continue to work towards filling in the major blanks missing in this early access version.			"

Early Access Review
								Sad to say, this is the first negative review I have ever written. Hopefully my last.I want to preface this by saying that I'm an absolute Harvest Moon FANatic. I own nearly all of them, and spent an obscene chunk of my life playing them.I've always wanted to have a Harvest Moon game on PC as I have a ridiculous amount of consoles and handhelds just trying to keep up with this series of games.I also want to say that I have very high hopes for Wild Season. I seriously, truly do. But that being said this attempt at bringing a Harvest Moon game to the PC has serious issues that forbid me from recommending this attempt to anyone.First, the development seems very lackluster and uninspired. Even now the development cycle is going to longer and longer delays in producing any tangible work.The developers spend most of their time touring around touting the game, but spend very little time ON the game. Their twitch feeds spend the bulk of their time also either just talking about the places they've visited or other games, such as the last one where they spent more time talking about how much they wanted to play Cities Skyline then any interest in the development of their own game.They're a small indie group trying to charge a Triple A price for a concept in which they have little to no apparent interest in developing, prefering rather to use their current  barely functional mock-up to boastfully party down on the convention circuit. Just where is the money that the backers really going for?I truly do hope that a good Harvest Moon game does come to the PC, and I honestly do hope that Wild Season, Stardew Valley and World's Dawn does finally break the curse of failed attempts to bring a HM game to PC.But currently, with the slowing development, erratic developer interest, and money flowing to everything EXCEPT game development I can not, in good faith, recommend this project to any of my fellow Harvest Moon fanatics.

												3 strikes this game is out. I bought this when it came out, and today I have made my third, and final, attempt at playing it. I know people often bemoan idiotic or frugle things with video games, but this game it literally unplayable. Yea you can access a bit, and play around abit (f you don't mind things like characters flying off the screen etc), but this feels like a demo, not a game.  Sad to say, but this situation reminds me a lot of Godus. Example: Wild Season has implemented the need for advanced tools since the inception, but still have not seen fit to provide the player with said tools so you are left with boulders and tree stumps throughout your farm. Also a watering can that only does one spot at a time, and there are easily 40 seeds plots, which means 9 spaces per seed plot... that is 360 clicks just for watering... don't buy this until they actually turn it into a game.

Early Access Review
 Disclaimer: A key was provided for me to beta test the game and write an honest review I would like to apologize for my previous review, to those who aren’t satisfied with it and to those who doesn’t agree to what I wrote. After spending more time with this game, and figuring out a few stuffs, including how the save system works I’ve decided to revise my review, and hopefully this will correct my previous mistakes. Plot  – The story starts slow, it does take time before you see how it unfolds. The first part is quite too long for an introduction, you’ll be reading many dialogue lines before you could get your hands on the game and start playing. You can see notification on the right that you have completed a quest, but there is no actual UI that shows what your quest was or what your current one is. But there is a journal that shows your progress instead. So far as I’ve noticed, there is an event or happening at least once each day. So other than taking care of your farm, you’ll have something to look forward to the next day.There are times that the people you have met in town before, will no longer remember you once you talked to them again, therefore resetting the conversation. Graphics and Sounds  - The game was made in Unity, and so far it isn't that heavy in terms of graphics. My laptop can handle the game, but there are some noticeable lags and fps drops at some points of the game. Graphical errors also appear during conversations, i.e. an NPC goes through a wall or an NPC cannot be seen physically but they do have a dialogue. I’m not sure if it’s intentional that you can go through the NPCs, but it does take time trying to chase the NPC you’re trying to talk to. There are also invisible blocks that don’t let you pass through on the edges near the exit of the map. BThe game starts with a nostalgic soundtrack, for me it reminds me of the game I used to play on my GBA. It is a nice addition that a different soundtrack plays on different areas, but other than that, I suggest that they add an ambient sound as that would make players more comfortable rather than just having a music playing over and over again. Environment and Design  – The game may look like a mobile game, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad one. The areas are well designed, enough clutter so that it doesn’t feel flat or too boring in the eyes. Probably one way to improve this, is allow the players to inspect the objects in front of them and maybe just show a dialogue or description about that specific object. On the world map, I think there should be a label to see what area that is. And maybe add some signs on how to get there, because I personally had a hard time going to the port. I didn’t know that there is a passage on the east side of the town.  But other than that, I think the areas are placed ideally. Gameplay  – It’s the game that I’ve been wanting to have on Steam, a casual game that allows you to manage a farm where you can grow some crops, take care of farm animals, do fishing, and as well as mining. And then it also comes with a story, where you get to meet the people who live nearby and participate in different yearly events.  Controls  – The control option states the action keys, but it does not tell what it exactly does in-game. At first, you’ll probably press all keys to figure out its function.  The game also has a delay on registering the keys you’ve pressed, specifically on menus and when doing tasks on your farm i.e. tilling, watering, harvesting, picking up, etc. And with the gameplay this game offers, it is probably the best to play this game using a controller. Conclusion  – Sure, this game has its downs but nonetheless it is still a great game. Besides the game is still in Early Access, and so far, the developer has been very active on the discussion boards. Even if you’re not amused of how the game looks right now, I hope you stay tuned and be updated with upcoming changes.And for me, a few polishes and fixes this can turn out a very great game.    "

Early Access Review
								Got a free key for beta testing and reviewing. Wild season is basically a farm game with some sim aspects thrown in there. There's a rather mysterious story to keep things moving together, which works alright.While this is not particularly my kind of game, it does it's best to keep you hooked and you can see right away that the developer has put a lot of effort into it. It's still absolutely filled with bugs, but as long as the game stays in early access, I don't think that's something to be upset about.I kinda liked the art style they are going for. It's somewhat reminiscent of those older flash games you used to play when you were young, with a bit of JRPG anime and portable console nostalgia thrown into the mix.Music sets the mood just fine and the sound effects are on point. Animation quality is somewhat above your standard indie JRPG quality, but nothing to be exited about (bugs really bother here right now).Right now I've seen quite a few things that definitely need to addressed on the way, and as this kind of games only work with constant playtime and player progression, I can't recommend to throw in your game time hours just yet.Still, as a whole, I think fans of the genre will be pleased to have this on PC once it's finished and achieves the console-like quality it's clear it's aiming for. It will definitely have it's place at the steam store if it ultimately gets there, so thumbs up for the dev and the hard work that awaits!Final veredict: Wait for early access to end if you expect the full experience right from the start. Buy now if you wish to support the idea and help the developer get it just right. Not sure about the price though, I would wait for good a sale.			"

												This gaming company has failed to deliver on its promises, the change to having ""episodes"" appears to be nothing but a cash grab. The producers of this game did nothing but prey upon the good will of gamers who like the farming genre. Only buy this game if you want to waste your money, wile it is not the worst game on steam, It is one amoung many that are a clear waste of money. My reason for writing this is simple, to warn off others from playing this.In contrast, if you want to play a well made farming sim game in the Harvest Moon Style, I recomend Stardew Vally, which I have also written a review for, a review that goes into more depth then this one, because that game is worth it, unlike this one.

								Wild Season is a pretty interesting game.  I enjoy sim games and this is very good.  I really like how the story is told when you obtain the farm, but hasn't been worked on in years.  The tutorials are great too as they walk you though on how to farm if you haven't played this game. After about 30 min. of playing, my video card driver crashed.  I had the latest drivers for my AMD R9 280x, but had to remove it from crossfire to work.  All in all, I enjoyed the game so far and look forward to continue playing it and building my farm.  Pros:  Great story line, good graphics, fun to play / Removing weeds :)Cons: Video card driver crashed twice.  Changed from Crossfire to Single Video card seems to have resolved issue.  System Specs:Intel Core i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00 GHzRAM: 16 GBOS: Windows 10Video Card: 2x AMD R9 280X Crossfire "

								I like this game so far! Visually it looks like a classic JRPG but in crisp 1080p. I am not a fan of Unity engine but this game definitely looks better than any RPG Maker game I’ve played. Music is nice. Story is nothing to write home about but keeps you entertained. This game is very much a visual novel and farming sim so expect a looot of dialogs and well, farming. As of right now the game is still in early access so expect some glitches here and there but I haven’t experienced any game breaking bugs. Controls feel stiff at times (have to press the button 2-3 times before anything happens). Nothing too annoying though. Developer seems to be very active so hopefully all the issues will be fixed soon. Price feels a bit steep but overall it is a nice little time waster.  "

												Nice game which of course reminds us of Farmville and such.Because its early acces you might encouter bugs here and there however so far it looked nice and looking forward to the rest of the development.Did some horse racing, some mining, fishing and of course the farming bit, as for now im waiting for the carpenter to expand my empire.I had a chat with the dear chap but i dont know how to proceed.Btw i dont think it deserves the full price at this point but seeing its on sale right now who cares.$10 - $15 would be acceptable to me once fully developed.PS,would recommend to buy some chocolate as that will help you farm rubies a lot longer in the mine (needs a nerf lol).Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Quickfire Games "

								- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - ( Note, When I play this more (which I will), this review will change.I understand this is early access and has been for quite some time, I also understand bugs/glitches are always going to be there.I've been there the whole way through the greenlight, and I was so excited I could actually play it via steam.I'm deeply inlove with harvest moon, always have been, always will be, this is based off harvest moon, therefor i'm expecting it to be something quite like it.Overall, it has great potential, and when/if it comes out for 3DS/WiiU/Psvita, I'll also be grabbing it on thus consoles i have. I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro's- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I'm sure i'll have more to add when I've played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed. (JUST BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONS THAN PRO'S, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A BAD GAME)- Spelling Mistakes, such as, On the sign at the farm, 'ax'. ""they're reactions are similar"", The mayor says 'they's instead of they'd ""- overused words( Dear,Gotcha,Getcha ) makes it seem unprofessional when it's there twice a sentence,- not too detailed about the actual things you need to know- walking through doors sideways and not where the door is.( On the mayors tour )- mayor disappears in the General Shop when first meeting- mistaken he/she at the farm when clearly accepted was a she.. and then says she in the next sentence.- ""they're reactions are similar""- random 0 when mayor talks about the animal attacks at the start- few music tunes from harvest moon(friends of mineral town+TreeOfTranquility). - First person to visit the farm repeats before roselyn/jessica shows back up- Massive random line of b when jessica shows the above view of town- sleep and save is glitched, Can't save, - can't sleep ( option comes up, is accepted and then nothing happens )- start is an hour long-  No sound effects ( tools, people, walking etc )- Farm Layout Is basically EXACTLY like Harvest moon ( No Originality )- Turnip Seeds glitching and becoming infinite at the start- Controls are bugged and seem to not work ( Interact Button, even when changed. Also Escape for back comes up with exit option, everytime. )			"

 -This review is based on the early access version-Wild season looks like a promising game as a farming simulator, it may even become the 'Harvest Moon' of the PC once it's completed. The music and art style of the game look great, giving a nostaglic feel for those who have played 'Harvest Moon : Friends of Mineral Town' while giving a professional look to a game that isn't even finished yet. Although the game is still in Early Access, there were some things that hindered the gameplay for me that I would like to address to potential buyers.- The game has no sound effects while in the current alpha version. - Some graphical glitches occur in cutscenes, not game breaking but a little annoying.- The control configuration can be found within the menu upon starting up the game, but never explained in game. A brief control screen would be nice for starting a new game.In the future, I hope to see Wild Season as one of the best farming simulators on PC.			"

Early Access Review
								Having grown up with the Harvest Moon series, this game was right up my alley. Before I mention anything else, I should say that I like that there is support for same-sex relationships (since I'm not straight.)Getting used to PC controls was hard at first, and the default controls are a bit inconvenient, but they can be changed, so that's not an issue. But that's not the fault of the developers.While there is still some missing content (for instance, areas of the map that are inaccessible) I expect them to open up in a later update.Two things I noticed: After saving and exiting the game, the next time I started it up most of the NPCs had forgotten who I was! I had to reintroduce myself to them. Also, my character (a male) is referred to as a female by some of them (another issue I expect to be fixed in a coming update.)Besides that, the nostalgia is real. It reminds me of the older HM games (before the focus seemed to shift) which I really, really like. If you're already into these types of games, get it while it's discounted.			"

								I'm finding this to be a relaxing and enjoyable game so far. The story is slow to start, dialogue heavy and surprisingly intriguing. All is not what it seems on this lonely farm...The landscapes and artwork are beatifully drawn and very nice to take in. A lot of effort has been put into creating detail in the backgrounds and prety much every aspect of the presentation, which is also very nice.There is a lot to do from day to day, but the activities are of the relaxing kind, so don't expect anything too exciting.The quest log could be a bit more informative, especially during the early stages when you can't really do any farming/activities yet and there are no hints as to what you should be doing. I think an explanation of where and when to manually save would be useful too. I didn't encounter any major bugs, but I needed to press the keys many many times before dialog boxes with the leaves would advance. The only other glitches I came across were the occasional piece of dialog appearing two or three times instead of once, and the mayor who came in and out of the door 25 times while introducing himself. I'm not complaining about that last one, it was pure entertainment!			"

Early Access Review
								I've hardly gotten through the tutorial and it is already very clear how unfinished this game it. Glitched animations, misspelled/missing words, and the list goes on. This, however, is an early access title, which makes these issue completely reasonable. The game is generally enjoyable but suffers severely from a lack of of one important feature. There is no option (that I can find) to change the speed of, or skip, the dialogue. This would be much less of an issue if there wasn't such a huge amount of it! So far I know that  all of the townspeople are hiding something  , based on the fact that they talk and talk and TALK while telling me absolutely nothing! For me personally, this means that when the game updates and my save files are broken (which is expected and completely understandable), I most likely will not be playing the game again due to the absurd amount of time it takes to complete the intro/tutorial. The good thing about all of this dialogue is the are that goes with it. Each character has their own portrait with varying expressions based on what is being said, in addition to emote bubbles of characters' heads are they move around int he world.The gameplay is enjoyable, and has a very Harvest Moon/ Rune Factory vibe. I look forward to seeing how the skill and combat systems work.In short, this is a fun game with beautiful art, fun gameplay, and a lot of potential, but suffers from a lengthy tutorial that can't be skipped. I would only recommend buying this game if you're willing to take the chance on early access and will enjoy playing the game as it is now.			"

Early Access Review
								Wild Season is quite a neat little game, and has a lot of potential once the small errors are fixed, of which there are many. For example, the controls are different from a lot of other games, and are not explained at any point, so it's quite tough figuring them out. Also, often certain keys become unresponsive for a period of time. Other bugs include me getting the Welcome to Bedford Valley achievement whenever I enter a room, and people having a conversation with ""William"" in the general store but him not actually appearing in game (I'm not sure if that's a bug or if he was just speaking from another room, but when he did appear he was walking through walls)I am aware that the developers are working on fixing these bugs and it's good to see they are actively working on the game.Now onto the gameplay - from what I have played so far, the game has quite a good storyline. However, conversations with people at the beginning (when you are meeting everybody) take quite a while and leave you sitting pressing the RMB constantly for quite a while. The game has quite a nice concept - you've /accidentally/ bought a derelict farm and have to fix it up and start a buisness (at least that's what i can figure out)The music is interesting, but the loop is quite short and gets repetitive after a while. The art style is neat, and I've found the game similar to Animal Crossing in many ways, although in animal crossing you aren't required to become a farmer.Overall, it's an enjoyable game. I wouldn't really recommend it at it's current price, but I haven't seen the whole game yet, it may have much more to offer. If it's on sale for less than £10, I'd recommend you pick it up.			"

												---I received this game from the developer in order to review it. You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---I want to start out by saying Yes I know this game is in early access. It feels very much like an snes rpg. Music is about what you'd expect and graphics the same.  It has an interesting little story and the controls are ok. The downside is that much like a previous reviewer ""Mooji"" noted, there are areas where npc's are getting stuck in doors and maybe an option to save could be added a little earlier on in the tutorial (unless I just didn't know how to do so???). The price is a little more than I would pay for a title like this but if the developers continue to update and add new features (multiplayer would be cool), then I would say pick it up during a sale and enjoy. Again please take into consideration this is a review for an early access game. While reading other reviews it seems the developers are updating frequently and plan to make this a great title with many new features.Edit: Seems the way to save early is by pressing J facing the bed in your home. Don't know if it was just added or was always there but this is good to know!			"

When the game begins you are presented to one of the best aspects of this game, people can hate you! Yes it's not like harvest that every body is at love with you, so you have to work very hard and I'm now imaging all the possibilits this can turn to. Also this gives you that felling "" Ok you hate me? I Will you show how good of a farmer i can get""The map is big, really big and there is a lot of things. I will try to explore it more and learn a lote before the oficial launch of the game.If you like harvest moon like me, you MUST buy this game!			"

Early Access Review
								Wild Season is a story-centric farming simulator with a lot of potential. You just invested all your money into the purchase of a farm which turns out to be not quite what you expected, in a town full of people who clearly do not want you around. You now have to try and restore the farm while figuring out why the community is so hostile towards you.The art style is well-done and reminiscent of classic jRPG titles. The sprites and characters are beautifully drawn. The music is nice and suits the game very well. Sound effects are also decent and get the job done.There is a good number of NPCs and locations to visit, friends to be made as well as people trying to convince you to leave town.The pace of the game is quite slow and while it's okay when working on your farm, people who aren't fans of visual novels will probably be put off by the lengthy dialogues sequences. Between the intro and the tutorial, it will take you over 30 minutes before you can actually start to play on a new game. While it does a good job of setting the back story, this should definitely be reworked to get the player into the game sooner. (You can bypass most of it with the Quick Start menu option, but then you don't get to choose your character's name and characteristics.)At the time of writing this review, the game is still in early access and a lot of bugs are currently present in the game as well as large chunks of contents missing. Interactions with other NPCs are limited and they don't remember your past conversations between sessions. There's a lot of features mentioned at some point in the game that don't seem to be implemented yet. Also, saving the game doesn't always seem to work so you need to double check if you don't want to have to revert to the last auto-save. The developers appear to be active and are adding depth to the game and fixing bugs, so it look like it's headed in the right way.Controls currently feel very disconnected. Using the keyboard and mouse doesn't quite feel right, yet when playing with a controller it doesn't feel very responsive. Plus, not everything is currently mapped to the controller so I end up going back and forth between the keyboard and mouse  and the controller. Some actions, like closing an inventory window are mapped to the same button as using the tools, so you often end up spending energy needlessly by swinging your tools around when you simply want to close a dialog.Overall the game is nice and, with the right tweaking, can really evolve into something worth playing. Right now, I can only recommend this game if you want to support the developer and don't mind playing it in it's unfinished state. The price tag for this game seems quite steep for what you're currently getting and even for the final product, I would expect the sweet spot for a game like this to be around the $20 mark.			"

The ones i found more notable are not introducing the Key Mapings during the beggining of the game, i couldn't find the pause menu in-game (tried common keys, nothing), but yeah, the game itself looks pretty good to me.One thing i noticed was the mouse, it's pretty simple, but it's appearance makes you think that everywhere you click something will happen, a little popup, a conversation, etc.Dunno if it's already an ideia, but on my first time in the farm's chicken house i wanted to click on the display on the right and on the poster to see ""some lore"" but nothing, dunno if you are planning to add some story to random objects about the past of te farm, or just tips about farming, but it would be cool.For a Early Access game, i would give a 7/10			"

												In it's current state, Wild Season is far too unstable and frustrating to play.It's a competent farming game, with some really fun characters that I would love to know more about... but the mechanisms in place to plant my crops and court my waifus just aren't up to snuff.Some of the design choices are extremely questionable (Locked grid planting? With no option to toggle it on or off?),  and some really important features are missing from the current version that really make me scratch my head... but it's still playable.I'll come back to this one when there's a major update, because I really want to see what the devs can do with its latent potential.

								The Game is really Buggy. The controls don't really work. Characters forget who you are.The game seems to be in very early stages, but yet they charge you 32.99 USD for the game... they keep saying it's on sale- it isn't.I would not waste my time with it.I've played the game for almost 6 hours. All I've accomplished is a few rows of vegetables- because it's so darn hard to use the controls and most of the game is a narrative novel- mostly. "

								I've always been a fan of Harvest Moon, so naturally I would be interested in this game. There are a lot of bugs and some  one of which caused me to start my game over. My Charactors house becomes black space at some point, My tools  vanish from their slots along with the shipping bin.Love the game and the way the story is building and the lively charactors which do set this game apart from harvest moon.Overall I am excited to see how things progress for this fun engaging game.

Early Access Review
								This is an incredibly nicely done out game if you're a fan of harvest moon and games of that ilk! However, this game is still early access, and it is not without the bugs that early access typically has. Even with these bugs, the game has frequent updates and the devs are very responsive/involved with the community via forums and social media outlets. I strongly recommend this if you go into this full knowing that you will have some errors from time to time, even save file ruining ones. In terms of gameplay, it is also not without its faults. Maybe it'd feel a lot smoother for someone who is using a gamepad, i'm not sure ! But as someone who is playing this game with (mostly) a keyboard & mouse, changing keybindings is virtually inevitable. Though in my opinion, that shouldn't deter you from all the other strengths this game has to offer ! The characters are very nicely written out with interactive dialogue, it has some mechanics (that i wont mention for spoilers) I haven't seen in farming simulators yet, and the music/map layouts gives a nice jab of nostalgia for veteran harvest moon players (:			"

								Not sure how I feel about this game yet. Just started and I find the townspeople very suspicous. Also at the start of the game I could find no way to quit the game hmmm.Now as for the farm, the first thing I can see is that they have taken a lot of inspiration from harvest moon, which is awesome. Unfortunatly though as although it felt very harvest moon like, the farm itself was very jaring with how tiny and wierd everything is. Hopefuly the game mechanics are fine (haven't got that far yet), as all it means then is tweeking the farm to make it feel more friendly and not some zoomed out lifeless landscape. Funny I say lifeless considering the condition you find your farm in, in harvest moon, yet despite that the farm always felt full of life. With a little luck this game will feel just as awesome ^_^			"

												After putting about 4 hours into Wild Season, I have to say I am pleased. It is a very easy going farming sim with a lot of depth and extra things to do to keep you busy (I have hardly scratched the surface). The gameplay is smooth and maybe a little bit repetitive but i suspect you get that with most farming sims ;) It has a large variety of crops to plant, as well as trees and animals, fishing, cooking, mining and horse racing. I'm glad it isnt time based like other flash farming sims. It also seems to have a story to it :DThe music is nice enough, though I would prefer more tracks rather than the one on loop, There are several bugs, though none are game breaking (small graphics glitches and the occasional pathing issue) and it is lacking any tutorial on the mechanics, so there is a slight learning curve. The controls were pretty clunky, though the gamepad works great. The artwork is cute and easy to look at.I will definitely be putting more time into this one!Edit - It seems game saves don't remember who you have met, or what part of the story/quest you were in. Game breaking, so beware :PEdit 2 - Save games have been fixed!			"

								I received this game as a gift.That said, I'm quite impressed with the game so far, it has a nice menu, I completely remapped my controls and that worked out just fine. There's only 1 resolution option, but the menu for it is there so I'm guessing that they will add more options later. I liked that the game worked fine in both full screen and windowed mode, there are so many little unity engine games on steam that go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥if you try to alt tab and this one is not one of them. (Hell Hearthstone doesn't alt tab properly, so Blizzard could learn a thing or two)The Engine of the game is very cute and pleasant, and so is the background music.I like that the game is not just about spam farming and harvesting so it isn't just a farmville clone on steam, there are other interactions with people in town, and a bit of a story going on.The story and npc interaction is very J-RPG like and is fluid, though maybe a bit wordy, there was a funny little glitch when I spammed an action button to go ahead, and an npc called Barry or something kept going in and out of a door real fast, but I did not encounter any other mishaps.So I loved everything so far, the menu was great, everything was responsive and I like the look of the game and the soundtrack. Here's where I encountered the first little negative thing. When you're actually farming, tilling, removing obstructions, the game controls are a little less smooth, you have to be in the exact right spot to do things, you have to aim very carefully and might miss a few times, that is not a huge deal in general, but considering you will need to spam actions and do a lot of repetitive plantings etc. it could get a little frustrating.In General as an EA game it's very polished, and I would highly recommend it for people who like these little filler games. This is a review after playing for a somewhat short time, I have gone through the tutorials and done some basic things in the game, so I haven't yet gone in depth, I may update this review in the future and flesh it out some more.Pros.-Nice look-Good background music-Plenty of contentCons.-have to aim actions very minutely, easy to miss target, can get frustrating at times7/10 "

								Wild Season is a refreshing take on the farming RPG (think Harvest Moon), with an intriguing story and loveable characters. Normally I only play games with a strong narrative aspect, so the original Harvest Moon games, while fun to me when I was younger, were somewhat difficult for me to stick with because they couldn't hold my interest for long periods of time. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Wild Season does have an overarching mystery story--I bought the farm and moved into the town like normal, BUT, from the beginning it was pretty clear that a lot of people were UNHAPPY about the fact that I moved in. Some of them even asked me outright to leave, which only makes me more interested to find out what it is they're all hiding! Even so, a lot of the characters are really fun to interact with, and have their own unique personalities and ways of speaking. The dialogue definitely doesn't suffer from the usual cliches, so I enjoyed talking to everyone I encountered.The art and the animation is great; everything looks super clear, and is the HD quality we deserve from a 2D game in this decade. I wasn't able to test all of the features yet, but my farming ventures seemed to go fine, and so did the couple of times I tried fishing. Although I did encounter both major and minor bugs from time to time, from what I've seen, the devs are constantly releasing updates to fix them, and they also respond quickly to questions! The game is in Early Access and still unfinished, but even so, I'm happy with what I've experienced so far, and I'll be waiting on tenterhooks for the full release. Kudos to the developers; keep it up!			"

								If you can get past a few little irks that the game has it's really enjoyable. There's an interesting story, and the farm management is solid. There's very few options for this type of game on PC, and Wild Season does it well. It definitely needs more work, but with time it could be a great game. The game has a little bit of an issue with the controls, the defaul mapping isn't ideal (however, it can be changed) and it's a little unusual how you have to hold down the key for a little longer than you'd instinctively expect. I've encountered a few minor bugs, but nothing game breaking. There's a few other annoyances, like some animations lasting a little bit too long.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes this genre of game. However, the game is in Early Access and is not finished yet. This is definitely noticable, so if you're the type that would rather wait for a game to be fully polished and complete then grab it in the future. If you're willing to give it a go right now, and can get past the things mentioned above, you should find it an enjoyable experience.			"

								This game is pretty decent if you are into the VN and Harvest Moon style games. In the beginning of the game you get acclamated to the stores, your farm, and other folks you can talk to in town. They also provide a decent tutoriol to get you started as well. The graphics are done well and the music isn't bad either. There are some bugs, but the ones I encountered were minor, like certain NPCs getting stuck in a door and such. Overall for an early access game the developers seem to have some good polish in the game already. I am hopeful that they will continue to squash the bugs and make the game even greater.			"

Sometimes the controls randomly stop working, sometimes you start walking on top of everything. Sometimes the menu stops and you need to force close the game.

												First of all, I can't clearly say that I'm a huge admirer of farming/grinding games, so my impressions might not convey what I actually felt while playing this. Still, I was quite surprised to see how many possibilities are there, and can certainly say that one won't get bored soon enough and will find some in-game activity to enjoy with. Wild Season is still in Early Access phase, so of course, you can expect some ""issues"" which can slightly distort gaming experience. Although, so far I haven't met anything critical which would affect the session. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that once I was a witness to the bug whether characters were continuously going through the door, sort of being stuck there, but dialogues went just fine, so it wasn't a real problem. It cannot be denied that I actually loved artwork and character portraits which, being a cliche to mention, still feel really nicely done and look rather lively. However, I think that some of used assets could be sharper, while some can say they seem a bit blurry. Same goes for the fonts, and perhaps dialogue windows as well. You won't find a lot of witty dialogues, but they can't be referred as ""fillers like"" or blank, just to be, too. Town and its outskirts are big enough, so there is a lot of place for you to hang around. Although, there is only one jiggle melody playing for each location, and I must say, you may not feel satisfied while listening for it over and over again. The only noticeable flaw I've met is the quite distracting beginning of the game. Not by a matter of the story, but mostly for its unhelpful introductory part. You are following numerous cutscenes and dialogues, but don't get explained what it is for and whether you should do ""this"" or ""that"". Tasks-to-do keep appearing in the right corner of the screen, but there doesn't seem to be any quest log, so you could check whatever activity you should be doing. Also, short controls guide would come very handy, as you may change buttons for actions, but nothing tells you what each action does. You may not even learn that you can save the progress unless you go next to a bed in your house and randomly press ""J"" on it. Also, some commands like toggling of ""running mode"" aren't listed at all, so you might take a time to figure that it goes by ""R"". Meantime, I would really love to be able to use my mouse instead of a keyboard for some activities. since you have to handle both left and right of letters keyboard while still controlling the mouse for dragging items and some other things. In addition, sometimes it's required to press action button twice in order to perform something, and skipping dialogues with a button doesn't work very well. Long story short, while not covering all aspects of Wild Season and not advancing too far in the story, I've tried to shed some light on it. If you are a fan of Harvest Moon and acknowledged with words such as farming/gathering not only in real life but in-game as well, you might want to try out this project and maybe find it addictive enough to play on a regular basis. Otherwise, you may prefer waiting for a sale, and for a game to meet further development. Still, despite some minor [for me] issues, WS has a lot of potential and with necessary effort and polishing it can certainly become one of a few gems you rarely meet this time, not a big one, but one which is absolutely worth meeting with. --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ""Delight gauge"" of this game - ... 63%  --- ""Entertaining, relaxing and intriguing story which starts from a young man willing to start it whole over, overcoming life like obstacles, evil intentions of other residents and lots, lots of annoying weeds and ends with a story you create by your own hands. Sometimes lacking and revolting, but an overally decent game you might want to try, or even fall in love with."" ---  "

Early Access Review
First Impressions ReviewStory: The story seems very nice so far. You play as an inexperienced farm owner, living in a town full of people who are polite, but strangely cold and standoffish.  Why do the townsfolk distrust and dislike you so much? Will they help you with your farm, despite their feelings and your lack of experience?  Will you be able to do this on your own if they don't help? The story is well written, and more than enough to make me want to keep playing.  But there's just so...much...dialogue....   The dialogue text appears on the screen slowly, and I read fast. With no option to speed up the dialogue or skip parts of it, getting through the game's opening can feel like a real chore.  There is however a quick start option, so you can skip the opening scenes completely and go straight to the game.Gameplay: It's mostly the typical farm sim stuff:  You plant crops, raise animals, clean up your farm and do other management type chores.  Fans of the genre will feel right at home here, and newcomers will be able to get into it easily.  The tutorials can be a bit wordy, but most game tutorials have that problem, and it's not as bad as many.  I haven't run into any major glitches yet.Graphics and Sound: The graphics are very cute, colorful and 16bit-looking. They fit with the gameplay and story very well, and bring in a huge nostalgia factor, for me at least. I feel like I'm playing a Game Boy Advance or SNES again. The music fits too:  Simple, relaxing tunes that make you feel like you're living a country life. Controls: I played using a mouse and keyboard, and the controls seem to work well enough.  I did have one pretty frustrating issue:  I started playing in windowed mode, and after going through a good 40 minutes of story, I figured out that about half of the controls weren't working.  I restarted (quickplay this time) in fullscreen, and everything worked fine.Menu Options: The game has the option to raise and lower the volume for music and SFX.  You can also change between a few resolutions and play in full screen or windowed.  Some more resolution options might be nice, but I can't think of much else you'd need for a game like this. Again, I hope they add an option to speed up text for dialogue.  Slowly reading through the opening scenes can be a little painful.Early Access Notes: Wild Season is currently an Early Access game, meaning there will be bugs and glitches, your save file may or may not get wiped at some point, and things may not always work the way they should.  This is true for ALL early access games!  Sadly, there will be people who buy the game on a whim without understanding what early access is, and give a negative review based on things the devs haven't gotten around to implementing or fixing yet.  Please don't be one of those people!  You should only buy this game if you enjoy the genre, want to support the project, are willing to put up with glitches, and are interested in providing polite feedback and helpful criticism. Early access is for patient and understanding gamers.Rating: I won't give a rating on Wild Season yet, since it's an early access game and any rating would likely change based on how the game changes.  I will say that's it's a fun little farming sim with cute graphics, good gameplay, nice music and a entertaining story. There are glitches here and there, probably even some that I haven't seen yet. But looking around, I've found that the devs respond quickly to community posts, and there are updates on a fairly regular basis. More than that, I feel like there's a lot of love and hard work being put into this game, and in my opinion, the effort is worth supporting.			"

Early Access Review
								Wild Season is Harvest Moon style Farming Simulation with some Visual Novel thrown in and lots of other things to do. It uses nicely done 16bit style graphics and good music fitting the genre.I was nicely hooked into the story here which is not always a great part in these kind of games but here it really stood out. Also there are lots of activities you can do with lots to explore and NPC's to talk to. As i reviewed this in Early Access (9.11.2015) i have to tell you that if you are looking to buy this game now and just play i will not recommend it this early on, because lots of bugs you will encounter in this game. Most horrendous are the controls right now among with glitches in animation, gameplay, etc. which will reduce much of the gameplay experience. I would say wait for the final release.But if you know what Early Access really means and want to get on it seems like developers are responding pretty regularly to posts in discussions and multiple fixes have been rolling out pretty steady so far and i would envision that this game will be one of the better Farming Simulators / Harvest Moon Clones when done.I will bring thumbs up to this game because it really has potential and as it is in Early Access i really cannot put bugs at fault in review as bugs are going to be fixed and game expanded. I will revisit my review on later stages and see how the game has progressed.			"

Early Access Review
								It was with GREAT excitement that I purchased Wild Season, a huge fan of the Harvest moon game Friends of mineral town I was ecstatic to find a game to carry on its legacy.Before I continue I must say I am well aware this is early access, however the comments in my review will reflect that.The Pro   1) Cute Art Style   2) Interesting GamePlay reminiscent of Harvest Moon series   3) Plot which actually had me wanting to know more.   4) Really good character design.   5) Great concept for a game (as Harvest moons success has shown us previously)The Con1)Over priced for the type of title it is, IMHO I would have gladly paid £15, but for the lack of polish £24.99 is a little high.2)The Controls were terrible, I have played close to 500 titles and I would say the controls here were in the top ten worst, they sadly just didnt feel responsive, i felt like i was controlling a tank vs a little farming sprite!I really hope the Dev team look again at the control system before launch and make it more responsive, for as it stands I doubt I could ever play it for more than a few moments.http://bromwyneth.com/wild-season-wanted-to-love-it/ "

Early Access Review
								This game has serious potential but it needs more time. Pros: + Decent story line: You move to a town, and for once not everyone likes you. And it's clear there is a reason for it. It makes you want to know and keep playing. + Graphics are cute.+ Music is alright. Cons: - Many bugs and glitches. I had problems doing the simplest of tasks. Even basic gaming things.- Controls take a bit to get used to- Not sure how far the story goes, but from the last patch it doesn't seem very far. Conclusion: I am looking forward to seeing where this is going and I really hope I didn't waste my money on this. I love Harvest Moon and really want to see this game do well. But as of right now, I have to give it a thumbs down.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is a JRPG with farming elements. I was very pleasantly suprised by the way the developers have transformed a classic in a farming simulator. + Better sound than some JRPGs nowadays+ Good character introduction+ Extensive and rich gameplay+ Has many features- Bugs - invisible characters and for some reason I cannot get the menu to work- Character creation could have been better- It's hard do skip some unnecessary dialogues- Save feature? - PricePersonal Rating: 6/10It's a great game with alot of potential but It's still in Early Access so its expected not to be 100% operational. I recommend the game because I believe the game is worth playing once the bugs are fixed.			"

												Until more updates and patches are applied, I hate to say hold off. I love the Harvest Moon series and even just picked up Stories of Seasons for the 3DS. I purchesed this hoping for a PC one I can play either at home or on the laptop while on the go, but as soon as I launch the game, the main menu comes up, and everything seems fine, but I can't do anything. Mouse, game pad, keyboard....Nothing works! For $30, I'd like to play something, even if its buggy or choppy, but to be able to do nothing isn't right. Tried ajusting the settings as intructed to beta, but even after the updates, still fails to respond. I'm hoping the game is patched and updated soon so I can enjoy it. I have high hopes for it!.Update! 11/27/2015Ok, full release, and I can now play. Good start. A bit slow response, but controller supported and sound seems to be there. Music ok. Went through the menu's, options and the like are ok. Started game, again, a bit touchy, but all in all, going ok. Speeding up now, I get to start playing, saved my game, which also is touchy but works, and step outside to start first full day. I meet the guy that will be picking up what I ship and offers to show me how to farm. I have a sickle and a hoe with some seeds now. I do the first part, but when the secound part comes up, he gives me a hoe...which now is no longer in my inventory. So in short, can't complete the totorial. So I reload and try to skip it, but once again, when he hands me the tools that I can use, the hoe once again vanishes from use/inventory. Can't farm, when the most important tool, the hoe, is not avalible, makes things kind of hard ha ha. Still, as said, the game is a bit choppy, but does seem like it'll hold promise like the old SNES Harvest Moon with some updated art work. Currently sits at ver 1.0, and I've sent the developer some notes, so hopefully they look into them. I'll update again when the game is patched...soon I hope ha ha.			"

												Early Access Review, 11/4/15Short Version:  A storycentric farming game that seems like it could be fun in the end, but is still too buggy/unpolished in the current Early Access state to really be so now.  I would give a sideways thumb if I could.Rather than just another flash/facebook farming game, Wild Season is a farming sim with a VN hook. The filler gameplay is much of what you'd expect from a Farming Sim (clearing, planting, expanding, etc), but the storyline adds a reason to continue and grow.  Even as you strive to build up your dusty little rock of a farm into a glowing field of green, much of the focus is on exploring the mysteriously isolated town you have suddenly found yourself a part of. All in all, Wild Season is a game with promise, but is the very definition of 'Early Access' - multiple bugs are readily apparent (as of 11/4/15) so only buy at this time if you want to support the devs, contribute to the game's progress, or try it out early while builds become more solid.  Current Bugs/Issues:  There are some graphical hitches with character text alternating speeds and animations repeating strangely (characters dashing in-and-out of closed doors several times before they enter), along with various other gameplay bugs. Additionally, the controls still need a great deal of love - it seems to want to be controller-friendly (and given the 3/4 overhead classic rpg feel, it should be), but many controls are not intuitive or simply do not work without a keyboard and mouse - the 9 hotkeys and menus for instance. However, the mouse/keyboard don't feel quite right either, with movement issues and action delays, so you seem to need 4 hands to use all three inputs at once.  Targeting plots on your farm is also a bit of a chore, and character text does not always respond to a button push, which immediately breaks immersion (and makes the many text-boxes in the long intro rather painful to get through).In the end, Wild Season might be worth a go - but ONLY if you can tolerate early, still-glitchy builds (especially at the current $16 price point, which is high for an unpolished game).  Judging it as a released product, I have to give a thumbs down, but the devs seem to be actively fixing reported bugs and other issues every week, and listening to all feedback given. So, the game may be worth it eventually, but if you want to buy a finished, product to enjoy fully now, you should probably wait until forum topics and recent reviews can confirm a complete, relatively bug-free experience.Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												I was a funder for the Kickstarter (Dec 2013) at a tier that should include music, backgrounds, and a forum badge, in addition to the game. I experienced some of the alpha, and really liked where it was going. Things have improved a great deal with regards to GUI inventory/tool management, but I'm still seeing some bugs and things, and while it's out of Early Access, it functionally still remains incomplete.Of note, the following:There's two menus, the main menu that allows you access to a quickplay or story-mode, and the menu you can interact with when you're in the middle of gameplay (by pressing ESC). The in-game menu does not include save/load capabilities. From what I've read, you can only access your saves from the character's bed, and I haven't figured out how to interact with that yet. (***SAVING SHOULD BE IN THE PAUSE MENU.***)The basic controls have given people a lot of trouble, both with the defaults (WASD, but then some random key choices for other important movements) and with their capabilities. You can't access the ESC or controls throughout an extremely long introduction (I say introduction because any tutorial function actually comes the following day, and because the player is thrust into the world without a functional tutorial!), but encounter situations (like, perhaps, wanting to save in the middle of the very long introduction?) where you might want to reference those key-pairings. Additionally, some players have mentioned things like selections not registering. It didn't want to allow me to select a birthday for my character, for example, and took two or three tries to actually get a season and date in. Additionally, although the icon pointed to the summer, it still logged it as a spring birthday. Players also mention that selections like naming your farm, picking out the character's blood type, things like that will revert back to pre-established settings. Also of note, you can click a lot of different things to bring up the same mega-menu of inventory/journal/character information, but you can only advance the dialogue with one key. Visual novels will allow you several choices, including mouse-click, spacebar, and enter-key, but here, you only have one option.You don't get all the tools immediately, and it doesn't give you a lot of hinting about when, where, and how you might receive those tools. The boards are your friend here. Despite this, the tutorial character is pretty insistent on your first day that you plant all the seeds you've been given, and since your seeds want to plant in 9 plots at a time, you're effectively losing those seeds to unviable ground since only one spot actually allows you to access all 9 plots on that first day. That tutorial character was the first and only tutorial character I met. Another handed me a fishing rod and worms, but no information on how to catch fish. You can purchase a cook book from a third character, but I haven't seen how you put food together. Once that initial teaching has been given, they disappear off again with their secrets, so good luck remembering.Space-bar is ambiguously examine, but not everything can be examined. There are no clues on how to pick up food or eat it. I expect when the character is given a gift of breakfast that it might perk their stamina up; instead the plate was thrown into the middle of the table and rendered inaccessible. The character then accepted a tour around the town, and when they returned, the pancakes were gone. Someone had broken into the character's house and stolen the uneaten gift pancakes. I mean, that's what I assume happened. I kind of hoped that leaving the house might prompt the universal laws to nudge that plate over and make it accessible for a second attempt, but the character suffers from extraordinarily short arms, an effect, I believe, of birth defect.Load and lag were fairly long for something that has such simple assets. Pauses in the middle of dialogue, or vague side-scenes about 'THEY REALLY BOUGHT THE FARM' served to extend the introduction even longer than felt comfortable, and again, without the option of saving progress. Characters emoting at each other through floating icon balloons also served to extend things out longer and unnaturally.Doorways are super particular on how to enter and exit. Oftentimes, I have to back up and take a running start at them. The door will move, but the character will bounce off an invisible barrier and have to go looking for the right way to approach the open doorway. The characters will glide all over instead of walking. NPCs will dash across your farm and through the village, making tracking them down a display of your finest hunter-gatherer instincts. There's an unusual amount of fonts/font-diversity, and the font-sizes for descriptions and inventory are a little on the smaller end of things, comparative to the rest of the text. And my character got stuck fishing.Despite all this, I'm really glad to see how far they've come, and I expect things will clear those up and give this much more polish in future updates. Accessibility is their most recent drive, and while I can only rate this as mediocre at the moment, I know they're going to improve. For the price, I'll give them that opportunity.			"

												I probably played this way too little to give a review. The game looks similar to the first Harvest Moon game, I haven't played the newer ones. You are running a farm. Plant crops and sell them.The tutorial was a bit vague, the tutorial just told me to do stuff, but didn't tell how.  The game crashed on me when I quit the game, which caused that my progress was lost with it :/Currently I wouldn't recommend it if it the crashing is a known issueDisclaimer: Source of consideration: Quickfire Games "

								Borderline unplayable.The graphics stutter and lag terribly.  I wasn't running any of my tools to check my FPS but I would estimate something like 10-12 just walking around the farmhouse.  It got worse out in the fields.  All this is on a box I use to play games like Skyrim and Saints Row 4 with no lag and medium/high graphics settings.I use a wired XBOX 360 controller for my PC and I did not see any options to configure or choose it in the menus.I hope that this improves with time, because I'm a big fan of Harvest Moon games in general and the art style here is cute, but I can't recommend anyone spending more than $5 on the game in this state.

I lost my data and decided to try it again and made it about 5-10 mins in and then I went to my inventory and the menu got stuck and would not let me close it.

												First, this IS an Early Access Game, so there is some small bugs here and there, the developer does patch these bugs every so often, which is super great!So far I liked the storyline, it seems like everybody to hate me equally much.Sometime in the story, I was asked if I wanted to sell my farm, and I said yes just so see what would happened and guess what! Game Over! (I found this quite hilarious, because the first thing I thought, was that selling the farm would not be an option)I really enjoyed and found those options to answer in the game quite funny from time to time.As many others said, it is a bit like Harvest Moon, and if you did like Harvest Moon, you should def. pick this game up.There are still as I said in the beginning some bugs here and there, but it has not been something affecting me that much so far.One thing I’d like to see though, would be a small adjustments to the controls and a maybe an introduction, to the controls to the different basic stuff, (J,K etc.)I personally wouldn’t pay the normal 28€ price for the game quite yet, but I find the discounted price quite fair.Anyway, great work so far, keep up the work!Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Quickfire Games "

I hope it doesn't let us down and go into a completely different game or possibly a Stardew Valley clone (Which i havent played, but I can tell I prefer Wild Season more) With  news coming out more frequently it seems hopeful.

												Snooze Fest 2015Ok, first of all this game took way too long to get started. Way too much introduction to get even started with the virtual farming lol. I tried really hard to like the game and I even hoped that the game was fully controller supported, but trying to get by all the text with the controller made it wonky and I felt pressing the CRTL button was much faster. Another thing is where is the exit game option at? I was trying to locate that and that didnt seem to pop up at all. The set up in the game is nice and I really wanted to like it, but its way too slow for me and virtual farming isnt my cup of tea. I even started falling asleep listening to the dull music. I was hoping for a RPG action aspect in there somewhere. I'm more of an action/adventure/rpg kinda guy anyways.Disclaimer: Source of consideration: Quickfire Games "

But for people to compair this to HM and them complain that this is notgood enough is just stupid in my book when this game was made for player to buy in and suppport the idea behind the game , if you can not understand the words early access or pre-alpha then find something else to buy , HM is from a company that has had year to impove their games: But If you want a framing/dateing sim that takes it roots from HM this is the game for youFor a Group that is working hard tomake and impove their work as the game goes is impressive.the game has and old school feel with a new school heart. if you read this hole wind up thanks and enjoy the game .

Early Access Review
								Being a huge fan of tycoon games and other games that involve some sort of business management, Wild Season immediately interested me. It reminds me of Harvest Moon which is a good thing since those games are amazing. Despite Wild Season currently being only available via Early Access, I can already tell from the little that I have played, that this game is very ambitious and will go very far. Not only does it give you a farm to manage with a quirky back story, but it also includes other various activities around the town for you interact with. In my opinion this gives the town a vibrant atmosphere and makes things feel alive. You are not just limited to a game that revolves around repetitive farming duties like most other similar titles in the genre. You will meet several NPCs around town, all with their own unique personalities and there is also potential for you to meet a person of interest and develop a relationship. A couple negatives at the moment are the slightly laggy control of the character inventory menu when selecting items and also the character you play seem to move quite inaccurately. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to save the game as well. Such is the nature of Early Access games so I am sure all these minor issues will be fixed as development continues. I am now eagerly awaiting its final release as I can see this becoming one of those addictive games that I get engrossed with on a daily basis. I definitely recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
Disclaimer: played during Early Access with a review copyI like it, but just not enough to recommend it. First impressions of the game were pretty good; the start screen has a smooth look and there is calm background music. The introduction and beginning of the story nearly hooked me, but there was slightly too much repetition with some of the dialogue.   Options + Controls The options menu is simple and clean; you can change the sound, and rebind the key controls. While in-game, you can't access the options menu until you receive an item from a NPC. This is a nice idea, but not really user-friendly. The NPCs teach you the basics, but you have to figure out for yourself which buttons to press. It would be nice to be able to move your character around or interact with objects using your mouse, because the controls can sometimes be slightly annoying.  BugsCame across a few visual bugs, such as the weather staying grim throughout a couple of summer days,  sometimes NPCs glitch in and out of the doorways, and the response time while fishing is too slow to get a proper result.   Other Problems ...There are some things that you would expect to be able to do or interact with, but can't. Like being able to place chopped wood where there's an image of a wood pile. Being able to adjust the text speed would also be nice; I accidentally clicked on a few dialogue options when skipping text. PriceEven with the Early Access discount, I can't help but feel that the price is too high. 3 hours into the game, and I don't feel engaged enough with the story or gameplay to recommend any of my friends to buy it.   My overall impressions of Wild Season is kind of average. It is in early access, so maybe there will still be features added later on. I want to recommend it, but at the same time I want to shake it like a cassette tape. I'll probably put more time into it, but for now, it's a hit and miss.			"

Early Access Review
								As an avid, long time fan of the Harvest Moon games I've been excited to play Wild Season. I'm only a few hours in, and I'm already more invested in the story and characters than I ever have in harvest moon games. The gameplay is also more rewarding and less grueling. It has all the makings of an amazing farming rpg.  I did however,  run into many bugs including one that I haven't been able to play on from. For example: often characters who I've meet and interacted with on several occasions will seemingly forget we've ever even met. My chickens don't do anything and I have no way of checking their stats. I can't figure out how to get upgrades from the carpenter. My primary task button never seems to work I have to press it an average of 10 times before I can even speak to someone, etc etc. The bug that broke the game for me was the quest, (SPOILERS!!!!!!!)when I had to ask people about the doctor's disappearance. After I'd ask, the screen would go black and stay that way and I'd be forced to load an earlier save. Also I couldn't get passed the quest when you help Panca search Ponco's room. Nothing in his room would trigger a progression in the quest.I'm really looking to play this game after a few more updates. I'm sure once it's playable it will be worth the money I spent on it!			"

								Review based on Early Access 11/6/15ConceptFirst of all i like the concept of the game which is indeed a bit like Harvast Moon. Didn´t play long enough yet to go through all content but there seems a lot to do. Off course you have your farm but also a town with quite a few locations, horse racing-betting and for so far I´ve seen a nice story and lot´s of npc. Graphics are simple but very nice. Current stateOn the other hand this is an early access build and there are still some things that need polishing.Most anoying is that it looks like keys are not always responding. Maybe it´s just me not standing exactly in the right position, but if it´s mentioned in some other reviews i hope the devs will look after it.Other point is that you have to click a lot during conversations with npc's to get to the next page. It hapen't me quite a few times i clicked to fast and skipped the screen were i had to choose a response without knowing which option i had chosen. Maybe the devs kan think of something smart to prevent this.Also i hope steam achivements will be added in the future.ConclusionNice promising game for everyone who loves farming games. At this moment I think asking price is (even with EA discount) to high for it's current state. But it's well worth to put on your wishlist and pick it up when development is a little further.			"

Early Access Review
								Wild Season is a game with a ton of potential. It does a lot of things well, but there is still a lot of work to be done. There aren't many games in its category, so I am happy the developers took the opportunity to make this game.You start off creating your character. An introduction video tells you who you are, someone who can't find a job. So you decide to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere and start a new life. On your way there you crash your car. Luckily, someone's there to save you and you wake up in the remote town you were headed.It being in Early Access, there are a lot of problems with the game. But I did find it to be enjoyable during my brief play-through. As I said earlier, a lot is done well. From reading the forums, I have understood that the €28 price mark is a mistake and that the discount price is its 'real' price. I think this game is great, the entire atmosphere of the game is lovely and there is plenty to do already. But you would have to accept that there is still a lot of work to be done. This game is obviously still a work in progress. So for that, I think €15 is stretching it in its current state. If the game gets to be finished, I would definitely recommend it.6/10 (taking into consideration it's still EA). Pros:+ Get to choose to be male or female, name, birthday and even blood type.+ Lovely graphics!+ The musical tracks, albeit monotonous after a while, were very pleasant. I think they fit the game great.+ Some people have complained about a lot of dialogue, which is true there is a lot of it. But this is a story-driven RPG, it's required for a game like this. I personally enjoyed it a lot. The dialogues and jokes were done really well! Whoever did the writing also had a lot of eye for detail.+ The game doesn't hold your hand, there's a lot of self-exploration. I think this is great, because games today all have a baby-sitter function. Don't expect that here!+ During my play-through I felt I had plenty to do. There are a lot of NPCs to interact with, and getting to know better. You can mine for things like ore and diamonds, manage your farm (cut weed, plant seeds, water your plants), and even fishing.+ Has a neat quest log and journal in one. A World Map that I had to use A LOT. An inventory and your character's profile.+ Controls for the keyboard are rebindable.+ There's a toolbar at the bottom of your screen with all of your tools (mining pick, fishing rod, plant seeds, watering can, scythe, hammer and more). The actionbar is binded to numbers so you can equip them without having to go into your inventory.+ Works with a wireless X360 controller. I thought this played a lot better for this type of game than a KB.+ Has a stamina system where actions such as mining, drain your stamina and your character becomes tired. This adds a bit of realism and challenge to the game. You can't just spam actions, there are consequences. Your character expresses his/her exhaustion with animations which are very cute, nice job! Sleeping and food help you restore your stamina back up.+ I like that there's day/night transition, with appropriate crickets sound during night.Cons:- Can't adjust your character's physical appearance, such as hair colour. Would be great if this could be added in the future.- This game REALLY needs a reliable way to speed up text. Whether that's a slider option within the menu (1.5x, 2x etc), or just pressing a button to instantly jump to the end of a conversation bubble. The latter already seems to be in place for the controller. Pressing the A button seems to jump to the end of the bubble? But half the time it just jumps straight to the next bubble, it just doesn't feel reliable enough. Maybe a slider would be a better solution, if pressing a button proves to be too difficult to fine-tune? Or perhaps both, so the players can decide for themselves?- It happens way too often that controls aren't responding, leading me to bashing the different action keys. For example if I want to start a conversation, or simply cut the weed on my land.- Talking about cutting stuff, why after scavenging something do I have to press the action key again to put it into my inventory? I assume it's meant to be a choice whether you want to keep the item or not, but I didn't find any way to discard something straight after scavenging. Now all that happens is me running around with an item over my head until I put it into my inventory.- I feel like the keyboard controls would benefit a lot from the mouse being used more. Also, the game doesn't seem to recognize the mouse cursor that well. For example when saving: http://i.imgur.com/EFPz601.png- I like that with the controller I can use both the stick and the d-pad, how come the same isn't the case for KB with WASD and arrows? I know you can rebind them, but why not just bind both of them? There are, albeit on rare occasion, moments when I'd like to switch between both. I feel there shouldn't be any issue to simply add this to the game.- The controls for the controller aren't very intuitive. With some getting used to, they are certainly usable but I found these specifically to be very annoying: * I couldn't open the main menu, even though start button seems logical. So I had to press ESC on my keyboard instead. * X to go 'back' instead of B? I find that extremely confusing. * LB and RB is used to switch between toolbar items, but within the in-game menus I suddenly have to use LT and RT to switch menus? Some consistency here would be nice.* If I could rebind everything myself it would be fine, but I couldn't find a way to do this for the controller.- Requires a lot of manual saving to continue where you left off, because loading the automatic save made the game unplayable for me. All I would see is a black screen, forcing me to hard-close the game. Loading my manual saves works fine though.- That's why it would also be nice if you could save anywhere, and not just by sleeping in your bed. Saves a lot of travelling back and worth (there's a reason why HM02 was invented you know!).- Meaningless descriptions for the control keys (action1, action2). These really need more meaningful names so you know what you're binding your keys to. Like 'interact' for action1 and 'use item' for action2. These might not be the best either, but it says a lot more than just 'action1'.- A lot of door glitches, sprite models just running back and forth between doors while talking to you. But I assume these are high on the 'to fix' list.- The sound of waves in the port, or on the beach, is making me DEAF. Even when all volumes are set to 0%, the volume doesn't change whatsoever.- I like the addition of the sound of crickets during night, if it weren't for the obvious looping. The looping makes it sound really annoying, I think because it ends so abruptly. I think having a longer track, so the looping doesn't happen every 2 seconds, would help with this.- Didn't notice any other SFX sounds? I would love for there to be a sound when talking to NPCs, like a lot of other old school RPGs. Maybe even for entering buildings (door sound). Why exactly is there an SFX slider?Remarks:* With the keyboard: My character moves faster when sprinting diagonally. I find that this works out pleasantly, because moving around takes a lot of time. But on the controller this does not happen, so I assume it's a bug. I welcome it though.* With the keyboard: My character sprints automatically in the direction I'm holding, even when I release the sprint key. But considering this does not happen with the controller, this has to be a bug. As someone prone to RSI though, I found this to be very helpful, because it relieves stress from my hand. So I hope this can become an actual feature of the game. (Perhaps a controls option with a check mark that says ""hold sprint button"" so people can choose for themselves?)			"

												Provisionally! This is a game with a lot of potential, but it should not have been released out of beta. I recommend it because I have faith that issues will be fixed and improve the gameplay, and the story already has me intrigued.(Hopefully spoiler-free ahead)Alright, I've played through to the end of the episode. Some of the things people have complained about as bugs are more due to to impatience. It *is* possible to clear stumps & boulders; it just takes a while. Chickens *do* produce eggs; you have to actually feed them. Fishing it not bugged, it just takes actual skill. (I didn't buy other animals, so I can't speak to them.)That said, there are bugs, but none I found game breaking. Mostly over- and -undersensitive controls, and shopkeepers who don't like to wait on you (but given that the town doesn't want you there, I see that more as a flavoring feature than a bug :P )Does the game need work? Yes. It currently takes some creative thinking & planning to get your seeds where you want them. There's no way to store lots of lumber & stone for eventually upgrading your farm. However, you can't do that yet anyway, so that's academic. Hopefully that feature comes in the next story update (see: the town wants you out). It's very difficult to make friends, especially if you want to get to know the two 'acceptable' outsiders. (Again, Town. Hates. You. explains a lot in-story.) There are story actions you can do before you do the *other* story action needed to make them count. Smaller features, like the TV and cooking (I think), aren't working yet.It is a lot more difficult than your average Harvest Moon, but I enjoyed that. The story actually kept me guessing on the details of the reveal. And so far, it is more involved than ""take over defunct farm, revive it, find friends & spouse"". At the same time, it has the classic elements of ""take over defunct farm, revive it, (try to) find friends & spouse"". (I'm hoping they add a particular bachelor in a future update.)Let's just say it takes a standard HM template and turns it sideways. For an indie attempt, it's coming along nicely. However, there is currently no playing after the reveal at the end of the episode. If you hate the idea of episodic gameplay or think it's not a good format for this type of game, hold off. If you like the idea of sitting on a cliffhanger, give this one a shot.I, for one, can't wait to see where it goes.8/10 would purchase(KickStarter backer)			"

Early Access Review
								Got this as a beta key.When I first saw the screen shot and little descrition for the game, I was expecting farmville meets RPGMaker. It's too early to tell as I barely got through the intro. The pacing of the game is extremely slow. Part of the reason is development of the back story (the visual novel portion of the game) but also due to the interface being ""clunky"". For reference, I use a 360 controller which is my preference for a game of a more casual nature. It would be nice to be able to do everything with a controller but that's not the case. While movement & menu selection are mapped, navigating the journal is not and also typing your character's name has to be done with the keyboard. So sometime I go back & forth between controller & keyboard. At the moment dialogue progression can be a chore. At times you can fastforward with a press of a button and at other times you sit and wait as if it's timed (a bit too slow for my taste).So far I think the game is okay. It doesn't draw me in as I'd hope. Graphic wise it is comparable to most other games of this genre: characters are cute/cartoon-like. Music is pleasant but could definitely use more variety. Control seems smooth and responsive enough: movement at least.I will edit this review once I get more game time. "

												I only got this to help the genre move on PC after the episode fiasco went from hardly playing it becase I was on pins and needles to see more done so I wouldn't reveal spoilers for my first big playthrough to now going meh, at least this is helping the genre make it to PC. I don't regret buying this but will not recomend this to anyone now a game in the genre that works well is out, don't think I need to say what that game is, but this one I will look at many months from now when they sort it out, till then don't recomend it, take your money to the other games in this genre this no longer is the flagship for the genre, just a good what if it worked game, that has had way too many issues with their publisher and bit off more then they can chew.

								Where to start. Too many buttons that dont make any sense. Im using keyboard because the controller is giving to many issues.Cant seem to exit alot of menus. The Animations seem to take a long time for repeat doings. ( use axe to cut wood. seems to take to long. ect.)Everyone in the game seems to hate me from the start. I could see if they didnt know me. But hate me? Makes me feel unwelcome to the whole game.Game is way to expensive for us to just be bug testers. I feel I should be getting paid to help fix the problems.The map seems confusing, even with the tour im more confused. Plus the tour takes to long.Stick with the Harvest Moon Series. This seems to be along the sames lines, but a cheaper version of the game. Hate to give a bad review I was really excited about the release. Hopefully it will be better on the Vita, but wont be forking up anymore money for disapointment. "

												I think people are being too critical of this game. Personally, I think it is charming and colorful. The characters have interesting personalities--the dialogue is fresh (unlike what can be found in the Harvest Moon games that inspired it). While it DOES have some bugs (e.g. don't get paid for weeds or wood when you ship them), most of them do not detract from the overall appeal that this game has. Some say that an episodic approach is bad, and that is an opinion that I do not share. I say whatever floats the developers metaphorical boat. They have their reasons. o 3 o p.s.......the turnips are adorable. \( ; A ; )/ <3			"

												As of the realese of Episode 1; I can say it was quite disapointing. I am, however, looking forwards to the next episode. I really wish they had fully finished the gameplay aspect prior to rushing the release for Ep. 1. I know it was because they needed funding.. but honestly, a lot of people have decided against this game because of it. The fact that even the carpenter or tool upgrades hasn't been implemented was quite upsetting. Overall, the game does seem to have an okay future, but don't let my review turn youi away. It was an amazing  2 seaons of playtime, despite the bugs. It just needs some good old work.. but the price you pay is definately not worth it.  "

(The real game starts after a 50-60 min. of play)The interface is not bad but it needs improvement imho.I will keep playing for sure and see where it goes...If you catch a good discount and like top/down-RPG style-story driven-farming games (And that is a narrow list.) get this one...

												Okay.Yes. This game went from a Beta/EA release, to an episode release, but it's still VERY unplolished, and I mean things from bugs (I gave Will a gift and he was just so damn happy he spazzed off of the screen, I mean literally his sprite spazzed completely out of the shop and I didn't see him again the rest of the day) to even grammatical and spelling mistakes. And yeah, it sucks from a gaming point of view to only be able to play to a certain point then have to wait for an indefinite time for the next episode just to continue but-With that said-I really enjoyed playing this. It's a nice change from the generic Harvest Moon, tho yes the style is similiar, the story is a complete new expierience. The story is really interesting, and when you find out the secret- tho im sad we have to wait for the next episode- it just makes it that much better and sets it apart from other farming games completely.  Yeah, I was really excited about the same sex marriage/romance option, which isn't implemented in episode 1, but it and other things will be added as the story progresses in other episodes i'm assuming. And also hoping there is like an 'endless/seamless' way to play at some point, if not when all the episodes are out. (Meaning, even after the story, you can continue to play the game)I've read a lot about the price being too steep as well. I bought it when it first was put on steam. So, as far as I know, all the episodes will just be added for me, not having to buy them. The way i've seen/read, this is SORT OF like the 'base' game, and the episodes will just expand it (More story, more areas, etc). So if you can't justify the price, think of it like that. Base games are always higher than expansions.So the cons aren't the best, but I do believe the it's a GOOD game as is, and it has an epic amount of potential with the next episodes, as well as fixing some bugs with this one, to be a GREAT game.Overall, I personally think it's worth it. It's got a long way to go, and I know it's being worked on as quick as it can (I'm also hoping it's finished or the episodes release in a decent amount of time, not 5-6 months in between, i'm eager to find out more about the story and do other things in the game as well), but i'm happy with my purchase.Also, my first real review so i'm sorry it's all over the damn place. Just kinda upset me people were giving it a lot of hate, given the circumstances, when I think it's good. o-(*^*)-o			"

Early Access Review
								Wild Season is a very difficult game to give a yes or no reccommendation to at the current state the game is in. The game has to be one of the most fun RPG maker games I've ever played and is truly impressive considering it was made using that platform. On the other hand there are so many bugs and issues with the game that it is hard to reccommend it at the moment. Some of these issues can be forgived as the game is in early access, but it seems as though the developer should have fixed some of these problems before putting it up on Steam. Pros- Amazing visual style and graphic design. Honestly, the visuals are probably the best part about this game.- Very familiar ""Harvest Moon"" style gameplay.- Fairly interesting story.- Developer appears to be working to fix issues and bugs.Cons- Insane amount of bugs (Often I'd find myself walking through walls and other people, cutscenes glitching out, etc.)- Wonky Controls (For example, the only way to save is by pressing ""J"" while facing foward in a bed. Planting crops is also difficult alot of the time as a result of these controls.) - Very Dialouge Heavy at beginning of game. Takes about an hour or so to get into any real gameplay. - High Cost (Even while it is on sale at the moment for $16.49. For the regular cost of $29.99, it is even more ridiculous. I mean honestly, go buy Cities: Skylines or something.)- Very Repetitive Music (What little music is in the game is actually pretty good, but it loops wayyyyy to often.)Overall Wild Season is a game that shows a lot of potential, but for the state that the game is in at the moment and the fairly high pricetag I don't believe it is worth your purchase. In the game's current state, I would only reccommend if you have an obession with Harvest Moon, or if it is on extremely high discount.VisGaming Rating- 5/10			"

												I know there is a lot more to come from this game, but already I love it! I go crazy for anything like Harvest Moon, though I do appreciate that this is NOT Harvest Moon, it is a completely separate game and should be critiqued as such. I'll start with what is, by far, my favourite thing about this game. The characters. I REALLY like how unique and different each character is from one and other, I find myself getting more and more invested in them and the story the more I play. I find myself feeling differently about certain characters at various points in the plot, maybe suddenly someones motives become clear or even more clouded, maybe they spoke to you slightly differently and your character picks up on it. There's so much going on in terms of plot and people, which makes it a winner in my book. I do however, have one critisism, as you progress and talk to people they might give you clues about what they, or maybe others, like to receive as gifts, I just wish these clues were a little more obvious, and if there are obvious clues, I haven't seen them just yet. Also, I can't end this part without mentioning how happy I am that the Bachelors (and bachelorettes if you roll that way) are so much more age appropriate than in the HM games, I know that you never really get given any ages in HM but just the fact that they LOOK older, it makes my little heart so happy!Now, I suppose I COULD comment on plot but, honestly, I don't really want to; mostly because I'm still experiencing it for myself but it's also hard to give an honest review of the plot, in my opinion, unless you have seen the whole thing in it's entirety. So far, all I can really say about this games plot is that it sucks you in, stick with it, follow the story, and you'll see exactly what I meant when I wrote about the games characters. The only glaring problems, for me, are the bugs and keeping in mind this game is still early access, I have to say, they're not actually THAT bad. I mean there are some that really 'bug' me (not even a little sorry for that) but all in all, none are game breaking and I have yet to encounter any that can't be fixed by a simple save + restart. Yeah it's a pain but it's early access! There is one, however, that I havent been able to solve for myself and that is the issues I've been having with the stores, all (barring the animal, general and now Lilly's store) dont actually seem to be interactable, which is annoying because as it stands, I have no way to recover my stamina. I did have the same bother with Lilly initially but that seems to have corrected itself somehow? All in all, I love this game and if you enjoy Harvest Moon, odds are you will too! I, personally, am enjoying playing it now, as is, BUT don't let the fact that it's not complete put you off, it's a fantastic game with an excellent story and I am addicted!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is greatly inspired by the Harvest Moon series, but it has a different vibe when you play it. It tries to improve on a lot of aspects of the series.Pros:The art style is gorgeous!It is really easy to move around (not so much to perform actions - see cons)Charming story for what I have seen so far.The introduction to the different tools is really well done and intuitive.Cons:The wait time between some dialogues was really long (EG: Very often a character will look in the 4 directions before speaking?) It would be better if it was skippable with a mouse click just like the dialogues.The actions (Expecially the sickle) feels really slow: it's even faster to grab and store weed than cutting it!Bugs:In the discussion at the inn (After visiting the farm and the shop) the characters that were entering the door were passing thru the wall and entering the door over and over again until a key was pressed.The same bug as above happened to the mayor at the entrance door of the clinic.If you position yourself between 2 planted seeds both will be highlighted when holding the watering can, but only one will be watered.Overall it's a fun game, I will play it some more and update this review as I go.

Animation bug on the doors when someone is comming to you(they kinda stuck and repeat the same animation over and over) , hapened in the General store,Inn , and hospital(mayor stucked at antrance for like 10 seconds repeating the entering animation).Too much forced dialog which cannot be skipped.

								I started playing this game AFTER reading other people's reviews and saw alot of people mentioning this game is broken, yata yata yata, but when I started playing, it felt like it was a barebones RPG. There was no initial story or background information (unless you skip that when using quick start) and the characters' names were boring along with the dialogue. The farming part of this game was cool, so I started clearing and planting and watering, etc. but after about 20 minutes of this I'd had enough I couldn't take the music anymore! I mean it sounds great and feels great to play this kind of a game with this kind of music, but it's just one tune on repeat, I did notice when I was exploring different areas had different music on occasion, but it was still just a different tune on repeat. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game just yet. Obviously I will continue to play this game as it updates and will revise my opinion accordingly with changes, this really is a neat game.			"

								Honestly, this game is horrible. It looked like it was going to be great and that it has good potential, but so far there is hardly any story and I can't even farm (the reason i bought the game) because theres a bug that wont let me buy anymore seeds. So basically I'm just running around hoping that story will pop up and the seed merchant will become unbugged. Hope this game gets better in the future...			"

												I haven't got far into the game but I can tell that it does hold a very good amount of promise when it comes to the game play. As of right now there are a lot of bugs that need to be reworked but if you dont mind the whole having to chase down an NPC to get their AI on the right track, the rest is a piece of cake from what I have encountered. I made a quick list of the things that have made me shake my head to the things that I have liked in the game and while I do vote to recommend this game, I cannot say I 100% recommend this game in its current state.Cons:- The NPC AI have them running off the map, its a pain to attempt to catch them- Sometimes you get stuck on the door frames of the house but thats normally caused from sprinting- The stacking system is a bit flawed when it comes to resources but its simply a pain- NPC normally get stuck or you are unable to find them- Fishing is a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ the bar that you need to get into the red area is off but a few seconds so you have an awkward timing. - You cant really tell some of the enterance ways from an exit in town(List will be updated as I play)Pros:- The story makes you wonder at the start, I find it pretty interesting.- It does have a very strong feel linked to Harvest moon.- On a personal level, the graphics are 'cute' to me.- Harvest works for the most part though its a bit awkward to have to not just harvest the plants with your hands.- The days are long letting you have more time to find people and talk to them as well as tend to the farm and animals.- Map is pretty big so lots to explore.( Shall be updated in the future!)

												As someone who was not at all involved with EA or Beta, I'm really enjoying Wild Season so far. It's super cute, there's lots of friends and hopefully romancing possible with the ladies, which is nice :). The story is just interesting enough that I want to keep playing it but it's also spaced out enough that I can keep farming like I want to. I'm also pretty impressed with the actual logic used for the crops, correct seasons, the actual image for them looking accurate (I work in agriculture so that's important to me). I haven't gotten around to the animals yet.I will say there's some little bugs here and there but they don't really affect gameplay that much. Placing seeds is sometimes hard, some people don't end up where they're supposed to be on occasion. Finding things is occasionally annoying but you get used to it. Overall, I'm having a lot of fun and I'd recommend this game.			"

								I highly recommend Wild Season even as an early access game. Setting the bugs aside, I commend the game for its potential. The story is particularly interesting, and I can't wait to see how it goes on from here. The characters are very much alive, and I think the dialogues are well presented. The gameplay is greatly enjoyable as well. I like the features currently included, and once a stable build has been produced, I think it would become even more fun. Oh, and the art! It's one of the strongest point of this game.Downside, well, controls are not as responsive as they should be. Since it's an early access game, it still lacks content.			"

								I had to refund my copy due to this toaster of a computer but here's what I think:1.the story is painful and starts out the game with the town hating my guts. Why would I have any motive to run a damned farm if my suppliers were gnashing their teeth everytime I went into their stores for seeds or something? I'd scrap the car,leave town and then sell the deed to some megacorp like walmart or monsanto and laugh all the way to the bank while the town gets some long overdue scrutiny.2. triggers for cutscenes either went off early or never went off at all. especially when the runt tells you to leave in the beginning.3.I didn't care for the player character models but that's a personal peeve of mine and I won't ding the devs for it.4. a sandbox mode where there's no story and the townsfolk don't all act like they all need to be burned at the stake would just be fine with me.5. Minions! Farming is hard work and would be nice to hire some expendable hired hands to help out with the daily grind! Sending them to do chores or get supplies from the detestable townsfolk would do wonders.6. controls need to be fine tuned and simplified.TLDR:Serious potential in this game but marred by bugs and painful storyline. keep an eye on this game but waait for a sale.

								EDIT: Wow, I'm glad I didn't spend my money on this game. I can't believe they decided to split up what little was there and leave those few that believed in the game without the content they were promised. Now, if they wanted to get the game that they bought, they have to buy it again as ""seasons"". Yeah, great.My review:This game is in a very early state of development and its current price is simply too high. It has, however, a lot of potential in my opinion. In its current state, I was not able to find any way to pause the game, the dialogue and scripted scenes are too long and there is no ""skip"" buttom for dialogues. In fact, I had to do some ""key smashing"" just so I could proceed to the next line of dialogue, as it sometimes just wouldn't work. Pros:- Really nice style (Old-school feel, beautiful world design)- Interesting storyCons:- Price- Unskippable, long dialogue scenes- Lack of real gameplay for the first 20 minutes- The game uses a lot of resources, not well optimized yetAs I've said though, most of these issues are probably due to the early state of development. I sure will come back to the game once it has progressed a bit more to check its progress, as it does have a lot of potential.Disclaimer: I received this game for free for reviewing purposes.			"

												I think that this may be one of my favorate games on steam and I have lost many hours playing it. However there's still a large number of problems with it.Pros This game has an interesting story with interesting and belevable characters lots of likeable people and the main villen shall I say is actually quite intimidating at times especially later.I found myself just wanting to dig deeper into the town's mysteries and why everyone's so darn- peculur. There's a good varaity of different plants you can grow each seasonI wouldn't exactly call this a Harvest Moon clone but it does radiate a very simalar feel with the gameplay and you can tell it's been heavily influenced by that particular franchise. If you love Harvest Moon you will definatly want to give this game a try.Some pretty neat references are hidden away in this game the most obvious is probably the Tardis sitting ouside the doctor's clinic.Lots of potential (potential as this game is still a work in progress)ConsNo instruction for what buttons you can move and interact with items (I almost returned the game due to this but went online and figured it out [a w d s to move, i for inventory, and j k l to use tools and interact with items]) You can't always buy things even when a shop is open unless a specific person is behind the counterYou can't really choose which seeds or saplings go in your slotThe game is buggy and incomplete and the story will be released in ""episodes""This game is really fun and worth playing but can be frustrating at times and you may want to wait till it's on sale to get it. As it unfortunatly is it isn't worth the 17 dollars.			"

												If you ever sat down in class with a computer, an emulator and a rom of harvest  moon then this game is made for you!! Its an absolute rip off of harvest moon and I couldn't be happier.  The game features improved graphics yet a lot of the same game play as HM and i am absolutely loving it so far.  From where I am up to now It looks like there is going to be a bit of a plot twist coming up but who knows! Im recording it and uploading so if your interested in a more indepth playthrough click this link:

			Views: 142		

			Buy this game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/328220/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Thanks for watching!		

And now the pros and cons: Pros: *Insane Nostalgia: Not really a pro for new players but this was the king of them all before Animal Crossing and even           then it held its own, if you EVER played a Harvest Moon and enjoyed it its pretty much a requirement of your childhood to purchase this game.*New Story: Everything I've seen so far actually indicates the same story however none of the town members seem to be happy you've moved in so you can absolutely smell something is coming.Cons:*Weird Audio: If you watch my playthrough you'll see what I mean.  I started with really nice audio, set my name and everything and the next second I couldn't hear myself think.  It was only when I got to the very end of all the text that I could access my settings and that heavenly audio button. *Controls: The Tutorial doesn't actually walk you through what buttons to press.  Its J, K and L just incase your wondering.   I changed mine back to the good old emulator set up of Z, X and C however it doesnt tell you any of this which can be a bit annoying when Frank is giving you the farming tutorial. *Cutscene: This is just my own complaint but at the very beginning I skipped the entire Intro thinking clicking would only go to the next text box.  Call me an idiot but they should change the skip to an actual button or something that says 'Click To Skip'All in all this game is amazing, the developers seem involved with their community and are constantly updatiing.  I am so keen to start growing some chickens and get my horse not to mention try some of the new stuff like Horse Racing!Hope you guys found this review helpful and enjoy my playthrough!Peace!~Proxy			"

Early Access Review
								Excerpt from my blog review on Wild Season: First off, Harv---I mean, Wild Season has a lot of potential. Since it IS in its early stage, Wild Season is plagued by hilariously wonky bugs and glitches in which I actually I had to stop playing it after 3 or 4 days. However, it shares the same addictive qualities as the beloved Harvest Moon games with, of course, its own spin on it. What separates Wild Season's storyline from HM is its dark, suspenseful storyline. When you first start, you'll quickly notice that everyone in this town hates you. While the filler of the game is farming, taking care of animals, etc the storyline keeps you hooked to find out the answers and improve your relationships. Wild Season has done a good job on character development giving each NPC unique, intriguing personalities.One of the unique features of Wild Season is its quest board where NPC's enlist your help by putting up timed errands. Problem is there are just too many bugs and glitches it's almost unplayeable. The funniest glitch that made me laugh was seemingly switching bodies with an NPC in front of me during a quest. Keyboard shortcuts don't register right away so I had to spam a key like 10 times to talk to NPC's.The game needs a bit more polishing before it's truly ready. Moreover, the way the game is right now doesn't justify its absurdly high price of $30. I would ONLY recommend this game if it's on sale.

												I'm a huge fan of harvest moon and i'm so happy to see a game like it finnally come to PC after all these years. The games a lot of fun and very similar to harvest moon and Rune factory if you've played any of those kind of games. The game does have bugs but it's releiving to know that the devs are actually working on this game and getting rid of the bugs to make the game more enjoyable. There are a couple of minor bugs that you might run into but nothing that makes the game ""unplayable"". The ""unplayable"" bugs have already been patched for the most part so you don't have to stress out about that. Currently where the game is right now i would suggest it if you don't mind a couple bugs and just enjoy the aspects of farming in harvest moon like i do.			"

												Why does everyone hate this game? Okay, yeah, the controls are a slight annoyance, but if they're that bad for you, you can remap them. Okay, yeah, I don't always agree with the Episodic format. In some siutations it works others it doesn't. All in all, though... I didn't find it too bad.The few minor glitches I found weren't as game breaking as some would lead you to believe (for me, I had a few instances of things disappearing from my inventory, but upon adding something else to my bags, POOF! it's back). And I never once found the instance of people 'forgetting me'.That being said, there are a few things that do bug me more then others. The collision detection on some things (ore rocks in the mine, the hit locations for your hoe, axe, sickle, hammer and watering can) can be a mild annoyance, but it's not something that takes away from the soul of the game. That soul is - at it's roots - it's the Harvest Moon we've always wanted. I love Harvest Moon and Rune Factory - it's the whole reason I jumped to buy this game, even before seeing the epidosdic format - and I think that the developers honestly love the series as well. It's Harvest Moon taking place in that seedy little town you're not so sure is as 'upstanding' as everyone says.On the whole, I think this game has potential - and even though the 'pay for more content' deal caught me completely off guard as I didn't read much past that it was basically Harvest Moon - I will continue to buy the DLC. Some of you will disagree with me, others will agree, but as I stated before, the heart and soul of the game is there... and it is good. A little bit of elbow grease and some love, and this game has the potential to shine brighter then most of the Harvest Moon games, if you'll excuse my pretentiousness.			"

Early Access Review
								Titlescreen, artwork, and character sprites are all fine. As advertised, the game plays ALOT like a visual novel. The first hour of the game is FILLED with text. Once the setting is established, you finally get to roam around and tend to your farm. (this consists of clearing out the weeds, logs, rocks in your farm. Plowing your farm, adding seeds, and watering crops. Each time you do an action, your energy meter depletes and once it is low enough, you have to sleep, which is a decent mechanic). I like the night and day transitions as well. It is an early access games, so there are a few bugs. The mouse support does not seem to function well. Talking to people sometimes requires you to spam the action button, which is ""J"".I would describe this game as a visual novel with farming, fishing, and horse racing as mini games. This game lacks stimulation which is a worrying trend for visual novel developers due to the Steam refunds. $16.49 is way too expensive for this game.... let alone $30. At the time of this review, games like The Banner Saga are on sale for like $5. I know some people will like this game and I wish there was a neutral button for this review, but I cannot recommend it for everyone. sort of SPOILERS BELOW:---------------------------------------------------------------Haha... the game abruptly ended when I chose to sell the farm. I don't think you should have this option in the game and if you are going to included it, make a proper ending for it. Show what happens.. dont just cut to the title screen. It just seems lazy and only gives off the illusion that decisions matter. With this, the game just ending and the player got a crap ending after reading an hour of text.. they aren't going to feel good about it, so why include this in the game... ?  "

Early Access Review
								I am really enjoying Wild Season so far. I've only played through a bit of it, but I am liking what I see and am happy that I pre-ordered the game.Yes, there are bugs. It's an early access game after all. Don't buy an early access game if you are expecting it to be pristine and bug free. However, the devs of Wild Season are VERY good at acknowledging the problems and fixing them. If you have a problem with the game, submit a bug report and let the devs take care of the rest.I haven't found any game breaking bugs as of yet, just some minor ones that are minorly annoying, but not devastating to my gameplay.I've been wanting a Harvest Moon-like game on the PC for a while now and so far Wild Season is really delivering. I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for us over the coming months.			"

Early Access Review
								I know is Early Access and I want to say that the Game has potential but at its state I can't recommend it to anyone yet. Ok let's start with the Pros and Cons:Pros:-Supports 1080p-Game has potential to be something great-Cute animationsCons:-If you try ""Quick Start"" in-game looks to Dim to play well.-Story for 1hr of Gameplay feels incomplete from start.-I never found a place nor a option to ""Save"" So I lost everything :-/-""ESC"" Button does noting, No menu to exit the game, you have to press windows key and the close it-No tutorials-No Graphics option nor AA, FXAA, Vsync, Full Screen, Full Screen Borderless, Windowed, ONLY have Resolution option and 1080p option is way down, you don't actually see the 1920x1080 Resolution-Game is Not Very Smooth Stutters FPS goes from 60-54 Fps most of the time, and after loading a new town goes to as low as 34 fps and after goes back to 54-60 fps., and I have a quite powerful Gaming Machine. -No voice acting, lots of reading for a 2015 Game-Game still Buggy, others characters gets stuck on doors at times, I admit it is quite funny xD And disconcerting at the same time :=/			"

Early Access Review
								As an avid fan of Harvest Moon (like most of the other reviewers), I was excited to get my hands dirty.  Despite it being in Early Access for over 6 months, it's not as far along as I had hoped.Pros:+  Good character design+  Charming Dialogue+  Decent controller support+  Gender options+  Fitting musical compositionsCons:-  Couldn't complete the tutorial due to possible bug-  People kept entering and exiting rooms during conversations-  Character control needs tweaking (personal preference?)I will definitely be spending more time with Wild Season, but at its current price point it is hard to recommend.  I hope that it turns into a serious Harvest Moon competitor, but it's just not there yet.			"

Early Access Review
								WARNING: This ""review"" is on an EARLY ACCESS game, and should not be taken as a review of the intended final state but rather MY EXPERIENCE with the CURRENT STATE of the game.EDIT: So the controls *DO* work, they are just a little bit laggy at times but not too bad. Controller support however is abismal and causes conflicts with keyboard input, so I suggest just using the keys. The layout is sorta goofy, but it's simple enough to grasp and not specifically bad just different from most games that I've palyed. I'm liking it so far, but for the uninitiated: the first half hour or better will be NOTHING but dialogue. Personally I find this infuruating, as I would rather be abe to skip quickly, or put it all in a cutscene or some kind...that I can also skip. This is a minor complaint however, and if you are a Harvest Moon fan you are probably rolling your eyes right now.[Refer to edit] I've been waiting for this game for a while, but can't even play it because the controls just won't work. I loaded it up, and got all the way to the farm then the inventory opened somehow (don't know what button I pushed, because it wouldn't let me exit the inventory). I pushed every single key on the keyboard and every button on my controller and could not leave the inventory.So I alt-tabbed and killed the game, and relaunched it. Got to the main menu, and now zero input is recognized. Menu music is playing, the cursor isn't hung, but you can't select anything on the menu and the only thing to do is kill it again. I'm about to try again, but so far this seems ike an unacceptable flaw, even for early access.			"

Early Access Review
								I've have been waiting for this game for soooo long and I was so happy when I saw it on here, but I must say I was dissapointed with a few things after playing around an hour; there are quite a few annoying bugs like with cutscenes starting and stopping instantly and I got stuck in the calendar screen once and had no way to get out other than resseting the game which I hadn't saved after going through that long intro. Also the darkness that sets in when nighttime comes was still there on the next day. I really hope there'll be a way to change stuff like the resolution and make it windowed rather than fullscreen because I don't have a very good computer and I would love to play this without having lag. Another I would love to see in the options is the ability to change the controls so that instead of needing to use certain keys I can change them to my preference. (Another thing, my game had no sound at all except for in the title screen but I don't know if that's because it'll come in a later patch or it's a bug ^^; )Apart from all that, I do really like the game; the art style is so beautiful and I really like the story line that's building up. The controls could use a little tweaking but otherswise it's okay. I probably wont play this again until it is fully finished or after a certain patch gets rid of the annoying bugs though.			"

								Loving this game so far. I'm a huge fan of Harvest Moon, Rune Factory and Animal Crossing, and this game shares a lot of the elements that make them so great. The NPCs each have very individual personalities, and I can't wait to make some friends and find a soul-mate ;) The music is also great, it reminds me a lot of the older Harvest Moon games such as Back to Nature.

								back in 2015 I made a review on this game stating how it was the embodyment of ""We will finish it Soon™!"" and it got a lot of downvotes, but here we are today and Im sorry I couldn't tell more people not to waste money on backing this project. Even though it was a game idea we all wanted to see remade, we ended up wasting our money and shortly after a game which did everything that Wild Season had promised us and more got released; here Im obviously talking about Stardew *****.For anybody who has even a stray thought of buying the game now I say ""go use that money on a trip to Wallmart"" what ever you find there is certain to be of more worth than this game.

Early Access Review
								VERY early access game...one of the earliest. The game probably should not be on Steam's EA yet it is so early in development. And for the current asking price? Absolutely not. First off, the player is forced to wait through about 15-20 minutes of forced dialog and linear movement exploration. To be clear, there is NOTHING to do during the first 15-20 mins of the game other than click the dialog forward or move to the next building because you are forced to meet the inhabitants. I've never played a game like that, it lost my attention and interest very quickly as a result.When you finally do get to learning about farming (cleaning up your field), you are told to weed it using your sickle. The problem is, nowhere is it explained how to actually use it (make it work). Clicking Mouse 1 and Mouse 2 does nothing. Nor does spacebar or Enter.  Apparently there are quests to help guide the player through the tutorial, but you cannot access them!  All you see on the side is the title of the quest, most of them using the identical title btw (which prevents them from being anything meaningful). It pops up when it is new and when it is completed. But disappears in between. You have no idea what to do because clicking on them does nothing and there is no Quest Log like there is in 100% of every other game that uses quests as a mechanic.There is no in-game help, no keyboard settings or keybindings to look at. I had to search the forum for the answer, and seemingly, it's the ""K"" key.Once in game, there's no way to exit other than ALT-TAB and close window. ESC does nothing. There is no saving. Plenty of bugs, plenty of non-working gameplay elements, plenty of forced dialog...the devs forgot one of the most important things for a game: fun.  And I had none of it with this game unfortunately. Perhaps when it is further developed it may be different, but as it stands now, I certainly would not recommend this game, especially for the absolutely crazy asking price. There are so many better early access and indie games that are this price or cheaper. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for the current asking price of this game.I don't mind the simple graphics, I don't necessarily mind having NO sound in the game (apparently it's disabled due to bugs, which just furthers my point as to just how early this game is in development, but there needs to at least be some meaningful, working gameplay elements to consider this a game. As of right now, it's merely an interactive e-book.Stay away until it is further developed. It has a long road ahead of it.			"

												I received an Early Access key for testing/review. This applies to v0.7.0.12, which is current as of 10/7/2015.Update 2 (June 2, 2016): I'm switching to negative. I've held off on replaying this game hoping there would be new content to entice me, but it's been nearly 8 months since I first played and patches are still focusing on bugfixes. That isn't a bad thing and better than no patches at all, but it really shows this wasn't ready to leave EA. While they've lowered the price and remarketed the game as episode 1 with promises of future episodes, so you at least get what you pay for, the lack of new episodes since release has left me uncertain of the game's future.--Update (game left EA): I've played a bit since launch and I have to say I'm surprised at how smooth it feels now compared to just a few weeks ago. Player animations are fluid, no more weird flickeriness, controller support was greatly improved but there's still some controller issues with certain menus. I said before that it was apparent it was unfinished and I meant it. When they announced out of nowhere that the game was out of EA I was skeptical at how much they could do in three weeks, but it looks like they really did a lot! When I get the time I'll try to play through again, see if I can get further than before and re-write this review.--I started playing in the afternoon and ended up playing throughout the evening. The artwork is great, sitting in a happy median between high res and retro aesthetic. I enjoyed my time with it, but unfortunately was halted by a bug that hindered my progression. I'll have to reload from earlier to continue. It's definitely a game to look out for, and issues seem to be getting ironed out left and right, but in its current state it might be a bit too buggy to fully enjoy. If you're looking for a polished game then you'll likely want to wait until closer to launch. I look forward to following the progression of this game.What immediately sets it apart from ""just another Harvest Moon clone"" is that it's very story driven. You're the city slicker invading the peaceful little town of Bedford Valley and nearly everyone is weary of you moving in. Every character has a distinct personality, down to their mannerism of speech. You soon learn of the other recent arrival in town, a replacement doctor for the clinic, and the mysterious, perhaps devious event in the town's recent history. Instead of just sleeping the days away after tending to my farm I was interacting with people and attending the town's festivities (which even include horse races that you can wager on). Unfortunately as the mystery was starting to unravel, I ran into the aforementioned bug.It's very rough around the edges in its current state, but playable. When you start the game you're advised that updates to the game will likely render previous saves incompatible, which for a story driven game may be a deal-breaker as you invest time in progressing the plot unlike sandbox or other multiplayer EA games. There are lots of minor issues that make it apparent that this game is beta/EA/unfinished, but very little that actually matters from my time with it. One humorous example was when I got a call from one of the girls while I was harvesting turnips and happened to have one in my hands. We ended up going to the beach, and the whole time I was still holding the turnip over my head.My previous experience with the Harvest Moon franchise is only the SNES game and the heavily-stripped-down-but-almost-the-same GBC version. It's refreshing to play something that's more than just ""grind crops to shower the lady you fancy in gifts so she'll dance with you at the festival and marry you so she'll stand still in your home"". I actually want to know more about Bedford Valley and its residents.			"

												I bought this game late last year and have been waiting for the devs to come out with one decent update and although there have been fairly consistent small updates there's been almost no progress since then. When I play the game now it doesn't feel that much different than it did 10 months ago. I understand there will be bugs and I'm not the type of person to complain about every little bug, but if Episode 1 is supposed to be finished I think most of the bugs should be fixed by now, it's been a long time to be honest. I do like the idea of this game though, I hope the devs can update with some new content sometime soon, but right now I can't reccomend it.			"

												As a Harvest Moon fan I really recommend this game. This is the ""Harvest Moon"" game that I would believe those whove played Friends of Mineral Town and Back to Nature would enjoy. As did Friends of Mineral Town, Wild Season is bringing in all what makes the RPG Farming Simulation genre good and addicting. In its current state it is still heavily buggy and lacking in many areas but judging what I can see in game, I believe it is headed in the right direction. With a bit more polishing and a whole lot more content I would really think this will be one of the best RPG Farming Sim games available.+Great Farming Action   Its not like Farmville or anything like those online clicker games. Its old school RPG Farming. How it should be. Youve got a variation of crops and trees. Using different (hopefully upgradeable) tools you tend to them, from plowing to watering to sowing and eventually selling them for profit. Not only that, you also have a variety farm animals to tend to such as cows and chickens. +Active-Time Farming   Time moves on as you do things in the game and in this certain characters will have their own schedules and  will be found in different differnt places in differet times of the day. As more work is to be done in your farm youll have less time to do other errands like buying seeds, getting your groceries, wooing women and celebrating birthdays.    And when I said birthdays, yes, there are birthdays. Other than an active clock to keep you on your toes, there is also a calander that shows you the season, holidays and events. Most crops only grow on certain seasons so you need to work hard and quick to get the most profit since they wither as the season ends.    Time really adds to the game and makes it more immersive.+Alot of characters   Your Farm is not only the place youll be in for the entirety of the game. Youll get to visit the town and meet the colorful (and friendly?) townspeople. The Townspeople provide you with what you need such as seeds and farm animals, if you have the coin. There are characters that are viable for marriage too.+/-Nice Artstyle   The game has an interesting artstyle similar to that of the old handheld Harvest Moon Games (sort of like RPG makers-esque). That is a cute and colorful and kinda tiny. It does look nice but its honestly nothing we havent seen before. Im sort of hopeful of changes to be had in some areas, like it just feels sort of flat (I know its a 2d game) and lifeless.+/- Decent Soundtrack    Wild Season got it right to get the sound of an anime RPG farming sim but its sort of lacking. Like footstep noises and such. It may sound like a nitpick but things like these and to the immersion and it just sounds sort of really quiet without those. Sometimes the soundtrack repeats cut and the repeat doesnt sound seemless.-Buggy as all hell    As do most Early Access games, Wild Season is really buggy. From messy button inputs to characters that seem to be out of place this is what truly breaks the game. The controls are sometimes unresponsive and characters just bug in and out (sometimes they get stuck in a loop within conversations/cutscenes and you cant progress. -Really expensive    As of the state of the game it does not really justify its hefty price tag. Overall the game is fun but it heavily needs more work. I am excited to see it finished.8/10update: They didnt			"
