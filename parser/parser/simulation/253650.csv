												This game is gorgeous. Let's get that out of the way first- it is absolutely stunning. And with about three hours put into the game and 100% of the achievements obtained, it's a good game for achievement hunters as well. If you're looking for a pretty game to sink a few hours into, then you could do worse than Sparkle 2 Evo, especially when it's on sale. The sound track ranges from the advertised 'relaxing' to 'wasps in eardrum' noises that made me check my speakers, but that may just be a matter of taste.It's in gameplay itself, and execution, where the game could've been great, but turns out to be just mediocre. In the beginning you're presented with the idea that eating certain types of food within the game will change the way your Spark evolves. This could have been very interesting, with different tactics for different branches, but the only difference in the 'food stuffs' is color. So yes, you can eat a non-meat fish. Maybe it's swimming algae. Even with the vivid color scheme, it can be difficult to tell which of the more advanced creatures correspond to which color without some trial and error.Finally there's the 'boss battles'. The bosses do not fight back, and one of them barely moves- victory consists of slowly nipping suicidally-depressed mega-fauna to death. But hey. It's pretty.			"

												Several others have reviewed this game and said it's based on Spore. I presume they are referring to the very first stage of a Spore game which is just a mini-game. To be accurate, Spore (2008) actually copied flow (2006). Flow was originally a free flash game and was part of the creator's masters thesis.Yes, this game is VERY much like the game Flow on the PS3. But it is not the same game nor created by the same people. The mechanics are largely the same but this game goes for a more complex evolution where there's three different kinds of food (instead of 2) and you have to eat a LOT more to increase your creature's size.You get to look at the creature's stats as it grows and guide them by eating different types of food.If you enjoyed Flow you'll very likely enjoy this game. It's graphicsa are very vivid and colorful. It's slow paced with no set time limits or precise goals, so it's good for just chilling out. There's a few flaws like having to hold down the left mouse button constantly but you can use the keyboard to control it. But really it's quite enjoyable, especially if you are into playign zone/chill games "

												This game is very beautiful! It has 2 modes - single player or competition (against the AI). Single player can become boring very fast, because all you do is eat a certain amount of food (orbs) to finish the stage. Competition mode is fun because the AI actually challenges you and you can only go to the next stage if you win against the AI. But it also can become boring very fast, which didn't happen to me considering the game only has 14 stages and 2 of them are specifics to get achievements. The controls are easy enough most of the time. It can be a little frustrating depending on the evolution of your spark, but easy to manage. The game leads you to believe that your spark will evolve in different ways based on the type of food (orbs) you eat. That's not true. Not only the evolution of your spark is the same no matter what you eat, but you can't actually choose what to eat (not in competition mode at least, since you gotta beat the AI). You can choose what to eat in single player (the game only requires you to eat the necessary amount of food of at least one color), but it makes no difference whatsoever. The game is not worth the full price, but for 90% off I say go for it. You get trading cards and 22 achievements in a few hours. I didn't regret buying it. I suggest you watch a video of the gameplay though, just to be sure.			"

												A fun little game that i had a good time playing. Very cheap, so it is expected for it to be short and sweet. You play as a small bug, that swims around picking up elements to evolve yourself. The more you eat, the bigger and more advanced you become. It is worth the cheap price for a short, but decently entertaining experience.For the achievment hunters, it took me a total of about 3 hours to gain 100% achievments.			"

Sparkle 2 Evo is a casual artistic evolution simulator. Start as a microscopic larva and build your way up the food chain as you evolve based on what you eat.Pros: Graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The game captures the transparency of actual microscope observation, while bathing it in a rainbow of colors. Your stats and appearance changes depending on whether you eat carnivore, herbivore or omnivore matter. You get to confront other microbes in a speed and twirl competition, trying to eat out its weak spots while avoiding its head until it's the only thing left. Music is calm and soothing.Cons: There is no behavior difference between your prey: the exact same creatures simply exists with different colors, making you wonder why a herbivore would eat fish, squids or other animals. You can't die, the extent of risk you face is getting pushed back up one level of depth, or getting a light red glow in the screen if you cannot be pushed up any further. Little replay value: there's a set number of levels with no randomization. There is little complexity over your evolution, and you might accidentally eat matter you wanted to avoid.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itThe game might look and sound exquisite, but there is little more to it. A few hours is all it will take to go through the entire game, do every level and max out your evolution. As it stands, Sparkle 2 Evo doesn't offer enough for me to recommend it.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Sparkle's primary draw is its immersion. Graphically it is a simple but gorgeous aquatic landscape, accompanied by a lush ambient electronica track, which changes as the levels change. It offers some incentive to finish the level quickly as the tracks, as ambient music is apt to do, can become somewhat repetitive and tedious. Movement and speed controls via mouse/keyboard are basic and intuitive, though game controller support would have been appreciated. Gameplay itself is very much a rinse and repeat, but the boss levels and species customization are fun. If Forever Entertainment chose to, they could pump in a few more updates and expand the look and feel of biomes, additional music tracks, and co-op options which could really add to the shelf life of a game like this. Still, I was very pleased. Fun game to chill out to, minimal learning curve, immersive environment, and a solid value at its curent price.			"

												The game feels extremely incomplete, a pale copy of spore's first phase while being much more empty and confusing. The ""controlling one's evolution"" part is a big lie, there is no customization. The fights are slow (and you can't get damaged) and the whole game feels painfully repetitive. Graphisms is the only nice part of the game, but cannot hide the emptyness of the game. A big loss of time.			"

												This game is a nice calm, casual evolution simulator. The graphics are amazing and the controls are rather simple, as diablo 3 / Torchlight 2 player I had no problem whatsoever using only my mouse for more accuracy.You are a little sparkle and have to keep eating to evolve, you can evolve 3 different creatures at the same time. Which is alot of fun. The Music is very calming and the graphics are amazing! Spore players might as well like this game as it is the same as in the beginning of spore, only with better graphics and they never go on land.I got this game on Sale for only 49cents. And I think I never had so much fun on a 49cents game. Also for Achievement / Perfect Game hunters: This Game only got 22 Achievements which you can unlock whilst you playing and exploring the game. Therefore It is very easy to get a perfect game in it!For Tradingcards fans: This game has cheap Trading Cards.Either Way I recommend this game for everybody as it is only very cheap and is alot of fun!

												Sparkle 2 Evo is basically a PC version of Fl0w for the PS3. It's exactly the same in that you're a creature that has to work its way up the foodchain by eating food and enemies that are smaller than you. You'll eventually grow bigger allowing you to eat bigger enemies. Like Fl0w you'll be switching back and forward between 'scenes' trying to find where the food is located. Even the graphics are in the same style. You could say it pays homage to the PS3 game but in my opinion it's just a shameless carbon copy of it. But since we PC gamers are lacking a proper Fl0w I guess this will do nicely in the meantime. It's the only reason I'd recommend this really.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												This a great little game, you could say it's one of those hidden gems.Although the playtime isn't that long, the visuals and music is incredible for a game that (most of the time) only costs 1$You play as a small microorganism climbing the evolutionary ladder by eating one of three microelements:-Red which makes your Sparkle (as your species is called) faster and more manouvrable, however at the cost of eating speed.-Blue which makes your sparkle more balanced in the way of movement and eating speed but sadly looking quite uninteresting.-Green which makes your sparkle incredible at eating with the highest eating speed and a skill that makes your mouth about 5x bigger, however it isn't very fast and his turning speed also ins't too great. However the green sparkle is in my opinion the best looking sparkle.As you grow more and more instead of eating stationary microelements you start encountering species, most of which have ways of stopping you eating them often in the form of a slow trap. others take a long time to be fully eaten and until they are they will keep pushing you a level upwards if you touch their head, and others are relatively peaceful but require you to find a way into their body to eat their guts and finally decapitate them.Each stage of evolution your sparkle evolves visually, at first growing longer and developing a type of sac to show you its road to the next level by the size of it, after that it will grow jaws or in the case of the omnivore it will grow even longer, after that evolution truly branches and  every sparkle will go it's own way, i will not spoil this because they look too beautiful to explain.Though the levels are few (there are only 14) there are 2 optional boss battles, The Squid-Worm and the Octury.The Squid-Worm is a large worm that requires you to eat all of his segments before eating his head, not too hard but it looks great and it's a fun way to show yourself how far you've come in your mad dash to become the top species in the sea.The Octury is a humongous octopus that will make you eat all the glowing orbs on it's tentacles before entering it's head and devouring it from the inside out, though -once more not very challenging it's a huge monster that is great to look at in comparison to your little sparkle.This is a great game and if you like Flow or need something relaxing in your library i definitely reccomend you to pick it up, it's very cheap and there are even trading cards to be gained.

												Sparkle 2 Evo is belonging to a series of games with Genesis and Zero, where you're taking the fate of a little sparkle in your hand. Your goal is to make him evolve and reach adulthood. To do that, your little guy can eat microelements, that will determine towards which category he will fall.Indeed, while you don't have any control over the DNA in itself, you can choose to eat only a single kind of element or juggling between them, knowing that when you're leveling up, you can change your form and by doing so use a special ability.You can be a carnivore (by eating red elements) with a sprint as special power, a herbivore, with the possibility of eating elements away from your mouth (for that, you should search green elements) or an omnivore, with a repulsive ability (the blue element will be your best friend).However, through different worlds, you're not alone. You can find octopus, fishes, etc.. that you can eat. They're also belonging to each color: you will find blue, red and green fishes for example. You're generally alone in the world if you choose the casual mode and your goal is to eat one element until none is left. You can choose to continue to explore the rest of the level, which will allow you to level more.But you can also enable the competitive mode, where other sparkles, controlled by the AI, will fight you for dominance. Your only way to win is to ensure that you ate more elements than them. When you win, you can clear the level as in the casual mode.My great regret in that gameplay is that I don't have a real control over DNA. I can't choose the elements I really want. The only way to do it is to eat only the microelements and when you're in competitive mode, you can't really choose to avoid some elements if you don't want the AI to give you time.Also, some enemies tend to swap layers, with a resulting chase being difficult.The graphics are beautiful. You're really in another world, with bright colors. And the soundtrack is really relaxing.  It's fitting to that deep world.Anyway, Sparkle 2 Evo is a game, despite its flaws, that is very entertaining. If you want a total control over your sparkle and have quests, you should orient yourself towards Genesis. If you want just a sparkle without any goal, without any worry about being carnivore/herbivore/omnivore, head for ZERO. However, Evo and Genesis are the best in the series, so, you can purchase it without any problem.			"

												Evolution is a concept that interests me and I'm sure a lot of other gamers. Sparkle 2 Evo looks like it should be the real deal, but sadly, it's nothing more than a glorified game of Hungry Hippos, if you know what I mean. There's very little strategy to it. It's just a race to see who can gobble down the most of one of three different types of nutrients that turn you into a herbivore, a carnivore, or an omnivore. It's not really any kind of fun and the evolution aspect has no depth.			"

												Sequel to Sparkle Zero, this game features new things such as deciding which way to evolve your creature. You have three choices, Herbivore, Carnivore, or Omnivore. Each of these are represented by a colour found inside in the game.Just like Sparkle Zero, this features a evolving system around your creature, that starts out weak and evolves based on what it eats. The original game and the third are as follows..Recommended for some fun and achievements which are super easy to get and cards!			"

												It's a pretty good game. It's also simple to understand: Eat, grow, eat some more, rinse and repeat for all the levels. The difficulty doesn't really increase, but the areas become larger and there are more elements to collect in each level for completion, as well as a larger array of different kinds of life as you progress. You don't die, but there is a ""Competitive mode"" that times you and pits you against other critters (controlled by AI) like yourself, all trying to gather as many resources as fast as possible before time runs out. That mode isn't fun, but I just turn the option off.Overall, I recommend because it's easy and relaxed, and I had fun with it. Only issue is that it's repetitive once you've done it a single time, so nothing really feels new. It's worth buying at discount, but probably not full price.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo's interesting art style at first drew my attention. Upon inspecting the achievements I could not turn down an easy to complete game as an achievement hunter. In the same night that I bought the game, I completed the game 100%  in around 3 hours.During the course of the game I was not sure if I was expecting more or if I was expecting too much. The mechanics of the game were fairly basic and never evolved a whole lot. There were some interesting levels and others felt like they took too long to complete. The use of layers in the game suits it very well and they used that quite effectively at some points while at other times it felt like there should be layers when there weren't any at all.The mechanic of eating is simple and the evolution based off of that feels somewhat lacking. I did not feel like I was ultimately challenged in different ways because of these changes. As such, the level of difficulty was not remotely close to challenging in my experience. At times, I was not even sure exactly on what I supposed to do in some of the boss levels. Even when I did figure it out, it felt like it took unnessesarily long to wait for the boss to be interactable.So was this game worth it for the amount of fun? I don't feel like I wasted my time due to the achievements I decided to get, but I personally feel like something is missing. I'm not sure what that is exactly.			"

												Not worth the price.I downloaded this game not knowing that it was a lousy port from Android and iOS systems. The graphics show that it isn't native to PC and any resolution larger than 800x600 is going to show every pixel. People have described this as ""not a game"". They are right. But unfortunately it isn't great as art either. I bought it for $5 on sale and I don't think it is worth even that much, at least with how they described it. If they listed this as a port and not as an ""artistic non-game"" I might not feel tricked like I do. I don't know what kind of gameplay other's have experienced but I was unable to evolve my creature, and that was the only interesting thing about this game that would have redeemed it. The soundtrack is awful, and I also don't know what kind of people were saying that it was beautiful and entrancing. It's cheap sounding and doesn't sound at all professional on a decent set of speakers (which I'm guessing is due to the upscaling from iOS to Windows). I think I didn't play this game for more than 20 minutes and I'm already tired of it.			"

The graphics very inspiring glowing lighty - like in the movie Abyss. Another goodie is to collect 3 different elements instead of one and bosses are not too easy.

												Actually I don´t really know what I expected. I saw the nice graphics and read something about ""evolution"" and thought ""yep, that sounds like a fun game! "" Maybe I´m the problem because as a biologist I expected somehow something a little more scientific (stupid idea I guess). I hoped there would be a chance of manipulating the genes, and really have an influence on how your organism evolves but all you do is swimming around in a sometimes kind of psychodelic looking environment (with some kind of coral-structure in between) and search for green, blue or red coloured things your organism can eat. Usually after 5 minutes in a level you have to search for them a lot and maybe I´m short tempered but after 10 minutes I think it´s super annoying. Other people might call it relaxing but I see no point in searching forever for dots. Just to do the same thing in the next level again.I´m not saying it´s a bad game but if you want a game where you can DO something, where you can ACTIVELY evolve and influence something ... go look somewhere else and don´t be fooled by the genre-tag ""action""!

												This game looks awesome ... for the first 10 minutes. When you get used to the interesting jelly look, gameplay shows it's evil face and this game is not only boring (just collect color items) but also annoying when you have to swirl around and around and around and up and down - just do get those damn colors. Nope, even the low price is a waste of money for it. Too bad, that the great look is the only thing that might attract people.			"

												Sparkle 2 c'est pas vraiment, vraiment un jeu.C'est plutôt un simulateur d'Homer Simpson, l'humour en moins.Bon ok, c'est joli, c'est poétique et les musiques sont belles.Mais il n'y a aucune profondeur de gameplay. Vous devez juste manger toutes (ou pas) les petites boules de couleurs et les créatures aquatiques.Ne vous laissez pas leurer par le ""choix"" donné de votre régime alimentaire. Être carnivore, herbivore, ou omnivore consistera seulement à manger les animaux de couleur rouge, verte ou bleue.C'est un peu comme si un végétarien refusait de manger des fraises parceque c'est cruel, mais ne serait pas contre un bon steak de croco à l'occasion.Bref Sparkle n'est pas mauvais mais pas forcément bon non plus.Jouez-y si vous voulez vous détendre, ou procurez-vous la bande originale et installez-vous dans le canap' avec un bon bouquin, ce sera tout aussi efficace.L'affreux.

												Great game to waste a few hours on, as you can see from my 5 or so hours on it. It was a good game, but unless I missed something the game lacked a bit of story line. Here's a list of my pros and cons about the game.Pros:- Good time waster- Great Value- Compelling gameplay. (I mean come on! You get to eat things and evolve!)Cons: - As I said before, unless I missed something it lacked storyline.- Levels I think 11 and 12 got a little tedious.Not really Cons:- If you like underwater travel, this game is pretty scary.- I almost crapped myself a few times from randomly being nommed on. - You evolve into things that make you go NOPE!Overall, this game was a solid game. 8/10 would swim around eating giant squids, and going in bellies again.

												If you remember the game Flow, then you know this game already.  You are a small sea creature. In the game I mean, I'm not suggesting that you are actually a small sea creature, unless of course you are, which is just fine too.Um, anyway, what you do as this creature is eat things so that you grow larger and evolve.  There is no danger or risk, you just eat as much as you can before the other creatures do, much like a trip to the buffet at an Overeaters Anonymous convention.The graphics are pretty, fluorescent translucent sea life drifts about, waiting for your ravenous maw, and soothing music, such as is played at the bottom of oceans, gently caresses your ears.  The whole experience is kind of like being at a rave where someone secretly replaced all of the Esctasy wth Valium.  I thouroughly enjoyed this game, short as it may be, even though I've never even attended a rave, taken Valium, or eaten a jellyfish.			"

												This game is a missed opportunity. I really hoped from the looks of it that it would be a souped up version of the Micro-organism stage of ""Spore"" -- which was insanely fun and attractive but not complex enough. Sadly, this game is even less so. There are really only three creatures you can be, and while you ""evolve"", it doesn't seem or feel important. You get bigger. This game could have been so much more. I know the price was a steal, but for as good as it looks it's more sizzle and less steak.			"

												Should you buy this game? Short answer - YesLong answer - This game is simply amazing. From the beautiful graphics to the soundtrack, this game is fun. Sometimes I will just idle in the game and listen to the soundtrack. Sure, it may only take 2 hours to beat with a single character. But you can make a new character and choose different paths to take. You can also play a mode where you are against an AI character. The way I played it was i leaned my chair back, plugged in a gamepad, and relaxed when I was playing. The bad things about this game are there are few levels, and there is blatant looping in the soundtrack. If you are on edge about it, you should definately buy it. 8/10.			"

Just for Relaxing 3 Hours! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I must say I enjoyed playing this ""game"" (I am still not sure if we should call it this way). It started like ""let's just try this one"" and finished about 3 hours later with the very last boss battle. Problem is this game seems like unfinished!You are supposed to ""evolve"" but after playing for 3 hours trying to figure out the way it worked, I gived up. Let's put it very simple: you just collected colored bubbles and if you get a lot of one color your ""animal"" will change its color and shape. That's all. No real evolving. No real challenges.Game is very easy (you cannot die!), music is unobtrusive and the world is colorful (but requires a hell of a PC at the highest setting). So it's easy to get hooked in.But after 2 hours you will still be wondering ""and now? is this still the tutorial?""... Game itself gives you the response: ""this game is supposed to let you pass some time, it has no real objectives"". Looking at the achievements you will also realize that you have just finished it. Well, thanks for your honesty. Since it's honesty time, I'll unistall you right after clicking ""post review"".Best played with X360 Joypad or MouseRecommended Buy Price < 3$Score 6/10 "

												I have purchased this game on the one year anniversary, and 90% off a cheap title was an offer I could not refuse. The game is very fun. It consists of a casual simulation of an evolving life form you control that floats in water and tries to feed itself in order to evolve. The gameplay mechanic is somewhat reminescent of Spore's first stage. The graphics are dreamlike and the art style is impressive, the music sets the ambient rather well and the gameplay concept, although so simple and basic, manages to captivate you for a good few hours. Difficulty wise, the game is incredibly easy but it is meant to be a time-occupier (waster is innapropriate in this context), not a competitive game, although you have that option. While the game is fun, it lacks a few concepts that would have greatly improved it, and it kind of bugs me in a game that is concentrated on evolution: the lack of creature customization, as the creature grows soley based on what type of food you eat, and the lack of an endless mode, where the level is randomly generated. Other than that, it is a great game to spend your ""Im so bored"" time, and though not perfect, a great indie title.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo. The second part of the ""Sparkle-trilogy""; a series of so called ""Evolution simulations"". I own all three included ""games"" and I want to review them all. I have already recommended the first, no, the ""Zeroth"" (don´t know whether this word exists) part, because of it´s epic looks. Previous point is basically the mark of all three games; epic visuals but, well, questionable gameplay. Evo comes up to those too, but with some changes which disturbed me in some ways. So now I am heading to describe the game a little.There are just three aims in Sparkle 2 Evo: Eat, grow, evolve. That´s it. So for this nothing changes. And here comes the publishers´ ""clue"": Competetive mode. Yes, that´s as hillarious as it sounds. You are ""fighting"" against an AI in matches lasting WAY too long. The one eats more stuff ""wins"" and if that´s you, you´ll unlock the next stage, which is basically the same as the previous, just with new colors and soundtracks. Wait, there´s annother way to obtain your progress, next to competetive mode: You can also eat EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF NUTRIENS on the ENTIRE map. Because of the ""innovative"" controls, that are as precise as my aiming in CS:GO, (trust me, you don´t even want to see me using the AWP) that can easily take you 20 minutes of your precious lifetime. Okay, just joking, but not lying. Annother negativ fact are the ""enemies""... They CONTAIN the nutrients you need to win the level, but there´s always just one way to get them. And if you fail by half a visual milimeter, you´ll be pushed into annother layer of the ""Abyss"" (that´s what the game-world is called) over and over again... Unfortunately your AI oponnent has better luck with that.The only two things GOOD about this game are the visuals, as usual, and the fact you get the soundtrack for free. It´s not a extraordinary good one but at least a nice deal to compensate the EULA, which only says ""No EULA, just have fun""...Is there really need to discuss about this anymore?What I had almost forgotten to mention is, that Sparkle 2 was developed by other guys as Sparkle 3 and Zero were. They didn´t do a bad job (in relation to the other two games) but they also didn´t really make it better. As for normal, achievements are gained by progress and evolution isn´t only useless but also it does only depend on what color the food you eat has. Yeah, pretty much like in the other games. Sincerely, Titanic21; 21th December 2016; 9:12 pm; CET. (Just don´t take me too serious as for this review. My opinion is honest, but the rest is not.)			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is a casual game. You are an ocean dwelling creature. You eat and grow. There are basically 3 colors of food. Which color you consume the most will determine the type of creature you'll become:- red (carnivore)  => you'll move fast but eat slowly- green (herbivore) => you'll eat fast but move slowly- blue (omnivore) => medium movement speed and medium eating speedAt first red, green and blue blobs just float in the ocean and you eat them to practice the movement of your creature. In later levels, you'll encounter other sea creatures in a variety of shapes but basically you always need to stay away from their head (or they will push you away) until you've eaten what parts of their body you can eat, and then go in for the kill by eating their head. You can play the game in two modes: competitive mode (default) or 'casual mode'. I strongly suggest leaving competitive mode on and only switching it off if you find the game too hard, which isn't very likely. You see, the game gets pretty easy once you figured out how it works. You start at the top layer' of the ocean. You will see radar 'pings' in red, green or blue telling you in which direction there is food of that color. When you don't see any pings anymore, you go down to the next layer and look at your screen for radar pings. Again you hunt and eat until you don't see any pings anymore, then you go down to next layer and so on. If you want, you can focus (more) on one type of food to become your preferred creature type (carnivore, herbivore or omnivore) but in my opinion that is something better left for casual mode because in competitive mode, it's better to just eat everything you find.The graphics are very nice. The music is very subtle and fitting. The Steam Achievements are easy to complete (you'll most likely complete them before you complete the game, unless you happened to miss something). It's a nice game to play for a few hours but don't expect something it's not. Don't expect a twitchy action game or a puzzle-like game that will challenge you for dozens of hours. If the game looks like something you might enjoy, I recommend giving it a go, especially if it's on sale.			"

												This game is a weird mix of the early stages of Spore and flOw from the PS3 were you play a creature that evolves by eating different coloured orbs and you move on from stage to stage buy eating enough of them and improving on your creature. Mostly played in the games casual mode and when doing that the games really goes super casual and was an alright passtime while listen to podcasts and music. For me it was never more then a timewaster.Most achievements will be thrown at you for simply progressing and the only stuff that will take some extra focus is beating the two bosses in the game and both of them are things you simply can't fail on...you just need to spend enough time on them to figure out how to beat them.

It is a great concept using very old and unoriginal gaming techniques to create a slightly newer more psychedelic experience.

												Looks better than it plays.You can either choose normal mode, which lets you win the levels when all of 1 color are eaten, or competative mode, which is basically trying to eat most of everything on the level before the AI version of you can.I didn't feel like the colors were explained very well, as you usually ended up eating a bunch of creatures in the game, regardless of whether you chose the green 'herbivore' or not.So basically you just swam up and down in the levels trying to find your favorite color, which could get frustrating as sometimes the creatures you needed to eat would swim outside the map. Also some of the creatures of the other colors (one of the slugs I think) would sometimes carry your color, but not flash to show it.3/5			"

												This game plays fairly similar to the first stages in Spore, but offers a longer timeline and deeper immersion in the microscopic evolution.

In the first 3 minutes I obtained 5 achievements, the game is mainly fast paced. You use your mouse to control your plankton, during the campaign you're put up against another plankton, the plankton that gets the most species wins. Very nice game for what it's worth.			"

												Neon and Food Everywhere!Design, graphics and music---------------------------------Sparkle 2 Evo, as the name suggests, does exactly that: it sparkles alot. it gives you that deep sea feeling, where creatures unknown to mankind live. It looks like you are watching the different liveforms move and eat and survive through a microscope in a lab, just flashier. It's a delight to look at your lifeform evolve as you eat away. The music sets a relaxing ambience as you battle for survival.Gameplay----------------------------------Basically, it is a collection game against the AI with an timer. It plays fluid and simple and very straightforward. The graphics and the music is what its all about and it does a great job at that.Verdict----------------------------------A very relaxing and fun game if you need to calm down from your recent rage quit or have a couple of minutes to waste.

												Imagine a scenario where you and your best friend went to an all you can eat buffet, then your friend made a bet on who could chow down the most before the restaurant ran out of food. Except the buffet is not a buffet but a pond, your friend is not human but your exact clone out to ruin your day. Rinse and repeat this for 15 levels and you will get a pretty accurate picture of what this game entails.Honestly, it was fun for the first hour and mildly relaxing, but then the repetitiveness mounted quickly after. Controlling your evolution seemed great on paper, but it mattered little in terms of game play. The same goes for the varying types of creatures you fight before devouring, they look nice on screen but that’s all there is to them, since you can’t die any form of strategy was immediately thrown out the window.The two boss stages felt tacked on as well, almost like a prove of concept rather than a sequential part of the experience.Get this in a discount sale only, not even if you’re filthy rich.

												Steam sale -80%. How could I say ""no""?This game is like a Spore first evolutionary step. We are swimming around eating stuff and growing our bug-like thingy into the top predator of the seas. That's the whole story. Gameplay is as basic as it gets. If one played some ""feed the fish"" games, he knows what to do. For other players, mostly who are not familiar with the ""genre"", it's basically a Snake+, where ""+"" stands for more content than parent game. You swim, eat, grow, rince and repeat. Graphics are really well made. It's colorful and bright, eye candies are everywhere. Also our creature, no matter what evolutionary step we will take, is really well made and looks both astonishing and threathening. Music is in pair with graphics. Relaxing tones mix rather well with blissful graphics, giving us something to ease our mind while endangering species with our gluttony. If this is a Lothus flower, it's pretty damn territorial.About bad things, well, there are two. Firstly, steering is kind of buggy and can screw up sometimes. Especially, when we are not really good at it. Some times I was just wondering WTF is going on, because my species went ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason. The other time it needed so much time to ""ignite the engine"" I was bored dead. The other problem with the game is the length. It took me 2 hours to PERFECT the damned thing. 1,5h to beat the ""story"" mode. BS? Well, it's economic class game, so what did you expect? It cost 5 euro normally, and there is constant -80% on it, so you can grab a bite for olny 1 euro. So I must say, that it really was money well spend.Buy this game if you want really easy 100%, are new to the game whatsoever (or have anybody who is and want to play, just like Cursed Treasure), want to relax or just to grab a game because you really need to ease your wallet. Either way, buy it olny on sale, because 5 euros for less than 2h gameplay is a ripoff. Never the less, it was fun, and I will enjoy it even after some time.Zawisza out.			"

												This is a in between game. With in between I want to say it is a good time waste if you need some relaxing fun. If you are a powergamer, this game isn't for you. You'll fly through the levels without much thought and won't even see the fantastic artwork that the designer set the game in. You'll try to evolve, get bigger and the largest critter in the pond. But don't mistake this game for a ""Spore"" spinoff or something even related to it. You'll grow by eating other life, and you have to be careful to not be eaten yourself. If you want a Spore-like game, buy Spore, but leave this game alone. It is more an complex and animated version of a circle of life sim, and it is very casual.The artwork and the music have drawn me into this game, the simplicity and reasonable learning curve of the game were some interesting things. And it was at the time I bought it very cheap. When you buy this game and want to play it, take your time and play it slowly. There is so much to discover, see and hear. Alone the soundtrack is marvelous and fitting for the game.			"

												Beautiful evolution simulation, depending on what color resources you eat, your organism will change shape and acquire abilities. There are around 10 levels available, and each level is filled with resources and other organisms you can eat. At first I thought that you just eat everything, but it's best to eat one color resources, so you evolve further. Green resources make you bigger and slower yet you can eat faster, red ones make you move faster yet reduce your eating speed, and blue ones are in between.Game is fun little time killer that is around 3 hours long with easy achievements. Only thing required to play is mouse and ability to see three colors (red, blue, green). If you get grossed out by bugs and crawling things with tails and tentacles, then check in game footage beforehand. Otherwise it's nice little game.			"

												I went in EXPECTING a smart-phone game, and since I paid a ""smart-phone game price"" while it's on sale, I can't say that I'm disappointed at all. I loved Spore, and yes, as so many other gamers have pointed out, this is quite exactly like the first 15 minutes and stage of evolution in the creature/4x game Spore.I had hoped the music would be something that would surprise and impress me. But it's some of the most, mellow, ambient of all the mellow ambient music out there. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing, but there just isn't as much variation as I'd have hoped to hear.The visuals, to me, are really impressive. It feels like yesterday I was playing pop-stations and tiger handhelds trying to wring a few grams of enjoyment out of them. Now I'm playing a game that looks like the closest thing I've played to what I always expected ""virtual reality"" (in a wire-frame style) to look like. I really like it's look.The gameplay is a little numb, but no more so than say PacMan, and I loved PacMan.I have hit a bug in what little time I've been playing though. I didn't expect to find any, but since the controls are a little bulky feeling and I can't get the ASDW to work, I often barrel right into obstacles, and I accidentally buried my little guy into what I guess was some kind of paralyzing jellyfish thing that was caught in a whirlpool with the tide pushing me further and further into the jellyfish. After about a good minute and a half of me anticipating some kind of glitch out of where I was stuck, my little germ rocketed up and appearently clear out of the level. Everything raced by and once it finally slowed down, it turned around and restricted my movement to normal speed and only back towards where I came from. I waited about 5 minutes but never made it back to the play-field before giving it up for the time being.Get it while it's on sale, I might've been a little unhappy with a typical purchase of Sparkle2Evo, but as demonstrative games go, this one is a decent enough piece of eyecandy that I've so far enjoyed.

												Fantabulous game. I enjoyed it but i wish there was some more explanations to certain things. I also wish there were a way to evolve your creature differently. It seemed that each type of organism always had one outcome. They all ended up being things that looked like a centepide, moth, and a mosquito. If there were a way to perhaps combine the elements that were used the most, that would be wonderful. Another thing was the gene lab. It seemed logical yet i couldn't dicipher how to fully optimize my creature. It also would have been cool to have mutations. Perhaps somehow having two heads or being a carnivore with the ability of one of the others. Add some randomness to the game. Also was there ever a first one? If not, I'm looking forward to a second one. :D

												This is such an amazing little game with beautiful graphics, soothing music, and simplistic gameplay.The tutorial is short and covers the basics but problem I found out is that in later levels the game leaves you to figure out how to continue to grow by eating the blue, red, and green item things from other much larger organisms which is not a big deal but a little annoying that the tutorial didn't cover that fact.overall great game if you want to relax but remember that in later levels eat other enemies as long as you can see the little organism things somewhere on their body.

												Sparkle 2 Evo... Just a Flow clone?Many people say and think this is a Flow clone, I personally have never played Flow, nor have I watched videos so that will not be influencing this review.Sparkle 2 Evo is about a three hour long game, where you control a microorganism where your goal is to eat to evolve. What you evolve into depends on WHAT you eat, so eating red makes you a carnivore, blue an omnivore, and green an herbivore. Depending on which of the three you become you get special little extra stats, for example the carnivore being the fastest. What you eat ranges from bits of food floating around, to giant squids fifty times your size. Also, each animal you eat requires a specific tactic to beat, for example, using the tactic that’s used on a glass squid wouldn’t work on a skeleton, which makes the latter levels in the game more interesting, and creates some great, well thought out boss battles. There’s also an GenLab, so you can see which of the three traits you use the most, and what your current bonuses are (developers said you can use the lab to change your creature, leading to people believing you're supposed to do it in the GenLab, but they were more getting at the fact that you can change your creature based on what you eat). There’s also a competitive mode where you try to eat more than the opposing AI, fun but not too interesting. A lot of complaints come from this game 'not looking good' or being pixelated, and not having the option to change resolutions. Well, don’t listen to those, because you can adjust resolutions, and it can look damn near perfect on the highest settings. With that having been said, the visuals are beautiful, absolutely just full of vibrant colors, and this may actually be my favorite part of this game. Various corals, and other large debris define the maps, and change depending on the depths of the levels, and location, which I think can be really good at times. The music, well, isn’t amazing. It’s not BAD, but could have used a little more variety.Now for the problems, this game is buggy as heck. One of the more infamous glitches causes you to not be able to progress any further on a boss battle you just spent eight minutes trying to beat, forcing you to restart, and possibly having you do it a third time. Another major bug was a missing species that was required to be killed for an achievement, but recently this has been patched. The last bug I’m going to mention is when the keys stop working. Yes, they completely stop, even when you exit to the main menu and the level reloaded, they still won’t work, forcing you to shut down the game and restart it. And the biggest problem in the game, you can’t be hurt. Did a creature ten times your size just bite you? Well, better throw you up towards the surface then. This completely removes any urgency in the game, making it more boring than it should be (entertaining nonetheless). Pros:beautiful visualscomplex evolution systemgood boss battles (sometimes boring though)Cons:bugs, glitches, etc.controls are… offyour “compass” is confusing at firstcant take damageI would recommend waiting for this game to go on sale (as it often does) if you get it.Score: 5/10Score (if the three mentioned bugs were removed): 7/10Curator page:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/ "

												(I've received this giveaway key from Indiegala long ago and forgot that I even had the key there....huh....)Welcome to the Microorganism: A vore game.I originally opened this game blindly and without even knowing what to expect from the trailer.  I was pleasantly surprised to see what Sparkle 2 Evo had to offer.  It's a plug-n-play title simply about devouring other organisms.  The best part about it is how beautiful the graphics look from the microorganisms to the subtle smoke some enemies emit.My biggest complaint is that one of the ""bosses"" is rather vague with the controls and that the enemy AI is pretty dumb most of the time.  I also didn't know any real benefit between elements as I just ate all of them blindly.  This game is also pretty quick to finish within just a few (2-3) hours and the replayability is low unless you want to play casually.Is Sparkle 2 Evo worth the purchase?  For $5, it's a bit pricey for what you're getting.  I would say to wait for a sale, when you'll find it going for approximately $0.50.  It's short, cheap, and an easy 100%.8/10    I'd rate it higher, but I'm afraid a microorganism ate the rest of the score.			"

												This game is a yes if it's on sale. It's basically a remake of Fl0w (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(video_game)) but with more levels and stuff (at least compared to the original free Flash version of Fl0w). It's pretty good, I guess, and sometimes it's really pretty. But... it's a little less soothing and and chill than Fl0w was. This game does seem to do more and be more than Fl0w, but it's just lacking that same feeling of Fl0w.Overall, it's not bad, and I can recommend it to pass the time. But, for those of you who are expecting Fl0w, just be aware that you might not quite be getting it with this.			"

												7.9/10 - Great Casual Play and Challenging Competitive ModeThis is one of my Top 25 casual games. You swim around a nucleus or something eating other species within that cell. You'll get bigger, advance though the 30+ levels and have a better time doing it than you'd think. The controls are easy, just a mouse button and a few keys.An interesting twist to this game is the multi-dimensional element. You have to consume species on 1 plane and then you can trigger dives to navigate to another plane. Pretty fun idea that is easy to control. Competitive mode is really challenging!Worth the $5; Got in a bundle for nothing. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												Sparkle 2 Evo takes previous 'evolution in a pond' games such as 'Spore' and 'Flow' and evoles them into what they should have been. It is graphically pleasing to the eye and yet also challenging. The greatures are as intricate and complex as many macro-invertebrates are in real life.I will be using this game to spice up my classroom during hot and gloomy afternoon lessons in summer, and possibly get a few kids playing it on the projector as a reward.Note: This is not a game to spend lots of money on.

												Sparkle 2 Evo is a eat-n-evolve game like Spore, except you solely exist in a primordial pool. It takes 2-4 hours to beat the game so I personally feel $5 is overpriced and $3 is more like it, so find it on sale if you can . The game also has a fair amount of bugs, like an evolution dna ""lab"" that has no controls, critters getting stuck in coral, horrible opponent AI in the last levels, incorrect instructions (WASD does not work) and it doesn't explain your ""radar"", and a bug that makes the octury boss unbeatable. It's comparable to Flow and Spore, a colorful, semi-relaxing Unity-based game.			"

												I got this when it was dirt cheap, I had less than one dollar in my steam account, and I still had money left over afterwards, and then it was worth the buy.At 4.99, it is not.It's similar to spore's cell stage, but with none of the complexity of Spore's very simple creature design, all changes are cosmetic and happen automatically.  But the cell stage and this game are different, so i will try and avoid comparing them.  As for the gameplay itself, it's very simple, move the creature around, eat colored pellets.  The colored pellets change how you look.  There is little to no variation between eating the red pellets, the green pellets or the blue pellets besides how they make your creature look.  Sometimes other creatures have red pellets attached to them, but since nothings stopping you from just eating all three, there's no real point in chasing them down unless you're looking for specific designs or trying to follow a specific route, which still, has no effect besides design.  The hitboxes for the environment and for creatures is kind of strange, it always seems bigger than the actual image.I'm not really sure what it's supposed to be.  I would say it's a time waster, but it has a specific amount of levels and isn't engaging enough to make me lsoe track of time.  I would say it's a simple puzzler, but the 'puzzles' only consist of figuring out how to get food from other creatures, and is optional.  I guess it could be called a relaxer, but I never really felt relaxed the entire time, the music is the only bit pointing towards that, and some of the tracks aren't built towards that idea at all.I guess the game looks nice, but the charm is short lived, andthe art style can't hold up an entire game when everything else seems to be lacking.

												I got this when it was dirt cheap, I had less than one dollar in my steam account, and I still had money left over afterwards, and then it was worth the buy.At 4.99, it is not.It's similar to spore's cell stage, but with none of the complexity of Spore's very simple creature design, all changes are cosmetic and happen automatically.  But the cell stage and this game are different, so i will try and avoid comparing them.  As for the gameplay itself, it's very simple, move the creature around, eat colored pellets.  The colored pellets change how you look.  There is little to no variation between eating the red pellets, the green pellets or the blue pellets besides how they make your creature look.  Sometimes other creatures have red pellets attached to them, but since nothings stopping you from just eating all three, there's no real point in chasing them down unless you're looking for specific designs or trying to follow a specific route, which still, has no effect besides design.  The hitboxes for the environment and for creatures is kind of strange, it always seems bigger than the actual image.I'm not really sure what it's supposed to be.  I would say it's a time waster, but it has a specific amount of levels and isn't engaging enough to make me lsoe track of time.  I would say it's a simple puzzler, but the 'puzzles' only consist of figuring out how to get food from other creatures, and is optional.  I guess it could be called a relaxer, but I never really felt relaxed the entire time, the music is the only bit pointing towards that, and some of the tracks aren't built towards that idea at all.I guess the game looks nice, but the charm is short lived, andthe art style can't hold up an entire game when everything else seems to be lacking.

(Ooo, oooo) This game kinda feels and looks like spore tho, but only the good part when you eat and grow and collect other beings to become the beast in the sea. Honestly, good simple fun. Start small, get bigger, dont get ate now, some cells are larger than the player. With a multielement setting and dna customizations, your ""itling"" is yours to love and grow.

												This game is an iPhone port with forgettable music, bland/repetitive graphics and confusing game mechanics. The first 10 minutes were fun but that's about it. The controls are frustrating and there's a cooldown at which you can absorb species (the little orbs) so you keep going past them and then you have to go back all the time.My advice is to look up gameplays first unless you are familiar with the genre, if you buy this game after looking at the screenshots you might be disappointed, because the game does indeed look fun until you are in control.There is litterally no challenge in this game. It's super easy, I have never lost a level in the ""competitive mode"" and I finish the game entirely. About 2 hours of gameplay to finish the entire thing. I do not recommend this game, I find it really boring.			"

												I suppose one of the developers was playing Flow and got briliant idea ""Hey, lets make the same game, but better!"". And they did.. Unfortunately, this one is not better. It is not even as good as the first flash version of fl0w was back in 2006 or so. And that one was free.. Controls (mouse or kb, no pad support) are not responsive, everything moves annoingly slow and there are no real enemies or anything that would give you a challenge. Most of the time you just slowly swim around and eat evolving pills or harmless creatures. Even two available ""boss"" encounters are boring as hell.I've made myself to finish this game, just to see how will my ""sparkle"" evolve and I really regret it.If you really want to play game like this and have not tried Flow before, go and play Flow. If you've already played Flow and are looking for something just like that, go and play Flow again. Sparkle is not the game you are looking for.			"

												Forgive my lack of words to describe this game, other than ""extremely lame"".I was hoping for something similar to the creature phase of ""Spore"" just expanding upon the idea a little but was bitterly disappointed.There is no Evo(lution) whatsoever in the gameplay of Sparkle 2 Evo, only the graphics change slightly (they do sparkle nicely though). Also it does not make any difference, whether you play as carni-, omni-, or herbivore, other than having to collect a different colour of food bits, that lie around the map, doing nothing. You can't attack your opponent or have to protect from him, your playable little worm does not gain any traits and so every level and the goals are pretty much the same every time and the whole thing gets repetitive and boring incredibly fast.Don't be fooled to buy it only because it's dirt cheap while on sale - that doesn't make your time spent on it more worthwhile.

												Very similar to Spore's first phase in which you're a micro-organism swimming around in goo looking for food, and while that section wore out its welcome only by the time it was over in that game, that is entirely what Sparkle 2 Evo is about.Maybe if you're the type who wants to mull about within something that looks visually interesting, this game'll be for you, but there's very little going on from a mechanics perspective, and what is there becomes dreadfully dull very quickly.The price-point is cheap, but there are better games out there to be had for cheap prices nowadays.

												I'm writing this review after finishing the game, well after I was done with it. When I first played it, the game looked pretty nice. Beautiful graphics, whole evolving idea to explore, spore-like gameplay, 3 paths to choose. But after first few levels illusion of ""evolving your creature however you want"" ended when I saw you get 3 preset creatures depending on which color blobs you ate the most. Gameplay gets pretty repetitive and is not challenging at all. When you first time encounter a new creature, working out how to beat it and which parts to attack first etc. is nice but when you have to kill it for the 30th time all the appeal wanishes. After killing the second boss and getting 100% achievements I've decided to stop playing, because I saw no further motivation to grind through teh rest of the levels. Another con I will give this game is for it's GUI. At 1080p resolution menu items are extremely pixelated, you can't tell between green (completed) and yellow (not completed) level tiles to see which level you should go to next. At least it wasn't botehring me inside the levels because there isn't any UI at all.Pros: - beautiful graphics - creative enemy design - trading cards?Cons: - repetitive - not challenging at all - no customization options of your evolving creature - ugly GUITL;DR - if you are really bored and it is on sale, it can entertain you for a hour or so (I've completed it in under 3 hours). It is nice to look at and you even get som trading cards and achievements.			"

												While this game isn't bad, persay, i  didn't do anything especially interesting to keep me playing for more then a half hour at a time. The visuals are some what nice, if not a bit painful to look at after long periods of time. The actual gameplay consists of playing as a long serpent-like creature that swims around and eats certain food items to gain a specific trait. In the end, it feels like the cell stage in Spore, only a bit watered down. For five bucks, there are much better games. I might reccomend it if it goes on sale, but even then, a game like Terraria when it goes on sale is almost always going to be a better purchase. "

												-The perfect game for casual play, throw on a podcast or some music and eat away at other organisms. -The game has pretty much no failure conditions at all, there is a competitive mode where you race to gather more organisms than the ai, but ai is so slow its not really a threat, and the other organisms in the regular game cannot eat you so there is no way to fail, which in my opinion is good for just a casual experience. -You can make the experience a bit deeper by trying to pick up only other organisms of a certain color, each color organism gives points to different attributes of your specimen. There are 3 colors, and each has its own special ability, so if you've gathered majority red organisms, you will have the red special ability and so on for green and blue.PLAYTIME: Completed every level and gained all achievements in the playtime shown.

												This is one of the best feeding games I have played in my life. I 100% recommend this game for everyone to play.This game is just a treat to play. The best part of this game is it's graphics. The graphics is just outstanding. They did one of the best visually attracting games I have seen. A top notch art, design, graphical orientated indie game. The design of the Species, Organisms, Environment and everything is @ it's peak. The art style and graphical design is a phenomenal masterpiece and that made the game visually dreamlike impressive.The Music of this game is serene and sublime. It helps refresh the mind. The music helps to relax the mind a lot. The gameplay Control system is another great aspect of the game. The game can be play only with keyboard or only with mouse or with both. I used both to make the game easier. The gameplay aspect is a mix with casual, relaxation and competitiveness. This game can be enjoyed by any kind of player and they won't be disappointed after playing this game. The gameplay is very smooth and can be easily learned. The difficulty is not very easy and not very hard. It's fairly easy which makes it better for everyone. The games main aspect revolves around an organism or a life form eating it's way up the food-chain in the deep underwater ocean. Most of the species seen here really exists in the real world and there food source revolves around these lifeforms. The game concept was very good in this part and the developers did a very good job on it. It helps to understand the lifestyle of the lifeforms living thousands of meters down in the deep sea which actually exists.The game can be easily 100% completed in 2-4 hours but every achievement isn't easy and they did very well to spread the achievement to finish the game but not much grinding aspect attached to it.The games optimization is very good and works very smoothly @ low mid range PCs very well.The games level design is fairly good but they could've added much more in the surrounding environment.The AI gives a fairly descent amount of difficulty to be competetive.Pros:Graphics is just a masterpiece (110%)Music is very relaxing (10/10)Game Control is very good (10/10)Gameplay is fairly good (9/10)Game Level design is fairly good (7/10)Concept is spot on (10/10)Design is very good (95%)Can be enjoyed by everyoneEasy 100% achievement unlockA deep story within no story Learning aspect Game optimization is very goodCredit play design is very unique (9/10)Cons:Lack of variation in MusicNot many Levels (Won't spoil it though)Could've done much more with more underwater speciesLack of map surrounding designReal time multi player could've been addedVariation in difficulty is bad. The first one is the most difficult and later it get easier and easier.The cons are there because I love this game very much and I got attached to this game and I wanted more but it is very good the way it is and is recommended for everyone to play.I highly recommend this game and you can but it on steam sales for $0.49 and it is totally worth it. :D			"

												If you're looking for action-filled games with extreme diversities in gameplay, this is NOT the game for you.However, if you're looking for a good break with a calming gameplay, calming music and beautiful graphic and colors, this game is just for you.Yes, the game is pretty 'pointless' but that's practically what I like about these kind of games. It's a good diversion from the action-filled games with high tempo. The graphics are just beautiful. They're colorful, yet not 'bright and rainbowy' in any way. The music is great and the game is calm and slow-paced; Perfect for a little break, as the levels aren't that long either.I would have liked a bit more diversity in the evolving. The type of food you chose doesn't really affect your creature that much apart from apperance, and if you want any chance of winning over your opponent, you must eat more than one kind of food to complete in time. It could use some fixes there.			"

												This is very similar to the 2006 game, ""flOw"". You start off as a kind of microbe who swims around and eats things. As you eat, your body fills out, and once you're filled out all the way to the tail, you level up and your tail gets longer. Depending on what you eat the most of, you develop different stats and eventually skills. It's a very simple game without much to think about. You just swim around and eat. Some of the things you eat try to fight back, but not too hard.If you like 'zen' games, where the goal is relaxation rather than entertainement, then this is a good one.			"

												I like this game its a non loss  time killer if you just wanna chill and not have to sort anything worry bout stats , pk ,griefers, inv space or do anything but listen to music while straying round a beautful map , i do say beautiful because it plays just awsome on a lowend computer even at high res a change from most games i play. all n all 8/10 it losses points on no real character development oddly one of the features and there is no real direction you find a good map with alota red green or blue and grind it till you max for weeks . And there is no real  direction or goal to aim for hence i can see why some people dont like it - a goal orientated mind needs a goal this games goal is to kill time . BUT it does not advertise that its a hardcore mmo or brutal game  you cant ever lose the only thing you can fail with is evolving the right way and that oddly takes time and searching on some levels often if you want to evole to the next stage in x color it involves find a map with lots of said color and redoing it over and over something every gamer is use to if you want x item and it only dropz off z npc you grind z npc till you get it .Red picks a target and bursts after it , green eats fast real fast, blue scairs fishys n stuff away from where they currently are ....great for moveing fishys outa corals.

Its not a game with a backstory or objectives you need to learn; there is no learning curve other than the five control buttons you need.This game is like the game Flow on playstation3, or any other kind of idle-time adventure game. There is no real 'end' or 'death' in the game; you begin by selecting one of a few single-cell creatures to play as, then spend however much time you have to kill kind of just floating around, eating stuff and exploring a visually appealing environment. As you eat, you grow, and can eat larger and larger prey. If you get damaged by other craetures, you shrink. Depending on what you eat, and in what order you eat it, life grants you different evoloutionary advantages as you progress.The game ends when you get bored and put the controller down, or pick another creature to play as.

												This game is pure beauty.

There is no penatly or danger from bumping into large creatures or creatures with poison that should rightfully turn around and eat you. You are basically the lone wolf among a very dumb and slow moving pack of sheep.This no danger feel is the dowfall of this game sadly.They should have taken the Spore idea where you always have something larger than you to fear.As you grow larger you should be able to fight earlyer threats as well as getting new ones as you progress.A multiplayer mode vs other people would help too.A time race on who eats who.However i dont regret buying it.The creatures are so fascinating to look at that even though i know its just pure eye candy....well....i do like me some eye candy from time to time.

												Sparkle 2 Evo. Now when i first saw this game I thought to myself two things. This reminds me of The Munchables (a very kiddish Wii game) and Electroplankton from the Nintendo DS from Nintendo. The game is about you starting off as a newly born organisim in a huge world where you must fight for survival by eating other types of food under the floor of the Ocean area you are currently in. As you ""eat"" more certain organisims your character will level up and become anything from a balanced character to a Herbivore to a Carnivore based creature. The Controls for this game are simple you can either use keyboard moving with W A S AND D or using your Mouse you can click and hold to make your character swim to the area. The control is this game is very tight. I thought for a game that was only being offered for $5 Wasn't going to be worth my time at all But it is a very awesome game. The Graphics are pretty damn impressive for a game that only wants $5 for it. The Controls are easy to get used to and seeing all the changes in the scenery as you dive or rise in the water (using X to Dive and Z to Rise) all change in real time. Everything from seeing huge Coral multi colored reefs, to even seeing a Whirlpool almost suck you in it is all very colorful and this game should be given a chance. Only thing That is missing that would make this game EVEN better is Steam Trading Cards. Here is hoping the game recieves an update for them. They would be pretty awesome to collect. 9/10			"

												This game seemed amazing at first. A spore-like game. It looked like a beutiful game. Turns, out, none of these things are true. Turns out none of these things are true. This first one might be personal preference: The Graphics. The game has a very confusing layout as it is, and the super-bright colors and odd and confusing perspective don't help much. The game gets old fast, and it becomes more of a challange to figure out which height you are on than the game you are meant to be playing.I give this game a 4/10. Core mechanics are flawed. It has potential, but it needs an major update that will probobly never happen.			"

												SHORT VERSIONPick it up for five euros and have a game that you can whip out for 20-30 minute sessions whenever you want to relax a bit.LONG VERSIONThe art is gorgeous and the beautifully animated sealife is sure to dazzle you at first glance. It comes with a soothing soundtrack to match its visual style. However, the gameplay is repetitive which is both the game's strong and weak point. It doesn't offer anything more beyond what you do in the first level (swim around, eat other organisms, sometimes evolve) but because of that it's  easy to understand and get into. The number of evolutions boil down to three (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore) per developmental stage so there's not much to play around with. You follow the pulsating lights to find food and once you have found it, you feed by simply swimming through it. You win by eating a set amount of food which can get tricky if you are a slowpoke and let other creatures nab your dinner. There are standard, static food such as algae and floating bits of meat but the higher level prey have fun little gimmicks to them. As an example, if you want to consume a baby squid you first need to snip away at its nervous system on the front then the poison glands on the back before it's weakened enough to be gobbled up.The best feature of the game is the inclusion of an optional non-competitive mode which removes the other hungry contestants so you can hunt for food at your own leisure.

												This is a relaxing game to play. The sounds and the colors overall make the game seem like you are in a dream. If you enjoy  biology, then you will enjoy this game, as you get to guide your own organism through water, hunting and feeding on any prey that comes your way. Overall I believe that this game is very well put together.			"

												This game seemed amazing at first. A spore-like game. It looked like a beutiful game. Turns, out, none of these things are true. Turns out none of these things are true. This first one might be personal preference: The Graphics. The game has a very confusing layout as it is, and the super-bright colors and odd and confusing perspective don't help much. The game gets old fast, and it becomes more of a challange to figure out which height you are on than the game you are meant to be playing.I give this game a 4/10. Core mechanics are flawed. It has potential, but it needs an major update that will probobly never happen.			"

												SHORT VERSIONPick it up for five euros and have a game that you can whip out for 20-30 minute sessions whenever you want to relax a bit.LONG VERSIONThe art is gorgeous and the beautifully animated sealife is sure to dazzle you at first glance. It comes with a soothing soundtrack to match its visual style. However, the gameplay is repetitive which is both the game's strong and weak point. It doesn't offer anything more beyond what you do in the first level (swim around, eat other organisms, sometimes evolve) but because of that it's  easy to understand and get into. The number of evolutions boil down to three (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore) per developmental stage so there's not much to play around with.

												Sparkle 2 is probably one of the worst games I've bought. There is barely any challenge, no conflict, there are enemies, but they only send you up so that you can move to the side and come back down. The art is interesting, I'll give it that, but the only thing you do is swim around and touch little powerups, just so that you can start over in the next level.I do not recommend this game.			"

												It is described in genre as: Action and Simulation but this game is not really either of these. Nothisg really kills you, so no action in there; this game is no where near simulation. The only part of it that pushes you to try harder is the ai that tries to pick more points, and fater than you. In that regard it's like a racing game, sort of, since when you reach a certain point count, you win. It's really casual, as much of what you need to do to get points is to gobble up as much food as you can, and little strategy or tactics to do that except to do it fast.The other thing that bugs me is the class system, there are the carnivores(red), the harbivores(green), and a blue class i'm not sure about. This game is barely tries to stay accurite to these classes as all of them can gain their colour points by feeding on other organisems. carnivores will often eat inanimate red sphreres too.4One might think that in such a game, where it pretends to simulate an evolution the traits of one class will hold throughout the game... Well this is not the case since every time you level up you might change your appeaence to the other class, seemengly at random. Sometimes the visible traits will transfer to another form, line the carnivore's tail, but it still quite un logical. The only thing that does pass are the mechanical traits, like carnivore's speed, or herbivores agility.If you're looking for a beautiful casual arcade game, this is it.If you're interested in an action, or a simulation, do yourself a favour and pass.

												Honest review.- I still don't know why my creatures change (some people say You play with 3 - for me its stupid)- The gameplay is not that bad, but it's buggy I got stuck inside the octopus and couldn't get out had to restart level and this one is REALLY hard one.- I don't really feel like I'm making any choices? It feels like whatever I will eat it will lead me to the same evolution...- Some levels are big, but have ""JUST enough"" food, which makes this game boring  I had to run around one lvl for over 20 min to find last 5 of any color Overall it's fun game but for me, it needs still a lot of work, and it feels, it's not finished yet, not polished.I've played firstly 1 hour, and decided to make all achievments, so I did another 1 hour, but I don't think I will ever finish it.I just hope it would be less boring, omg.I recommend ON SALE.

												This is a game that is meant to be played ""casually"".  While the game has multiple z-axis ""planes"", it is a game largely played on a 2-dimensional field, where you basically just guide your little critter to eat things until you grow up.  There are three ""paths"" to go down, which you traverse through eating colored blobs of three colors. There are two modes.In the non-competitive mode, you basically just get dumped on a map, and get told to eat everything of one color to go to the next map.  There's essentially no way to lose, but to quit, which I suppose is what makes it ""casual"", and it's not like games need to be hard to be enjoyable, but there's no particular story, here, to make the world more compelling without it.  There's some ""exploration"", just to see all the different critters, but once you have seen every level, you've seen everything the game has to offer.In the ""competitive mode"", you have an AI-controlled critter competing with you for food, where victory is measured in hogging more food than the other guy can get.  While hypothetically, this means challenge and desperately trying to hunt creatures for food faster, regardless of color, in practical effect, you can just stay green and vacuum up everything far faster than your opponent, since the extra bits of food from dividing food pieces all count to your total, and you can consume more food from critters than the game expects to count. In general, I could eat several times more food than the opponent, and never once seemed like I was in trouble unless I completely abandoned attempting to eat for a while.  The big choice in the game about which critter to be is somewhat defeated by the imbalance in the practical use of the different criters.  The ""carnivore"" red is quick to accelerate, and gets a ""dashing"" skill to ""attack"" other creatures.  The ""herbivore"" green (and I put ""herbivore"" in quotes because you still hunt and eat other animals, you just want to eat the green ones) has faster eating time (making it so you can eat as fast as you ram through food, rather than skipping over food for a second or so) and has a super AoE suction attack that consumes all food in the area.  The ""omnivore"" blue (which, somehow, eats a different food entirely from both carnivores and herbivores, rather than just eating both in roughly equal measure,) gets a better turning radius and a defensive sound skill that makes creatures flee from it.Hypothetically, in a game where combat mattered, the difference between an attack skill, a defense skill, and a resource-gathering skill might mean something, but since all you do in this game is eat, the herbivore skill is fantastically useful and makes the game significantly faster and less frustrating, while the omnivore defenseskill is useless since you need to hunt critters, rather than have them flee you, and the carnivore dash attack is pointless since the only enemies that run from you do so across the z-axis, which the dash will not go across.  Ultimately, I recommend this game only on sale for the sheer color and fascination of it.  It's odd and interesting, and worth looking at, and on sale, you can get it dirt cheap enough to justify buying it for aesthetics alone, but there isn't enough actual gameplay to keep you in it.  This is a game you can completely ""play out"" and feel you've experienced everything it can offer in just a half-dozen hours.			"

												The game is beautiful and the music is nice, but the gameplay is lacking.  This is a casual game, not meant for people looking for anything deep or innovative, just a little something to waste some time on your phone while waiting for a bus.You evolve your creature by eating either red, green or blue food elements, and the different colors influence how your creature evolves.  These food elements are scattered around the environment and are supposed to evolve you into either a predator, herbivore or omnivore, respectively.  Consuming different amounts of each color produces different visual combinations on your creature, but no change in gameplay.Whether you evolve as a predator, herbavore, or an omnivore, you still guide your creature around eating food elements.  You don't actually become a predator chasing down fast prey.  You never become an herbivore, swimming around to avoid predators.  You never become an omnivore.  No matter what you do, the game is the same: guide your creature around the world eating pellets.  Nothing is hunting you, nothing is trying to fight you off, prey does not illude you, and your competition AI never attacks you, so there is no reason to evolve in any particular direction.Really, the whole challenge is in the controls.  This game was designed for touch screens, and I imagine playing it on a tablet or phone would be incredibly difficult.  I played it with a gamepad, and that made everything too easy.  The difficulty should not stem from the controls.Still, if you're looking for a casual expeience that's beautiful and a challenge on a touchscreen computer, this is all right.

												I went into this game expecting some variety and cool boss fights. then once I started playing it, I just ended up doing the same thing over and over and over again. maybe Spore's ""Cell stage"" has spoiled me. the idea of genetics was a great idea, until I realized that you cant controll or customize anything. the particles you eat don't even make sense! herbivores just end up eating anything green even if it is a worm or jellyfish... same for the omnivore and canivore. I expected herbivores to at least eat things off of a plant like material. the boss fights are a joke. for one, if you take any damage there is no harmful effect other than you just spiral away a little bit. and secondly, the bosses barely do anything! you just end up doing what you have been doing the rest of the game before that.... eating small colored particles off of the boss until it just magically blows up into a blue slowing cloud. TLDR: everything sounds awesome until you play it and see that it is just a good looking and has worse mechanics than your typical flash game. a waste of money.			"

												A game that was heavily inspired by the game flOw.The core concept sounds fun and should be enjoyable, the gameplay is marred by horrid controls and really imprecise movement. You feel like you're trying to guide a tank, not a snake-like organism.Similar to flOw, there are multiple layers you can transit through in each section. Each layer contains various other enemies and DNA strands you can consume. The different types of DNA alter your creature's genome, enabling different characteristics. This concept is central to the game, and quite innovative.The visual design is superb, with great design cues for the various creatures. The environment feels bare, but that can serve to help focus your attention.Music is relaxing and sounds are unobtrusive.With better implemented controls and movement, this might have been a fun game. As it stands, I'd avoid it.			"

												This game is... pretty. Very beautiful and chill, relaxing music. The gameplay is like the first phase of spore which I personally enjoyed a lot but even that was more in depth than this and spore was supposed to focus on a lot of phases and gameplay mechanics whereas this focuses on only the first phase and it doesn't really do it that well. You can choose between 3 different type of sparkles but in reality it doesn't really matter. Each sparkle can eat pretty much everything with ease. You  can't  choose any stats / upgrades and generally there is no real RPG element to eat regardless of there being a level up system.I guess if you want a chill 4 hour experience you could buy it on a sale or with a discount coupon but for 5$ kinda hard to recommend.

												This is not a game to tax the brain or the reflexes. It's less a game, more a cyberpet with levels. However, there is something to enjoy here. It is calming, pretty to look at and (as I just did) you can lose three hours without notice.Here is the problem. The lack of explanation is a big thing. Not being told what your 'special power' does leads to ignoring it. Activating it requires you to stop moving and double click on the head of your sparkle. It breaks the flow of the game to do that. Would it have been such a problem to assign it to a key? I ate only green and blue food, looking to create a slightly different type of herbivore, but it doesn't matter. You eat enough of one type of food, you level up and turn into that type of creature. I got trapped in red food, had to eat my way out, and changed into a predator. Not satisfying at all.There is a really sound basis for a brilliant game here but it feels like it is still in early beta. It feeds the eye and the ear very well, but your mind goes hungry.Finally, I think it was a boss fight... not sure. A level called the octuary darkness. The control method and view point change in a very strange way. It feels like a bug. Imagine stepping from our universe and into another where up down, left right and back and forwards suddenly meant different things. Like that. Not fun, and not acceptable. If you want to chill out, turn your brain off and just relax (why are you lookikng for a game to play?) this will do it for you. Just understand it is VERY limited. I feel bad not recommending this game, because I enjoyed it, but I got lucky and this is bugged and quite empty.			"

												This was one of the first games I've gotten in awhile that disapointted me. Honestly, Spore does a better micro-organisim eat/evolve game. The problem is that despite the level having more dementions, the gameply is very linear. If you've seen the video and read the description, you've half played the game already. Your evolution is essentially random, as you inevidably eat whatever you come acreoss as fast as possible for points, and there is no way (that I found) to modify your creature in-between rounds to say, prune out the junk to try an sculpt the creature you wannted. Nope, only way is to be picky about what you eat, and that wil likely cost you the rounds, as the AI will not be so picky. ... Which basicly turns the game into competitive 3-D Pacman...In a competitive 3-D Pacman sense, it's not bad! I, however, expected more... depth, options, and complexity (at least a much as Spore has to offer) and the concept has potiential, but alas, it's just not there now.That said, it truly is a casual game, and perhaps the lack of complexity is a feature not an oversight. You may enjoy Sparkles 2 Evo, I for one, am spending time on other games.			"

												This game could have a better name. This is a very well executed casual game. It plays a lot like the Cell stage of Spore although there are no points to spend on upgrades. It would be cool to see an upgrade system in future releases. I like this game. The graphics are done well and it has a relaxing soundtrack. It's nice and simple gameplay and it works with a controller. This is a quality made game.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. Firstly after 6 or so rounds it gets really boring. All you do is walk around, ""eat"" some things and beat the AI competitor. If it can be called that, because its realy easy to beat it.The leveling system is moot. You have to eat everything you can as fast as you can, so its almost useless to try and level up as you with.But, the real reason I cannot recommend this game is because this made me sick. I mean, reall sick, throw-up-in-the-toilet sick. So, if you are anything like me and gets sick after a bit of too colorfull games (like this one and Super Hexagon), stay the hack away.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo Review - Raymond KTIf you're wishing to play a smooth game for whoever gets the most food first, then this is your game.There is NOTHING to do with evolving AT all. All you're doing is going from level to level. I feel like it's a level game, complete this level then proceed, but the worst part about it, is it's BORING! You go around collecting little pieces of food and once you've reached a certain point, the game says ""You win!""Is it wrong to expect certain things from a game? Well it's hard not to when the game resembles the Spore Cell Stage to an almost exact degree. They can't even call this game anything to do with evolution. It is a level game, stay away from it			"

At about the 5th level the computer controlled opponent becomes about ten times better and starts eating way more than you. It also starts to get tougher like how the things you eat are placed, like in jellyfish and what not.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												The graphics are amazing and, in my personal opinion, that's where the good bits stop.  I suppose my expectations for Sparkle 2 was that it played out similar to the cell stage in Spore, but much better.  Sadly, I was completly wrong (because I've always wanted a massive game built around nothing but that concept).  So if Spore is what makes you look at Evo and go ""yeah, I could try that.."" then crush those feeling immediatly.  You'll just end up disapointed.  After I got over that, though, the game still felt boring.  Maybe it's just my taste, but i felt their was little creativity in it besides the art direction. You do nothing more then to swim this way, bump into these things (usually these weird orbs that are your food, I guess?), and call it a day.  The controls can also be pretty frustrating.  I spent a good deal of time in the start spinning around my food instead of eating it, or running into walls when the spacing became tight.  The AI's feels...odd. None of it feels like you're in an ecosystem full of beautiful organisms, which was honestly my biggest pull to the game.  All in all, the concept of Sparkle 2 sounds interesting and cool, but it could of been something much better then what it is. It's not that I want it to become a differant game all together (and I'm not saying it has to be like Spore) I just don't like it.  I can't recomend it unless it's on a pretty big sale.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is fun, relaxing and above all - pretty. But it does have it problems. Namely, things you need to eat will occasionally swim off the map. Food will also get stuck inside coral, and unless you're currently the green creature with suction powers you cannot retrieve it. There is also no real danger to yourself - you can get bitten by other creatures, but all that will do is turn your screen red and make your creature swim a level higher.It's more similar to Flower than Flow.

												A pretty game, that's for sure, but the gameplay is boring and basically also lacking a real challenge. Also, you don't really have that much control over your evolution: sure you could try and eat only one colour, but that means you will just be growing slower than your opponent in competitive mode, meaning you will lose the match. As you make progress you encounter more (bigger) species, but most do not really provide a new and different challenge. They are just bigger, thus taking longer to defeat in the same way you defeat everything: by eating it. This process becomes boring fast, and after about an hour not even the pretty colours and lighting or the soothing soundtrack could keep my interest.			"

												Very beautiful, very immersive. Played non-stop when I first got it. Unfortunately, there are a few bugs (minor spoiler):_______________________________________________________________________________________-Some of the levels were marked as ""completed"" even though I haven't even got to them yet. -The boss battle in Octury Deep is literally unbeatable because the game seems to prevent me even touching any of the octupus' tentacles. I understand that you have to use a special in order to descend deeper and become closer to the tentacles, but even when I do, the bulbs are unable to be eaten even though I head for the lowest one first.-Another Octury Deep bug may be using the special in order to descend deeper into the boss' tentacles. For me, I was only able to use my special a grand total of three times (without being able to even descend) before I'm stuck swimming forever without hope of defeating the boss. It required me to exit and restart the battle again, and at one point even restart the game because the pause options didn't appear. I retried many times, but unfortunately, the bug remained. I couldn't progress through the battle.______________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion/TL;DR:Aside from the major bug in one of the boss battles, the game is worth playing. The details are stunning, the controls are pretty smooth, and it overall piqued my enjoyment.			"

Players get to control the DNA evolution of their little organism 'Sparkle', depending on the 'food' consumption (Green, Blue or Red) which is trackable via GenLab. I had 3.6hrs into the gameplay, completed the game and cleaning up the steam achievements. The only bad part of the game is the lack of info on Level 13 Octury Deep and Level 14 Squidworm Void, it took me an hour or more to figure out what to do and how to beat them. P/S: There are good guides on steam regarding these levels.			"

												Simple game.  Recommended for the very casual gamer.Controls are basic in that it is a point and click to manuever a creature in the direction clicked.Sounds are basic but well done.  Enjoyed the ambient music in the backgroundThe premise of the game is to collect coloured orbs and level the creature up.  The orbs collected determine the type of creature that will evolve.There are two modes; competitive and non-competitive.  Competitive adds an AI that collects the orbs as well.  Collect more than the AI to win.  Non-competitive removes the AI and the goal is to collect all the orbs.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is pretty and relaxing. However, the gameplay is boring at best, the levels are unchallenging and the only decision you make, which is choosing whether you want to be omnivorous, herbivorous or carnivorous, has barely any impact on your creature and its evolution. I was a little disappointed. Still, it was not entirely unenjoyable. In short, Sparkle 2 Evo offers a stress-free experience in a beautiful environment, but not much more.			"

It loses points for the control behavior at times it gets in the way of itself and the obstacles in the environment seem to interfere with some mechanics of the game.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is a beautifully made concept, but not much of a game.  You swim around in liquid eating colored particles which give you different growths as you progress in evolution.  You cannot die and you cannot lose the game unless you are playing competitive and you fail to eat faster than the AI controlled Sparkle.  What made this game fun was the layer shifting mechanic.  You can swim in to the background or the foreground while hunting for food.  The effects are great and the animations on the creatures encountered are fantastic...  it reminded me of watching microorganisms with a microscope in college.  I bought the game on sale at $1.24 and I enjoyed the game, but I know it is not for everyone.  The game gets repetitive fast and there is little difficulty, even during the boss fights.  Over all the concept in the game has potential to become great, but as it is Sparkle 2 Evo is more an ""experience"" then a game.   "

												4/5 starsIts a fun time waster, reminisent of the feeding frenzy series (and the various app/online knock-offs of it).Overall its a pretty good game, the graphics are really neat, but times they can seem odd when applied to certain creatures though (namely octopus). The ability to customize your creature is somewhat difficult to use, you basically eat different things and hope for the combination you desire.Its very buggy, and chrashes frequently, fortunately the levels aren't particularly difficult (or long), so don't worry you shouldn't end up loosing too much progress. The game is also updated infrequently, so many of these types of bugs (and a multitude of smaller ones that don't mean much) will hopefully be fixed incrementally.Other than the players creature (which is reminiscent of a copepod) all of the creatures in the game are real species, which is something I found neat, don't expect to recognise most of them though (unless you are well versed on abyssal marine biology) because some are fairly obscure (its never a bad thing to include obscure creatures in  games, I appplaud it)			"

												The graphics look neat but you will quickly  tire of the game.  Here are a few observations:1.  You can't really die.2.  You have to eat a full set of colored ""pelets"" to proceed to the next level (red, green, or blue).  This is fine however before long, there are different sized pellets and different animals of the color you are going for.  Some times the small pellet counts towards completing the level, other times it does not.  Same with animals.  Eating some helps to progress while other times that same animal does not contribute to level progress.Am I upset I bought the game?  No,.. I spent $0.49 and played it for about an hour.  If I can get one hour of game play for every dolllar spent on Steam, I consider it a good deal.  Spend $20 = 20 hours, spend $1 for 1 hour.  So in this case I hoped for 30 minutes and am happy I spent an hour on the game.Any more then $1 and I would pass on the game.q77 "

												You play as a microorganism. Your only goal is to eat. evolve and level up. It plays similar to the early stages in the Spore game by EA. It's entertaining for an hour or so, after that it gets boring and repetitive really fast except for the 2 boss stages found by the end of the game. I'm playing with the xB360 controller, controls are slightly unresponsive at times. It's easier to play using a mouse.

												A nice little means to pass time if you like those ´food chain´ type of games where you eat anything and everything to grow bigger so you can eat even more stuff. That may not sound appealing to some people but in all fairness, I don´t think this game was made with the purpose of raising excitement. The game does look beautiful and that´s probably it´s one strong aspect because it lacks depth in everything else.The game is supposed to induce a sense of relaxation but because of all the swaying motions and camera view I found it more nauseating than anything else. For that matter, it´s a good thing there´s only 13 levels which can be played through within two hours. Two more levels if you´re planning on going for 100% achievements.. in which case I must warn you that one of the two extra levels is almost impossible to beat with the keyboard & mouse because of some apparent bug that causes you to get stuck in empty space. Either use a controller or switch to one for this particular level and it should be fine.Maybe a fun game to pick up on a sale but because of it's simplicity not worth full price in my opinion. The only thing that could justify the price would be the 'pretty graphics' but if that's what you want out of a game, you can do much better.			"

												Sparkle 2: Evo is one of the prettiest crappy games I've ever seen. It looks so nice and sleek, the design is all shiny and beautiful looking, but the gameplay itself is terrible. You basically swim around with clunky controls (which where the developer's intentions, mind you, but they're a little overdone and can just be down-right infuriating to use) and eat small pieces of food. You either eat red, green, or blue, to become a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore, respectively. But it doesn't really matter, since you can't control evolution anyway, you basically change shape for a few levels then you just stay the same from what I can see. You can't modify your creature like in SPORE (which this is clearly a ripoff of), there's no real fights or anything, you basically can just swim in misshapen circles and try to eat the tails of enemies without hitting their heads, and you just clear the food out from level to level. Yawn! Sparkle 2: Evo is sometimes frustrating and always very boring, which is a real bummer because it looks so pretty.4.1/10			"

												This game, like Morphopolis, is a collecting game. However, more functionality is present in this game vs Morphopolis.The principle is simple: Eat a number of a certain colored orbs, and you gain some traits related to that color. There are three colors: Blue, Green, and Red. Different ratios of orbs results in different appearances. You are able to die, so you have to be methodical with how you play, but can be played casually without issue.I don't believe it's worth full price, but the game is known to drop below $1 during sales. For trading cards and achievements, it's not a bad game for sale price.			"

												Judging by the included instructions it's supposed to be a carbon copy of flOw - but it isn't, in a bad way.Graphics-wise it's ok, though in my opinion not as slick looking as the aforementioned game's high-contrast monocrome art.The problems are mostly with gameplay and control consistency:It's much slower than flOW (or at least than the ""demo"" that is available on PC) and the layer mechanic is not like in the documentation as far as I could tell. The tutorial is also wrong, it shows opposite key bindings at one point.There is also more visual clutter that has no gameplay relevance, I suppose that comes down to preference though.The controls aren't really precise enough to account for the differences between this and flOw. Since in this game you have to pick between different food and manoeuvre obstacles, I'd expect the turn radius and eating cooldown to be lower or the world to contain more empty space and be zoomed out. Currently it doesn't mix too well.The menu controls don't seem polished, for example ESC works for backing out of some menus but there are screens where it doesn't do anything at all. The equivalent button is sometimes in the top-right corner, sometimes in the bottom-left one. The menus are also slow instead of calm and reactive (but I don't know how flOw handles in that regard, since the PC one doesn't really have any).Finally, the default control scheme isn't adjusted based on locale: If you have a QWERTZ keyboard for example, you have to switch to English or reconfigure it before starting the game. (Which is possible, so this is just a minor point.)At least the music is nice, but it's not memorable by any means.			"

												You play as a microorganism. Your only goal is to eat. evolve and level up. It plays similar to the early stages in the Spore game by EA. It's entertaining for an hour or so, after that it gets boring and repetitive really fast except for the 2 boss stages found by the end of the game. I'm playing with the xB360 controller, controls are slightly unresponsive at times. It's easier to play using a mouse. Other than the beautiful visuals and relaxing soundtrack, I have no praises for the game. Overall it lacks any depth and replay value.

												4/5 starsIts a fun time waster, reminisent of the feeding frenzy series (and the various app/online knock-offs of it).Overall its a pretty good game, the graphics are really neat, but times they can seem odd when applied to certain creatures though (namely octopus). The ability to customize your creature is somewhat difficult to use, you basically eat different things and hope for the combination you desire.Its very buggy, and chrashes frequently, fortunately the levels aren't particularly difficult (or long), so don't worry you shouldn't end up loosing too much progress. The game is also updated infrequently, so many of these types of bugs (and a multitude of smaller ones that don't mean much) will hopefully be fixed incrementally.Other than the players creature (which is reminiscent of a copepod) all of the creatures in the game are real species, which is something I found neat, don't expect to recognise most of them though (unless you are well versed on abyssal marine biology) because some are fairly obscure (its never a bad thing to include obscure creatures in  games, I appplaud it)			"

Sparkle 2 Evo totally blew all the other evolution-tree type games out of the water. If you are a casual gamer, or you simply enjoy music, you will love this game straight from the tutorial. My only wish is for the game to be longer, as I finished the game and got every acheivement in about 10 hours of gameplay. My advice: take it slowly and enjoy the view!

												I usually don't do lengthy reviews on games, but this is one that interests me.Sparkle 2 Evo is a game where you eat stuff and grow. That's pretty much it for the concept. There are different things you can eat, which would be herbivore food, carnivore food, and omnivore food. No, they are not called plants, meat, or both.It's a pretty laid back game. In my experience, there really is no way to lose. The opponent AI is pretty dumbed down and moves at a snail's pace. There isn't much else to the game other than: eat, grow, repeat. It really doens't make much of a difference what you choose to eat either.If you choose to be a carnivore, you move faster, but you can only eat one thing at a time. If you choose to be an herbivore, you move significantly slower, but you can eat more things in an instance. I still have yet to figure out what's different about being an omnivore, since it's basically the same as being a carnivore.You basically pick red, blue, or green. Sound familiar?The control scheme is a bit weird. It's functional, but it's weird. You make incredibly wide turns and you'll find yourself running into walls a lot. At least with keyboard/mouse controls. You can pick either keyboard or mouse. I have yet to try out the controller, but I've heard that's what this game is meant for.At points, the game will just seem to drag out. You'll be searching through each layer several times once the level starts to run out of food. You don't win until all the food is eaten (in my experience), and since the opponent AI is slow and often idle, this may take a while. For as far as I've gotten, there really is no sense of urgency.Overall, I wouldn't know what to give this game on a 1-10 scale, but it's relaxing, and it's dirt cheap. If you've ever wanted an expanded version of the first stage in Spore, here it is.			"

												A nice collecting game, which only uses mouse drag (or WASD), clicking and scrolling. In it you have to collect three different elements, which after a while makes your species evolve. There are three different paths to take in the evolution (omnivore, herbivore and carnivore) and picking one doesn't restrict you from anything. The soundtrack is great, although it starts loop a little too much in the later stages, which are quite long and tedious.The game has few bugs, including getting stuck on a certain depth level, making you restart. Also some enemies can get stuck in walls, halting your progress. These should be fixed, since they are quite annoying.It's 3 hours to get all achievements, but I didn't complete all stages, since I got a bit bored in the end.			"

												The title only drives the artstyle of everything. It's like spore, but locked at the cell stage. You can customize your... Well, I never remember what the hell the main creature's called because it doesn't tell you, but anyways you eat small pellets, choosing growth paths, outgorging your opponents, or simply taking a moment to relax and play the game. As you go along you find different anemones made out of, for some reason, pellets. You eat the pellets then the creature and you get easy levels.

												This game is annoying.  It is pretty, and it's got some fun music, but the way it plays is frustrating.

I had hoped to get a more fleshed out version of Spore's first stage (which was what the game looked like), and I may have been disappointed because I had that expectation.  I also felt like the game controlled poorly, and was generally frustrating to play.  I didn't play it very far at all, and I regret buying it, even at $5.  I can do better.			"

												This is one of the strangest games i have ever played. The only way i can liken it to something is to say it is similar to the game 'Snake' but you cannot die. The competitive mode faces you off against an 'opponent' (i use the term loosely as yourarely encounter one another and the only evidence that there is an opponent is a small bar at the bottom telling you how much it has eaten) Whilst the gameplay is bizzare to say the least, It is oddly calming. In conjunction with the ambient soundtrack and the beautiful (allbeit bright) neon graphics, this game is an escape from many games and offers a wy to 'unwind'. Although i struggle to call it a 'game' as such with 0 storyline  and even the objective of the game seems abstract. Don't know if i can recommend this game either way but i have enjoyed it!			"

												The visuals are fantastic and concept is interesting, but gameplay could be tweaked to make this game much more enjoyable than it currently is. I bought this under the pretense that I would be able to pick ""perks"" for my creature as I leveled up and gathered pieces for the DNA tree. Instead the change is purely visual and picking only one feeding style (herbi/carni/omnivore) doesn't appear to have any major differences over the others. Another thing that annoyed me was that you couldn't be hurt or die. Being attacked by a larger creature simply makes you flee to a higher layer and is more of an annoyance than anything else. I never felt in any danger and overall the game felt too easy. Not a bad game by any means, but it could be much more exciting. 5/10.			"

												6.5/10Beautiful game. Beautiful graphics, beautiful soundtrack. A pleasure to play or even just watch it be played.In terms of gameplay, however, I think fl0w did a better job as a tide pool game. In fl0w, all creatures are made upof edible ""bits"" which other creatures can eat, including the player. This makes the player vulnerable in the same way as the bigger enemies in the later game - get all your ""bits"" eaten, and a bite to the head will be your death. Something like this would have made Sparkle 2 Evo far more exciting. There would be peril beyond just getting pushed up to a higher level.Furthermore, the DNA mechanics could have been made far more influential. Maybe it could be possible to have different physical traits from each of the three pathways. This could be reandomic, or dependent on which color each bar of the DNA gets filled (e.g. one line determines the mouth, another a leg, a bunch for the tail, etc.), or have the player choose. Dunno. It just feels kinda pointless as it is.Finally, needs more levels and different enemies. Maybe make it so certain enemies can only appear for a certain type of food (such as only red & blue fish; have the green fish replaced by algae stuck to the rocks, floating pieces of algae or something that is not a plant fish because WTF).

												Very gorgeous, relaxing, and all-around pleasant game. I played the recreational mode which strikes me as the far better option of the two modes given this style of game. It's not really challenging at all, but it's very enjoyable and the vibrant worlds are a delight to explore. The weakest point is probably the two large bosses, which admittedly can be a bit tedious compared to the rest. All in all though a very nice experience, though admittedly quite short. Though with how much I enjoyed playing through it once a second playthrough is all but assured from me at this point.			"

Enjoyed the ambient music in the backgroundThe premise of the game is to collect coloured orbs and level the creature up.  The orbs collected determine the type of creature that will evolve.There are two modes; competitive and non-competitive.  Competitive adds an AI that collects the orbs as well.  Collect more than the AI to win.  Non-competitive removes the AI and the goal is to collect all the orbs.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is pretty and relaxing. However, the gameplay is boring at best, the levels are unchallenging and the only decision you make, which is choosing whether you want to be omnivorous, herbivorous or carnivorous, has barely any impact on your creature and its evolution.

												Luckily, I own a touch screen computer because that's where the real value lies. I wasn't aware the mechanics would be so easy to control with my finger when I purchased it during the Summer Sale 2014 for about 75 - 80% off but I'm glad I made the impulsive purchase. There isn't many games that adapt to the touch screen mechanics very well but this game does and I'm enjoying my experience so far.			"

												I bought this game because I has a coupon and I must say I rather enjoyed it. Sparkle 2 Evo does heavily favor flOw in mechanics and general design. However, Sparkle 2 does address a few of the issues I had with flOw such as the time it took to eat a group of creatures and the lack of a major change in the appearance of the player creature. There is one thing I will specifically praise:-Visuals. The colorful, almost alien world of Sparkle 2 is definitely one of the highlights, creature design is overall just as impressive.The Sparkle's appearance also actively changes based on whichever color of food you focus on in that evolution segment. Even focusing on one color has dramatic changes as the Sparkle starts out as a small larva and eventually develops wings, legs, and assorted appendages.However, the game is not without its flaws, and they aren't in short supply: -Above all else, the game is relatively short (easily beaten with 100% in 2-3 hours) so don't expect a particularly engaging tale -The collision detection is somewhat off and sometimes the passable and impassable barriers were difficult to distinguish. -The beginning decision, carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore is little more than a ""Choose your color"" decision and overall has little effect on gameplay as your Sparkle can eat all colors regardless of their current forme.Overall, Sparkle 2 Evo is a short but enjoyable title that I recommend if you can get it on sale.

												This was a neat little game that I enjoyed quite a bit.It wasn't much of a challenge, but it did create a relaxing environment through its stunning visuals and soundtrack.My only downside was how short it was. Took me about 3 hours to nab all the achievements. I'd definitely be interested in extending my underwater adventure through any DLC or additional games down the road.			"

												A visually stunning and amazingly simple game. The audio provides a subtle soothing ambiance while playing through the levels in this game. Think Spore but not quite as complex. A simple concept done with great execution of style and gameplay. 8 out of 10 in my book. It loses points for the control behavior at times it gets in the way of itself and the obstacles in the environment seem to interfere with some mechanics of the game.			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo is not only beautiful, but relaxing as well. Its music and art take you into another world that makes you feel like you too are swimming along with alien like creatures. Honestly I would play this game much more if I didn't have to make the choice of either playing game, creating artwork, or doing college work. The price is wonderful, and while it is what you pay for is what you get, I am recommending this game to everyone and their mothers since its just that simple to play and great for all people of all ages all over the world.

												Reminds me of a game I used to play on my Dads phone many years ago.This game consists of eating ""Microelements"" which levels you up and eventually you evolve to a higher ""stage"". If you focus on red Microelements, you will become a carnivore, green Microelements turn you into herbivores and blue Microelements are omnivore traits. Each kind offers different ability's. (I have only played as a full on carnivore at this point in time), so being a carnivore gives you the ability to be agile.On the other hand the game is very pretty, with a calming ambient track in the background blending the game-play and graphics together nicely.Having only played this game for a hour, it is well made, but lacks challenge. Very casual game.8/10Images:-------

												This game is, as many have put it, visually stunning. It's also fairly straightforward, meaning there's not much to get confused about. My grandmother could probably play and she has trouble remembering how to play chess.That being said, it does progress at a very quick rate, and the achievements are easily obtained. Bear in mind that I haven't quite finished the game yet; however, I can't imagine it will be long.I really love this game. I must have whispered "" wow "" every thirty seconds. It is a very casual game, though, so those of you who prefer to have your teeth clenched tight as you play a game might not enjoy it very much. It's so relaxing.Even if you are the type to play rage games, this could prove to be a nice break from it. I got it when in was on sale very cheap, but had I known how good it was, I certainly would have paid full price.And that concludes my rambling speech.9/10			"

Sparkle 2 Evo review by NenokmagicI've finished the entire game and gained every single achievement associated with the game.I liked the game, I would see myself buying another one just like it with more levels and perhaps more dynamic gameplay.Gameplay: 7/10What I felt is that the game brought in some good simple gameplay that relaxes you.I that the game itself could use some more dynamic gameplay, since essentially that ""special"" power didn't really do a thing and you felt as if you had no use for it at all.Though I found one more fault in the game and it was the controls, I was so unlucky to be one of the few that got a bug that made my controls not work correctly. Making the gameplay experience a bit strained as I had to restart the game from the start. Graphics: 9/10Simply stunning in my opinion, they feel clean and uncut. Though having a more of a bubble feeling when it comes down to it is quite the opposite, for you find great detail in the colors themselves immersing you into the gameThe game having a wide selection of options when it comes down to picking a graphical face for the game.Why not 10/10 even though there is little fault if any to the graphics, there is simply something there you cannot put your thumb over.Story - None If you are someone that likes story in games, then this game is not for you having no explanation nor understanding what you are doing, do you find yourself eating these blue, red or green bubbles in order to grow. While at the same time you are feasting as some type of parasite on creatures of the sea. Music: 7/10I found the music itself great at times having a deep immersion though I found it break at times as a certain ""song"" started, giving me this annoying immersion break, which I found of course extremely bad. The music itself is played over and over so you get quickly turned off from it, but while it lasted you’re going to be in a zone you wish you could stay in.Summary Good game, could be better. But for the cost it is asking for a definite yes, if you want a casual relaxing game which you can simply sit back and enjoy the atmosphere. "

												It has pretty colors and horrible controls. I chose a carnovore but that really didn't matter because if I accidently bumped into another color (which happened all the time because the red ones were buried in the middle of them) then you still ate it, which defeats the purpous of chosing in the first place.

You just kinda plug in your control and chill with this game. that is once you figure out the damn controls; that said go throught the tutorial kidos, i didnt and it was annoying (all my fault, not the game)worth a couple of bucks, and the evolution is pretty cool. you are what you eat, and there are 3 diff things to eat that effect how your creature looks and plays. I went for the green path so could suck down food faster, but red made you move really fast which was cool. and im rambleing w/eanyway just buy it for a low key time killing relaxing game			"

  Sparkle 2 Evo  Sparkle 2 Evo is a very slow progressing game, it allows you to relax and enjoy the every level.I really recommend this game, especially after a day of work or college. You can really relax and chill out after a big stressy day, and I enjoy replaying levels to chill out for longer.The game is really beautifully designed and the music is very relaxing to listen to, Would be cool if you released the soundtrack on Steam. I hope a Sparkle 3 game is made, if it does I'll buy it as soon as it comes out. Maybe add a progressively hardening sandbox mode, so we get to evolve it multiple times. Maybe also have an option when you evolve or level up to add parts to your creature, like possibly like this: You have evolved, choose you evolution part:  Claws (+1 Damage) Shell armour (+4 Defense) Stamina (+2 Speed) Thicker Skin (+15 HP)Good luck with any of your future games,   -Spectral_King			"

												A nice collecting game, which only uses mouse drag (or WASD), clicking and scrolling. In it you have to collect three different elements, which after a while makes your species evolve. There are three different paths to take in the evolution (omnivore, herbivore and carnivore) and picking one doesn't restrict you from anything. The soundtrack is great, although it starts loop a little too much in the later stages, which are quite long and tedious.The game has few bugs, including getting stuck on a certain depth level, making you restart. Also some enemies can get stuck in walls, halting your progress. These should be fixed, since they are quite annoying.It's 3 hours to get all achievements, but I didn't complete all stages, since I got a bit bored in the end.			"

												A visually stunning and amazingly simple game. The audio provides a subtle soothing ambiance while playing through the levels in this game. Think Spore but not quite as complex. A simple concept done with great execution of style and gameplay. 8 out of 10 in my book. It loses points for the control behavior at times it gets in the way of itself and the obstacles in the environment seem to interfere with some mechanics of the game.			"

												I bought this game because I has a coupon and I must say I rather enjoyed it. Sparkle 2 Evo does heavily favor flOw in mechanics and general design. However, Sparkle 2 does address a few of the issues I had with flOw such as the time it took to eat a group of creatures and the lack of a major change in the appearance of the player creature. There is one thing I will specifically praise:-Visuals. The colorful, almost alien world of Sparkle 2 is definitely one of the highlights, creature design is overall just as impressive.The Sparkle's appearance also actively changes based on whichever color of food you focus on in that evolution segment. Even focusing on one color has dramatic changes as the Sparkle starts out as a small larva and eventually develops wings, legs, and assorted appendages.However, the game is not without its flaws, and they aren't in short supply: -Above all else, the game is relatively short (easily beaten with 100% in 2-3 hours) so don't expect a particularly engaging tale -The collision detection is somewhat off and sometimes the passable and impassable barriers were difficult to distinguish. -The beginning decision, carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore is little more than a ""Choose your color"" decision and overall has little effect on gameplay as your Sparkle can eat all colors regardless of their current forme.Overall, Sparkle 2 Evo is a short but enjoyable title that I recommend if you can get it on sale.

												Sparkle 2 Evo is pretty and relaxing. However, the gameplay is boring at best, the levels are unchallenging and the only decision you make, which is choosing whether you want to be omnivorous, herbivorous or carnivorous, has barely any impact on your creature and its evolution. I was a little disappointed. Still, it was not entirely unenjoyable. In short, Sparkle 2 Evo offers a stress-free experience in a beautiful environment, but not much more.			"

												Luckily, I own a touch screen computer because that's where the real value lies. I wasn't aware the mechanics would be so easy to control with my finger when I purchased it during the Summer Sale 2014 for about 75 - 80% off but I'm glad I made the impulsive purchase. There isn't many games that adapt to the touch screen mechanics very well but this game does and I'm enjoying my experience so far.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game all the time, but I'd only get it when it's on sale. It's definitely a different game, but far from a good game. The first problem I had with this game was the lack of explanation. It told you the basic idea of the game at the start and immediatly threw you into the deep end hoping you'll figure it out by yourself. There were multiple hours acrossed a few days where I had no idea what to do to progress further in the game. I finally gave up and looked up some form of help, which thankfully there was some in the steam guide section for the game. The gameplay itself is really simple and fun once you figure the game out.The graphics on the other hand are amazing. It reminded me of geometry wars. The design for all the different species and environments took me by surprise each time I saw them. So TL:DR pick this game up if you can get it really cheap, otherwise I'd wait.			"

Sparkle 2 Evo review by NenokmagicI've finished the entire game and gained every single achievement associated with the game.I liked the game, I would see myself buying another one just like it with more levels and perhaps more dynamic gameplay.Gameplay: 7/10What I felt is that the game brought in some good simple gameplay that relaxes you.I that the game itself could use some more dynamic gameplay, since essentially that ""special"" power didn't really do a thing and you felt as if you had no use for it at all.Though I found one more fault in the game and it was the controls, I was so unlucky to be one of the few that got a bug that made my controls not work correctly. Making the gameplay experience a bit strained as I had to restart the game from the start. Graphics: 9/10Simply stunning in my opinion, they feel clean and uncut. Though having a more of a bubble feeling when it comes down to it is quite the opposite, for you find great detail in the colors themselves immersing you into the gameThe game having a wide selection of options when it comes down to picking a graphical face for the game.Why not 10/10 even though there is little fault if any to the graphics, there is simply something there you cannot put your thumb over.Story - None If you are someone that likes story in games, then this game is not for you having no explanation nor understanding what you are doing, do you find yourself eating these blue, red or green bubbles in order to grow. While at the same time you are feasting as some type of parasite on creatures of the sea. Music: 7/10I found the music itself great at times having a deep immersion though I found it break at times as a certain ""song"" started, giving me this annoying immersion break, which I found of course extremely bad. The music itself is played over and over so you get quickly turned off from it, but while it lasted you’re going to be in a zone you wish you could stay in.Summary Good game, could be better. But for the cost it is asking for a definite yes, if you want a casual relaxing game which you can simply sit back and enjoy the atmosphere. "

												It's very chill and quite reminiscent of the cell stage in the Spore franchise. The perks you get from the three possible classes aren't so far apart, but different enough that it changes gameplay. The fact that I haven't found a way to die yet is quite odd, meaning you can't lose unless you play against AI. (Which at the moment isn't providing much competition.) Graphics are lovely eye candy though, so that's a great plus for me.Overall:Not the most engaging game out there, which might explain the 90% discount when I got it, but entertaining for those slow afternoons.

												In short this game felt like a Flow clone.  It's slightly unpolished, but it doesn't detract from the gameplay too much.  The instruction/help segments reminded me of a JRPG text sequence rather than an informative help source.  I enjoyed the ease of movement through the different depths of the level, but the level geometry that you can move through and cannot move through is hard to discern.  I would've liked to see the creatures coast a little more upon movement button release rather than skidding to an immediate stop.  The movment also felt a little clunky in the sense that you can't turn unless you are moving.TLDR: Has potential, needs polishing. 6.5/10			"

												This game, like Morphopolis, is a collecting game. However, more functionality is present in this game vs Morphopolis.The principle is simple: Eat a number of a certain colored orbs, and you gain some traits related to that color. There are three colors: Blue, Green, and Red. Different ratios of orbs results in different appearances. You are able to die, so you have to be methodical with how you play, but can be played casually without issue.I don't believe it's worth full price, but the game is known to drop below $1 during sales.

												This game is good. If you have played Spore, think of it as a slightly more advanced version of the first stage, and nothing more. The gameplay might not be much but it is relaxing, and its a great way to kill time. The style of the game s beautiful and the soundtrack is very nice. For the price, it's a nice game if you just need something relaxing to do to finish a day.8/10 would eat sea creatures again.(Get it on sale for 49 cents while you can!!)			"

												Sparkle 2 Evo was a game that i found myself to not enjoy on first sight, however as the game went on, i found it very relaxing and entertaining in a sort of way. It is a game that you could easily sink 1.5 - 2 hours in, It consists of the main animal (thing) of eating other blobs to grow, which later you would begin eating other animals aswell. This was entertaining as i (personally) haven't played any of the other games that are based on eating smaller animals to grow, etc.It had beautiful, consistant graphics and each new animal and background i discovered all shocked me, as they really were beautiful. However, it is not a game i would see myself playing again, as it just doesn't seem like one of those games you would play over and over.I rate it a 8/10.			"

												Nice, atmospheric little game with a decent soundtrack. Inexpensive and good to fill time with, though can be a bit tedious when trying to find that last bit to clear a level.Eat or...be stunned...or kicked up a level. There's no real way to die I could find. The levelling of stages looks pretty much the same regardless of what path you choose. The controls can be buggy and prevent you from getting achievements.Not a bad game for the price but I don't want to spend the time to repeat the game over and over just to try and get the last two achievements. Might possibly install it again later to play but not in a hurry to do so.If I had the option, I'd rank this game as a neutral. I'll recommend this game for the graphics and sound. Not so much for the control bugs and tediousness.			"

												A relaxing game of ""eat the coloured bubbles"", with the occasional ""avoid the enemy, then eat it"". Sparkle 2 Evo has you playing as a tiny, crystaline organism, that slowly evolves into different forms based on what colour(s) you eat. Red turns you into a fast attack-type, green turns you into a slow defense-type, and blue is a mixture of both. Your looks, abilities, and speed all change depending on what you choose.While enjoyable, this game is very casual, and more of a stress-reliever than anything actually competitive. Buy it on sale if you want something calming to play when you're stressed out.			"

												When they mentioned ""Dreamlike visuals"", and ""Immersive music"", they weren't kidding. When I got this game, I didn't realize how much of a unique game this was. Sparkle 2 Evo totally blew all the other evolution-tree type games out of the water. If you are a casual gamer, or you simply enjoy music, you will love this game straight from the tutorial. My only wish is for the game to be longer, as I finished the game and got every acheivement in about 10 hours of gameplay. My advice: take it slowly and enjoy the view! It doesn't hurt to have a good pair of headphones on hand for the great music!			"

  Sparkle 2 Evo  Sparkle 2 Evo is a very slow progressing game, it allows you to relax and enjoy the every level.I really recommend this game, especially after a day of work or college. You can really relax and chill out after a big stressy day, and I enjoy replaying levels to chill out for longer.The game is really beautifully designed and the music is very relaxing to listen to, Would be cool if you released the soundtrack on Steam. I hope a Sparkle 3 game is made, if it does I'll buy it as soon as it comes out. Maybe add a progressively hardening sandbox mode, so we get to evolve it multiple times. Maybe also have an option when you evolve or level up to add parts to your creature, like possibly like this: You have evolved, choose you evolution part:  Claws (+1 Damage) Shell armour (+4 Defense) Stamina (+2 Speed) Thicker Skin (+15 HP)Good luck with any of your future games,   -Spectral_King			"

												Sparkle 2: Evo is one of the prettiest crappy games I've ever seen. It looks so nice and sleek, the design is all shiny and beautiful looking, but the gameplay itself is terrible. You basically swim around with clunky controls (which where the developer's intentions, mind you, but they're a little overdone and can just be down-right infuriating to use) and eat small pieces of food. You either eat red, green, or blue, to become a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore, respectively. But it doesn't really matter, since you can't control evolution anyway, you basically change shape for a few levels then you just stay the same from what I can see. You can't modify your creature like in SPORE (which this is clearly a ripoff of), there's no real fights or anything, you basically can just swim in misshapen circles and try to eat the tails of enemies without hitting their heads, and you just clear the food out from level to level. Yawn! Sparkle 2: Evo is sometimes frustrating and always very boring, which is a real bummer because it looks so pretty.4.1/10			"

If you dont care about gameplay and only about how the game looks, this game is for you, but for someone like me who needs both to be good, graphics have to look somewhat nice and story be good. I do not recommend. If there is a major update and improves gameplay, I may take a look at that, but I dont think thats going to come. For me, Waste of Money.			"

												Sparkle is the successor of FLOW. The idea is to see how a game “flows” and keeps a player engaged. Sparkle 2 loses some of its minimalism and adds some evolutions to the mix. You can go for a Herbivore, Carnivore, or Omnivore and each one has it’s positives and negatives powers.			"

												It feels like this ""game""'s sole purpose is the mingling of beautiful graphics and sound. And this is ok, if relaxing colors are what you want. It was for me, because after reading a few reviews, I didn't expect more (and got it on sale).But: I cannot play the game for more than ten minutes straight, because the constant circling and the general ""fluffiness"" of the movements just make me feel dizzy. After 15 minutes, this starts to turn into sickness.So as great as the game looks, people prone to seasickness might get problems.			"
