Early Access Review
								There is nothing happening with this game aside from meaningless trade item updates.Whats actually wrong:1. No factions. This alone breaks the game by it's very nature. There are things to do like trading and mining but these things are pointless given the fact that you can just hang around a space station killing everyone who leaves and then selling the loot to said space station without anyone being upset about the means in which you acquired these goods.2. There is no galaxy. It's just an illusion. All solar systems are basically empty, sure there may be a star and some planets but the only thing to interact with is space stations. A vast majority of the galaxy has zero space stations so there is no reason to venture beyond more than 3-5 solar systems in your entire play though. Also, every Earth-like planet is literally Earth.3. No AI whatsoever. All enemy ships follow the exact same pattern of attack. This is most evident if you alter the games files to allow yourself enough speed to outrun the enemy. All enemies will spot you, dive towards you firing at you while never trying to lead you with there weapons. They will fly by you and turn to shoot again. If you go faster than them by editing the games files to get in front of them they will ignore you and turn away from you to shoot at where you should be. After collecting all the ships and playing through the game I initially thought there was a lot of reason to think Drifter had a really bright future. However, after seeing none of this games issues ever being addressed in an honest light by the Dev and seeing updated that included literally nothing but items the players could have added themselves by playing with the game files I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Nor do I think anything is really going to come of Drifter. Instead of making a game I believe this developer is concentrating on making the illusion of a game.Tip: You can save at a station, exit the game, reload and the station will have 50% of it's inventory respawned!

								I know this game has missed its original launch window by a lot, however I am so glad they aren't rushing. Even looking at the 8 months since last beta release would make you think this is not worth investing in as it may turn out as vapourware. I'd implore you to follow the main Dev on Twitter @celsiusgs as he is always tweeting screenshots and progress. As well as interacting with fans. I just tweeted him an hour ago about an issue and he already responded. So far (version 0.53) it is a lot of fun. You start off with a capable, fast ship with a pair of small lasers outfitted. From the first few minutes, without upgrades, I was able to pick a fight with 3 other ships, destroying one and escaping in my damaged ship. I wish I had better macro support on Mac, my Saitek Command Unit would cover most of my controls but it's a painful process on my platform. That being said, the controls are pretty straight forward but I'd like the option to access all options from the keyboard. If I am walking into a situation that I know I may not be able to handle then I plot an escape route. It would be much quicker to hit a key to engage my pre-planned jump rather than click on my ship then click the jump button from the radial menu that pops up. Trading has been fun, although I'm less of a trader. Prices do very heavily system to system so its worth taking the time to learn some good routes and run them. Myself though, I prefer taking patrol missions to chase down pirates for funds. Now exploring is where this gets really fun for me. Since its a 20,000 star system, procedually generated galaxy there is so much unknown. There is greater diversity, more detailed systems and features that will make it all the more fun down the road but as of the May release I already enjoy exploration. I played Outer Empires online for a few years and I loved exploring the 20,000 star system galaxy for years. When NPC communication comes out it will be far more interactive and immersive, I look forward to that as an Explorer. So far my interactive choices are protect, shoot or leave alone. Pretty fun choices but the promised NPC comms system will be a huge step forward.Well thats my impressions of the current version.The progress towards 1.0 is taking a bit of time but the new features, graphical updates and love being put into this game make me patient to wait. Until then I'll enjoy what I can currently play: 8 ships as a trader, explorer, pirate, merc, etc in a 20,000 star system sandbox. Somehow I think I'll occupy my time.			"

								I backed Drifter on Kickstarter. It got funded in juni 2012. More than 3 years later next to nothing has changed. Might still have  potential, but the developer probably doesn't care anymore. Very infrequent updates change next to nothing.I'll revise this review if this game ever gets finished.			"

								Tons of potential, but in my mind not really ready for even early access.  The tutorial was frustrating to figure out, the radial menu is very much not clear.  My main problem though is the game is paced way too slow.  My first mission I got wanted me to deliver an object to another system.  Ok, fine.  I figured out how to plot the course and noticed it was 57 jumps away...ok...  I did my first jump to see how it works and noticed the jump drive disables for a 60 second cooldown.  57 jumps = 57 minutes IF you jump exactly on the cooldown second every time.  That's pretty poor design.Buy it if you want to support it.  There is tons of potential here and I expect it will be greatly improved.  This is the reason I am recommending it, but if you don't know how to read my review and can only look at the thumb then I can't help you.			"

								I've played Drifter for 70+ hours pre-Steam, and while there is a steep learning curve at the moment and a lack of content in some areas, the level of detail and the all around playability already make it one of the better space trading sims out there. One of the first things you'll notice when starting a new game is that your ship follows the laws of momentum, and doesn't come to a full stop every time you thrust in a different direction. Couple this with projectiles and energy weapons that take time to reach their target, and you get tense and often disorienting battles, fighting as much with the laws of physics as with the pirates that want whatever it is you have.Outside of a few core systems the galaxy is procedurally populated with star systems and destinations, some friendly and reliable, others viciously hostile teeming with marauders. there's trading opportunities everywhere, and it's up to you how safe you want to play it.As for the trading, it's a steady if slightly shallow source of income. However the framework for it is in place, with regional price differences and the need to balance what you can carry with what will make you the most money, and with this being Early Access new content is always in the works.Like with trading, the available missions are steady cash flow but a touch mundane, with patrol missions being the preferred combo of seeing new places and blowing up things.All in all, the fanatical level of polish and the overall level of detail, combined with the devotion of the devs and the steady stream of new content make Drifter a very highly recommended purchase.

								So you feel like playing an open world space game, but you don't want to go HAM and play one of the super complex/hard ones like Elite Dangerous, Oolite or even EVE? This game got you covered!Drifter has all the elements you would expect from a good space exploration/""simulation"" game but packaged in a much more casual way, while still feeling very sandboxy with little handholding.Things you can do with this game:All the activities you would expect you could do: Trading, bounty hunting, mining, courier jobs etc.Play with your left hand while drinking a cup of coffee with your right hand! Drifter has very simple controls and you can reach almost everything with your WASD hand. Only the occasional mouse input is needed. Gamepad's an option too.Experience the thrill of a newtonian physics model! But this time it's much less of a mindfluck because it's restricted to a 2D plane.Play it on your old computer! Has constant 60 FPS on my ancient Linux machine which has only 2GB RAM which it has to share with the low-spec Intel integrated graphics card. Yep! Awesome performance!All in all even with the limited scope of the early access beta Drifter has hit a wonderful balance of simplicty and open world space simulation and I'm excited to see how the final game will look like!

Early Access Review
								In its current state I can hardly recommend this early-access game. I bought this game following the anouncement of the developer that the release 1.0 version would occur in 2015 and checking quickly the current ""roadmap"".Apparently the developer insists on making a game with 20k systems in a huge galaxy and I was not impressed after 11 hours of gameplay, which is pretty much all I needed to exhaust the current content of the game, having made more than 60 millions creds in that period of time. Now I am fully aware of the early access status and I do not mind missing features or placeholders.The current graphical content is pretty nice, music is ok. What bothers me is here below and is mainly about gameplay, UI and game design:A. TRADINGEconomy is not dynamic - if you like to trade, that means you find a route or two and with each jump it will reset the quantity of good on each planet, allowing you to ""grind"" the same spot all the time (boring really quick though).In fact, trading is pretty straight forward, you calculate how much profit you make per ton on each merchandise and depending on the quantities available on each station (and your cargo capacity) then you start the grinding (hundreds of times).Asteroids systems! Sucks. Depending on your spawn point after jumping, you may end up having to cross the belt 2 times to reach the station.Launch from starbase sequence - 10 seconds wasted (I use this timeframe to setup my navigation). Option to deactivate game cinematics (or shorten them)?Wait for docking bay? Wtf mechanic, occurs NPC ships are docking and you may end up waiting up to 40 seconds doing nothing. <-- Apparently this was fixed in 0.6.2 Thumbs up!Horrible UI - hope it will get improved. For example if you check the (nice feature) remote trading offers, you don't see the quantity of goods in your current station and you cannot purchase directly from this part of the UI. Basically you have to press ESC (or the cross) three time, then press a button to exit the pilot area, press a button to go the trade area, then press another button to go to the stock exchange. By then, you better remember which goods you may make a profit with, and if you have creds and space left, well, you have to redo the whole thing again to fill your cargo.B. COMBATPretty simple technique, it only gets difficult when you face multiple enemies. The AI basically charge you, pass you by, rotate and repeat. It is bugged for the slower ship if you get close enough to it and the ""thougher"" enemy in game is actually only a time waster (well, till you get more decent equip, with the max gear, they are sitting ducks and blow very fast like anything else)Itemization is too simple. I expected a simple game in terms of combat but to that level?!? So you have Guns and Missiles. Guns are divided in 3 main types, each of which has 3 main archetypes (low damage+fast, average everything, high damage+slow put it simply)- kinetic, uses ammo and consume little to no energy- beam, continuous high damage and low range- energy bolts, average damageMissile are divided in 2 main types which are rockets (dumbfire) and missile (guided) with variants like MK2 shooting and locking faster or dual fire launcher.And that's it.Defensive systems and upgrade rely on the same simplicity and archetypes, i.e. your can setup armor that increase your speed/manoeuvrability at the cost of HP's, or setup an armor that reduce those while increasing HP.No encounters beside missions. Well, civilian ships you may attack, but that is pretty much it.Once you found a technique (even vs 3 opponents) to dish out damage while allowing your shield to recharge (taking a few hits is inevitable), combat really is simple and quickly boring. Beside, once you upgrade with anything but starting lasers and equipment, you roll over anything. Boring (if I did not mention it several times already).C. MININGYou can buy a mining laser, which take the space of your guns. You drop more Ore when you finally destroy an asteroid.You can destroy asteroid faster than with a mining laser with your normal weapons, you don't get the extra Ore drop yet you still mine faster than with mining stuff and it makes it up for it.Once you go back to a station with your cargo full hoping for profit, surprise! You can do only one thing with the various types of Ores which is find a mission which ask you to provide some.D. BOUNTY HUNTING & MISSIONSPatrol missions - the most rewarding and also the longest - are a pain in the neck. While the mission spawns some pirates (usually offering individual bounties that are altogether worth 3-4-5 times the final reward) which is nice, you still have to go through sometimes 5, 6 or more waypoints with no visual feedback if you cleared that one or not. At the end for a simple game, it tends to get you to do a lot of things in a complicated manner. Also, sometimes... well actually most of the time, you cannot complete the mission because somehow there is either a bug or a ship spawned or goes anywhere but near the waypoints (2 or 3 hours of my playtime where actually spent drifting in circles in the same galaxy till eventually I gave up)Other missions and single target missions are ok, nothing amazing though.E. PIRACYMost likely the most fun. Civilian ships spawns around stations (or if you want extra challenge, attack miners in asteroid belts as the rocks are the most dangerous).Sadly not challenging at all, unless you shoot 3-4 ships and make them all hostile, civilian don't help each others and no security force shows up or anything.Loot system is currently frustrating at early stages, as most of the time ships do not drop anything. If they do drop stuff, it is only equipement. This makes it pretty profitable to grind some civilian ships for a while, especially when you are already geared with with decent stuff (I personally prefer the 3 guns/2 missiles fighter) and usually destroy any ship in 1 passage. Sadly there is no much point anymore at this stage for making money.F. USER IINTERFACE, GUI & SETTINGSKeybinding lacks options. Why is there even a ""mouse control"" option ('m') if I cannot assign stuff to mouse buttons?Too many unecessary steps and chores (going back and forth) are induced by bad UI choices. In a game of this simplicity you would expect more attention to such things (do the developers play their game? or games at all?)The acceleration mode is slow to engage and could also be improved. Ending up waiting 40-60 seconds to reach a station is fun the first 20 times, then it gets annoying.I did not expect a complex game, neither that is what I wished for. I was fine with an Elite-lite concept. Yet, considering the game is to be released in 6 months, I fear most of this time will be set to fill in the graphical place holders and add a few new features. Although the base is not solid and this game, even at realease, may only be ""fun for a few hours"". Its prettiness (both graphical and sound, which are both more than decent for the price tag) won't make me forget that I personally prefer content (and I do not mean 20k systems here, but a gameplay reason that will ensure I will be willing to spend enough time to be willing to visit them). Content that may drastically lack even at the end of 2015.I reserve myself the right to modify or remove this review should I be sufficiently and positively suprised by the final product which I really hope. This game has potential, but in its current state and even for such a low pricetag I cannot recommend it.			"

It has inertia!  This may annoy the hell out of you, and you've now been warned at least once to know that that means.  Inertia annoys a lot of people in space combat games, but here's how you figure out if you hate it or not: Independence War.  That is all you need to know about Inertial space combat.  This is in a 2D plane so it's a little bit easier, so if you thought Independence War was difficult, don't worry because I completely agree, IW2 was!This game is a lot of fun.  Big Picture mode friendly!  It is very controller friendly, even in beta!  That may not matter to you, but that's a plus for a lot of people.  You might be annoyed to know that you NEED a mouse (at this point), but in the tutorial I only needed it 3 times, and after that just to interact with inventory, look at map easier, etc.  Still, just a bit.  It's definitely a PC game, not a mobile port or dumbed down for a controller, if anything it does the same thing as Freelancer did and gives us a simulation without requiring a joystick.I'm pretty sure I voted No in Greenlight but my memory is a little fuzzy on that so I may have clicked 'Yes of Course This Game Is Great And Belongs on Steam!'.  That's what the button says, right?  I'm backpedaling really hard so my memory is fuzzy on that subject.  Either way, yes it's worth the price of a movie.  Whatever metric exists for you at $10-15 for a big screen entertainment ration.It's still BETA, it says in the top left corner, so if anything about beta versions bothers you (UI, etc) wait for the final release!  It's got a bright blue Early Access box for a reason.It's good.  Real good.I would arguably say it's the same gameplay as Freelancer.  Considering the video and screenshots, take that for what it's worth.  If you think I'm a fool to compare this game to the AMAZING FREELANCER then it's 5/10.If you possibly think I'm right, it's (Freelancer +9/10) =  9/10 (-Freelancer)If you don't like space games, go read The Hyperion Cantos.9/10 - Early Access, Beta, etc			"

								I bought this a couple days ago after reading about the recent update and watching a few vids and reading some comments.. I gotta tell you that I'm pleasantly suprised!I've been exploring, trading, policing and doing a bit of mining also. Honestly I had to make myself stop playing earlier after noticing I put in 35 hours in 2 1\2 days! It has some user interface issues and a few glitches getting into starbases, also its lacking content, but I can see how populating a whole galaxy might take a bit of time. The galaxy is absolutely massive though, there has to be thousands of solar systems, and though some look similar they are all different.All in all I'm very impressed with what I've played so far. Once they fix the UI and make some hotbuttons or full 360 support, plus some more assets and content, I'll be putting a ton of time into this..			"

								It's definitly a rough sketch of a game that has potential. I had some fun with it, but that's only after I used Cheat Engine to derp around with with everything this game has to offer. It's lacking a lot of content at this point, and there's a ton of things, such as the UI, that feel very disjointed from the ""theme"" of the game, or lack there of.I understand game development isn't easy by any standard, and I get that it's hard to see your work getting bashed with negative reviews; however, I won't stand here and say ""you should get this game because the developers care"" because the developers really do still care. Just because they care doesn't mean this is a product that's up to par, and this being an early access game doesn't make that an exuse. It's been 2 years. This is a wake-up call, and the devs need to step it. "

								Now, I saw one or two make mention that this game was trying to be Freelancer or Privateer. All right, maybe it is trying to get that in there a little bit.And yes, the flight and combat is only along two dimensions and therefore is a bit flat (I am so sorry, I wasn't thinking when I wrote that....).But I have to say, for an early access, I actually rather like this. Sure, you won't make a huge gob of cash without a lot of work and all, but for myself... well, it's like this.1) I rather like the graphics setup, particularly the slipstream. It's quite nice, and heck, I'm running on a lappy with ""inferior"" graphics capabilities. So hey, that has to be worth something.2) I am REALLY digging the soundtrack. I'm hoping the developers will make it part of the DLC content (gimme gimme nau....) if they don't release it on general principle. (Big hunt devs!)3) The controls are fairly straightforward honestly. Mind, it would be nice if text tags came up as you mouse over the radial menu, but that's just a polite suggestion.I look forward to seeing how this one progresses. Nice one, devs. Good on ya.			"

								I'm editing this review to include the following, at the top so it's the first thing you read:I'm so glad I got this game. I've really been stressing over RL crap and finding it difficult to unwind with my usual passion: video games! But Drifter strikes just the right balance, for me, between therapeutic and engaging. And that is a big deal. Now, on to the review.Drifter is a small indie studio's contribution to the space-pilot sandbox genre. It is set to small but evocative soundtrack by the acclaimed Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Crypt of the Necrodancer, etc.) and features a 2.5D game engine.Pros:- Ships and equipment are varied and detailed enough to facilitate custom load-outs that are actually meaningful for a particular niche or combination of niches- A very large network of interconnected solar systems, each with a security/economic rating- Varied and engaging gameplay: mining asteroids*, fending off pirates, being a pirate, and a surprisingly diverse set of mission types- Several flight modes: normal, afterburner, ""slipstream"", and interstellar ""jump""- Solid music, sound, and graphics- Runs well on low end machines- A promising road map by a responsive developer (including crafting, factions, etc.).  Bug reports and suggestions are quickly addressed.* A quick note on mining: it's quite engaging compared to other games! You mine by shooting the asteroids with your weapons until they explode, dropping ore. Running into an asteroid damages your shields, so navigate asteroid fields with care. Modules confer the ability to scan nearby asteroids to determine their ore content, and create a local gravitational field to pull the mined ore to the hold. In short, farewell to clicking a button and going afk.Neutral:- Newtonian flight, i.e., inertia is conserved. I personally prefer this but some people hate it.- Loot including mined ore is destructible, so you need a light trigger finger. I actually don't mind and see it as adding flavor, but this will really irk some people.- Capacitor is drained by afterburners and some weapons, and recharges given the opportunity. Again, I personally find this to be a feature, but others will disagree. Note that there are capacitor upgrades.Cons:- Some bugs (nothing game-breaking in my experience thus far, though)- The UI needs work. It's not hard to figure out and is smooth once you do, but is rough around the edges and missing some intuitive affordances.All in all, this is a solid buy and I recommend that you give it a try.

Early Access Review
								I was skeptical at first about the 2d space sim, but it won me over with solid gameplay, and great trading system.  I am a little disappointed by the lack of variety, or information about the various planets.  It would be nice to do some exploring of the planets and learn interesting facts, or find artifacts to sell or something.  Instead you get a very generic description of the planet.  The stars all look the same, and there seems to be a limited ammount of space stations.  But the fighting, trading, and ship customization is very well done.  I don't know what all I can buy to add to ships, but I have been so torn by ship setups that I have parts in storage that I will switch out to change my fighter into a hauler, or my hauler into a miner.  Sounds like I may be discouraging you to buy, but it truly is addictive and fun to play.  That's what truly matters.Pros:Huge galaxypretty graphicsinteresting tactical battles with good physics (especially when taking on a pack of enemies)Trading is fun and rewarding if you can haul enough in your ship and investigate the stations along your mission track.strangely addictive.mission system that keeps you moving about the galaxy instead of just hanging around one area.has an auto dock function!!!  (after playing elite dangerous I sooooo love this) btw I know you can put an auto dock on your ship but it takes up a valuable spot where you could have something more important to the acutal gameplay in elite dangerous.cons:limited missions.killing enemies is the best way to make money instead of hauling or mining or missions.  unbalanced in that way.solar systems are too similar.  Sure that asteroid field can make a fight more challenging, but that's about it from what I've seen.  We want rewards for checking out the various planets and stars!!no real exploring.  Every system is populated that I've seen.needs more ship variety.			"

								I play a number of games like this including Elite: Dangerous, X2, X3, Jumpdrive, etc, but the issue is that, to really unlock the potential of those games, you need at good joystick and throttle/hotas set. Sure, you can fumble around trying to fly via a keyboard and mouse, but, meh, as I said, you'll be losing most of those games' true potential by doing so. Fortunately I have a good joystick and throttle/hotas set but I know not everyone does ... or sometimes you might not be in the mood to do all of that fancy precision flying.One nice thing about Drifter is that you can fly with the keyboard and mouse or with a fairly simple gamepad. Granted, I'm not trying to sell the game on that point alone, but sometimes that helps.Drifter simply suffers from the same problem all space trader games suffer from -- the game takes place in space and space is ... wait for it ... wait for it ... EMPTY! That's right folks! There's just not a whole lot to see in space except background stars and a few planets. People, I think, are spoiled by earth-bound games that offer endless sights and locales to explore. Even ""empty"" terrain is filled with trees, mountains, random monsters to slay, ruins to explore, caves to discover, rivers, paths and trails, forgotten treasure, and, what's more, that terrain can vary. Over here, you're exploring the snowy wastes of a dwarven stronghold and 100 hours into the game and you're hacking your way through the jungles of a ""Mayan"" ruin. But space is, well ... space. While, sure, you might encounter the odd shipwreck, floating cargo container, anomalous rescue beacon,  pirate base, black hole, or asteroid belt containing a rare metal, one solar system is going to look pretty much like all the others. Even if an ambitious Dev sat down and hand crafted tens of thousands of planets to place in thousands of solar systems, would you notice the difference from one planet to the next? Or would you, like many others, simply whine about how all the systems are the same and there's really no point to exploring? Space games require a bit more imagination than the standard game because you really have to immerse yourself in the idea of BEING there in order for any space game to be truly fun. Even a game as epic and visually stunning as Elite: Dangerous requires that mentality. Yeah, the Drifter dev could stand to sprinkle some surprises around the various systems, that much is true ... and maybe he has. I haven't been everywhere. The best thing the dev could do is make his universe a bit more dynamic. But many of the thumbs down boos I've seen have resulted in the standard ""no duh"" complaints from people who only play games to beat them as fast as they can, some shamelessly admitting to using exploits, bugs, and file alterations to do so. Now ... seriously ... where's the fun in that?  It's a bit like saying, ""The game is horrible because I can get rich doing the same mission running freight between the same two star systems 500 times. There's no reason to go anywhere else!""  Well, yeah, but if that's really how and why you play computer games, perhaps you need a new hobby like, say, solving quadratic equations or something. Ya know?Drifter isn't perfect but it is fun. If you're one of those players who are only interested in logging in, going right for the throat of the game, beating it, and moving on to the next game, then it might not be for you. But if you're like me and enjoy fiddling around with games, smelling the roses, playing the hell out of a game until you've squeezed every last drop of possible enjoyment out of it (and then coming back to it a year later for even more enjoyment) you'll almost certainly enjoy Drifter.

Early Access Review
								I'm going to sound like an old man, but this game has tried (and totally failed) to be like Freelancer, a game over a decade old which did a much better job with every aspect of space combat, travel, mercantilism, politics, and graphics.The UI is painful. Lots of ""undefined"" stuff, horrific clashing colors, unclear buttons and needing to navigate all over the place just to be able to buy goods or leave a space station. Not to mention scrollbars which use mac-style scrolling (where scrolling down [towards you] moves the bar up). I know it's early access, but this isn't unfinished - this is heading in absolutely the wrong direction. I understand that many amateur develops treat UI as the last 10% of the game, but those are the UI that end up being *bad*, like this one.The idea of confining a space game to a 2d plane is different, and it simplifies a lot - making the inertia and general navigation easier to follow. But after a few minutes it just feels restrictive - every system only has a couple planets and a sun, so you wind up just going to one or two points in every system, then leaving. You feel like it should be some kind of turn-based game, because it just doesn't have the freedom necessary for real time.I really do hate to be this critical, I want to like the game. I would just never recommend it to anyone.			"

								Drifter was a little game I picked up awhile back. And I don't recommend it right now, for a few reasons.ProsThe drifting mechanic is pretty cool.ConsSuper confusing, and the tutorial barely tells you half of what you need to knowIcons don't have descritions when hovered overNo form of smaller jets on your craft to say, change direction without just pointing your nose that way and gunning itGetting around the massive solar systems, even with slipstream, takes an age and a halfThe maps are extremely hard to use, as you can't click anywhere on the map to zoom on that point, it has to be an actual planet, star ect.So far the game is both incredibly bare-bones and incredibly confusing.Having a drifting mechanic with no method of lock-on to keep your ship pointing at an enemy makes it hard to do anything other than drive at them head on blasting your guns. This turns combat into more of a joust with only the guy with better shields winning.Your ship is stuck on a 2D plane. You can't fly up or down at all.No cockpit view.You could blame me just not fully understanding the game, but the parts I do understand at least basically (the main problem is the game desribes 0 things in the tutorial outside of flying your ship, which is basically WASD and space...) make the game (that's been in development  4 YEARS!!! ) feel like an early alpha demo.I bought this game cause it had inertia. I should have saved my money and bought Enemy Starfighter, cause that was basically this, with more content, better combat, a better inertia system (there's a key to enable drifting, cause in that universe people realised it was stupid to just let ships drift around all the time)  and on a 3D plane instead, with a cockpit view.

								I love this game! i dont have like any steam hours on the game, but i have had this game since around and maybe before christmas. i have played it for countless hours and loved it! If you really like exploring massive maps, then this game is for. why? because there are THOUSANDS if not HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of solar systems to explore! If you like space games then you will probably like this game alot! you can mine asteroids and fight bandits or be the bandit and shoot NPCs who are flying around or mining. You can take on contracts to get extra cash to buy new ships or wepons or armour, etc. you can sell your ores after you refined them into sell able bars at the stations. This game really is good! If you want to see what the game looks like and how the mechanics work, catch my live stream this weekend!  www.twitch.tv/airintc   solid 9/10  P.S: keep in mind when purchising this game that many items are still place holders and there are bugs and glitches.

Early Access Review
								My very first Early Access purchase and my God has it been a ride so far13 years ago I remember, out came Freelancer. Game where you were exploring (for it's time) VERY big space environment, with loads of different worlds and star systems, planets to land, almost every station had a bar where you could take on different jobs or just follow main storyline, which had pretty good story. Not jawdropping, but it kept you playing nontheless. Hundreds of different ships, weapons and other equipment. It also had one of the most memorable multiplayer experiences I've been a part of. With great community and thousands of players. Best feature of the game were mods. Tweaking your engine to be 20 times more powerful, getting weapons that could destroy any battleship in seconds, getting one same battleship yourself... I loved it. It kept calling me back for years. Nowadays, when I play Freelancer, looking back I realize it had one simple flaw which kept it from being on my top 3 list of best games I've ever played - it was repetitive. Missions were same altogether, not much variety. You could go and blast civilian ships and become a pirate, or help armed forces to get rid of pirates and gain some reputation depending which side you choose, but that was about it. There was not much variety in trading either, not if you were playing solo campaign. Only multiplayer kept me coming back. It wasn't best game I've ever played, but I'll surely remember it forever.Over following years, my hunger for space exploration grew stronger. I've tried a lot of other space sims. X3 Series were too complicated, EVE was restricted to multiplayer only and had monthly subscription, Starport Gemini was not what I was looking for either. When Elite Dangerous came out, I bought it and played it for quite a while, before I grew bored. Although it's still fantastic space simulation, I wanted something a bit more casually oriented. No Man's Sky turned out to be a flop, so I started looking after indie developers. Generally I tend to avoid Early Access titles, because sheer idea of playing game which is still in development seemed somehow unappealing to me. Little did I knew how wrong I was.Drifter came to my attention after browsing through store and it seem really great, despite being only in EA. I decided I'll buy it, worst that can happen is requesting a refund I said to myself. Couple of days later... Just wow. I am impressed how much had already been done. Enemy encounters can be very suspense at beginning and you need to grasp concept on how different ships respond to you. These dogfights are awesome, and although being in 2D (or is it 2.5D? IDK :D ) fights can offer you great amount of fun. Hunting down pirates is very well done, although sometimes you have to restart the game in order for bad guys to respawn I think. Just after few hours, I salvaged 5 Dark Matter Reactors, sold 4 of them and acquired Egret. Ship that has most weapon hardpoints, bought 4 gamma beams, all top equipment and now I'm destroying civilian Odysseys and other ships that come to my way, salvage their cargo and selling it on stations. There is no police or armed forces or any other type of Interstellar Security™ to stop you or issue bounty on your head, at least for now. I have some 6M credits and ATM I'm headed through center of galaxy to other end of star map. I want to see if there's any populated systems or group of systems in the most remote parts of my galaxy.So, game being as it is, it's still in development. It crashed few times, mainly when I opened star map. Game has tendency to bug out at this point. I was browsing through some systems that are on the very edge of galaxy, tried to plot route to them and then it crashed. Had to delete existing save game and make a new one. Enemy AI is questionable, sometimes they stand still, not doing Jack or Jill and you can kill them easily. Highest bounty I've received for a pirate was 19k, their equipment stays same, so do their ships. Stations all have same layouts for different things you can do at them. Factions also need to be added urgently and building stations in later updates. I've seen supercomputers and station parts being sold on markets, maybe they can be used for building your own mining empire, or pirate outpost, or trading company... Man, it makes me dizzy when I think how much can this game still get in future updates.Can I recommend it? Absolutely! You will need more imagination to really immerse yourself into universe of this game and it does not have a tutorial other than how controls work. But if you can make some logical conclusions on how ship menu works when you click on it, you'll get a hang on it pretty soon. There is not so much of a content yet, as it's still in development, but I've spoken with dev and he said we can expect some mayor update in following week or two, before they can finally release full version of this gem. You should definitely try it. Despite still being in beta, it can already keep you busy for hours, as it did with me :)EDIT (8.1.2017): Still eagerly and patiently waiting for next promised update. Just checking back in for a little. Hope you're gonna deliver it soon :)			"

								I have been playing this game a lot and dearly loving it.Drifter is still in ""Early Access"" at this time, which basically means it's in beta.   I'm playing version 0.6.3.  Even though it's in beta it's surprisingly bug-free, but not every feature intended for the final game is implemented yet.  That's ok, the game is actually quite complete as it is.  More content and additional features are just icing on the cake.  While there are some glitches, most are minor and generally just cosmetic.  Expect subsequent versions of the game to be improved.A lot of this game's depth isn't obvious on the surface when you first look at it.  While the enemy AI seems overly simplistic at first, eventually you'll see the enemy ships doing other things.  Instead of just performing a slash attack, they'll turn and run if they think they're being overwhelmed, for example.  And while it's easy to fight just one enemy, you can get into situations where you are facing a lot of bad guys at once, which can get pretty challenging.The game is well balanced, with simple missions to get you started, and more difficult missions after you learn your way around.  These aren't labelled as to which are easy and which are hard, you get a variety of missions from the very start and you'll have to pick and choose what you're comfortable with.You have a good variety of ships to try out (there are 13 currently in the game) but some are better than others and you'll quickly find your favorites.There are a lot of weapon and equipment upgrades as well, and sometimes buying even a single upgrade changes the nature of how you fight battles or even just fly around.Trading is well implemented, with a lot of different types of systems with varying prices of goods, and there is a major metagame involved in finding good items to trade and good trade runs. While trading isn't useful in the early game, once you've made enough money to buy lots of expensive trade goods, you can make more money in trading than you can killing bad guys, even with a smaller ship.I've written a detailed guide, available in the Guides section, that describes everything I've found that you can do and how to do it.  It has a lot more information than what I could fit into a review.  Check it out.Be sure to check out the various gameplay videos.  They'll tell you very quickly if Drifter is something you'd like.Drifter is a fairly simple game, with lots of stuff to do if you go looking for it.  If you want a more complete and complex Space Game experience, check out Elite: Dangerous.  Right now, Drifter is quite enough for me.Loving this game! "

								I'm reviewing version 0.6.1:I wouldn't recommend the game in this ""Early Access"" status.Pros:-interesting to see how the game works-different ships, few weapons and other ship-upgrades-space-fight is kind of funny (because it's not really hard)cons:-UI (menus, space station,...) are ok, but sometimes you have to go through so many menus for easy repetitive tasks like selling stuff, buying stuff,..)-no space stations or other things in more than 90% of the galaxy. so there's no point in exploring right now beside mining, space-fight and a few missions (also space-fight or flying from A to B)This game feels like a like an (rough) idea and reminds me of the game ""galaxy on fire"". I hope the Dev will do something with it. I'll look at it again in 2 years.			"

								At the time I am writing this review, I have no gameplay time what so ever.  This is a review of the Dev himself, and the interactions ive seen and the one that Ive had.  Many times I have said to myself "" No more early access games "" for the simple fact that Devs dont seem to react or even care how the fanbase feels about the game. Example: ( http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=3000AD http://steamcommunity.com//id/cirruspaxton/recommended/285670/  ) The Dev of 3000AD removes bad reviews and bans players for being ""Trolls"" for saying negitive anything about his games.  But from what Ive seen, this will be different.  When I play Drifter, Love it, Hate it, I know that my opinion will matter.  This review is not meant to tell you about the game, you know if its you type of game already before looking at the reviews.  The team behind the game can be just as important as the gameplay itself, thats why I bought it, Thats why this game gets my Thumbs up, becuase i Support the Team behind Drifter!

								Drifter - Very small Indie team, but I really find Drifter to be quite enjoyable to play. Currently in Alpha/Early Access but the gamer is quite playable with many ways to play, Pirate, Miner, Trader, and anything inbetween.The game reminds me of the early days of Elite which is a good thing, as that game was down right addictive. Drifter is one of those game you can pick up and play for 5 minutes or 5 hours and get somewhere regardless of time sunk into the game.Controls are simple, but this is a good thing. Game doesnt need a PHD in Astro Physics to get into the game and start playing, a few minutes doing the beginner tutorial and you will be away.At its current state of Early Access, I can recommend Drifter, if Space gaming is your Genre.

								Not getting a good feeling about this one.It's barely at demo stage still. Yes bits of it are playable, but the GUI, graphics and overall feel of content is very unfinished. I guess it got a few people interested back when it was on sale, but as you can tell by the player stats http://steamcharts.com/app/259450 even the people giving great reviews don't seem to actually play it.It's just reaching the point where you can begin to wonder when the next update is. Looks like the ""Yes I can make an amazing game"" enthusiasm has worn off. It's even more surprising when the dev could just work on the basic GUI and graphical game content, whack that out the door and call it an update. Example. Everything's icon at the moment is a small metal cube in game. Resources, armour .. everything .. small metal cube. It also has this semi-3D problem to overcome. It looks 3D, but actually it's a 2D game on a flat surface. Bit like a driving game.This one really is a ""buyer beware"" offering. I'd value it at around $1 max at the moment as a curio to keep in the library and see if it ever gets updated. There's no way it's worth the $11.99 to $14.99 that's planned.Sorry Dev. It's sat in the library not being updated for getting on for too long. Nice idea maybe but ... the idea isn't in the game yet.			"

								This game is absolutely marvelous. I spend hours just exploring and shooting at stuff with the starter ship when I bought the game. There are very few cons with the game. While I've had some issues with the mouse pointer, that was a hardware issue with my computer, so the game isnt to blame. I especially love the music, and the playstyle, which is reminiscent of Red Nova, another one of Celcius Studio's games, which I spend hours upon hours on. Even though development is slightly slow, I have to say that it's worth it, as intead of rushing content and features in and then leaving them buggy, they take their time and make sure everything is a masterpiece.PS - don't be fooled by my 0.4h; I played most of it while offline, so Steam did not record anything.

								Very creative, lots of potential here. NOW WITH MORE POTENTIAL THAN NO MAN'S SKY!!!I was 99% sold on the beta as is, but then I looked ahead at what the devs are planning by the 1.0 release. WOW. http://celsiusgs.com/drifter/wiki/Development_RoadmapI will admit that at the moment the game feels like too little variety/content spread over WAY too much universe. Reading the roadmap posted above should remove any doubt though, this game will only get better. Factions, NPCs, a reputation system, random events, special missions, crafting, the list goes on. So far, the biggest 'con' that I can see is that the UI is a mess. In a trading game, it cannot be a mess...it must be entirely streamlined. At this stage it tears you out of immersion as you question which tab lets you access your ship, after you bought items, that have to be placed ON your ship, and then ON the respective system, and then 10 clicks later you can leave the station with your new loadout. Half the time you forget which star system you are in. Also the radar and other readouts during flight take up half the screen, which is a pity cuz this game is so darn beautiful already. BUT...this is a beta. No worries. The biggest 'pro' is, well, everything else. The music and sound effects are spot on, dogfighting music especially. The scope is immense, and from the title screen you see just how small you are. The ships look cool, the weapons look and sound fierce, and you have enough methods of going fast that the space isn't TOO overwhelming. Good beta, GREAT potential. Can't wait for 1.0!			"

								The menus are rough, the tutorial leaves you wanting and the Combat is awkward. The game play is like a heart surgeon with a jackhammer and TNT. 	The space station menus are gray boxes with plain black lettering in them. All navigation is blocky and awkward to use, no hover hint no talking paper clip.  The menu backgrounds on the other hand are a nice shade of ink black, a nice touch in the world of moving backgrounds and super saturation colored things.  	Drifter is 2D in space which is weird at first but makes sense the longer you play.  You start in a basic ship floating in nowhere with the tutorial that explains the basics and not much more, actually it explains nothing other then movements and basic turret combat. While leaving out that you need to transfer you old equipment to the space station to sell it.  Making space piracy or mining a number one option for money making as trading is still rough and overwhelming.	With this game being a sandbox game it has very little in the area of personalization, lol who am I kidding it has no personalization at all in fact naming your ship is not even a option, or at least I have yet to find that menu option.  The textures are simple done, so simple in fact it looks like they have a picture of earth as some planets. Though do not let that discourage you from playing, the ships and space stations are simple with an artistic grace.	With a 8-core FX-8350 and GT440 my frames/sec sit in the 58 range though higher and lower have been seen and expected. With Anti-Aliasing and without there seems to be very little difference that I can discern on a 1080 monitor.  It does get bonus points for being available on Linux.	Once said and done the game is a rough diamond that is the next Hope diamond or Triple A game			"

								Great potential and the direction it's heading is a good one. It's a bit basic and the tutorial lacks alot of needed information. And there isn't really alot on the wiki or youtube or anywhere for that matter. Which is refreshing to find things out to a point but the amount you have to figure out is a bit overwhelming. Mining is probably one of the most fleshed out features i've delved into so far. Which is pretty basic. But the idea is there and I can see where it will go as far as using resources to craft things. Combat is a little tricky and same with movement. I like the authenticity that you don't just stop moving or slow down when you let off the gas, since there is nothing to slow you down. But there is a velocity cap which is counter-intuitive to that Idea of interia. I think it would benefit from always trying to go back to 0m/s when not holding a direction. Some things like starsystem scale and distances and actual velocitys are off. But that is very minor and doesnt actually affect the gameplay. More of an asthetics things. Right now the choice of ships is limited and very unbalanced. But I think the game has a solid base from which It can build an amazing game. I havent ran into any bugsin the things I did. It just needs more content and menu polish. If you like space games and mining/crafting/space combat games. and don't mind a few bare bones. I would pick it up.			"

								I was Super Excited to this game and finally and be able to play a new, engaging space-trader  (I'm a huge EV NOVA fan. Chances are you are too, if you're reading this.)I understand this is still in early days of development, however;This Game is just not that goodThe control shceme is AWKWARDThis makes Combat CumbersomeThe Layout is unfinished and confusing (everything is a uniform gray with small, hard-to-read text)Most of the graphics are not in place and have blue cubw placeholders- this makes using the marketplace tedious and difficultAbove all it's EMPTY. No storyline, no quests, just 8 ships you need to grind to to purchase and some basic shoot and/or fetch missions. I understand this is in it's early stages but the basic, skeletal core of the gameplay here is un-fun.That needs to be reworked before this is any good.			"

								I have been playing this game for about a week now.  Started out very confusing since the game play instructions are very basic.This is a BETA, so you need to go into this knowing that also.  There will be tweaks along the way.  Possibly resets as well.I have played MULTIPLE beta games in the past (Silk Road Online, Matrix Online, Americas Army, Age of Conan and more).I have tested out mining & trading.  Currently, its not too exciting, but, its a Beta.I have tested doing trade runs as well.  Its a good way to get started to make some credits.  After a few runs, I looked into other things.The quests mostly seem to all work.  I have found a few kinks, but mostly happens when you cancel a quest and the quest item is still in your inventory.  If that's the case, just jettison it or abandon it in a station.The most fun so far for me is doing bounty hunting.  Just find a 0% safe system and wait for them to come to you.  Please keep in mind, you should at least have your weapons upgraded.  The bounty rewards will add up and you will be able to upgrade everything else.The in-game music is very nice, graphics are also very impressive!			"

								Really nice game. Open world sand-boxy space exploration game with a ton of different areas to go to. It is lacking in content right now, but it has a lot of potential and the devs are going to add a lot of stuff to it. Definitely playable right now if you want to start your career as a trader, pirate, pirate hunter or a miner.The UI needs work, but the devs are going to give it a big overhaul in the next update. The tutorial is also barebones and I figured out how to do all the stuff the tutorial didn't mention. It doesn't have a steep learning curve.			"

								I find myself wishing I had the source code so I could fix the long standing issues that are painfully obvious.  Like all the UI buttons that do nothing, but aren't disabled or hidden.  Development of this Unity3D game is very slow, I can only assume that the developer has been focusing all thier attention on artwork or sound.  While I do see a few code issues that were updated in the last update, it's not enough changes to make me believe this developer is really spending more than a few hours per month on the game at best.All that said, Drifter does offer a very interesting take on a tried and true genre of space exploration combined with the open world freedoms that we've come to love with newer games.  There were some nit-picky things that I noted that I felt were rather wierd, like no one would build a mining base in a star system that has nothing to mine.  Some of the complaints that other users have made are really easy things to fix, and I say that as a developer myself.  One suce complaint was the ability to tell the difference between different types of star systems at a glance.  Thats easily done by displaying them with different colors on the galaxy view.Aside from the overbearing development slowness and persistent game issues, I'd give the game an overall 7.5 out of 10.  I would recommend this game for space exploration enthusiasts.  If you're just looking for a space shooter, this game can keep your attention for a while.  It'll hold your attention even longer, if you also like trading resources for money, or going mining, or just running errands.			"

								for a early ascess game, this is one of the bests games out there, in comparison to full releases it still lacking a bit but the game has alot of potentional based on what the developer has released related to plans for it. i have 8.6 hours on record though which isnt much but its simply for the fact i rage deleted the game when i died , tried to load a previous save, then accidently saved on the slot so i saved after i died and i got mad a deleted it, however i really did like it and how the fighting system worked for the shields,rockets, and lasers/etc that were for the ship and the game already has a decent selection of ships to work with if i remember correctly, if you want the game go for it but just becareful i guess of misclicking it was fun and with 6.0 on the way i will most likely redownload.

								Important: Updates in this early access have slowed down to a near halt. Bascially, they're just icon updates for items in the game. But those icon skins don't add any depth to the game, and that's what it desperately needs.I like Drifter, but I can't recommend it as it is. It needs a little more depth, and it needs more frequent MEANINGFUL updates. The game itself says it's a space trading sim, which it is, but there's nothing interesting about it. There's no haggling, there's no interaction, it's just buying products where they're cheaper and selling them where they're more expensive.The game also markets that it has 100,000 star systems to explore, but in reality there's nothing to explore. You move on a flat plane towards the space station where the trading can happen and that's all you do. The only other thing to see is the asteroids which you blow up and mine, and there's some ""combat"" which is very bland and not fun.			"

								Fun game. Most of the bad reviews are saying that that game is not that fun and unplayable. The people that wrote those reviews do not understand that this game is still in development and is not officially released. They also say that the space combat is bad but that is because they do not understand how to dodge incoming laser barrages and fight the enemies back. A lot more content is coming with the release of 6.0 which is coming later this week.However, for being still being in development it is a fun space game. You can mine, bounty hunt, trade, and do whatever fits your play style. The universe is very large and I still have not explored more than a fews systems.			"

TL;DR - This is almost good. Ensure that you really want this game before buying it.I don't think I've had this much fun with an early access game before. If you like games such as Flash Trek, Elite Dangerous, X Rebirth, EVE Online and are fondly looking forward to Star Citizen, then Drifter is the game for you. Without delving into detail, Drifter is your basic space flight sim with elements of combat and trading. Your ultimate and only goal is to make bank. How you make this money is totally up to you; mine asteroids, trade with stations or become a gun for hire. You're thrown into a massive, procedurally generated galaxy, with thousands of star systems to explore. The ship designs are sleek and unique, and combat is dead simple. Even if you've never touched a game like this before, I can guarantee you'll pick up the controls easily. Super fun, I can't wait to see what the future has in store for Drifter.Pros: Literally X for dummies. If you've ever played one of the games I listed above and were scared away by the complexity, don't worry - Drifter is dumbed down to a fault. There are less than one hundred keybinds! Perfect for the potato in your life! I get constant 60fps on my wonderful 4GB RAM / integrated Intel GPU shitbox. This is some next-gen witchery. Gamepad support! Self explanatory. The game requires little to no keyboard/mouse input in gamepad mode - almost every function can be mapped to a controller. Looks super pretty. The lens flare might be maddening at times, but the models and effects are breathtaking. The combat is idiotproof. Point and shoot. It's poetry, really.Cons: The game has been in (slow) development for four years. This might be a personal thing, but just seeing this really raised some red flags with me. The developer has made some recent claims about returning to the game, however. They've made the promise to have full release by the end of the year (as of July 1, 2015) Very, very little to do. You can take missions, yes - but that's pretty much all you can do. There are six or seven kinds of missions and all of them are almost the same, barring very slight differences (kill this ship in this system, deliver this item from this system to this system, etc) Everything looks the same. There are maybe ... twenty or so different ships. Out of these twenty models, I've only ever seen eight or nine of them while roaming the galaxy. Out of the eight or nine, there seem to be only four kinds of 'pirate' (the only ships you're tasked to hunt with the kill missions) ships. The planets and the suns are nothing special, really. Limited gamepad support. The only qualm I have with the gamepad support is the fact that you can't: calibrate the sticks or change stick control (eg. map movement from left joystick to right joystick) The combat is mindnumbing. There is no such thing as 'altitude', or 'variable height' in Drifter. All of the action takes place on the same level on the y-axis. It's simple, but it's not exciting. It boils down to playing a game of chicken with your enemy while holding down the fire button. Not only that, but the combat AI is stupid. Much too expensive for what the game is, currently. I wouldn't pay more than ten dollars for this to be honest. Wait for a sale or buy it as part of a bundle. "

Must've been only 20% off! ""Early Access"" robberies never do have good offers! And it was a full 12 months ago when I bought it..... still, I am going to demand a refund for this utter turd!All star systems are vapid, with the same layout, same G-class yellow star in the centre. Only a handful of poor planet textures, planets don't actually do anything anyway. All terran class planets look exactly Earth.Not a lot of ships.Even less weapons / upgrades.Ie, there's simply nothing to spend your money on.Terrible GFX.Terrible SFX.Terrible UI.Terrible controls.Seems unfinished. Seems?! Ha! It ain't 1/4 finished! And never will be!No factions.No ""living universe"".Only a handful of repetitive ""missions""Seems this will never be finished. The dev seems to have absconded with the money already.An empty game that I was bored with even after 0.4hrs of play!Absolute cow clart! Compared to games like ""Transcendence"" and ""Vega Strike"" which are FREE and open source..... Drifter is an absolute punch in the nose to gamers, and just a money making scam. Quite frankly the dev has mugged those unfortunates who bought this. Just like David ""Robber"" Braben did with ""Elite : Dangerous (to your bank balance)""This game should really be titled ""GRIFTER"", as in ""confidence trickster""!EDIT ---------------------------------------------The game is still getting worked on, heavily. Maybe I was being harsh with the ""Grifter"" comment. Well, I'll keep an eye on these updates and try the game again, and tone down this review if the game improves!			"

								Very good gane has potential in becoming a great game. Like to see more ships, missions, more diverse and dynamic environments. Few issues with AI especially when mining and a AI ship passes infront of the lasers turning agro as it thinks you purposefully attacked it. Ends with you either leaving or engaging in an unwarranted and unecessary combat that distracts you from your objective and wastes time/resources in repairing ship. Reminds me of a great game i played in the 90s, look forward to seeing this develop thanks for cool game devs.			"

								Pros:-Large expansive worlds-Interesting ship balancing mechaniccons:-UI needs work-Stupid AI-No tooltipsI think this game has potential but it still needs a lot of work. Currently in version .61 there's really no direction or story for you to follow, it's all do whatever you want mission or mining or w/e. Ship AI are kind of stupid, no evasion just charge at you then run away till a certain distance then u-turn and repeat charge. Would like to see more improvement on the UI especially regarding the active missions like some what to automatically plot the course to your objective rather than manually finding it which gets very tedious. Also would at least like to see how many credit I have when i'm trying to buy stuff on stations. Have to leave the station to see it -_-.Why is there no strafe or some rapid emergency left/right boost dodge. Havn't used the launchers much at all after the tutorial as it's kinda useless and pointless with stupid AI. Money is easy to get and it didn't take more than an hour or two to get enough for a higher spec ship. Trading seems tedious with the hard to read ui. Really not sure why there's a CD on the lightspeed jumps as you literally spend an entire minute staring at the screen waiting for it to be over so you can move on which gets worse if you have to do several jumps. There's very little interaction between your ship and the world outside of missions. Rare to see any random event if at all any ships. In the end I would say this game is worth a try, but for the price tag might want to wait till it's more polished or reaches version 1.0 release.			"

								This game is great! Reminiscent of Freelancer, yet on a much grander scope! Currently you can buy different ships, some for trading, some for fighting, and various trade goods. Mining seems to be in-game although I could not see a way to sell or refine ore, and combat is fun. It is only on a 2D plane, yet the games mechanics work well with it. One little but VERY important feature is you can view trade goods for a remote system and your current (local) system. In the UI it also has the price difference calculated for you. This feature makes price comparisons very easy and is something a lot of games over look. There are also many different ship modules in-game, such as weapons, ammo, and utility modules. Most items do not have their art icons yet, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the item itself. Right now it is a very enjoyable game, but when it is finished, I feel it will be one of the best Space Simulation games out there!			"

								Ya its a good game. Obviously still in its early stages but it has excellent potential. Would love to see more support for a controller, as well as hover explainations of what I am pressing or buying. Also a little more vibrant with the colors and interface, but I understand these things take time. Other than that its a great game. I will be playing this one for a while!			"

								Drifter's been a lot of fun to follow. The gameplay is already great to play and it looks fantastic.Sure, as an early access game there's work to be done, but Colin, the developer, is super responsive and does a great job with keeping us updated on his forums.EDIT: So it's been a few months since I started playing and the updates have been slow. That said, the developer's been very open about his progress and how he had to go back and refactor a lot of code to add a LOT of new features he's been working on.Just the other day he released 0.6.0 and there's quite a few great changes. Primarily, he's added a few ships and a lot of new visual enhancements.His release schedule is supposed to be a lot more frequent (I think like every 2 weeks or something he said) and I'm really excited to see what else comes out of this.I've wanted an single player Eve style game for a long time and so far it doesn't disappoint.Right now Colin's working on adding a lot of new content to the game so the galaxy doesn't feel so empty.But I think the best part is that he's very active with his community of players and is very open about what's coming and what he won't be able to accommodate until a later date.Still definitely gets my thumbs up and as long as progress keeps coming, I'm sure that'll stay the same.

								Looks like it has promice, the UI was a little strange to navigate around, I would have prefered to have a hotkey for the navigation and maps. Otherwise it looks like the basis for a good game the universe looks vast... Also I think there is a problem with the jump drive, it says there is no fuel even after docking. So cannot really get to another system. I hope this is fixed soon. In mouse flight mode, it seems you cannot pitch and yaw the spacecraft, only turn left and right which makes for some boring dogfights.			"

While a lot of people will complain about the slow space travle I think its kinda awesome,(go through this http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html for a little bit of persepctive with out using the jump function) and pretty accurate.

								I do like this game. It has tons of potential, and I can certainly see that it will be amazing. The best way I can describe it right now, is it's like ""freelancer with physics"". Freelancer is one of my favourite games, and this game can be better than that.Right now it's obviously very early in development, so I can't honestly recommend you buy it as it is right now. On the one hand, I wish I had waited, on the other hand I'm excited for it's potential. It has the potential, and hopefully will, be one of the best space games out there.			"

Just one thing, taxes, black market and forbidden goods are missing, but I am sure if we all ask for it, we might even get it before Xmas.Great jobs developpers, you are awsomes !! "

								I have had this game pre-Steam and I love it. I don't know how many total hours I've logged, but, this game truly captures the spirit of Elite but with a nice difference, namely, your ship isn't a pushover. Someone mentioned a steep learning curve and I have to disagree. The controls are very intuitive and the radial menu works very nicely.  Battles can get very wicked so be prepared. Also, I should add that the game plays very well with mouse and keyboard. Lastly, Sir Isaac Newton is definitely in the pilot's seat in this one so if you're not used to Newtonian space flight models, take your time as the initial systems explore are safe. I like the slower pace of the first hours of the game because the game universe is beautiful and I like exploring the eye candy. But, don't worry, the pace picks up and some of the combat missions are really insane in a very good way.			"

Would be even better with an MMO like element! Edited to reflect to new information provided by the developer in the comments. "

								Drifter is amazing, I feel it's just about everything I've been looking for in a space exploration/space sandbox game. It's been one of the VERY FEW early access titles that I've purchased and enjoyed so thoroughly. This is what ""early access"" should be, not ""lets push this alpha out the door that's only 2% finished."" You can pilot your ship, destroy other ships, mine asteroids, (by blowing them up, of course) take missions, or just travel around the galaxy, to name a few features in the game so far. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun sandbox environment in space, and it still isn't even done yet.			"

								This game reminds me of a single player version of EVE Online and that's a good thing.  One thing that absolutely surprised me, was the physics of the flight.  The game doesn't have full controller support and according to the developer himself, that is the best way to play the game.  But it is coming in Patch 0.6.0.  So hopefully that will be really soon.  This will be a fantastic game to just sit on the couch, turn out all of the lights, and delve into.  I can not wait for the finished product.  And speaking of the developer, he is an awesome guy that really cares about the fans of the game.  He is on twitter @celsiusgs.  Follow him.  He responds back to questions very quickly.  Enjoy the game!			"

								This game is fun and has plenty of activities to do. You can shoot stuff, or trade, or ferry goods across the exeedingly vast universe. I'd reccomend it, and it's pretty good for a beta early access game.As for graphics:-The overworld graphics are very nice-Station graphics could use a little work, however-There are a couple of bugs, and joystick support is so-so-Mechanics are good-Weapons are a bit unbalanced, some lower-teir ones are better than higher teir ones.-Difficulty seems easy-ish, trading doesn't seem worth it.

								This one is a bit hard to recommend just yet, because it's obviously very early on in the development. However I am going to go ahead and give it a provisional recommendation, simply based on the fact that the game already has all the hallmarks of a game that is going to be good.There is a lot of things that this game is already doing right, that so many other space games have got wrong. for example, in this game you get your normal speed plus an afterburner key to double your speed, you get slipstream speed for flying at very high speed, and then you get the jump/warp speed, where you shoot off in to the horizon.While I can't seem to make the ship move up or down, the handling is nice and responsive, and it looks like there will be plenty of options in this game, like stock markets, ship dealers, missions and so on.However, the game is still missing lots of things, and because of this, it is a bit frustrating.As the game stands at the moment, it is just a curiosity, and not even really playable, as it's just too simple and incomplete. You could in theory play it, there does not seem to be any bugs or glitches, but its just a bit boring at the moment, and just kind of makes you wish that it was ready to play, and that all the missing features were in place already.It is basically too early on to bother playing this game for hours and hours, but it is well worth supporting to get it to a more finished state. I believe it will be good when it is finished.For what it is worth, here are some things I would like to see in the finished game:- More things to buy and sell, 100's and 100's more things. At the moment you get to trade allt he elemental based things, like metals and water and what not, but I would also like to see more exotic things, such as alien goods and fictional materials.- The game could use some voices, it feels kind of empty at the moment. It could use a robot companion or control tower telling you bits of advice and making odd jokes.- It would be nice to be able to move up and down if not yet possible, even if its just jump up or down 1 level of set space.

								This game is feels like1. As if a 5 year old made the gameIn this game there's:2. Barely is anything to doIt looks:3. WAY different than the developers promised it to beYou can't:4. Land on planetsAny Earth-like planet in this game is ACTUALLY:5. Planet Earth (sometimes with rings around it)How long does it take for the game to become boring?:6. After a few hours (I actually played this game for some 2 hours, for the other 15.5 hours I just forgot that I kept it turned on.)Any pros?7. Good Question!Conclusion,This game is total crap, and it's also been in early access for over 2 years. Usually it takes less than a year to take a game out of early access. What's worse though is that the vast majority of the things that the developer of the game promised to add weren't added during those two years. So if you've already bought the game, then try refunding it. Unless you like it, then that's fine. I'm just stating my opinion.I'll give this game a 0/10. If you don't know why just read the whole thing 'cos it took me quite a while to make.			"

								A gem worth taking a look at. I'm missing the bigger ships and turrets and all that, but I have a feeling there is a lot yet to come...			"

								Honestly I can't even play this because after changing resolution I can't even play the game because I can't change it back to the original state. Also you didn't impliment a Mac OS magnify option. How frustrating how broken this game is. It should be considered alpha then beta.			"
