												Grand Ages Medieval for me sums up the modern games industry, a base product designed to accomodate the many DLC's that will no doubt follow.  Even on the main screen clicking on additional content takes you to a window with included button that helpfuly states 'go to shop', even though there is no DLC to buy just yet.  Even so I decided to give the game a try and I am unhappy to report that my impressions from the many let's play videos were correct.  GAM is quite simply the bare bones of what could eventually become an excellent game.  It is at the moment an extremely shallow offering with little to no depth, in which you engage in the mind numbing process of tweak the trade route with an economy system that already needs a patch.But what about the other side of the game, surely it can't just be trade?  Well people, I am sorry to say that the combat system is even more shallow than the trade system, and those of you expecting a Total War type mini-game will be sorely disappointed.  Quite simply you send your units against the enemy units and may the largest army win, there is no battlefield strategy at all.It is to the credit of the developers that they have made a game so lacking in depth somewhat enjoyable if you approach it in the right way, which is why I think it will only get better with time and lots of money spent on DLC's.  Unfortunately I am not prepared to spend what could amount to hundreds of pounds on a single game, and if you take my advice hold off on buying it for a couple of years.  By that time there will maybe be a GOTY edition out with all the DLC's included.  Not recommended as it stands.Edited after 14 hours play to point out a few problems:Trader Ai is as dumb as your average rock.  Balanced or production settings, doesn't matter.  Trader will still cart stuff around that are not needed while leaving needed goods stockpiled and gathering dust.  Major rework of Trader Ai needed.Production costs too high, quite often outstripping the value of the goods produced.  This means that  all production needs to be micromanaged or you end up with a crippled economy and spiraling debt.Troop upkeep way too high which means that a human player can never match the Ai in numbers.  Again, adds to spiraling debt.Bands of animal that gather in huge numbers and appear to be more intelligent than most humans, seemingly calling out to each other from miles away to come and join the fight.  I cannot stress enough just how much of a nerf these animals need.  Same for the bandits.Resources:  Two problems here.  First there are only 20 of them which is a very low number for any kind of trading and economy sim.  Secondly, they are the same all over the map instead of being region specific so there is no real reason to explore far and wide in search of those rare resources.Combat system is just bad.  Rock, Paper, Scissors affair that can drag on for hours if there are enough troops on either side and boils down to blob vs blob.Game as a whole lacks meaningful content.  This is supposed to be a sim of medieval life at a city state level yet all you do is trade and take over a few neutral states.  Don't even try to take over Ai controled major factions because they will have more troops than you, more cities than you and the ability to produce new units out of thin air while your bank balance crumbles, at which point the entirety of your army will give up and go home, even mid fight.  These developers need to look at a few games from the past such as the guild series etc. and take a few hints.Tutorial campaign needs an overhaul so that it actually teaches you how to play and doesn't screw itself over by, for instance, telling you to send mercs against shield using bandits.  For those that don't know mercs use polearms which are apparently pretty useless against shields.  Maybe someone should send a message to the past to let Alexander know that his pike phalanx is actually crap, who knew?  A simple change here such as putting those bandits on horses would alleviate that problem.Map being huge is made pointless by scouts on speed and by enemies / animals that can see you coming from 50 miles away and rush to engage you in battle.  It is also made pointless by archers that apparently have space-age bows that can fire and hit from miles away.Game needs a x10 speed option instead of having to hold down the spacebar all the time.Chronicle is not very useful as it stands.  Events should come up as a clickable icon at the top of the screen when they happen.  If the icon is not clicked on then it should vanish after a certain time to avoid screen clutter.Ai cheating needs to be severely toned down and should only be there at all on higher levels.  Normal level should be a level playing field.I could go on but that lot gives you some indication of the state of the game.  Peace all.			"

												I actually feel bad for downrating this game. It has some fine ideas and concepts and would most certainly keep you very entertained past the two hour steam refund mark.The problem is, that it doesn't keep you going much past that point. You suddenly find that you've built everything you can. Every building, every troop type, every resource generator. All you can do is to repeat the process over and over again until the map is full of cities. You engage in repetetive trade routes with the same scant few resources that can be obtained anywhere in the map (fine wine from my Scottish vinyards, anyone?)And when the map is full you have to endure the even more tiresome process of either wooing or conquering enemy cities to your faction. A process that take so long per city that the very thought of taking over the whole world is a truly frightening concept.In short...allow me give you the experience of playing this game. Consider it a free demo:Pick up a book you know to be good. Perhaps you read it before or it comes higly recommended by someone you trust. Read chapter One. Don't worry...I don't mind waiting. Just let me know when you're done...Ah, hello again! Did you enjoy that? Good! I'm glad to hear it. Now go on and read Chapter Two and come back here for the next step...Welcome back! You must be pretty invested now. A new world to explore and characters to follow on glorious adventures. So exciting! Well, don't let me keep you...you go right ahead and read Chapter Two...yes, Chapter Two, that's what I said. Yes, I know you already read it, but just go read it again, it'll be fun! Oh...and when you're finished, you'll need to read Chapter Two again. And then follow that up with Chapter Two. I trust you'll be able to work out the next step from there...And that's it. You set up your early game, full of possibilities and exploration as you set your flag down and make your mark on the local area. You move into your mid game - consolidating your power and expanding your reach. And then you stay there. There is no end game. No top tier production buildings requring many cities to work together. No distant technological research that needs a concerted effort to reach. No Development of agents, espionage, religion, enhanced diplomacy or advanced troop types. Nope. You just carry on playing the mid-game until you lose interest and start again. And you start again another 6-7 times until eventually the frustrating realisation comes in that you've spent hours doing something you don't even enjoy, so you come here and write a big 'MEH' review to save others from the boredom.TLDR - Absolutely fantastic game for an hour or so until it completely runs out of ideas and content. Consider waiting for a lot of DLC/expansion content before purchase...or a very generous Steam sale deal.			"

												(Due to the huge ammount of ""you've got spelling errors and I have nothing better to do but point them out"" comments, I am putting in a disclaimer: there are spelling errors in here, Its not unreadable by a long shot, yes I know, you don't need to comment about it)This review is long, but worth it. Don't let my small ammount of game time fool you, I assure you I know what I'm talking about. There is a TLDR at the bottom.When you come to this page and see that it has 44% positive reviews, thats for a reason. The game is basically an economy simulator, and it dosent even matter that its in the medeval ara, it could just as easily be in modern times, becasue theres nothing special about it, other than the buisinesses being of the type from that era. The ENTIRE, let me say it again, ENTIRE game is about managing an economy, and trading. Usually this wouldnt be bad, but heres why it isCONS-The economy system works great, when you build a city, you choose five of the ~20 recources to produce, problem is,  you can get these is any city in any country in the world. There is no reason to create a city outside where you are, or to even trade with another player, becasue you can get it all right there. In fact, you can just build ~5 cities and be set for the rest of the game producing everything you need. ""but if I get more people, wont I need more cities to produce more things to keep them happy?"" nope, you can litterly just stay where you are, theres no reason to expand. Ever.Once you've completed your ~5 cities and are trading with yourself, or others if you want, but you really dont need to, the way players grow in power and gain more money is by building more buildings, but heres the kicker: after the first about 30 minutes of the game (and these games take longer than most Civ. games) the rest of the game is incredibly repetative,you just switch from city to city, constantly buying more buisinesses of the exact same type, more and more, over and over again. and this is all if you haven;t gone bankrupt by this point, which most people are struggling with too hard to even care about the other players. This game might as well be just singleplayer, becasue it dosen't matter if your opponent is there, your both probally drowning in debt. Not to mention the problem with armies: not only are they so simplistic that a second grader could do it with both hands tied behind his back and a blindfold on, theres no reason to buy anything other than low tier units. The only thing that makes a country special is its ""unique"" units it can get, but  you don't even need them, you can just spam pikemen (lowest teir unit) to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥done just as well, they are cheaper to maintain, and cheaper to buy, and you can get better attack/defense ability from spamming say ~5 of them than you canfrom a special unit that would cost you more. Not to mention that the debt is so bad that you fall into debt in the damn tutorial, and guess what, if you don't get all the way to the end, you gotta ♥♥♥♥in' start all over again. Have fun with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.PROS- The graphics are alright I guessTLDR: You pretty much do the same thing for the eintire 3-4 hour game every game economy wise, armies are a joke, a 2nd grader could understand and the teir system is useless and broken, might as well be a singleplayer game becasue all players A) have no reason to expand or attack and B) you will all be too busy drowning in debt to do anything about eachother, its a game of see who can float in a sea of debt long enough to not have their ""empire"" fall apart. Put simply there are better, cheaper games out there. But I mean hey, the graphics are pretty good.Oh and I almost forgot, theres only 2 way battles, so if an army of three meet up, one will end up reinforcing the other, even player armies. And not all the units fight, so if you have an army of 4 units vs 4 units, only 2 of them fight each other, the other 2 stand around with their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in their hands wondering what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on for litterly years (the battles take something like 5-10 in game years to complete...that makes sense...). So when you go to kill the bandits that have been robbing your trade routs, the bears that have been plaguing the forests will come and reinforce the bandits, while the army of wolves stands idly by waiting for you guys to finish so it can follow you back to town and rob your trade caravans.In fact, if you don't read anything else, just consider this:Ammount of people who have finished a multiplayer game: 1.1%Ammount of people who have captured another players town: 0.7%Ammount of people who have won a multiplayer game: 0.7%Those last two, are the same.

												This game looks good on the surface, but has little depth to it.Its a very basic medieval economy sim with some very generic combat elements thrown in.They advertise this game as a ""Grand Strategy"" game when its nothing of that kind whatsoever.They posted twitch feeds to showcase what the game looks like and claim""transparency."" But this is just decieving eye candy. To make you believe there is depth to the game.I even watched a few lets play videos and seeing how the game starts out, it looked very interesting and makes you think that the game must go very deep as it progresses.  But in reality, thats where it ends.  It was enough to trick me into buying it, and kept me interested long enough to get past the 2 hour mark for refunds.Dont let yourself be duped like I was.  The dev team stresses how they worked so hard and long for 2 years to make this game.  When they said they worked on it for 2 years that should have been a clue that the game isnt that good.  This game is worth about $5 tops.  Maybe if they had put 3-4 years into making this a much better game, it would be worth $40.  Right now, $40 is a huge ripoff.  But you dont realize it until its too late.  Heck I might even say they planned it this way.  They dont even plan to make it better.  Devs will visit the forum, and even comment on peoples reviews, begging people to give them better reviews.  They are either being slimy or are just that stupid.The only good thing is the music.  I really liked the music.  But thats it.My recommendation for this game is ""Hell No"" This game is garbage and a waste of money.  Dont buy it.If you want to play an actual grand strategy game, take a look at Medieval 2: Total War.  That game makes this one look like puke.  Or Crusader Kings 2**EDIT** I need to add this.  It seems the devs are using fake accounts on this forum to promote the game and sucker people into buying it.  If you see anyone claiming to have played hundreds of hours and how great it is, just have a look at their profile.  They are all private, zero level steam accounts.   Theres more than a few of them here in their steam forum.  They are all fakers.  Do not buy this garbage game from these deceptive developers.I have reported this game to steam for fraud and all of their fake accounts.  And everyone else should too.  Dont let them get away with this scam.			"

												Beautifully made empire building game in a non-fantasy setting of medieval Europe. Furthermore, it is not like Total War (in a positive way, I'm a TW-fan myself). It focuses more on the strategic, econimcal and diplomatic aspects than TW. GA: Medieval offers an enjoyable, fully narrated campaign, alternatively an ""open world"" play mode and multiplayer mode. I have not yet tested the multiplayer, but will update the review once I have.  My impressions so far from --- (very bad) to +++ (very good):Stability: +++No crashes and no issues with alt-tabbing in and out of game.Music: ++Nice, soft medieval background music. Graphics: ++ Better than the map view of current Total War titles so far. Lacks the unit details of TW, though, but zoom-in and zoom-out is far more smooth plus the weather details are better.Gameplay: +++In the campaign, you start as the ruler of a small city and have to increase your wealth and power by military and diplomatic means. The missions you receive during the campaign will help you with that. GA:Medieval has a very nice balance of micro- and macromanaging, which is something that I imagine is very hard to design. E.g. you can set up trading routes for your traders within seconds and just let them trade between these cities on their own. They do a good job with that. However, you can still take over manual control to send out traders to buy or sell the exact items in the exact quantities you need. You may stumble over ""adventure sites"" with your scouts which most times will result in small combats and a bit of loot, if you manage to get the upper hand. Diplomacy is no one-way communcation in this game. AI-Characters may contact you with diplomatic offers or even missions, which may raise or lower your diplomatic standing with other parties. You can decide which buildings to build in your cities, but have to keep an eye on what you want to produce with them, how much and what kind of ressources they need and if there are enough workers in your city to run the production building. Overall very nicely done with a lot of choices to be made.Tactics: -Since I mentioned Total War in my review, I thought it neccessary to touch the topic of ""tactics"" this game offers. There is no separation of strategic map movement and tactical battles. There is one map which handles both. You do not control the movement of units in battle and so forth. You send them into battle and can pull them out, if you feel that you have to. In this aspect, GA:Medival is far, far behind of TW. If you think GA:Medieval is another TW-clone and you play TW because of the tactical battles, then GA:Medieval will be a vast disapointment in this matter. On the plus site, units in GA:Medieval tend to follow a rock/paper/scissors mechanic, e.g. Archers beeing superior against infantry, but weak against cavalry etc. So you have the tactical option of chosing which units to send into battle against which enemy.Multiplayer: ?Not yet tested.I'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.EDIT 1: The first good impressions did no lie. It's good and it's getting better, including NOT A SINGLE graphic or game bug, crash or other technical issue after hours of continous gameplay. Remember that this is the first day of the game's release! Furthermore, and I try not to spoiler, I want to let you know that the advancement of your rank isn't just a number that increases over time. Entire new aspects of the game become available and you continously shift from micromanaging to macromanaging - without losing the ability to micromanage units, cities and so on if you feel you should intervene. EDIT 2:The story of the campaign is easy to follow and surprises with some ""interesting"" turns of events. Again, I don't mean to spoiler. That said, I just got the steam achievement ""Got Laid!"". :DEDIT 3:There's far more trading to be done than I tought. Although you can ""fire and forget"" your trader units and send them on a trading route of cities you specified where they buy and sell stuff, you will still want to micro at least one trader unit. I'm still early in the game and maybe the weight of the trading aspect will shift once I've advanced my rank from names that sound mercantile (Merchant, Landlord, etc.) to more noble titles. I still review the Gameplay as very good (+++), but the focus on trading that I feel in this early stage of the game push the rating a little in the direction of ""only"" good (++) without justifying a demotion yet.

												This game is a niche within a niche, designed to appeal to a very specific type of strategy game fan.  Basically, if you ever played another game from this same developer (Patrician 4, Port Royale 3, or Rise of Venice) and found yourself wishing that you could have a bigger role in building the actual world and not just trading in it, this game is everything you've ever wanted.That's what this game ultimately is---a combination of a Civ-style empire builder (in real time) with 4X elements and the same trading simulation you know and love and have probably been playing since the days of Ascaron (from which studio Gaming Minds' people came, kind of like how Obsidian's full of Black Isle refugees and how Firaxis is Sid Meier's old Microprose team reincarnated.)Once you know that, you can start taking this game on its own merits, and there's a lot here if you want to deep dive into it.  In theory, you could just produce all 20 of the game's commodities in four cities total and be completely self-sufficient, and that's a perfectly valid goal to set for yourself in freeplay, if an utterly limited way to do things.  Where the game shines is in how those resources interact.  Gone are the days from Patrician 4 where you constantly asked yourself ""why are the mills that make clothing nowhere near the places that manufacture their essential raw material?  Why would anyone want to make something that relies on shipping something in from 1500 miles away in a cog?""  It makes game sense (profits proportional to effort required) but it's wildly unrealistic.Now you can plan your economy based on what the land provides.  Make towns in meadows that serve as your nation's breadbasket, sending food to that mountain outpost that makes your metal goods.  Butter up your AI rival by creating a town that makes a ridiculous amount of money trading them what they need, and use diplomacy to keep from having to go to war.  Or master those economy mechanics to support a military, but note that realism is in place here---large standing armies just weren't part of this game's time period.If you geek out on this genre (and check my Steam library---I geek out HARD on this genre), this is the game you've been waiting for, the culmination of everything a trade simulation and empire-type game can be.But that comes with a warning---this game has a ""mixed"" Steam rating for a reason.  It is absolutely, positively not for everyone.  If you weren't blown away by the previous efforts from Gaming Minds, this will not make any new converts.  I recommend this game, but only to people who are ready to embrace what it has to offer.(I haven't mentioned multiplayer, since I'm exclusively a singleplayer gamer.  Bear that in mind as well.)			"

												Grand Ages: Medieval could have been interesting but sadly it is nothing more then a mediocre and bland trading game.The game feels a bit like Patrician, mixed with a bit of 'the Guild' and Industry giant games but with a few more side activities like founding new towns ( but have no control over it aside from choosing a few buildings ) and a bit of simplistic warfare. All the elements are pretty basic and the variety of goods traded are few and bland. The only thing you are doing in this game is setting up trade routes and simple trade alliances with the occasional boring battle over which you have no control whatsoever. This could have been an awesome game of medieval town and business development with intricate production chains and in depth trading, but sadly it is not. If they had kept the Grand Ages city building style or made a more in depth medieval business simulator like the Guild or even Tropico style it would have been a bestseller. Now it's a game that does neither of the elements that made the other games enjoyable very well. If you want a good enjoyable medieval styled game you'd better play Patrician, Knights of Honor, Medieval Total War, Cursader Kings 2 or the Guild.I can recommend this game only for people who want to play a basic trading game and are bored with all the older games. In my opinion all the other older  medieval ( trading ) games are better in every way. This is much too bland and not worth the full price. This game should be priced more like simple Indie-games in the 10-20 euro/dollar range. I got it cheap, but if you pay the full price you'd better refund this...this is not worth the price. Even most indie games are better and worth more then this game.Huge disappointment and a loss for those who want to immerse themselves into medieval trading and building. Maybe this game will be better in the future, but I doubt it.			"

												Conclusion: This game had the ingredients to be just amazing, but it fails in almost everything. ZERO immersive.I bought this game on pre-release, and that's a mistake I'm never doing again. Please, don't trust what you see on the promo-videos or the screenshots, because what you imagine is not what you get.I did play this game with an open mind and a positive mentality, however the game itself made every possible effort in order to make me dislike it. Let's see:1.- The only guarantee is that you're going bankrupt. No matter how hard you try, if you ever feel like doing anything besides pressing space bar (for x10 time) and see a couple of trade routes moving, you will go bankrupt.2.- The trade route system is nice, however as an ""economic"" or ""trade"" game it's quite dull. The amount of resources is quite low, and there's no reward in establishing long distance trade routes that could bring ""exotic"" goods from -let's say- Paris to Constantinople. And that's a basic thing about trade in human history... we want the things that are from very far away, and we're gonna pay hard for them. But no, not here. You will be surprised that the goods in Constantinople are more like the same that the ones in Nuremberg. Even games from almost 20 years ago (like Merchant Prince) had a much more better economic and trade system, not to say the overall immersion.3.- So you like those battle screenshots? Forget about that. The units upkeep is unbaerable and unrealistic. Just by having 5 of the basic units (axemen and archers) you will see your funds crashing. And no, you won't see them winning epic battles, because they will be crushed by leopards (that multiply while fighting) or bandits (extremely more advanced and equiped units, that also multiply while on combat). Don't even dream to take over a city or defeat another player in battle, it's not gonna happen.4.- The city and population management lacks any in-depth. It's boring.5.- Diplomatic options and AI are extremely poor.6.- There's no cultures. That means that if you play in Arabia or Scandinavia it's just the same. (and as I mentioned before... you will produce the same).I could keep going on and on and on. I hope the developers do improve this game, but if they think I will ever pay a single buck to see the improvements just forget it... I already got ripped off with 35 dollars.			"

												Just stay away for now... it needs some serious patching in terms of balancing and content. The game feels empty, a bit boring and simplistic. Imagine a Civ 5 with the biggest world imaginable and basically 8 opponents and a few citystates and no need for expansion because 4-5 strategically placed production centers can just aswell produce everything unlimited as could 40-50 cities. There just aint no need for a massive empire nor does it help to have one other than have it. Population is strictly based on your production buildings. Which means if you build 100 in 1 city its just aswell as building 1 each in 100 cities...well no its far superior in 1 city since the logistics are not really shining in this one here...Its a shame, really, i wanted it to be amazing...i loved how they sold it but damn it fell short of what was promised. Its like this: Imagine the book of lord of the rings only a little shortened to lets say 50 pages for the entire trilogy. Thats how i feel about the overly simplistic approach. There is so much missing... it feels literally empty. Nothing is going on ever... a few carts, a few scouts, a few treasures and super human speed for units. All i can say to the developers is: PLZ PLZ give this game more content and balancing patches otherwise...waste of time and money...			"

												Edit 05Oct15. They have fixed the very expensive military. Good. It still lacks reason in the production area as far as costs are concerned, and it is time consuming to either conquer or admit towns through trade. Once you have done a couple either way, it is boring and tedious. There are usually about 30 or so towns to bring to your cause, and they are all the same, just slightly different combinations of goods. Leopards and cheetahs (in England?) are very tough ♥♥♥♥♥cats and can kill entire military units, and they also respawn.You cant control military units in battle except to run away, and you build through a menu rather than a city sim. Disappointing but I will follow any changes they make and update thie review.I played this on normal settings for 40hrs over several games. This is Port Royale on land with uninteresting battle mechanics. The economy is seriously flawed. At a certain stage in the game, about 4hrs in, it turns to worms.Income from Production = 235,828 and             from Trade =85,829             from Taxes = 218,069Total Income = 861,383Expenses from Building maintenance = 89,500 and                from Buying resources = 4,905 and                from Production costs = 293,331 and                from Civilian Wages = 37,440Total Costs = 425,176Military Expenses = 347,628I should be in front by 88,579. Nope, I am going backwards by 233,078 per annum. What do I get for that hideously expensive military? Four units, 2 x Axemen and 2 x Longbowmen. Robbers on the highway have at least one Longbowmen unit and typically cost 30-40,000 per robbery which is deducted from Trade income in the statement above.This game is very much a work in progress, and it is no wonder the playtesters are not mentioned by name in the credits, I dont think they had any. No one even read the Game Tips, unless BAD HTML> means something clever. Spelling mistakes show a lack of polish and rush to start rolling the money in.  For a game that already had the trade mechanics from previous games, this is an unmitigated disaster of a game.			"

												12/8/2016 Still don't buy.Honestly this game isn't good right now, I  hoped that it'd be great but it isnt. This is both a semi review and message to the Devs. First off on a good note. The AI is good, its hard, its smarter than most I've seen and you should be proud of it. Now nice time is over. Here are a few points to improve the game vastly:1) Have MORE than 20 resources for the world. When you start the game you have 5 resources already being collected, so developers you already are able to have 25% of the ENTIRE WORLDS RESOURCES straight off the bat? With your second town, proper placement and adding points into tech to gain refined goods such as bread, beer or pork you will easily have 10 resources. Whats this? You have 50% of the ENTIRE WORLDS RESOURCES AND AVAILABLE PRODUCTION WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF THE GAME???! So the economy will quickly get swamped by the SAME GOODS EVERYONE ELSE HAS, especially when you double or triple production with more points in tech. What is this, the industrial revolution in 1050?! So consumption is so damn low, production is high, population doesn't want to pay taxes or buy things, economy crashes worse than Greece could try. Adding double resources will alleviate the economy issues, diversify and creating interesting games. Ok how about add cows? Get milk, make butter or cheese? Those 3 items don't exsist in the game, devs this is Europe. How about making weapons?? How about making ships?? How about being creative and stop taking the model of EA.2) Make combat at least mildly interesting as a Zerg Rush. With a possible basic outmanuvering like Hegemony, Medieval TW or any other real time strategy game. 3) Should've made an effort with voice acting with characters instead of the same 10 lines if that many. Seriously get draining, nothing as inspiring as the original stronghold series.  4) Lack of immersion as towns don't look that alive or feel alive, the world seems small. Adding more sounds like chickens, cows, pigs or priests would lighten up the game.5) No religion aspects? No modifiers to troops, towns or unique personalities? No Patriach or Pope? Oh I know, the Pope obviously wasn't important in that timeframe no worries. Random things that could be added. Why not have hunting, why not have several crops barley, leeks, several drinks, whiskey, spirits why not hunt several animals, deer boar, why not attrition, why not better weather mechanics, why not more comfort items, why not a decent economic game, why not a decent military game. Why not a fulfilling game?Now to quote -ITS THE ECONOMY FOOLS - Paradox Interactive Eu4 random event. Seriously if this was meant to be an economy game, which you devs HAVE DONE BEFORE, then make it vaguely similar or even God-Allah forbid fun. The premise was smart with good intentions but being lazy, narrowminded with actively saying DLC DLC DLC is a great way to end your career in EA. ""But Cat!"" Said the devs who worked 5 hours this week.""Coding is hard in an airconditioned room with long breaks, long meetings, long periods of fixing last weeks problems""You'd probably be given a good review if you did your job and provided a fun game. Said a cat with a malicious look and blood in his eyes. How I now view you guys:Your day at work is now consisting of just jerking off at the thought of how great.  How you created this game awesome  with your co-workers. Then you guys join in a circle jerk about how great you are. Then for the daily ritual the Devs this unholy pentagram circle jerk of satan produced this game of sin. You guys can't even compete with the Medieval Total War of 2002! The Pope should call a Crusade on your sins, all of Islam should call a Jihad on your decadance. Now if you're butthurt I'm glad you read this, but now get off your damn♥♥♥♥♥and provide a decent game. Seriously why should I buy another game from you in the future and god forbid a DLC? Should I now treat you like CA with lacklustre TW games? Are you going to be like Sid Meier and ride off his name and produce overrated games with little to no content but push out DLC and two years after release its ok? Now I won't get my friends to buy this, I will actively say ""Don't buy this game"" to anyone who asks. But if you guys provide DLC for free which makes the game as intended i.e. to be good, this review will be deleted and I will actively support you. Until then, such is life.			"

												There has been a lot of bad comments on this game, and I just want to clear up some Myths.For starters, this is a good game.  It's well thought out, and in depth.  The problem I see is many players don't understand the concept of supply driven economics.Myth #1.  You just need 5 cities.....  It's true, you can have 5 cities, and between them you can aquire all the resource types in the game....Seems fairly simple, even droll, However...This game has an in depth Economic aspect!!!  Trade is the primary source of income in the game.  That being said, your cities trade with one another, making profit, BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!   If all 5 cities have all the resources they need, and they only trade with one another, as the cities grow, the supply Increases, and the demand Decreases.  This causes the trades to become less, and less profitable, and eventually your trade routs are loosing money rather than making money, and you go bankrupt.   You have to carefully choose which resources you have in each city, based on the resources available in the area of the city, AND the needs of the neighboring Cities, be they yours or another player, or the AI.  I'm just 10 Hours into the game, I am a Baron, with 8 Cities, I have a Standing army of 50 units, and I am a Millionare...Litterally.....Myth #2.  There's no need to aquire more cities.   The game has a research tree that, as you could guess, enhances your economic abilities, and gives advanced units etc. Every time you level up, you get 3 more points to invest in ""Development"" (the research tree.)  The most effective way to level up, is *Drum Roll*..Aquiring More cities.!  More cities means more research, means a stronger economy, means bigger military, etc.   You can bribe your way into gaining near by cities, or just build one your self.  Again, if you just sit there with 5 cities selling the same goods to them they are going to flatline.  Expansion is essential!Myth #3.  There is no replayability.   Perhaps not in the campaign, since it is a linear plot, but there are numerous strategies one could employ to try to advance, even in the Campaign.  The free play option, is just that.  You can adjust the difficulty and numerous aspects of the game in the Single player version, to say nothing of a Multiplayer version.  ( I have not gone into Multi PLayer yet.)So replayability?...There's plenty.  Now to be fair, the game does have some things I find amusing, if not anoying...Like n ""Army of wolves""...350 wolves fighting as an organizd unit???? Rreally?? It wouldn't be so bad, but the will soundly defeat an army of 500 Militia...Then there's the fact that your merchants Only focus on Profit when they are automated, and pay little attention to the city's Needs, like food, and they don't seem to prioritize certain resources over another in a city.  For example, I have a city that needs Coal to manufacture tools, But there is another city in the trade lane that is just low on coal in general (doesn't ""Need"" the coal).  The Merchant will drop the coal in the first city that is lowest in the product to gain the most profit, rather than send it to the city that requires it to produce a product First.  As a result, you sometimes have to micromanage trade routs.All and all it's a great game.  Chalanging, fun, and in depth... You just need to have a basic understanding of Supply driven economics, and the rest is trial and error.I absolutly recomend this game!			"

***CAUTION! THIS GAME HAS A NARROW APPEAL AND WILL NOT BE RIGHT FOR EVERYONE******Please do your research and consider your expectations carefully before purchasing***A Slick and Barebones Wedding of Kalypso's Strengths...And Nothing ElseLet's talk a little about the context that spawned the  ""whats"" and the ""whys"" behind Kalypso's Grand Ages franchise.  Hopefully we'll reach some insights about the games and their place in history.Kalypso's flagship Tropico games are arguable among the best examples of the citybuilder genre in the last decade, and they've achieved a market saturation so viscous I'm confident in my assumption that you have most likely put at least a few hours into the franchise.  Kalypso uses a large portion of its sales capital to reinvest in the constant refinement of gameplay systems.  If there's one thing Kalypso knows how to make, it's a high-grade citybuilder.  For the most part in the Tropico games the major mangement systems and input-output relationships are balanced and intuitive- but also immersive and challenging.  Though I grudgingly admit that at some point Tropico 5's gameplay grew too cluttered and frenetic for me to enjoy. I'm old and I have ADD and I just can't keep up.Meanwhile, however, Kalypso has been quietly producing, reproducing, and more or less defining the standards for many contemporary mechanics and play paradigms within the somewhat niche genre of historical commodity-management games.  If you already know all this, I hail you as a fellow and thank you for keeping the genre alive.  If you aren't sure what I'm talking about, take a look deep in game list or at old bundles gathering dust in the ether, or think back to deep sales you've ignored.  Kalypso developed its systems across three paralell historical franchises: Patrician, Port Royale, and Rise of Venice.  These games aren't for everyone, but what they do- a lite but compelling simulation of ""Invisible Hand"" market relationships- they do very well. Most fans of the genre (myself included) own and play most if not all of Kalypso's contributions. The systems reward gamers who approach situations with some shrewd forethought,  who conjure a little extra willingness to grind, and who summon the chutzpah to make a few heavy gambles against the caprice of future markets.  Usually this just keeps you in the black but when it all works as you planned, you and your dynasty become fabulousy wealthy, and your organization's trade activities grants your allies prosperity and your competitors destitution. In-game this extraordinary success just means some shifting digits on a little spreadsheet with some fancy historical trims. Maybe that's why this genre in its purer forms is such a niche product.As a devotee of both genres I was giddy when word starting circulating about Kalypso's new concept, the ""Grand Ages"" franchise, which would combine the lessons from their other games into a seamless historical management sandbox.  Unfortunately what emerged, Grand Ages: Rome, was a jumbled Frankengame.  It was interesting but clunky and unintuitive, a sort of high-concept quagmire with a confused sense of scale and a baffling set of competing paradigms. Kalypso had included almost every system they'd ever made and then threw some more in there on top for good measure.A Roman Pundit Said ""There's Nothing New Under the Sun""...By Medieval Times Most of the Old is Gone Too...If GA: Rome is one side of the pundulum's swing, then GA: Medieval is the full swing opposite.  Kalypso has eliminated everything but the commodity management sheets and has stripped city management down to a single interface book from which you can either build one of the limited and static improvements or upgrade your commodity production facilities.  The rest of the UI follows a similar pattern: icons move around a map and at certain times you interact with various spreadsheets to influence or direct markets and growth.Don't get me wrong: it's deep and complex and finely balanced.  But it's startlingly narrow.  Every player is more or less exactly the same in terms of abilities and playfeel.  The only concessions to cultural distinctiveness are the local names and complexions of traders and governors.  The fact that the map is Europe is completely irrelevant to the gameplay, except that depending on your geography skills you may be able to predict resource placements.If GA: Rome was a Frankengame, then GA: Medieval is a skeletal golem: its disparate pieces may function together so well that at first it seems a living thing- but it's not. There's little heart and no breath in this automaton.  But I am convinced Kalypso will continue their refinement and eventually the Grand Ages we dream of will emerge.6/10-Conditionally recommended for niche fans and for collectors No Drama, Just Reviews  "

												GAM is not a bad game, but I can't recommend it.Many people say it's broken or that it's a recess simulation. The game is just hard to learn.It is basically an RTS, but the strategy resides in the trade system. War does exist, but it happens only a few hours after the match starts, and it's very expensive.War requires little strategy and no tatics. You just send your army on the enemy and let them fight, while you go back to manage your empire's trade economy. If you want a game aimed on war, just don't buy this, it has less of that than Civilization.Diplomacy is also limited. There is a rank, as follows: neutral > be allowed to transit inside the empire > trade inside it > peace > ally army. We can only go up or down 1 rank at a time, then there's a cooldown before we can change rank again. Only when we're on neutral we can declare war and attack. If we're above neutral rank, we must go decreasing it over time before being allowed to declare war. We are able to trade resources and gold, pay for ranking up and demand payment to remain on current rank (else decreasing it).The trading system is the most complex I've ever seen, and it's what we spend most time working on. Basically, there are 20 resources on the game, they are consumed by citizens, military and production of other resources. In example, every person needs to eat grain, building stuff requires lumber, and we can also use grain to produce beer, which people drink.From those 20 resources, each city can produce 5. The excess of production is bought by traders and sold on cities that don't produce that resource locally. When a resource is in excess, its price decreases, when it's lacking its price goes high. Traders must buy cheap and sell expensive to profit. We can automate traders routes, but the economy is dynamic and we still need to be always watching what's in excess and what's being needed and manage it.As I said in begining, this game could be good and has potential, but it lacks in many areas:1) The game is too hard to learn. Keeping the economy alive is a challenge. After more than 10 runs I learned how to handle it, but it's always a challenge and we must be careful to not let the expenses overcome the incomes.2) That's why some people call it a recess simulation, because of how hard it is to manage an empire economy. And when our balance goes 0 (which means bankrupcy), traders can't buy resources anymore and the army denies obeying orders. Yes, we paid a big amount to train the army, we pay weekly salary to them even when they are idle, and when we need them, if we don't have money at the moment, they just stay on current city and denies to leave. If they are fighting and money goes to 0 (most of it spent paying them), they leave the fight and go to nearest city and never leave it.Imagine how frustrating it is to be being attacked or be in the middle of a fight, have spent gold and resources building an army, and when you need them they aren't there for you.3) Resources aren't geographically spread. Manufactured resources, like cloth, beer and bread, can be produced in any city, given that town has the raw material needed to produce them. Raw materials are limited to places on the map where they are available and we can settle a city. The problem is that 20 resources is a low amount, and in an area where we can have 5 cities we'll find all raw material resources.Because of that, there's no incentive (resources-wise) to expand the empire. Be it by conquering or trading. Expanding is just more of the same.4) Multiplayer is boring. It's the old create/join game. Matches take many many hours to happen, nobody stays online for so long. Matches can be saved and played later, but then new players will start on already developed cities, which they might not like.Also, the game has a feature to fast forward time. In single player, it works kinda well. But in multiplayer, it only happens when all player activate it together, holding the space key. In practice it never happens, and there is still the lag that hang everybody when any 1 player lags. This makes multiplayer be MUCH slower than single player.5) War is expensive. Not only because army is extremelly expensive, sieaging a city takes time untill it's stolen. And when it finally happens, the costs of maintaining that city are very high, while the city in the begining produces pratically nothing. We must quickly send an automated trader to merge it into our economy system and wait for it to recover. While that, our income remains negative and our balance decreases risking reach 0.And when we finally bring the city back into working... we earn nothing for all the trouble. It's just a normal city as any other we have, but much more expensive than a settled one since it's already developed. We can't destroy a stolen city, of remove it from our empire. Once taken, it will be there and ours forever.There are 2 reason we may have to steal a city: a) at the long run it will be less expensive than settling one, because its business buildings will be already bought (but it's cheaper to settle and build ourselves than spend on the war to steal it) and b) when we have already settled cities on all the available land and our borders are close to our neightboors.There are of course strategies to bring an enemy to bankrupcy and pwn him hard, but we're usually busy trying to avoid our own to effectivelly be able to do it with others.It's so hard that even in the campain, which is a bsics tutorial, we bankrupt and can't continue.================Because of all that I can't recommend GAM. There are other better and cheaper games out there.			"

												It is amazing looking at all these reviews form poor to good that have so few hours; almost like everyone jumps on the review bandwagon to get their name out there despite their lack or knowledge of the game. I am no expert, by any means. But I pre-ordered and installed the moment I could. I spent most of my Friday playing. I had obligations after about my 7h mark. That being said: I recommend this game for the person who wants to play Empire Economic Sim. After about the 5 hour mark you finally get in to the combat part of the game. It is lite and not very in depth. It is very laissez faire, and if you are looking for some in depth combat, look somewhere else. The game is about establishing an empire and its trade routes. You build an army to protect that and take over other empires. The combat is similar to Knights of Honor, if you know the reference. Your men attack in a battle if they are in the general vicinity. You get bonuses based off your armies make-up. Swords beat Pike, Pike beat horse, Horse beats Archer etc. But it is very hands off after moving units in to the area.But the game shines when it comes to the economic sim. Building multiple supply chains, figuring out what merchant will make the most of his run, specifically defining his route and what goods he will trade. It is all done very well. And look beautiful. This game is fun for the people it is designed for. If you want a Total War redux, look some where else. Even against the AI it is challenging and figuring out the optimal routes is fun.I am no expert, and I feel I have only slightly broken in to this game. But since I came home from a night out and saw all the negative reviews, I feel I have to chime in. The game is fun. Watch some videos on youtube and decide for yourself.			"

												Kalypso knows how to make a game (the Tropico series, the Port Royale series), but this one just seems lazy.Gameplay:  At first it doesn't seem bad, the controls are mostly easy to figure out, and the visuals are fine.  Then your empire gets more complex.  At that point, you realize that you can't do much to control what the traders do once you set up their paths, and every battle is basically throwing your troops at theirs, and hoping your troops which get a bonus line up against their troops that suffer from that bonus (if there are mixed troops, there is no telling how it will go).  You have no control over them at that point.Environment:  Europe feels... empty.  Others have said it.  They are right.  The game advertises sometihng like 20 million square miles, but your scout covers them in short order.  In spite of that, there just aren't that many cities to interract with.  Eventually your opponents will blob out uncontrollably (France had all of France and half of Spain by 1074).  Your cities never revolt,  and combat is easy to avoid, so you can just spread out in every direction, making an empire so vast that it would have been unmanageable in the medieval era.  In fact, the game encourages you to do this, since the best of each unit type can only be received regionally.  Events:  There are never good events, only bad ones.  Famines without excellent harvests.  Plagues without baby booms.  Volcanoes without the subsequent soil improvements.  Trade goods:  limited in quantity, and you can easily make cities in nearly every region that can make the top tier goods without trading.  Campaign:  Easy to complete, but only if you don't strictly follow it.  If you do only what they say, you'll be out of money really fast.  Overall:  The game feels lonely and lazy.			"

												This game is the epitome of a dumb blonde joke- pretty but empty.Graphically it's lovely to look at with a well-chosen art style and color palette. The UI is workable and the music is quite pleasant. I'd love if the artists worked on some other strategy games because they did a nice job here.But the gameplay is the thing and there's not much here. You establish trade routes in which you import and export resources which your cities and other cities produce. After you've maxed out the production, you spam more cities and establish more trade routes. Rinse, repeat and yawn. There aren't any great key decisions, no feeling of truly building an empire or anything like that. It's city spam at its worst.There is combat in the game but it's lifeless and neither tactial or strategic in scope. It's a rock, paper, scissors affair where generally the most troops are the victorious troops. While I didn't expect combat control like Total War this really is very bland. Not to mention that a well run economy will just allow you to buy everything anyway. So what you end up with is a game that is devoid of a lot of decision making or components to keep things interesting. Given the larger number of decent strategy titles out there, this game commits the cardinal sin of being extremely dull. It's not a matter of it being worth you money. It's not worth your time. Skip it.			"

												Grand Ages: MediocreIt should be obvious by the number of hours played I tried to make this game work for me.It's an interesting puzzle game concealed within a RTS with a medieval theme. It suffers from an overblown advertising campaign that left too much to the imagination. Buyers came expecting a trading game on a grand scale and were severely disappointed. While trade is the crux of the game, it is not a traditional trading game. Sales/profits constitute the entire economic system. Efficiency is counterproductive to success. EX: Salt requires Timber to produce. If you produce Salt and Timber in the same settlement, you lose sales/profits. You have to produce Timber in another settlement and sell to the one producing Salt. That's the foundation for the entire trade/economy. You have to figure out the combinations that allow settlements to export all their goods and import all the additional goods needed for a growing population. There are 20 goods in total. A settlement can only produce 5. EX:2 Development Points open new technologies. Points are awarded for the total area your settlements occupy; measured by the circular footprints of your settlements. Building settlements close together to minimize travel times for traders and troops will cost you points. Where footprints overlap, the area is only counted once. ""...play by your own rules in free play...""The deal breaker for me was no true Freeplay/sandbox. I'm required to have at least 1 AI competitor, which makes decisions in nanoseconds from a programmed strategy. No matter what disadvantage I give the competitor so I can build in peace, it comes tearing past me demanding tribute with the threat of war. There are some other minor things that should be corrected but I believe the devs have left it for dead. Talk of DLC and updates is dated months ago. Last update only increased marketshare [added MAC users] There's nothing but lip service in the forums from developers. ""I'll pass that suggestion along. Can't promise anything."" ""As soon as there's any news, you'll be the first to know."" I'll change my recommendation if I see any signs of life.			"

												This game deserves a ""meh"". The idea has great potential, and I enjoyed the earlier stages of the game, but overall it falls flat. It's fun building your initial settlements, getting all of the resources and optimizing the trade routes. Then, nothing really happens beyond that. The resources are few and you have all of them so what now? Build more cities with the same resources with traders running similar trade routes? There is no payoff from expanding far and wide; you might as well place your cities as close together as possible because the same resources can be found just about anywhere. No cultures either, everyone has the same building tree. At this stage of the game you run into other empires and it becomes a tireless grind. Diplomacy is non existent beyond paying gold for neutrality/trade/alliances. Combat is super simple with only a few unit types and no micromanagement. This is fine by me, I expected this when I bought the game but there are just no pay offs beyond this point, combat or otherwise. The AI will puke out another army every once in a while, you will eventually fight them off while also battling bankruptcy, and maybe take one of their cities. Trying to integrate it into your empire is a chore because you already have everything it produces. I guess you can have traders go there but really who cares. Now it's just stuck on repeat with nothing interesting left to explore. You clone your initial group of several cities over and over, try to organize the chaos of captured cities, and buy more trade carts. The AI has zero personality and reminds me of text-based RPGs. Cities and military units are also lifeless. Fights are not fun to watch. It's sad because the graphics are great, the economics and trade are solid, and I can imagine a great game here but this is just an empty version of that.As far as comparisons to other games, this is more like Tropico that anything else (which makes sense since it's also Kalypso). If you've played it, imagine matching farms with factories and seeing palace guards fight.. but not as good.			"

												Oversimplified trading simulation. Have wine yards in North Scandinavia, coal in the next random town and so on.Decisions where you place your towns doesnt matter. Decisions what to trade doesnt matter. You have everything everywhere. Greatest challenge is the questionable autotraderoute AI.Normally your computer neighbours leave you in peace and spam their towns everywhere.Battles consist of spamming units in an endless stream. For some reason one of the computer opponents doesnt send units at all and loses his towns. As long as both sides spam units, no side will lose nor win anything - just an everlasting battle with endless resupply. Thinking about making a blockade around the town to cut off resupply? - No way, you get spamed everyway. Maybe you want to try if you or the computer opponent is the better spam clicker.... in this case have fun			"

												Grand Ages is really fun for the first hour or 2 of game play.  I really like their concept of the trade routes and getting goods to all my cities.  The problem I see for this game is that after you've got a few cities and have obtained all the trade goods it becomes very repetative.  Build a few cities and create a trade network among them and repeat.  If it was possible to obtain more numerous and more rare trade goods to add to the network it could be more challenging and more interesting.The military aspect of the game is very simple and unimaginative.   You build a bunch of troops and throw them at the enemy.  You have almost no conrol over your troops once in combat so battle tactics and strategy aren't much of a factor.  It quickly becomes very tedious once you go to war.Im dating myself here, but it almost reminds me of Caesar 3.  Really feels more like a low complexity city builder than a Grand Strategy.  This game has alot of possibility, but just needs some fine tuning to make it replayable.  Replayability is where this game really falls short.I give this game a 5 of 10			"

												I'm torn in saying this but it isn't worth it unless you MUST HAVE something to keep you entertained.Pros:- Found new cities- Choose resources to exploit- Very easy to pick up and play- Good for people with kids that interrupt gaming every 5 minutes (see shallow depth)Cons:- Extremely simplistic training, trading, battles, diplomacy, empire management (everything that puts depth into the game)As someone who enjoys depth this game is fully lacking in nearly every aspect from which I can get from any number of titles such as Patrician, Port Royale, Total War, Crusader Kings, Europa, etc.Examples:When you build a new resource production building, your town will get 100 new people and will gain new workers at a set rate. Diplomacy involves cash bribes and trading needed resources to a town until it reaches certain %'s and then you ask it to be part of your empire and it accepts...Promotion appears to be based on population so simply growing industry broadly is the best way of promotion while supplying your empire. There's no focus on diplomacy skill, martial skills, or economic management.			"

												JUST A WARNING BEFOREHAND THAT THIS IS A LONG INDEPTH REVIEW ABOUT THE GAME SO IF YOU ARE LAZY TO READ IT JUST SKIP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW.Now before you skip this game over for some negative reviews talking about the difficulty of this game or it being set up for some overpriced expansions, just hear me out. This game has a lot of potential and while I agree it maybe kinda pricey compare to some of the older games with a very similar genre this game still have its own merit to make it stand out from the rest. Now let me list down some of the things that you should know before purchasing this game;1. THIS GAME IS NOT TOTAL WAR - thats right, some of the screenshots might a little bit misleading making some players to believe that this game is similar to the franchise that is Total War. I must warned you first that this game is not about total war but more on trade and economic warfare that an all-out battle between soldiers.2. THIS GAME IS NOT A POLITICAL SIMULATOR - the politics in this game is rather abysmal and frankly for me personally is kinda disappointing as there is really not much for you to do when it comes to politics; other than the occasional declaration of war and trade or any other sort of agreements between neutral and hostile cities/players. It is really simplified to the point where if you are to do any agreement between you and the AIs, all you need to do is pay a sum of money according to the amount of population they have. Disappointing yes, this is one thing I hope will change in the future.3. THIS GAME IS NOT A CITY BUILDER – too often I see people complain about the fact that there is little to no choice of placement of buildings within the city compared to the likes that is Civilization/ Banished etc so let this be warning to you: This is not a city builder, in fact I would think this is more of an empire builder than anything; you get WILL get the choice to place where you want you city to be, you WILL also get to choose what buildings you want to build in said city, BUT you WILL NOT get the choice of where you want said building to be place at in said city. THIS GAME IS A GREAT TRADE-EMPIRE BUILDER SIMULATOR! In fact I would say it shows a somewhat perfect way of what capitalism is all about. Now I’m not here to talk about politics, I’m here to talk about the game itself. One thing great about this game is that really challenges you to make use of what confined land you are given/ spawned in and how to make use of said land’s natural resources. As you may already (or not) know, there is 20 resources that you must take advantage of in order to make the money that you need to expand your trade empire. To acquire said resources you must build businesses that will generate the resource that your city is geared for. Another thing you must also take note is that the MERCHANTS in this game that you HIRED are completely in it for their own profit. They will not work like a mindless drone controlled by some human player on what and what not to buy for no profit for them at all. (Though if I am not wrong there is a way for you to do that after researching a technology) They WILL go and buy whatever they think they could make some form of profit from and WILL SELL it to any FIRST CITY they go to that they THINK THEY CAN SELL FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE. Of course where the merchants goes to is completely controllable by the player but how and what they is mostly determined by the merchants. You can control this somewhat by controlling the trade route that you set them in manually or by building the warehouse and designating the resources you want them to stockpile for resale in another city by another merchant. This may seem very complicated at first but after playing it for awhile (or reading the guides that some of the community has made) you will eventually get the hang of it. This game has a nice balance in micromanagement and macromanagement and may be for everyone.Warfare in this game though pretty much boils down to a numbers game with a simple rock-paper-scissors format where archers beats swordsman, swordsman beats spearman and spearman beats horseman. Maintenance of the troops is also somewhat a problem in the early game where you have no money as the troop’s payment is rather high and note that you must maintain the troops with supplies from your nearest city as well giving them a range penalty on how they can from your empire. Most of the time a spam of mercenaries would be enough for most situations, only at times you will need to have a small contingent of elite troops such as knights and the likes. Another thing you should not is that certain units are regional base and can only be hired at certain regions. There will also be the occasional raids by bandits and the likes where you can build an archer tower to kinda counter it. A problem I have with this would be the large attacks of wild animals like bears and wolves which the developer has will looked into.  There is also a naval warship and the likes but it’s pretty much the same as the land. So here’s the indepth review/ preview of what this game is really like. Now some might argue that this game is unpolished and is set up for future overprices expansions but basing it off on Kalypso ‘s, the most expansive it should be would be around 20 dollars and below. Now I’m saying it based on SGD (Singapore Dollars) pricing so I’m not sure what it would be you monetary terms but I’m sure if they do make it so pricey it would be worth it. Take a look at Patrician IV: Rise of a Dynasty. It’s a pretty pricey amount for a DLC but hey it was worth it.NOW FOR ALL THOSE WHO SKIPPED ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE, HERE’S THE SHORT VERSION OF IT:Pros:Stability – No crashes so far, all in all pretty stable even on the highest settings and when Alt-Tabbing in and out.Music – I personally love the music in this game, Nice and soft medievalish musicGraphics – It’s actually better, in my opinion, than the Total War games map view and less laggy compare to their newer games. The troop details are not as extensive as Total War though.Gameplay – Campaign in this game is a good combination of basic tutorials and open campaign gameplay. Though be warned, it will still take a while to get used to as they do not explain every little detail to first time player. Trade is a big factor in this game and even more so than war or anything else for that matter. Do not be deceived by the Screenshots and trailers talking about war in this game as it is nothing more than a rock-paper-scissors numbers game. This game has a nice balance in micromanagement and macromanagement where trade is biggest factor for victory and is definitely not for everyone.Cons:Bugs – Like any game out there, there will be bugs. Currently there is a bug where you builder will start upgrading the road only to stop halfway even when you have all your necessary resources needed. Another bug is the occasional resource missing bug where it will say that there is a missing resource.Wildlife – Attacks by wildlife is ridiculous at times as there will be times they will spawn 4 to 5 Bears hunting down your merchants as you trade. It really breaks the immersion. One way I counter this is to build a couple of towers around the roads where they attack and manned them with archers.Warfare – Like I said earlier and I cannot emphasize it enough, it is nothing but a numbers game with a rock paper scissors format. The only other way to do war is to blockade the cities with ships/ sieging them with troops and starve the city out with something like a timer where troops on both side will die as the game progresses.I'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.

												Likes:It is a grand strategy covering medieval European (not entire world) history (not fantasy). A BIG Plus for this. Not too many new games like this - Attila and only partially Crusader Kings 2 and Civilization V.Cool graphic. I wished that CK2 had it like this. Very good solution. You have strategic view but you can zoom in and you see a city into the details (no need for separate window). I would only like more variety, more faces, more colours and flags and most importantly that developers add different cities look for different regions. And I would prefer if the characters and soldiers were less comic drawing and more reality shots. Bonus plus, that humans are scaled to fit everything else on screen, enough with those giant soldiers covering entire city.It is a complex game not too easy to learn, yet not too hard.Dislike:Overly agressive AI opponents, for my taste, for a game like this. Large minus. Not too many difficulity levels. Three. There is no one for the beginers, easy or so.Things that I like to be more improved as mentioned in upper part of the review, were I wrote about better part of the game. In another words, it is published earlier than it should be. But I guess that seems to be a standard nowdays, with majority of the games, unfortunetly. However all that can be added latter if the developer continue to maintance the game.Overal, I recomend the game.I wrote this, just to give support and incourage making of more games simular like this.Allthought I am not sure if anyone will read this. :)			"

												I've always wanted a game like this - an open sandbox empire building economic simulator.  While this game checks off all those boxes, it does nothing more than that.  Grand Ages Medieval is laughably simple and can be mastered in under a half hour.  Not understood in half an hour - mastered.  I've seen some reviews say this game appeals to Crusader Kings 2 / Europa Universalis 4 players.  As someone who has put several hundred hours into both games, Grand Ages Medieval does not compare.  If you're looking for an in-depth simulator, go elsewhere.			"

												This game needs about 2-3 times the number of resources and a few more production chains.  They could have done so much more.  Obvious trade goods that come to mind weapons, horses, stone, marble and dairy.  It feels to me like they took every short cut and cost saving step they could to put a minimal product out and covered it with pretty scenary and called it a day.  I hate giving bad reviews but it is what it is.  The game also randomly crashes periodically.			"

Posted: September 28, 2015
												Another Kalypso published game missing the mark & just creating another remake.I've played Port Royale, Patrician & Rise of Venice, I'd definitely like to start off by saying I love trading simulators in fact I love most economic simulators & even military simulators, my love for them definitely started back in 2003 somewhere when I played my first Port Royale, I think they're great but in recent years the economy ones have been stagnant with no innovation what so ever, you can literally install most old & new economic simulators by Kalypso & with out a doubt get the same experience, with the poorest one lacking some insane depth that which I hate to name Rise of Venice which was a complete screw up to me, and although that may seem irrelevant it's sadly very similar to this title Grand Age, in the way that the AI & trading works great & are its strongest areas, it just falls flat everywhere else, which I'd like to repeat to get the point across mostly to Kalypso & the developers who constantly keep creating these things.The approach they took with Grand Age, with land trading & towns is for sure awesome & a different approach than the sea trading simulators we usually see, but that doesn't seperate it enough to be that different.This is the theme I seem to be seeing since Patrician 3-4, Port Royale 2-3 & Rise of Venice, there is never any increased depth or improvements on their titles, I don't know if it's out of fear of changing the formula too much or just straight up lack of inspiration, but this is just another trading simulator, which I personally enjoy because of that, but it ends there I can't honestly recommend a title when I can as easily recommend another/older title that is similar.The trading is what you'd expect, it's fun, as it usually is & is only complimented by the AI, which I'd consider its only redeeming feature but it's an economic simulator, of which they've had years of experience developing, they can't ♥♥♥♥ it up at this point. The AI runs well, in fact in most cases the opposing AI will run better than you ever will, so it's not like you're not going to have a challenge, that and the AI traders you command do a pretty effective job, like they did in Rise of Venice, but because of Rise of Venice I can't say I was particularly impressed as it's not new, we've been seeing it for the longest time. Now sadly the amount of goods you can create or trade is once again limited, like in every other Kalypso published title of late, it's like they can't go beyond the simple variety of goods for whatever reason, so the maximum we have is 20, which means you can effectively create & distribute everything within the first 5-6 city's with good placement, the game sadly misses a lot of core goods that could be there, but I'm not really sure if this is that big an issue seeing as trading is all automated anyway. It's again nothing we haven't seen from past games, it's all still here with no improvements to innovation.The combat, like in most Kalypso games has always been there but they've never really been able to hit the nail on the head & in most cases I'm fine with that, I don't expect stellar combat mechanics from their titles, but Grand Age I have to say has the poorest combat mechanics I've seen in quite some time, it's a prolonged zergy mess, it takes way to long for combat to end, upto weeks for small scale battles & years or even forever for larger scale scenarios, when you & your enemy are fully developed there is no stopping the production of units, you can create units quicker than you can destroy them, so you end up with this eye saw of a mess bogged up in an area until someone goes bankrupt.Now that I think about it, they could have taken the combat out & my experience would have improved, that's how bad I consider the combat, you might as well just make it so you have to buy out all the competition, which is another issue I have with the title.This is where in my opinion the game falls off more than anything else I mentioned, the Towns/Villages & your interaction with the enemy through Politics & Diplomacy, it's all mediocre with no depth, Money gains you everything for the most part, influence/Sympathy & enemy towns, whatever you want to call it, it's all countered or based on how wealthy you are, it's not controlled by your actions or how you act. That also means if you want to destroy you opponent you can buy out their towns gradually if you're wealthy enough, though I have yet to see the enemy do or attempt this, probably because you'd decline as you're not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Towns/City's are all just Troops & Money spitters, they don't do anything besides that, they don't interact with you or with each other in any real sense apart from when you're using automated traders to pump more cash.I try not to compare games to other games that take completely different approaches to what they're trying to do, but there are definitely games out there that Grand Age could have taken from, Crusader Kings is a perfect example, hell even Mount & Blade could have influenced this title in a positive way, both of which are filled with depth, in the areas this lacks it, diplomacy/interaction/towns.Meh, I can only hope they introduce DLC that improves it in a positive way, I don't even care if they go down the Crusader Kings 1000 DLC route, as I'm sure economic simulators a somewhat of a niche genre anyway.This review is mostly due to people on the forums who are trying to get others on the forum to create positive reviews for another lack luster title.I apologies in advance if this review seems unorganised or poorly written, I don't usually write reviews for anything.

												This game seems to have gotten a bit of a bad rap. Coming from someone who has played a lot of Paradox games, Civilization and the like, I can safely say it's not a bad game.However it's not as good as it could have been, and that's what seems to have annoyed a lot of people. All the groundwork is there for this to be a truley spectacular game, but it just falls frustratingly short. Falling back to cliché car analogies - it's like someone took the time to design and make a very beautiful sports car, but did the interior lazily with some bad IKEA furniture at the last minute.It's missing that extra finish, those few extra mechanics which make the game far more fun and engaging (this could be anything from a political system, to more building options, etc.). Hopefully the devs will add this kind of stuff in, because it has so much potential to be a great game, but at the moment it's just a bit shallow.Also the game runs flawlessly on Linux ;).			"

												Grand Ages: Medieval is interesting in that, outwardly, it looks like many things that it isn’t. It takes its name from Grand Ages: Rome, in turn descended from the Imperium Civitas series (Glory of the Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum). However, Medieval is not a city-builder. From trailers, the game looks similar to RTS games like Total War, but military conquest is a token inclusion. The idea of trade and economy might bring up memories of Patrician or even Europa Universalis, and the top-down view even resembles Civilization in some ways. Grand Ages, however, is none of that.At best, imagine Civilization with every part of the game stripped down, and the only thing left over is the resource management. I do not exaggerate – resource management is the only gameplay mechanic of this game. It is a very specific niche with a very specific appeal, and there’s that satisfaction when you figure out how to do it right. Sadly, that doesn’t take long at all.Despite many complaints that the economy is too hard to figure out, it is actually far too simple. The core of the gameplay is centred on the production and distribution of 20 resources, including grain, wine, metals, and so on. Certain resources can then be used to manufacture more advanced goods, and in turn luxury items. These are then sold via trade routes to other cities for profit based on supply and demand. An observant player will realise that succeeding in the game isn’t really based on conquest, but understanding how to get resources to where they are in demand.Mastering the economy starts off with establishing trade routes to cover the resources you don’t have, but once you build new cities with specialties or source from other towns, you’ll find that you can easily supply the 20 different resources internally quite easily, and from there it really comes down to distribution. An understanding of shipping routes on a FedEx scale, with hubs and spokes and warehouses, makes more sense than manually buying and selling. The game features a rather generous auto-trade system with the AI-controlled traders picking items based on demand and always selling at profit. As long as you have enough resources being produced, and enough carts to carry said resources, there’s nothing impeding you from turning an easy profit.Military conquest is barely a thing. First you get annoyed at how your troops get obliterated by packs of hundreds of wild animals that stop your trade routes. Then you set up a strong enough economy to click the train button a few hundred times to build a massive army that takes ages to siege down a city. You either blitz through whole empires with weak fortresses, or spend weeks sitting outside a town to see which HP meter goes down first. There’s no control; just which blob is bigger. And if you don’t want to play the military game, you can just buy out cities with the infinite money you generate.Perhaps what is most difficult to swallow is that the game isn’t challenging or difficult because of the depth and complexity of the game. It’s because the game’s interface is shockingly designed. For an economic empire builder, there is a surprising lack of information on-screen. Most of the vital information is hidden through several menus. Fine-tuning your economy is more a matter of manually checking lists and then, much to the hatred of my wrist, having to click on what to build, whether it’s more carts or more businesses. It’s agonising that these things aren’t automated or at least provided with shortcuts. Most of the time I spent in the game was looking at menus and clicking the plus button a hundred times.The game features a campaign mode, with a story-driven conquest based around the Byzantine Empire, as well as a free-play mode where you can play anywhere in Europe. The campaign teaches you some basics, but is very easy to complete once you master the economy – which takes around 6 hours. The fact that there is only one campaign is sorely disappointing considering the whole map is there, which leads me to believe that Kalypso has another dodgy DLC model in mind. This lack of replay value destroys the value of buying the game. If you’re looking for endless new campaigns such as what you might get from SimCity, Europa Universalis or Civilization, you will not get that satisfaction. It’s just too quick and easy to get a strong economy going and very little challenge.This ridiculous tedium, lack of complexity and low replay value renders Grand Ages: Medieval a dismal game. If you like drawing lines on a map, clicking the same button a thousand times and watching a number go up, you might like this game. Even then, you’ll tire of this within a few days. This has been the easiest, least challenging game from Kalypso I have seen.For a playthrough of the campaign, see my video series:

												Okay Okay..... Everyone is moaning about going bankrupt and army costs and how its a reccession simulator. Well its not your are just overproducing the same commodities or your town management is not right.Right for people who are thinking of buying this game the promo videos are misleading to say the least and the game on the videos are not quite the game you get, Internet shopping right?? BUT... this game is fun and if you stick with it you will have fun so lets get starting on this review.The campaign is really good and gives you really good advice and help to advance through it so thats a bonus. Start with that because if you do an open game you will have NO idea what to do. The trading system is good by adding more traders and carts to different locations that you in in reach of because of supply but it lacks depth as all commodities can be produced well.....anywhere. Wine in scandinavia? furs in egypt..? that really needs tweaking. Diplomacy needs looked at as everything costs a fortune be it gold....commodities amongst others every lord/emperor/prince i have met are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Combat is really a cluster ♥♥♥♥ and that is probably the worst part of the game from roaming lynx, bears and wolves who all dwell in caves and no matter how many time you deal with them breed like rats and just come back. I do like the bandit camps and that is more realistic and once you destroy the camp its gone. But you cannot destroy the caves and they will respawn. Combat seems broken I had 5k troops VS 240 bandits and during the battle only 1200 could fight.... so 3800 were standing around the batle cheering on their allies its just not right. Wolves and lynxs can be dealth with but the bears JESUS what do they have machine guns??? they just slaughter your troops, info on bottom battle panel "" your polearm does no more than glance off the enemys formation"" i mean come on?? I have do deal with machine gun wielding, phalanx formationed bears IT REALLY NEEDS WORK.Now the expansion part is fun and gets harder as you go along now you dont always have to take over towns by force it will cost you far more than you need to. You can do it via diplomacy granded you are liked by their population at over 95% by selling them commodities they are running low on and also your sympathy is over 80%. Population liking i get but sympathy i dont.... Also when you start a campaign you have 8 competitors or how ever many you set but wheres the victory conditions or any idea on how to actually complete the campigh you have just started...... does not say it anywhere maybe you just take out your competitors right??? you would think so but they are always 10 cities infront of you and have atleast 5 x your army its like picking a fight with an apache gun ship ffsI seriously hope this game gets patched or they need to start giving money back to some people who may have been mis sold PPI..... sorry thats another subject. For the reasons of the promo videos and serious lacking of battle gamplay, no victory conditions on campign and general gamplay issues i would really like to recomend this to anyone that i dont like. Buy it if you like and if you like it im happy for you may even have a game sometime but just rememberwatch out for the machine gun wielding phalanx formationed bears :)			"

												Ok. I liked this game. But don't be deceived by its title. This is a trade simulator which resembles Patrician IV or Rise of Venice. It is not a city building game since you cannot plan your town or choose the location of key buildings. City management is not as complex as that of Civilization series. There is a lack of variety between regions. It feels the same whether you play in North Africa or in Scandinavia.Nonetheless, if you liked the Patrician series, you may also find this game interesting.			"

												First off, this is an economy game. The trailer is misleading. Take a moment, let that sink in...Right then!The combat is extremely simple; Total War this is not. _Do not buy it for the combat._ It's also a bit fiddly and could use a little improvement for what is there, but it boils down to Rock, Paper, Scissors with a ratio control. Have a lot of archers vs a lot of melee and no horses? Bonus to damage, and so on. It's a game of balancing the combats, and numbers. Pure, simple, numbers. If you can field and finance more than the other guy, you'll likely win.Overall, it's more akin to Patrician than many others I've played, though there is a bit of a Hegemony vibe in there, and a bit of those progress quest-like games too. Numbers, numbers, more! MOAR! The trading is the main point of the game: setting the towns up and picking production to create profitable routes, and expand your empire. Grand Ages: Medieval, however, takes a little bit different of an approach. Instead of being able to micro everything, you're controlling the macro. There is no placement, there are no trees to worry about. You plonk down a business, and once it generates some workers it's off an running. Additionally, you can't just make a bunch of traders and have to worry about paying them - you get 1 per city (though you still have to pay 'em.)It's all about the routes, and the various ways you can set those up. It's oddly engrossing to sit there and constantly tweak what's going on, and I've caught myself losing hours to it. "

												To sum up, this is a game very similar to Patrician with Civ 5 diplomatic elements and very simplistic Total War combat mechanics. Even then, I would compare this game to the classic, Knights of Honor (go buy that and thank me later). The game, aesthetically, is downright beautiful. The towns feel alive and are incredibly visually appealing while the soundtrack is peacefully immersive and you're immediately drawn into this economic simulation Gaming Minds has presented for you. It's actually really peaceful and enjoyable just to watch your (eventually) sprawling country to just ""live."" How's the gameplay though, you ask? It's alright. Relatively simplistic and easy to get drawn in to it's a pretty barebones simulation of economics on a Medieval scale. You build this building to make ""this resource"" while paying ""set amount of money"" as salaries and upkeep and sell the excess as profits. It's not exactly innovative or unique but it's most certainly competent and can be relatively stress-free unlike games such as the Guild 2 where market fluctuations from all manner of events can make or break your Dynasty and personal relationships can increase or decrease the longevity of your life span. The combat in this game can also be clunky at times. I don't know if it was intended this way or is just glitches but it seems like troops don't always want to engage troops that are already currently engaged which is rather strange. I found myself battling this problem while trying to take over my nearest neighbor who seemed to have been protected by his city's selection box.All in all, the game isn't bad, gameplay-wise it's your standard economic simulation, and not much else. Aesthetically, artisitcally, it's downright gorgeous and it makes for a damn beautiful game to just vicariously inspect.Gameplay Footage and Overview:

												this game has the potential to be a good game but it is not. it is simply way to repetitive and the ai is basically invisible on the european scale campain. the fact is the the game is limited to 8 players, (one per  starting region) is a good idea considering that it will give you place to expend. But expanding is nearly impossible! Since you'll basically go bankrupt after your third or fourth town. It simply doesn't translate well the economy during the medieval era. There is no taxation sytem which is weird considering that most european economy at the time where based on serfdom. The economy is based soly on trade and even if you can technically raid or siege, you will not get there before many hours of gameplay and even then your econnomy will be so fragile that you won't be able to do or gain anything by it! i wish i could get a refund for this but since i spent way more hours than the maximum required for the refund policy in order to learn the bases of the game i won't be able to get one. DON'T BUY IT!			"

												Grand Ages: Medieval blends economy management with Crusader Kings II-esque combat between the player and AI or other players. The game revolves around building towns in areas on the map which offer access to specific resources, dependent on the region. The game looks good from a graphics standpoint but the combat is lacking, involving little more than building a stack of units and right clicking another stack just to watch them fight it out. The economy management part of the game is very lacklustre, as it is far too easy to get access to all resources and build the buildings which allow you to build tiered resources e.g access to honey and fruit allows you to craft mead, and after this point the game is won by simply building an army and steamrolling opponents. Overall the game is not bad or broken, it just feels very unfinished. Like an EA game due for half of the base game content released as DLC, but it has been out for almost a year with only one patch that dropped a few weeks after release. Definitely not worth the price tag. Maybe worth $5 for a few hours of entertainment or to play with a friend.			"

												After playing a few hours on this game I can see both good and bad things about this game, ultimately I feel it is a good game, but I need to explain why..The Pros:This game has been released in an outstanding condition, not once have I experienced a crash or come across any bugs, accomplishing that in this day and age with the sheer amount of different computer setups you can find is by no means an easy feat, so kudos to the developers for that one.The game is a nice fresh breath from games like the TW or EU or CK games, this game is more focused on trade and building an empire than it is with combat. Combat does appear in the game, but you do not control it, like the Civvie games for example.Management of trade and production can be both manually controlled or automated, allowing you to play the way you want to.The cons:Content. As it stands the game is quite hollow, there is definately room for the game to be fleshed out in almost every aspect. Content has clearly been removed or never added with the intention of being made available via DLC.Mods. As far as I can see there is no mod support what so ever, but then again the game was only released yesterday, so we will see if the game will become moddable or not.Conclusion:A good game but it is in need of fleshing out, I personally do not mind paying for DLC, but only when the game adds something new to an already fleshed out game. Take Cities: Skylines for example, the new After Dark DLC for that game is by far the most outstanding and worthwhile DLC I have ever purchased. What I do not like is content being removed for the purpose of DLC just so developers can make more money. GAM is a good game, it certainly has potential, but the path the developers seem to be taking in terms of content/DLC, I am not sure weather or not I will purchase any DLC if and when it comes along.One final note: the price.This game is NOT worth 30 pounds, I pre ordered at a discount which I am thankful for, if you do not own this, wait a while and see what the developers do with it. As another review said, wait for a steam sale, or wait for a GOTY edition with DLC included.Bottom line, wait to purchase and give it time.			"

												In the beginning I though that this game would be good. I looked at gameplays and trailers and I started to get hyped for it since it looked pretty nice. Once I got the game I started it with hopes of a new empire/traiding game where economy would be the focus since that is what they said (devs,youtubers etc..) After a couple of hours I managed to create a little empire after several tries whilst learning the game. I discovered a place where you could see other empires and how well it went for them and so I went in there to look and I beheld the empires that had blobbed the entire map while I only had like 4 cities the AI empires each and everyone had atleast 10 cities... I thought to myself ""well i better pick up the pace then"". After an hour I had 15 cities and my army was big until I saw the size of each and every other AI empire.. 30-40 CITIES EACH??? Wtf? So after this I started over and this time i did my best to build up a stable empire and I grew quickly but even when it went quiet well for me the AIs spammed cities everywhere and they all had perfect economies. I coninued to play the game because I wanted to find a way to win but since every other empire took decisions every milisecond they could easily defeat me in a war that they started.After this I quit the game for a while. I came back to again a while later and I started to look not into myself for problems but into the game instead and the games Economy system is broken. It does not work as economic systems would work in a logical game or reality. Lets say I produce Salt but I need timber in order to produce it. So would it not make sense to create a timber place next to the salt factory to minimize traveling time and costs? Well not to the game since if you do this then you lose more then you gain... WTF? DEVS?? DO YOU EVEN LOGIC??I was very disappointed in this game but I learned a good thing after I noticed that I could not get a refund. I learned to listen to my gutfeeling and not to buy on impulses. After this game came out my personal economy improved not just because the game was good but because it was♥♥♥♥♥♥ DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT AN ECONOMIC GRAND STRATEGY GAME.BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A MOBILE GAME ON A PC. I rate this game 1/10 the 1 is for nice graphics.			"

												A lot of negative reviews seem to be from people who where expecting a different game, which is not fair on the devs as obviously alot of work went into the game.At first I was struggling like most people to make a profit and advance in the game but after reading some guides that's no longer a problem. This game lets you found towns, produce and trade good, make war and peace. it has a very nice campaign to show you the basics, there are some special buildings like the Inn where you can buy traders, builders, play a game of dice and send workers to other towns, a church lets you feed feed the poor and hold festivals etc.Don't expect anything like the total war games, the combat is pretty much out of your control. You can recruit mercenries, pikemen, axe men, scout, cavalry, mounted archer, archersand ships. Other units are restricted to regions, berserkers, flailsmen, swordsman, sabre fighter, knight, mounted warrior, crossbow men.The music and graphics are also very good and atmospheric, lots of very nice little details, overall I liked the game and would recommend it, I hope they expand on the ideas in the game.

												Grand Ages: Medieval. I was looking for something different to play and came across this n so far i can say its well worth it! Its mainly focused on the Trading/Economy side meaning that u dont have to just have a large army to defeat foes. In my own opinion this seems to be a mix of Civilization 5, Total War: Rome II & Banished n if you have all of them like me than i recommend giving this game ago! The military combat system seems to be basic but gets the job done althought hopefully gets updated in the future. On the otherhand the graphics are amazing either looking up close to your city or looking from above at the landscape.. you wont be disappointed with it.			"

												This game has some nice concepts and good basics, but in the end it is an unfinished game with some bad mechanics.If you have an army at a cave fighting some wildlife 2 units will fight while the other 10 watch.You get a really big map but you only get 20 trade goods, nothing regional at all.All you need for a perfect trade setup is 5 towns in a star pattern, once you've figured that out it's all a repetition of this.This would be an ok 20 euro game as it has no replay value, at 40+ euro it is a rip off and a typical Kalypso money grab. Given that this is a Kalypso game I doubt it will get any post release support outside of overpriced expansions.			"

												Short Story, don't buy. long story... well.The towns feel static. You don't really do anything with them. there are a few upgrades you unlock a few buildings you build but nothing makes it feel like an actual town. the idea of the map is cool.... but it needs to be way bigger if it's representing the entire known world at the time. Even if you crunch as many new settlements together as you can, all of denmark can hold like 3. Pretty sure denmark has more then 3 cities. In order to Win at this game, you have to orginize trade routes effectively. cool... but then you build armies. Are we suppose to... be a nation? or like... run a corporate trading empire? like nothing matches. There is no other forms of power other than the ""player"" and opposing AI. It just feels so awkward. If we play an entire nation... there should be a way higher empasis on Military power, but there is not. The whole world feels Dead outside of the player's interaction. The only thing happening is what the player is doing, and even than, as i said earlier, the towns still feel dead. Overall i think if they toned down the map... so it's not representing ALL of the known world that can only support like a hundred cities, but maybe just an Area. Hell, it does not even need to SAY where, i would probably enjoy it more if there was just a Random map that said map02 and was Not EU. Over all the game is not really BAD... it's just... not great... there is nothing that stands out to me. I love the hell out of games Like this but this one they just did such a minimum effort into creating it i can't recomend it, to anyone. I regret buying it, and i don't regret buying many games... hell i bought games i litterally have not even installed since i bought them some 2 years ago that i felt was a better purchase than this.

												This is a strange game. It includes aspects of diplomatic, military and economic control but, frankly, only the economic aspect works and that is strongly reminiscent of Patrician.The military aspect of the game is poor. You research techs and build units, which are very costly to maintain but you have little control over them other than pointing them in a direction and letting them get on with it. Mounted units move faster than non-mounted, and get into the action first. Some simple way of keeping the units together when moving would be nice.The diplomatic aspect of the game is not much better. You can negotiate agreements with mayors of cities or competitors. You need a Peace Agreement before you can ‘see’ into a city in the same way that you see your own. It doesn’t follow. To me, a way of setting up a trade mission would be more intuitive. You can take over cities militarily or by trading. Sieges are boring and quite why you should be able to take over a city because you supply it with goods eludes me.The trading side of the game is all Patrician. There are no real views to help you manage your empire; each city can produce only five products out of a total of twenty and some of the products require research and consume other products, so there is a supply side problem which is the most challenging aspect of the game. Once you get to the point where you have twenty or thirty cities to manage, plus the traders that are necessary to move the goods between cities, all your time is spent micro managing the production chain.Events happen; fires devastate areas and volcanos erupt at amazingly regular intervals. Wild animals are annoying.I bought this with high hopes but was disappointed. It’s nowhere near as good as the Civ games and frankly, Patrician works just as well as a trader game.Not recommended.

												Honestly, I have mixed feelings.I know how to play the game, how to turn a profit, use military units to my advantage to defeat barbarians, wild animals, and capture cities. But it's so repetetive.After a while it's just: What am I low on? build two of that buildingwhat am I low on? build two of that building build two of that buildingwhat am I low on? build two of that building build two of that buildingwhat am I low on? build two of that building over and over, only somtimes interupted by a small trade mission or skirmish, which by the way lets be honest, they put almost no effort what so ever into designing.you just go back to build two of that buildingwhat am I low on? build two of that buildingOver all I like the game, and it's concept, but it could have been designed much better, and could still be improved. I will continue playing it, but I mean really.... for $40 there should be a lot more content in the game, and not just a repetetive set up trade route and build buildings game. It could be so much more, so easily.			"

												Grand Ages: MedievalThis is a way cool game. Forget about the negative reviews. The developers have released a ptach that fixes many release day issues. Also, this is a not a total war game - the battles are fought on the strategic map between the units.Speaking of which, the Military is way cool. There are several unit types including Spearmen, Archers, Axeman, Swordsman, Cavalry, Mounted Archers and the cannon fodder unit Mercenaries. Also, each Region has a unique unit. Poland has Knights and Kiev has Crossbowmen as examples. All you need to be able to recruit the unique units are two things: Unlock the unit with Development Points and have the appropriate Barracks in that region.However, long before a Military can be raised a player must conquer the Economic System. Grand Ages: Medieval has a way cool economic system. Each town may have up to five production commodities. In order to increase the size of the city the production must be increased. This will cost money and lumber and bricks = lots of all three. As the city expands the population will require more different goods to be happy. Increasing a city past 1,000 population is good for income but the city will want more different goods.The citizens of a city will use the commodites stored there and this mean income. The larger the population the more commodities requried by the citizens. More variety of goods are also needed. Really large cities generate good amounts of money.Trade routes are also important. These can be set up to run automatically or by manual. Trade routes are the best at making money.Settlers can be recruited to expand the Kingdom. As cities are created and they grow more Territorial Claims will increase. This will eventually gain the player a new rank and along with it Development Points. Development Points are required to unlock more commodities, infrastructure improvements, and military units.Military units are very expensive, both in gold upkeep cost and comodities used. Grain is very important for the military and the cities. The early patch of the game lowered the military gold upkeep costs by about 50%, making it more possible to to have a military = once the Kingdom is large enough to support the troops.Grand Ages: Medieval is not a short game, however, gthe game speed may be increased as desired. It is a true strategy game at its finest. This is now a really fun game to play.			"

												Grand Ages: Medieval is a good base for an economy simulation with the nice addition that you can expand by building cities. But it is not good as a game because every single game mechanic is lacking depth and complexity.Later in the game, when you have the right technologies unlocked you even don't need to think anymore. You build 4 cities, so that these 4 cities do have any ressource available in the hole game (it doesn't even matter which region you play in). You build 30 ressourcebuildings of each type and you have a production/consume ratio of 1:1. That also discourages you from trading with anyone else. So this becomes more of a goods-transportation simulation in which you don't have much to do (except for automaticly trading with yourself and founding some cities from time to time). I got millions every month and have most of the things unlocked with just 8 cities, without ever expanding into another region. The AI: You can get them to pay you XX millions every 10 weeks or so simply by threatening to cancel the transit agreement. You can ignore them completely, if you get attacked you just spam out 5 units and don't need to bother with them for another year, and like i said: You don't need nor want to trade with them.The combat is also not good, even for it's simple mechanic. It just takes ages for every battle. I could live without a good combat, but at least it shouldn't be annoying.The game is lacking replayability. You can get everything by just staying in your starting region, which destroys the purpose of what should have been one of the game's strength: the large map. It doesn't even matter what starting region you choose, they're all the same, they just have different borders.The Trading is one of the most simple trading mechanics i've ever seen in a trading-sim; the battle is probably the most basic i've ever seen in any game; the city building is what i did expect, but also very simple; The diplomacy is also one of the most simple, and i'd say partly broken; The Replayability is not existent.  And that's pretty much everything this game has to offer right now.In it's current state i can't recommend this game, especially considering the absurd price.			"

												I am very disappointed. I have expected this game to have far more depth. What you get is an extremly  hollow shell ready to be filled with DLC. The devs could have put in so much more effort to fill this world and make it a deep and intersting one. The framework is there, but you can cover all there is to do in this game within an hour.  You build up your towns, which by the way is unimaginatively bland, and you set your traders to automatic trade. That's basically the game in a nutshell. Mind you, this is suppose to be a game based on trade and it's a big fail. The trade aspect is nothing compared to Patriacian or Port Royal. There are of course a few more other things you can do, like building an army and counquer your rivals but its not the core of this game and it's as well poorly executed and shallow. Also, you simply buy up every neutral town around you within minutes, because it is far more efective than using an army and the battle system is not enjoyable anyway. I really wanted to like  Grand Ages Medieval, as I have been following the game's development for a long time, but it's just another example of pushing out company greedy products who's whole existence is build on spamming DLC. I don't mind DLC, as long as you at least put effort into the base game and give the consumer a well rounded product, especially for the asking price. This is not some an indie game that's in early access for years. There were times dear developer and Kalypso, when Ascaron made top notch quality games filled with content at release. This game is nothing in comparison to those. Get back to your roots!			"

												Curator Review:Grand Ages Medieval is a fun twist on medieval age trade systems. Currency is definitely a big deal and it is up to you to create a massive trade empire. Expand your borders through war, diplomacy, or bribery and create an empire to span Europe! This game was a lot of fun to play and is a great concept. Unfortunately, Grand Ages Medieval ended up locking up my computer and being the only game as of today I have ever requested a refund for. It is most likely a compatability issue with recording software. Until it receives a patch removing the computer breaking bug it receives 4/10

												This is one of those games where i wish there was a ""meh"" button.  but if i am forced to look at the combination of price and game then i have to say no... this game is just not worth the 40 euros it costs right now. I estimate that in its current state it is worth about 20 euros. now for the more comprehensive list of points:I spend some time playing this game and there are things that i like and things that i dont like. The things i like:- The game map is really big and looks well developed. - The economy system has sufficient dept where you actually have to spend some time learning how the game works before you can setup a ""perfect"" economy- There are sufficient guides provided by the community that you can use to learn how to play the game. This is required because the the tutorials in the game do not really teach you how you should play- many of the core concepts of the game are good. Things i dont like- The AI is in my opinion overpowered to the point where i cannot beat it even at the lowest difficulty levels - personally i missed a ""free build"" mode in this game where i can just mess arround without any ais killing you.- the number of different reousrce buildings you can build is 20. This is enough to give the economy some dept but ithe production chain is a bit simple compared to other games such as the patrician series.- you cannot permanently kill beast lears/ bandit camps requiring you to micromange the military. - The militrary is relavily simple where the army with the biggest combat strength simply wins a battle. personally this is fine with me, but if you are going to buy this game then you would probably like to know this. Overall i would say that the game is pretty good, but not great, and not worth the 40 euros asked here on steam. Therefore i cannot recommend it.			"

												I really REALLY wanted to like this game.Unfortunately, there is just not enough to it.  Once you understand the economic system (which is fine and relatively simple once you have your head around it - it is HORRIBLY explained in game though) the game comes down to a repetitive cycle of ""look at list of industry production vs used"", ""select relevant city"", ""build relevant industry"", ""look at list of industry production""...Your economy will crash the first few times you play, until you work out how the system works on your own (the tutorial will actually make it harder to learn).It's so easy to get all the resources you need, without even thinking about it.  You can get a massive economy by trading within your own empire.  Anything outside of that is just with a handful of neutrals for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.  There is no need or even reason to bother trading with another player.  Why help them? It doesn't help you (well... nowhere near enough to be worthwhile).There needs to be more reason to continually expand.  More reason to build further away (you can easily have all your cities in a small cluster cuz pfft no downside).  More reason to interact with other players.  There is so much potential here, but it is wasted with half formed idea that feels like it is waiting for an expansion or DLC.   "

												I actually quite enjoy this game, although it took me a great deal of time to figure it out. Bascially, the management of the economy is the most important thing of this game, and making sure that you have balance with towns producing certain goods, but not an overproduction is the way to get ahead. I think the tutorial should go more into depth because I really had to flounder a bit before I figured out how to do the basics.Once you get your economy off the ground and have several cities, the game becomes a little on the tedious side. I would like to see more different types of commodities, and also more random events that haven't been implemented- both negative and positive. Also, marriage alliances would be really cool to have as well, it would be nice to take over a town in this manner. Why not? That's what the nobility did.I'd like to see more action within the town, and maybe some other visitors besides traders to the town. The game has a great framework but it needs to be built upon.			"

												Dreadful, boring almost like a board game in electronic form. after 3 hours there is absolutely nothing to do. i left the game and made dinner and came back nothing had happened, to have that in the first day of game is dissapointing. to all those that are expecting to build an empire you wont, you have no control of buildings, locations or upgrading buildings with the exception of a few, you plop down a city, build a road which literally takes 3 seconds and set up a trader and thats it-done. now wait for 10 minutes and repeat. I peronally have had it Kalypso, i have wasted so much monry on their hit or miss products and this is definately a miss			"

												I got 50 hours of mild entertainment from this game ( including AFK ). That's ok I suppose. I'll give it a thumbs-up. It was fun to learn, but once learned, not that fun to play. Checking in on the game today to see if they've improved the trade system ( the promising yet lackluster heart of the game, see other reviews ) I was amused to see that there is a thread in the community hub about the developers listening to all the player feedback, yet the big news was a mac port. I suppose that was what the player base was clamouring for.I don't begrudge the money spent, and I don't feel ripped off.nuf said ? "

												I was so looking forward to this game. The concept is fabulous, and I love the medieval period and resource management strategy games. The map is gorgeous and the systems are easy to learn. The tutorial is well designed with a good story - as long as you don't follow the instructions slavishly but build  2 more groups of cities as early as you can.Sadly, the game was so dull that I couldn't even be bothered to finish the tutorial  - probably for the 1st time in my life. Once you've leaarned how to set up a group of fast-growing cities trading together (hopefully with every resource between them) then that's all there is to it. Just rinse and repeat and build large all conquering armies withou any economic worries. Doing this without even the tutorial story would be unbearably dull and free of any challenge.Such a shame. What there is is good, but it's only half a game.  "

												I'll keep this short simple and sweet.It's a copy/paste of port royal 3 (WHICH I LOVE) with 0 added depth.  The ground combat/mechanics added into the game are so devoid of life it's hardly worth mentioning/exploring/PURCHASING this game.I'm a niche player, love these kinds of games.  This one is just 100% completely lacking depth, and anybody who says it has depth is a very simple person and there is nothing wrong with that.After you have 5 cities, your brain just goes on a never ending loop doing the exact... same... thing.  5 cities and you have unlocked 99% of what the game has to offer.It's simple...  That's how to describe this game and the reason I absolutely wish I never bought it.  I was hoping for more, but this game is like a baby step into the strategy genre.  Strategy is a broad spectrum mind you!  Graphic monsters like the Total War series is the Call of duty in the strategy world.    And Hearts of Iron is the meat and potatoes when it comes to the strategy world.  I'm not saying the game is easy mind you, just that it's TO SIMPLE!!!!!			"

												Like: Patrician, Anno 1503, Port RoyaleA nice economy game with a decent military system. It focuses moreon economy than military game so don't go in expecting a wargame. It has more to do with controlling the market through trade routes. You could play a military focused game but the combat isn't very deep and it still requires a strong economy to support a powerful army so it retains its economic focus even then.You can buy cities on the map however, so combat is not really needed. A strong economy can just buy its neighbors into the empire.Overal this game looks great and has a nice trading system. There are couple kinks to work out but it has a solid release.

												The game tries to be too many things and doesn't do well at any of them.The main component is of course trading, however there is a very limited selection of products to manufacture and sell. So after the initial creation of your product chain, you are simply repeating that pattern all over the world.Setting up trade routes is also boring and doesn't offer anywhere near enough depth. Limited options when choosing what and when to trade makes it far too repetitive.Far, far too much micromanagement.Game does offer a few hours of interest in the campaign, however once that is finished there is not much else to do. Hence might be worth it for sale around the $3 mark.However to be sold at the price it currently is, is absolutely ridiculous.			"

												For starters, I throw myself in there with the category of gamer who has tried this game that: 1) Understands that Grand Ages: Medieval is primarily an economical/historical trade simulator, not an epic military strategy game and 2) Is feeling that there is something missing or that it lacks a certain ""life"" and depth to it that keeps it enjoyable over the long run.I honestly wanted to see a historical trading simulator that lived up to or surpassed Patrician, the Guild, Anno (or Dawn of Discovery)...to name a few. I can play games such as the ones I mentioned for hours and still want more. This game doesn't seem to do it for me in that same way. So, for the time being, until the devs can add some things that bring this game to life, I can't recommend it. Keep in mind: I've only logged 18 hrs into the game at time of review and will come back and edit if I need to add or delete anything if the game is improved. But for now, I'll give a quick run down of good and bad, and include suggestions to fix the ""bad"", based on my current experience:GOOD- Beautiful graphics- Nice, ambient soundtrack- Challenging market supply and demand with trade routes you can manage and monitor for profitability- Challenging computer AIBAD- An extremely limited amount of goods. It won't take you long to acquire and produce them before you're having to fight against market saturation and trying to keep prices from plummeting, which will send you into bankruptcy. I'd like to see twice the number of goods in-game than what is already there. Also, I think consumption of goods needs tweaked. You're more often than not producing more than your cities are consuming. - Diplomacy, I've noticed, boils down to how much you're willing to bribe your neighbors to get them to join your growing empire. If you go to war, there is no cunning military strategy, only who can spam the most troops to outnumber the other guy so you can take over. Needless to say, the diplomacy aspect needs work. I would tweak the ""Sympathy"" that town leaders have for you to increase more with gifts and to decrease slower over time. I'm playing a free game right now and will bribe 20,000 gold to a neutral town and only see sympathy increase by 1-2% with their leader. So, you'll throw loads of money at a town you're hoping to add to your empire with little result. - The military aspect is badly flawed. Troops are very expensive to maintain and will send you into debt if you recruit too many, competitors and NPC threats will most always be stronger and have more troops than you, troop morale drops quickly and will see your men fleeing from battle, and battles drag out for far too long. I would decrease the troop maintenance cost, add a leader character to accompany troops into battle to keep their morale from flagging, tweak the AI on how quickly competitors/NPC units can field an army, and change the battle schematics to not take years or just be a war of, ""the winner is who has more troops than the other guy"". - Towns are basically just lifeless entities that have no real living, breathing quality to them that lets you feel like you're there. Only the names really differentiate them. So, towns are essentially production centers, a market to sell goods, and a spreadsheet you can pull up. It would be much more life-like if there were more ambient sounds when you're zooming in on your towns to check them out (dogs barking, town crier telling the news of the day, etc) more animations of villagers hustling and bustling in the streets, and the ability to micromanage and develop your individual towns where it actually will alter their appearances based on your decisions.  That's all I have for now. At the moment, the game is a very bare bones, but a challenging trade sim....it delivers on that. However, it lacks big on personality and depth that makes you want to explore the world and spend countless hours getting lost in the medieval life of your empire. Grade:  4.5/10  "

												This game is a very good city building game from the perspective of a small time trader who grows to eventually run and manage an entire empire. The military aspect of the game is not incredible but is still decent. The game plays quite similarly to other games by the developer such as Patrician V but managing land and port cities as opposed to just maritime trading. It is definitely a niche game but if you like city building type games with aspects of military, political, and scientific elements in addition to economic trading, it is a great game.			"

												If you can pay attention to details and micromanage your trade routes, product productions and keep everything in balance, this might be a game for you. It's was grand strategy tag that brought me to the game. After 17.3 hours, I completed the story with little over 14 Mil and 40 groups of troops. I am not sure why (as per the threads and complaints) everyone is having issues making money, getting enough sustained income to allow for a large army to pretty much crush every town in its path. So if you take the time to learn the game, it can be fun. If you want Total War like the reviews keep comparing this to, recommending looking elsewhere.			"

												Now that it has had a few updates, this game is a product worth buying. Like Crusader Kings 2, you can’t just jump into it and expect to automatically understand; the mechanics, particularly in relationship to supply and demand, took several attempts for me to understand. Unlike the Tropico series the goal is not to produce as many goods as you can, but just as many as your towns consume, then link them up with merchants. Supply and demand can be discovered under the “All towns” tab in any city and once you have a trading route the money starts flowing in. After you’ve established a strong economy, it’s a blast using your massive financial reserves to manhandle other players or A.I.s; buy them out of their towns, amass a massive army, whatever you want to do. However, you will get bored of it after you understand it and have played a few hours over the last few days. Without a modding community through the Steam workshop, every map is basically the same or a subset of the same map of Afro-Eurasia. There are also goods that are not included in the game’s original 20 goods that might make an interesting addition, such as marble, incense, and spices. I would give it a 9/10, but because of the lack of modding diversity I give it a 7/10.			"

												I would have to suggest this game, but I with a few stipulations.This is a very good game if you like Patricians IV.  It's more similar to Patricians than you first realize.  But after you start getting big you start to see there are differences between the two games, and in my oppinion enough to merit buying this game.One thing to note is that the business purchasing aspect of the game is much easier to work with, in that they have really good information on all your towns in one tab.  So if you can see how much coal all your cities are producing and just add a few more buildings for coal, then once they're built you have more coal.  And I think that's why people don't recommend it, because they have made accessing your data much easier.I DO miss doing quests, technically you can do quests for other towns, but they are very few and far between, and I felt like there was always quests to do in Pat IV, but it's very fun to create your own cities and build them up.All in all I really enjoy this game, and the trading aspect of things, if you're looking for a good trading/producing/town building simulator this one is great.One last note that should be mentioned, the developers in this game are AWESOME.  They have noticed the negative reviews and stated that they are working hard to implement what the community has requested for free.  They have worked hard to release this game, they are quick to respond to bug reports in the forums, and they release patches on a regular basis.  What more can you ask for in a good developer?			"

												A very oversimplified representation of medieval life in Europe and Northern Africa. You basicly establish trade routes in which you import and export resources which your cities and other cities produce and after you have maxed the production capacity of your cities you just keep spamming cities and establishing trade routes. Rather boring. Oh and you can also conquer stuff. The combat is rather pathetic though and costs a lot so you are most of the time better off just buying everything. But honestly, If you want to pain a map just buy some painting program or something. Atleast they aren't so darn repetitive.			"

I personally find the difficulty to be a nice change of pace from the ""Press 'A' and something awesome happens"" type of games. The game requires patience and a slow build up to supremacy. My biggest gripe is that the servers are a bit shoddy on multiplayer and matches have frozen out quite a few times. Definitely worth a shot if you enjoy economic simulators such as Port Royale or games like The Guild.			"

												I preordered with high hopes for Grand Ages Medieval, and I was disappointed to be quite honest.  Really shallow gameplay that consists of creating a new city, building a new trade route, and then leveling up to get new technologies.  The military aspect is boring as well, with just building units and sending them to battle, there is no Total War combat system or anything of the sort, and that is the most disappointing part in my opinion.  The economy is the only real turn on for this game, and even it isn't the greatest with just relaying goods back and forth.  The really last mentionable thing about this game is the diplomacy, which is just throwing money at people until they agree to an alliance or giving up a city to you.  This is just a setup for future DLC, and there is even an ""Additional Content"" button on the front screen to prove this theory, even though there isn't any DLC as of yet.  Stay away until DLC is available, as I have high hopes for it when DLC does arrive as it has a LOT of potential, but as of now, save your money.			"

												What a fantastic TRADING game! One of the best i've ever played.Now i've read quite a few reviews on steam because the game was rated at 44% at the time i bought it and i found a couple of things quite curious:1) Nobody said the game was a buggy mess. Nobody talked about any bugs.2) Everyone complained about believing it was supposed to be just like Total Wars games with detailed combat plus the trading aspect.3) People complained about not enough products, 20 is too low a number for them. And you can reach all those products with 4 towns.4) The ai is pretty good, even your own. But it should be better!5) There is already a choice on the main menu for future dlc...And the game is rated 44% for actually working and being a very great TRADING game? And you will notice the bad reviews come from all those early adopter that bought the game when it got out in september. Oh my gawd! Not another company that LIED to us and didn't give us what they said they would do! Oh no! Honestly, the bad reviews read like little babies that didn't get what they wanted so they smashed the game while crying to their moms! Now, on to a far more balanced review from a guy who didn't know this game existed before 2 days ago and didn't expect anything from the developer:- This is a T.R.A.D.I.N.G game. You build towns and must satisfy their needs so they can grow and produce more products that you can sell to other towns to make them grow. You earn money from selling to your own town and other towns. That's the basic concept of a trading game. It looks boring as hell, but oh god it is not! The balancing of production to fullfill the needs of everyone and not overproduce too much is QUITE challenging.- The map is biiiiig. Sure you could in theory build only 4 towns that only trade among themselves and do nothing else. But what about the other gazillions cities out there? Most of the time, they are too far for even a lot of traders to supply efficiently. So you need to build more towns, closer to them to fullfill what they miss. Cluster of cities is the key here and is easier to manage too.- Only 20 products to manage is not enough? Some of those products take 1 or 2 other products (That are also consumed by the cities) to be produced. It soon become a holy mess of dynamic supply and demand from hell and it is insanely fun.- I think the war aspect is pretty good for this game. The game is a grand strategy like Europa Universalis and you don't go into details like strategic combat (Like the Total Wars series). And honestly, you don't want to. Just managing your empire takes all of your time, you don't have time to waste on tiny or even not so tiny skirmishes. You have an empire to feed! And when war happens, it's a whole other ballgame! Now you need to supply the troops in the field, send more troops as needed and still keep your cities happy! It's like ratcheting the difficulty level. Oh and the ennemy can just attack those nice traders of yours running around and just ruin your economy! Hehehehe- So battle is like spear - sword - axe - archer - horse with a bit better units as your research them. Nothing fancy but from a grand strategy point of view, everything is there. And for those who believe you only need spears, i'll send you a couple of swordsmen to destroy your huge army of spears and we'll talk after that.- The game has no bugs at all. It still received a patch december 15, which is better than a looooot of games out there.- The game is very well balanced and polished. The gui is pretty well done. I haven't found a place yet where i told myself that the gui should have a button that does this or should have this automated. Nope, it's all there and thought for.- The automation of your traders is pretty good. You tell them which town to supply and they do all the trading for you. You only need to watch when they fill up their max capacity and improve it from time to time. That way, you can spend your time fiddling with your production of goods which is where the real challenge is. You have many ways of automating the trader and even can specify things directly if you choose (like buy X goods at Y price at town A and sell it at Z price at town B), but the more you mess with the trader ai, the more you shoot yourself in the foot long term.... Hehehehe- The learning curve can be pretty steep, but if you play the campaign, it's a huge tutorial and very well done (Plus, you get laid ;-). I believe it's also a bit easy because when you overproduce a good by quite a bit, the price of the good doesn't crash too much which would have terrible consequences on your budget! - The game is realtime with adjustable time speed from pause, to x0.1, x0.5, x1, x3 and x10 speed. Since it's my first game, i play mostly on x1 speed and pause when needed.- There is research. As you improve your level you can improve 3 things. It is a basic affair but with deep consequences. You want to put points everywhere, but need to schedule what you really need first. A couple of high end products are not availables until you research them (like making clothes. everybody wear rucksack before that! ;-)- The graphics are very nice for a game that don't really needs them, but hey can't say no to eye candy when everything else is great.- The potential for adding new interesting stuff into the game is fantastic. I don't know how much the devs are going to go there, but it's intriguing what stuff they could add to it. Just a couple more products with interesting effects would add new challenges. - There is a diplomacy of sorts to ally with other towns, even militarily and eventually take them over by money(prefered and easier) or by force. Each town is quite independent unless you face a uber empire.- One of the few game where i still haven't got to bed at 3 AM and still don't want to go and i'm not tired because far too engrossed in the running of my empire! xD "

												Does anyone else notice the final fantasy themed menu music? maybe its just me.Well im writing this review even though i havnt played much of the game because well i CANT10 to 15 min into the game it crashes and i have to reset my comp.anyway i have 10-15 min experiance so here it goes.graphics are nice and modern except youd think in games these days people wouldnt walk through doors..lazy animation? and i thought they said that youd see a bustlign city full of life....sure there are a few guards the few clipping animations of people but not much else.music is great on the menu screen!......what happened in the game?Diplomacy? DOUBLE YOUR OFFER AND WE CAN TALK.....(sigh) oh by the way you got 3 chances and anananana hands in my ears ( i caaannntttt hear you)....ughSO heres a rundown on what you do in the game. you start with a city and press on the city then press on the individual buildings for what they do. you have control over the trader scout and builders and can upgrade the cities using mony and development. however you have to set up trade routs roads and other towns to trade for money to make money which i guess could be time consuming but i wouldnt know BECAUSE I CAN ONLY PLAY FOR 10-15 MIN.THAT grip aside i kind of see this game as being short lived....if i could play.....anyway look at the video it tells you basicaly EVERYTHING you need to know about the game.PS NOT TOTAL WAR <- had to add that lol :) "

												Grand Ages: Medieval allows you to build cities to gather the resourses you find on the map, like the Civilization series. It then allows you to hire merchants and tell them to buy in one city and sell in another, like the Patrician series. Finally it allows you to recruit military regiments and tell them where to go and attack or defend in real time, which, as far as I know, is an innovation in this kind of game. These three elements plus a very light diplomatic element make up the entire game, which means the game is an experiment, an attempt to expand on previous sucessful formulas. As such, it fails, for I don't believe these elements can work together, not even in future installments, to create a new sucessful formula. This is probably because each of the elements was simplified, indeed, almost abstracted away, in order to make them all fit in the same game, to the point where the game involves very little startegy, be it in the city planning, trading or military aspects. To win you just have to expand more quickly than your opponents, which means you get more money and resources, which means you can feed more troops, which in turn assures you will win the automatic realtime battles.I think the game is fun enough to warrant one playthrough, howerver, so I'm recommending it.

												Extrtemly fun at the start of every new game, when you try to min/max your trade routes... But once you have expanded to around 30 cities and want to start the conqest, it's dull. Mass creat units and send them to enemy city, no strategy what so ever. There also no real incentive to conquer new cities, since one already has a stable economy and adding more cities to the different chains of your economy, just screws with it. And not getting a spesial unit or a general once you control majority of a area in a terretory is lacklust, as I said earlier the battles are just a mass spam of units. I wouls still recomend the game when it is extremly cheap.			"

												So, I bought it and the asked for refund. I know 2 hours is a very small time to judge - but according to Steam rules that' s time limit to get money back if the product disappointed you.And the product disappointed me. The game was presented like the final Medieval simulation (ambitious, etc..)- at the end it covers only one marginal aspect. I'll explain better. DIPLOMACYDiplomacy does not exist, I think also in Alfa Centaure there were more options. We are in the age of Crusader Kings II - really some kind of effort for this aspect could give some flavour.ECONOMY There is some resource management, and the economical model is nice (althought beoing not revolutionary - also less ""ambitous"" games like Cosmonautica have price / quantity variation). The system good - road - merchant - prices has become repetitive and there is a plenty of games that have already showed up being unsuccessful just focusing on this (look Offtrade Company).They simply become boring fast.WARAs the dev declared this is not a war simulation so the model is what is is.GENERAL ASPECTIt is just a personal opinion, but this game totally lacks personality. The name is Medieval but the same game could be ambiented on the moon or in every other age and nothing would change. It lacks the flavour of CK2 or The Guild, not mentioning Anno. At the end I find it overpriced for the containt.			"

												This is quite a difficult review to write... Is this a bad game? Not at all, and that's why at the end of the day I feel like recommending it - but certainly not at full price.+ Innovative gameplay: it is an interesting mix between a 4X (founding cities, expanding influence, conquering other cities, either through diplomacy or military conquest), a commercial sim (the greatest part of your entries comes from commercial routes, that you have to plan carefully) and a strategy game with some historical depth (I was amazed by the fact that when you found a new city, the AI suggests you a name that is geographically and historically accurate for the area and the period).+ Interesting campaign.+ Great level of detail.- The campaign is too short; after you finish it, you are left with a free scenario you can customise as you wish for endless games, which is perfectly fine, but the campaign feels a bit compressed and even wasted.- At certain points, really slow. You just have to wait and wait for you to have enough money to bribe your enemy, or for a city to like you enough through commerce for you to acquire it, or for you to reach a higher level so you can research that technology you need, etc...- Diplomacy is really shallow: you throw money at your opponents and buy their friendship and then their cities. You cannot exchange knowledge, or form effective pacts, you don't have common purposes or bias, just ""take all my money and be my friend""!- You only control the productive activities of you cities, and you can have only five of those in each city; then, you only have a very limited amount of ""services"" (castle, church, armory...) to build. As soon as you get enough money to build them all, all your cities look the same. Nothing to compare with the depth of managing a city in a Civilization, e.g.All of this said, I enjoyed the campaign, but I will not start a free scenario for a while!			"

												Hard to recommend this game. I had really high hopes for it as a deep empire-building strategy game... what it appears to be so far is a micromanagement sim. This game makes features out of mechanics that many other games would automate, such as selling surplus goods to neighboring towns and buying up commodities that you aren't producing yourself. Want to unload your excess food onto your starving neighbors for some extra cash? Then you need to buy all the excess from your townspeople, load them onto a merchant wagon, wait until said merchant arrives at the neighboring town, then sell them your excess goods. A lot of work for what many games have reduced to a single button click or slider adjustment. Sure, you can set up automatic trade routes for your merchants, but production is never consistent enough to be able to rely on these, and even if it was I'm not sure what you would do in the mean time considering just how much of the game the trading mechanic makes up. Then there's the questionable ""sympathy"" guage, seperate from the actual relations guage, that is somewhat ambiguous and never seems to rise when it should. No big deal right? Wrong, good luck growing your empire beyond 3 towns without people able to consistently raise neutral towns sympathy ratings beyond 80. For these reasons and a few others I just can't recommend this game to anyone other than hardcore economy sim enthusiests as much as I was really excited for this game.			"

It looked like the city building features were more in depth than total war, which is exactly what interested me the most.  It turned out that this game is completely focused on economics and trade, while all other features are an afterthought.  I just submitted my refund request to steam.			"

												In my own opinion, this is a very good game if you are looking to be a manager of things. I have been searching for a long time, and I found a good game. Pros:- Amazing trading system- Beautiful graphics- Fantastic city/village management- Smooth gameplay (What I mean by that is that there is little or no problems with running the game)- Few bugs foundCons:- Battle system is not unique in any way, to be honestSuggestions:- Make the battle system a little more like Total War fighting, and I will be the happiest motherflucker.- I hate to say this, but you should probably lower the price of this game to around 25-30$, you would probably get more people willing to buy this game. This game, I also hate to say, is not really worth 40$ SO FAR. If you add more stuff to it, though, then I won't complain.I am looking forward to the DLC. Unerde, the developer, if you are reading this review, I am happy with your game. I hope that you create other great games like this one. I don't care whether or not you want to consider what is being said in this review, I just wanted to write a review for this wonderful game.P.S. To anyone reading this review that is considering whether or not to buy the game, the people that created negative reviews are just picky. In my opinion, of course.			"

												Only for micro-management lovers. Automatic trade routes sucks (the ""manual setting"", which is actually a technological achievement, is good for nothing), interface is bad (you have to move your mouse just a bit to sell/buy 2 or 3 units more), and as other players have mentioned, diplomacy & warfare are close to non-existent (not to say some bugs when you're sieging 3 times the same robber cave). So, it's just a simgame about trading, but with only few products, quite lousy interface & very bad AI traders (they buy & sell at stupid prices, and again, the manual setting won't change much). Sometimes you win millions, sometimes you lose them, but you never really understand why (the trick is just to close down your factories and wait a bit, hoping you're not having some fight on).Like most sim games, it is still fascinating. Very good if you've got 3 weeks of rain coming.  But I'll stick to Total War & Paradox, waiting for Hearts of Iron IV (& Civ, if I'm in a nostalgic mood).			"

I say this because it when you start out towns will produce money for you, however they will eventually dip into the negatives by 1000+ and the lack of traders available makes it hard to get on top of it. But would i recommend this game? I'd have to say yes.

												This is an interesting game that's starting to really grow on me as I play it more and more.  One thing to realize is that you are not going to learn this title in a single play session.  There is a heavy emphasis on economics, trades, supply and demand as well as managing your overall production to influence your local markets and or crash your competitors markets.Given the era this game is set within, there is a limited combat system but for the most part it consists of ensuring you distribute your units equally so that no matter what units you face you can enjoy bonus damage versus what ever units you encounter and combat.  That being said there is very little control beyond this once your engaged in combat save the option to flee which will then cause you're selected units to run home screaming all the way.While this is a real time strategy game, in many respects it's plays much more like a turn based game.  Insofaras, each ""Week"" triggers changes in the economic landscape prompting the player to check each of their cities to ensure that any overstocks are bought up by traders to ensure the local market price is preserved for next weeks production cycle.  In addition to this each city is capable of producing only five out of twenty commonities meaning that active trading is essential to economic viability.  However you can only produce a single trader per city and it can take many weeks to travel along any of the longer trading routes a player might setup.  It is very easy to give into temptation and 'fastforward"" the game.  Which is a quick way to watch your economy crash.  Pay close attention to any city under your control that displays a red explamation mark.  It means trouble, and if your don't fix it quickly.  Well don't blame me for the results.Its fun, it's interesting, In two days I've already put in over 20 gameplay hours on this thing.  But it can also be frustrating, infuriating, and more difficult than it seems.  Overall a fairly realistic world domination sim as it might have been experienced in medieval europe, albeit with much more up to date information on locations that would normally yield up only months, or years old intel.

												This game is getting mixed reviews and i feel like i have to get off my lazy♥♥♥♥♥to review it to help counter it. this game is like total war, but flipped.  TW has emphasis on military with a backdrop of economy... this game is the opposite. Economy trade focus, and military runs in the background almost.to those who cant make money... you have to realize that every town consumes EVERY GOOD... and the larger the town the more consumption there is. towns can only produce 5 goods.  get better at trading. in fact... thats the whole design of this game, its awesome. Ive never had a bankruptcy problem in this game that wasnt my fault and i fixed it in due time. also the bigger the traders are (the more carts they have) the more upkeep they cost. dont send out traders with a billion carts if they arent using all that cargo space. have ONE... just one city with a warehouse with all goods.... all traders connect to that city. overproduce timber, bricks and metal wares (the are required for buildings not just consumption)now heres the kicker... all that economy is nice, works well etc.... but then you get into war. its fairly simplified and the total war series blows it out of the water on the TACTICAL scale. on STRATEGIC scale.... this game is actually better than TW. the AI will attack you and attack you to win... cities get sieged when the opponent is weak. total war series always left me frustrated with neutered enemies that would blockade a port and NOTHING ELSE. the tactical simplicity is actually a good thing IMO.... fewer options means more game focus on other things but most importantly the AI has fewer things to screw up.  all it has to do is allocate numbers to fight numbers, seige when not fighting. recruit and send reinforcements when possible. it does that brilliantly. gal civ series, civ 4, Total war series... all have failed to do what this games strategic AI can do. gal civ maybe could do it. starcraft 2 ai is also good. this game is amazing... ive been allied with an AI so i could see what they were doing... they were at war and all along their front they were fightingi havent played at the highest difficulty yet, but the only weakness is the AI has yet to declare war on me. i build up in peace while theyve been fighting each other for a long time.

In the game there are cool buildings you can build and unique resources you can raise for your towns. I do recommend this game, but wish there was more buildings and resources to pick from.

												So its a great game once you figure out the trade routes and get your economy up its like most games where you start off equal you must spread out fast and get a good trade network set up or your going to have a hard time winning.  Other than that i think there should be good events other than the bad natural events and plauge, and other maps and more commodities.But on the negetive side when you win there's no ending video or anything you don't know you won!!!! I contacted the maintenance people because i thought it was an error. ""They said its not an error once you win your saposto optmize your economy."" But i dont really see a point in that once you conqured everyone. Also the campain is more of a learning totural not really a good story or fights. it has more in common with the free play than a campain like invading countries. With a strong story			"

												I decided to get this game pre-release version since it  was high on my wish list. Now that I have it and played it several times, it turned out to be the disappointment I hoped it would not be.  First of all the economy system seems very unbalanced. The game concept is that you set up towns and grow your population by creating new businesses, hence the more business the more citizens in your kingdom. The problem is that more business leads to an excessive amount of goods produced which are not consumed by the population or cannot be consumed by all kingdoms combined [AI kingdoms included]. So you end up with too many goods and now where to sell them, run a budget deficit, can't recruit new unites or deploy your army unless your cash flow is positive again. On the other hand it makes  no sense to lower production of the goods that are being over produced because that will result in a smaller population , less tax and a faster way to financial ruin. The Devs need to act fast if they want to save this game. Fix the economic system, balance supply vs demand (if you have a bigger population then they should consume more goods) at the moment that is not happening in this game. Would I recommend this game in its current form? Absolutely Not!.....its a bad buy. But I do think this game has potential and I would like to see it improved.			"

												Another dumbed down PC game genre, this game could be amazing for tablet/ phone/ Facebook, but not for a PC game with that tag price, there are many many similar older games with deeper system/ simulation/ gameplay/ you name it. Patrician, the guild, Anno1404 all have better and deeper trade simulation and town management, some even have better combat system. Unfortunately, Grand Ages: Medieval is a bland trade game with beautiful map and graphics. I recommend you go for Anno 1404 it has both great trade system and city building management and also a better combat.  "

												Having read the reviews I was worried; I had waited a long time for a Medieval style 'building' game. Thank fully  I am not dissapointed. The games starts off gently and easies you into the complex  trading system via the campaign. The only negative I have is the 'Note: increase game speed by pressing space' notification stays UNTIL you press space; I really only play games now on a Sunday and I like to play at my own pace...

												It's a good game. At first it seems to be easy and repetitive, but when you get ambicious and try to expand or encounter a rival that is doing exactly that, the game gets very interesting. The way economy works here is quite real and you have to pay attention to the needs of your people in order to pregress. It's a different kind of strategy, focusing more on politics and economy than war issues. I really liked the game. I firmly believe that pre-purchasing was worth it.			"

												This game is right up my alley. Keeps me thinking and easy to get lost in....once you get the hang of it. It took me at least 4 starts to be able to get things off the ground somewhat efficiently. It takes time, a lot of time, to do things well in this game and keep pace witht the pc. That's how I want it, but it can be discouraging at times. It's got it's minor issues and things I want adjust but that goes for pretty much any strategy game out there. They said they haven't encrypted anything so it's possible to be modded and I do look forward to people tweaking a few settings, early game is rough once a military becomes necessary. Even so I've finally gotten a good game rolling and am loving the challenge of this game. Finally taken over a few towns, and more or less keeping pace with the PC factions who grow rapidly even on normal. Some may find combat a little underwhelming. It is pretty simple compared to the trading system. It basically always comes down to who has the better economy as battles can go on for years as you cycle troops in and out while trying not to go broke and expand at the same time. Honestly there's so much going on with the economy and expanding that you don't need to get dragged into the finer details of combat. I do wish there was more feedback for what is going on with the battles, That can actually be said for lots of things in the game. I'd really like more infomation on mouse over of many values because it can be really hard to figure out the breakdown of variables going into them. Is the game perfect, of course not, but I'm finding it really complex and entertaining, even if I did spend hours getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me.			"

												I like this game. Not sure I feel that the negative reviews are all entirely justified, though I get where some of them are coming from.It's a nice take on a medieval empire trading sim. I can get that if someone was looking for amazing combat mechanics, they might be disappointed - that's not what this game is.That said, personally I had investigated the game a little before I pre-ordered. It's as I expected - combat is pretty light in it. That's what I wanted out of the game, and I'm happy with it for that reason.Visuals are nice too - the world feels big, and it's pleasant to scroll through as you uncover it bit by bit.All in all, I'd recommend it if you like trading games where you develop your towns from a high level. If you're looking for a Total War style game with strategic battles, or an in-depth town-building sim, it won't be for you.			"

												Ok, this game has a bad rep.  It does somewhat deserve it.  It is a fun to play trading simulator set in the Middle Ages.  It is not at all like Grand Ages Rome.  This is not a city building game.  Kalypso has been releasing several rather poor trading games lately and then they want you to buy DLC or expansion packs.  That seem like that is the model they are working with here.  The Core game seems somewhat incomplete.  It has a lack of resources that should be fixed.  The whole kingdom game is almost nonexistant.  Yet with all of that I still enjoy the game. I hope they flesh it out more, (perferably by free patches to complete something of a full game, though it doubt it).  With that being stated I will recomend the game.			"

Posted: September 25, 2015
												First of all, as there seems to be some confusion about it. This is NOT a City Builder game like the other Grand Ages titles were. I heavily recommend watching a couple Gameplay Videos before buying the game. Dont buy this game expecting to get another Grand Ages: Rome.Onto the Review!About the game:GAM plays in a no-fantasy medieval Europe. The player starts out as a humble trader, and slowly works his way up to noble and later even Emperor. The basic Gameplay consists of managing your towns. You construct different businesses and a handful of different support buildings (Warehouses to store more wares, a Church to raise the maximum population etc.). Meanwhile you send out Traders, trying to make a profit trough the basic ""Buy low, sell high""-principle. Competitors or neutral mayors can be contacted via a basic diplomatic system, allowing for trade or transit agreements, alliances and of course, war. Towns can be conquered diplomatically, by making yourself popular in the city you'd like to have, and then integrating them into your own empire. On the other hand they can also simply be conquered. However, standing armies are costly and battles can take a considerable amount of time. So War may not be the go to solution every time. You also have the option to found towns yourself. Settlers can be recruited to found a town of your own, with different ressources being avaiable depending on where you settle down.The good:- The game is fairly easy to get into. You might go into the red on your first and second try, as it's easy to overspend on buildings and diplomacy. But it only took me about an hour to get into it. Menus and controls are straightforward and easy to understand.- The game looks very nice. You can opt to get a birds-eye view from above, which is very useful when planning trade-routes or just getting a good look at your ever expanding empire. Or you can zoom in all the way and watch your subjects go about their work.- The Campaign is well done, with good looking cutscenes and a fully voiced narration. It takes you trough every part of being a ruler, introduces new concepts one step at a time, and adds a nice background story to it.- There's a fair variety of military units, depending on which region you're in. It's based on a simple rock, paper, scissors principle, with every unit being strong against one type and weak to another. A decent army composition can win even when outnumbered. So simply spamming wont get you the crown.- The development system is simple, but satisfying. It's your choice if you'd rather focus on more production, better roads (so your traders get around faster) or developing better military. The amount of different wares increases over time, and so does unit variety. The game branches out the longer you play.The bad:- Managing larger empires can be a hazzle. There is no easy way to manage all your trade routes, beyond a simple menu that either shows each of your traders, or each individual trading route. A big overview of all your current routes and what is transported on them would've been nice.- Wild animals and bandits can be incredibly annoying. Bandit fortresses can spawn upwards 2000 people. With the relative cost of troops it's very possible that you have to deal with repeated raids over the course of a couple hours, until you have decent units and enough money to support them. Animals spawn randomly around the map and will scare off Traders, causing them to drop their wares. You can get them back easily, which is fine initially. But once your property spans across multiple regions it becomes incredibly annoying to hunt all those fu*kers down. Animals also seem a little too strong, with a couple Lynxes being able to wipe the floor with most basic units, making it necessary to hunt simple animals with half an army. It would've been cool if patrolling was a thing, or being able to set up guards for your traders.- The game can come off as a little to easy for veterans of the genre. Once you get the basic concepts down, it's very easy to sit at around 1 mil in cash. At a certain point deep into it, the game becomes a formality of just buying the same upgrades in every town and watching the numbers raise. If you want a challenge, you'll probably find it in multiplayer.- More of a personal gripe, but I was dissapointed to see that the towns show very little visual represantation of the stuff you build. It would have been great to watch some big, buzzling towns, crawling with people. But the Towns in GAM stay rather small and undimpressive. This is especially sad for big cities like Constantinopel, where I expected to see some eye candy. It reduces the fun I get from watching my Empire grow.- The game as a whole suffers a little from wasted potential. It's functional, and what it tries to do it get's done. But it's nothing overly special. Many areas could have been expanded upon, and it lacks the long-term replayability that games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings offer. Compared to some of the more meaty contestants in the genre, it's also much simpler and less deep.TL/DR:A great game for people who enjoy games like EU or CK, but want it a little simpler. It could have been a lot more, but also a lot less. If you're unsure about it, wait for a sale. I'd personally pitch the game at around 20 Dollars to get the most bang for your buck.			"

												I have read comments before purchasing the game. All I can say is that ppl are expecting too much too fast for the first release of this game. This is not Grand Ages: Medieval IV... it is the first one. All I have to say to those with such a negative outlook of the game is to think of all the wonderful games on their first release...they were not so amazing now were they? It took expansion packs, patch releases, etc. Give this one the same chance to work on it before writing such harsh judgements (the patch made to this game has already been released and fixed some of the issues/concerns identified in a very expedited manners, demonstrating how serious the developers are to make this game great). I decided to purchase the game disregarding the comments after looking at the various walkthrough and comments from SERIOUS players, not from those who just want everything handed out to them. This is a trading game and it should be about macro management, patience, strategies, etc. Please do not dumb the game too much. As for the army/warring aspect of the game, well, I want a trading game. If I want a war game, I would buy Age of Empires. There are some areas, of course, that do require improvement. Here are my observations so far:- The slide system for selling/buying goods is not very friendly, especially if you want to set a very odd/specific numbers.- True, the list of commodities is not really representative for the size of this map and would suggest adding more variety to the list. In medieval time, milk/eggs/bronze/silver/iron/beef, etc (you get my drift) were common commodities.This might generate various buildings such as Metalsmith, milkfarms, etc.- Notification system: I would love to see a similar alarm notification system for mayor missions and disasters as the one used for attacks or diplomacy discussion.So far, I am very pleased with the game and I am sure the developers are more than happy to improve it since they seems to enjoy playing it as well.I would give this game a 4 / 5 so far.

It's like a combination of Banished and Civ3 and once you mange to get your production to match consumption you'll be able to wage wars. Playing on the big map is fun but I think playing on smaller maps makes the game more interesting, it's more competitive and your opponents play a better role.			"

												I'm giving a thumbs up solely on the basis that I'm into this type of game... In the same way that the Total War series is more appealing to a mass audience than the Europa Universalis series, GAM appears to be a very niched game that isn't for everybody. I have played the game a little but watched plently of pre-release streams.A large portion of the criticism of GAM has been deserved:- Combat tactics are non-existent, battles basically come down to who has more numbers.- Diplomacy is overly simplistic, even if this is a trading simulator.- It appears to me that my income derives mainly from selling goods to my own citizens rather than actual trade with other cities. The trade with other cities appears to only be for the purposes of obtaining different goods that drive my prosperity up.- In the features listed on Steam the game world is described as ""gigantic"" and consisting of over ""20 million square kilometres"". While this might be the actual area of the terrain that the region of Europe covers in reality, GAM is by no means something on the level of an open-world game or even a massive scale game. While not entirely inaccurate, this contributes to the game representing that it is something, yet delivering something else.The issue here is that the game was overhyped with the gaming community having the impression that GAM would be this amazing offspring combining the best elements of games like Total War or Europa Universalis. GAM is certainly NOT what some of the reviews I read made it out to be before release.Having said all this, I don't believe it is fair to place all the blame on Kalypso. There were numerous pre-release streams available for us to check out and decide for ourselves what the game actually was. Yes, most of the negative reviews of the PC version I have read came after release, but it's not like Kalypso attempted to hide anything about the game pre-release.I do hope to see marked improvements in the diplomacy system. I also feel that the combat system should be removed entirely if there is no feasible way to include some degree of tactics or strategy (however, I'm thinking something like what Europa Univeralis has for battles might be work pretty well).My thumbs up also stems from my belief that there is great potential for the game and it eventually will turn into something great. It would appear that a lot of the imbalances and problematic mechanics can be fixed with patches in the future. We will have to wait and see if Kalypso does keep its promise to improve the game and release some of the smaller content updates as free DLC.In its current state I'd give this 6.5/10 (again highlighting that I enjoy this type of game and it's personal perference). If improved I believe it will turn out into something special.			"

												This game is a strange mix between the Total War series and Europa Universalis.The campaign is actually a tutorial in disguise, the meat of the game lies in freeplay mode, and multiplayer.The Good:- UI is fairly intuitive, and it's easy to find the information you're looking for- AI is challenging- Good spread of options for setting up a game to suit your tastes- Campaign is interesting and introduces many gameplay elements in a straightforward manner- Satisfying city management and tycoon style play.The Mediocre:- Graphics are fairly unimpressive. They're not bad, but nothing really sticks out. Character portrats and animations are terrible- Music is good, but overall audio design is fairly blandThe Bad:- Despite playing the tutorial, which introduces most things, the game really doesn't tell you how to effectively balance your  economy. There is a lot of trial and error.- Kalypso Launcher DRM is worlds better than, say, Uplay, but I don't know why companies bother these days.- There is no faction diversity for the most part. Expect to fight a lot of mirrors of your build and cities.Final Verdict: This game is fun, and with a few patches, can be a truly great game. It does a lot of things good, but many games do those things much better. Bottom line: If you want to play a citybuilder game with a heavy emphasis on trade and combat, play Anno 2070. It does everything this game does, but does it better. Still not a bad middle ages trading/management sim though. "

												The campaign is easy and rewarding except the over-reliance on money and trade. There is simply not enough military or city building, and far too much trader arrangements. Also most of the improvements in the towns are unnecessary and redundant and so are most of the troop kinds. It is basically just about money (perhaps real life was even in medival times, makes sense!). The normal business ideas are a little bit redundant here: For example a quick hint, if you are short of money (for example during taking over Odessa, or to keep armies in the field), take between 1-3 traders off the automatic route and give them 30-40 carts. Then take them to towns slowly fill them with the more expensive goodies (pomp, clothes, meet but also tools, beer, cake, wine and pottery). When they can't take any more (takes a long time), take the trader to Constantinople (or somewhere big) and sell everything at one. Yes, business-wise it sounds silly to buy expensive and sell cheap. But you get almost two million coins at once (think of it as saving under the mattress) which can be uses to buy town or keep armies. If you have more than one trader it can be a few million (useful for Odessa). So don't follow the sensible advice. I don't think this game really captures the essence of a country building game and it is far too much dependent on money. But having finished the campaign I must give it thumbs up although, I don't fancy carrying on with the open games which follows it.			"

												I bought the game awhile ago, played for 9 hours total then forgot about it. If your wanting grand strategy try somewhere else. Game is good for economical simulator about all. I bought it with high hopes. Not only that but since i bought it it still hasnt had any updates. Added events or features... Hey Kalypso mabee Paradox Interactive would let you shadow and see how real grand strategy games are made.			"

												I am just getting into the game, but it looks like a real winner. Nice trading/economic sim in the tradition of Patrician. Everything clearly laid out, I love it when I can quantify how much upgrades affect output. Then you can make decisions which mean something. Military does seem basic, biggest stack wins, but that never kept me from playing Crusader Kings 2 forever. I think this game got too many negative reviews by players who dont enjoy trading sims.

												I haven’t played the other Grand Ages game (though I’m a fan of Kalypso’s Tropico series), but if it’s anything like this one, I will be purchasing it when I’m done with Grand Ages Medieval.The trading/economic simulation makes up a large part of gameplay. For a micro-manager like me, controlling my individual traders, making sure my towns are properly stocked, finding the right build mix for towns, and optimizing trade routes is highly addictive. Combat takes a back seat to the economic portion of the game, but it was still satisfying.It takes a considerable amount of time to conquer a large map: I’ve played almost 75 hours, and I still haven’t started the campaign portion of the game.

												Hype buy. I just hate it.The economic model is broken, the military is fun but dont work because you will never have money to sustain it. You can have auto-traders, but to make money you will have to micro manage... and that gets really boring because all cities around you will already have the resources you are selling.Selling to your own cities or getting to the other side of the map is the same thing. You will get the same money going to the city close to your capital or going in 15 minutes voyage to Russia (from Spain)The AI bots just sucks: they will get more resources, money and tecnology, and will diplo anex everything around you.Can't choose religions. You will get mosques or churches because... i dont know. You just can't choose and that, for me, sucks. So, finally, dont buy it. Wait for new patches or buy it when it gets in Steam promotion weekend (10 dollars tops).			"

												I've been enjoying this game.  If you are a dedicated strategy gamer and like trade, ecoomy and strategy you should give it a look.  The highpoints are placing cities, planning your expansion, and building up a strong trade network.  Using trade and diplomacy to take over cities is a fresh twist.  The early game is fun and the AI is good.  The current weakness is the end game- it turns into a grind.  You can have an overwhelming advantage and it still takes a long time to gain control of all the regions.  One idea- give the player a slider and make it customizable how many regions you need to control.  Combat is limited, but for me it's good enough to compliment the other elements of the game.  The new option to auto-retreat when troops drop below 20% strength makes sieges tolerable.			"

												Wont say this is the best Medieval stradegy game, but for micromanagement it has to take the cake. It lacks luster in the combat deparetment only because the game itself is mainly focused around trade. Is still a fun game to play, i give it a 9 outta 10.

												Premise of this game was good, sadly the execution fails.I hope that core game features has not been stripped to be sold in DLC's.Visually this is ok for the game of it's genre, campaign and story has nice feeling along it, at least to bypass the 2 hour mark for return.Soon after that you start noticing the obvious lackings which has been mentioned in other reviews.- Lack of resources: Total of 20, can be managed with 4 towns.- Combat: was not on my waiting list, but if you must implement it, please do it correctly. Rock/Paper/Scissors, but without obvious logic or effect on result. Especially if both sides of battles have all of those in mix. - Military expences: Rule of thumb 1 unit / 1000 people, sounds good, just don't end up in war.- AI: Situation X: make an bad offer, I won't accept your presence for x rounds. No actual negotiation.- Lots of other issues, covered by other reviews.Game requires patch or two to qualify even as a ""great early access game"", in current state it is no way worth of full price.

												This Game is nothing like Total War.... So just stopThe Bad : There is a limited amount of resources and for a game that the main focus is about the economy and trading I would have imagined there would  have been speciallty products from different regions like silk from the east or spices ivory all the things that make the world so exotic and fun are not in this game. The Trading and the combat are mobile device quality without all the flashy things to click on.               The military untis are meh. The combat is just send your troops blindly into combat until the enemy gets tired of hacking them down the key is to keep sending MOAR troops to blindly die. At first I would watch the fight and retreat soldiers that were dieing and send fresh troops in but that got boring so I just sent waves of soldiers at anything that wanted to fight. (It helped out that I had over 140 000 000) Also the barbarian hordes constantly are a problem when you expand to 20+ cities. I came up with a strategy: after destroying there village I would errect a defense tower on top of there dead corpses to remind them that there maw beaches.  Its an easy game once you understand how to manipulate the Trade routes properly. Start a route with 4 close cities (as many as you want really as long as there not producing the same materials... unless the demand is so high you need multiple cities producing the same product) let the trader run the route a few times then click on the trader on the bottom left there is a barrel ""Change Route Analysis"". Once the trader has ran the route a few times he will have a good representation of the supply and demand on the route then add production slowly untill you get a feel for it add lots of carts to your traders (carts are built at the inn and have to be individually added to your trader) I was going to give this a Yes for recomendation then I wrote this review and even though I did enjoy the game it doesnt sound like I enjoyed it and the more I think about it I can not recomend this game unless it was cheap.

												This game starts out rather fun. The initial storyline is interesting but way too easy, The world is too small and there are too few resources. 5 per town and 20 total. You can make as many of those buildings in a town as you could want and in theory control those goods for the entire map. The world is just too small for a game of this scale. I defeated an empire out of Russia and controlled half the map just from capturing his capitol. You can control an area on the map with 5 towns. The economy makes no sense. I add up on my own all my income vs expensives and should be well into the green, instead I am losing money, much more than should be possible. The military units are very expensive for the small bonuses they provide and are just used for zerg rushing. You can have an entire army and only a few units will attack (I had 138 units but maybe 25% were actually fighting). The morale portion of combat is interesting but can be crippling. I had units that suddenly retreated and were stuck in a town because they had no replacements. Unfortunately that town was bugged (Vlore) and I ended up having to just dismantle those units. While this was happening, a rival empire decided to attack me. All my units were stuck in a town and I had no way of replacing them in time to save my city. The year is 1050 and there are no religious wars, really? This is a time of crusades and violent political wars.This game has a lot of potential and I hope the devs improve, but it is just too simple and easy to beat at the moment. Increase the map size, add more building types, add more resource types. Add more stories, During the middle ages there could be a mission for a crusade, or to defend against crusaders. Add more political and religious factions.If you played Grand Ages Rome, this product went in a completely different direction.			"

												TL;DR: This is a bland, dumbed down version of Patrician, with very little to manage for the player. The problem with the game is that most things happen on their own; you can't micromanage trade routes, you either do them manually or tell the trader to decide on his own. You can't plan your cities -all you have to do is build them and build certain businesses; people will appear out of nowhere to work in them. There is no micromanaging trade routes, no setting up production chains, no planning what to make next. The buildings and people to work in them appear almost instantly, so there is no planning what to do when, no strategic thinking, no difficulty and no sense of achievement out of builkding your towns.  While playing this game I was waiting and waiting and waiting for something to do, some aspect where I can plan and manage and have an impact; seems to me there is none. Don't buy it. If you want a good strategic game like this, go play Patrician or Port Royale. If you think you like GA:Medieval, go on youtube and watch someone play it. You'll have more or less the same impact on the game, and you'll save some money.			"

												I've always liked how kalypso creates games that dont focus on combat as much. my thoughts on the game campaign- 4/5 fairly helpful, trying to figure this game out without it would be a nightmare. didnt cover some things i wish it had.sound and art 5/5 pritty much what you expect. interface 3/5 often had to repeatedly click throught several menus to find the info i wanted. interface could be modified a bit to porvide more useful info. at the beginning trying to generate\trade and manage 20-ish resources for each town is difficult. but i can also see how people who play alot of other trading games find it rather lacking.overall, im happy i got it. i would also wait for a sale, as its hard to justify its current price for what it provides.for a settlement and resource management game, its good, but not great. if this game is about managing resources, production and trade from differnt cities, its main flaw is its rather basic trading interface. however i do have great hopes for this game in the future.

												This game is very stable.  That unfortunately seems to be the best part about it.  If you are expecting any military strategy in this game at all, stop considering it.  There is no military strategy at all.  This game is bare bones, with a set up for DLC to make the game actually worth playing once another 30, 40, 50 dollars.  Combat is a few models standing next to each other and doing nothing.  Expading your empire is little more than the process of training a settler, picking the spot, and then adding the new town to a trade route.  Not much more to the game.  Going bankrupt is a game killer and it happens almost every game that is started (not just for me, people have been complaining about that in the reviews and in the discussion).  If you really want this game, try it.  If you really aren't sure, but want to give it a chance, try it.  Just be aware of how long you play it so you don't go over the two hours of playtime steam grants you before you can ask for a refund. :))))			"

												Great Game, it has a slight learning curve when playing the game though such as with the economy. Most players on their first run will most likely bankrupt themselves. My tip to them is to not bother with buying the a.i. cities until you have a stable cashflow from a few other cities you prop up. its slightly lacking in military with the simplify system, but hopefully that'll be improved on with future expansions/dlc. In all, i'd have to give this a 8.2/10			"

												This game was pretty cool at first.  An interesting concept of having to manage the economics of your empire.  However, the bigger and stronger you get, the slower and harder it is to expand.  You can have a huge army but they have to sit and wait until you build up a new town otherwise you will not be able to supply them and their low morale will make them retreat.  Like I said, if you don't mind starting a new game every few hours because of sheer boredom/frustration, this is a good pick up.			"

												I don't write alot of reviews but I will for this one as I had pre-ordered this game and spent a good bit of money on it. I won't go as far as saying its a terrible game but for the cost of it, it really does lack. -The music is bland and uninspiring. Might as well turn it off and put your own music on.-The combat is as others have said uncontrollable. I had sent out a mercenary unit to fight bandits and it literally took weeks of ingame time to have them fight, and they still lost, to BANDITS. Heaven help if you fight against another city state's military.- The economics seem broken as i'll have something like 70k of gold but keep loosing money and thats without the red ! telling me that i'm running deficits. I have the max number of traders with lots of carts going to every city that most of the other cities are at least doing well and dont have any buildings except an inn and at least 1 production building for each of the 5 production slots. Like another reviewer mentioned your finances always seem to be on the brink but when you build a military unit (which you'll need to do to fight bandits robbing your caravans) it seems to put you over into the red.-Graphics are ok. They are not crazy awesome. I expected to zoom in to the villages and really see great detail but its just kinda blah.-True the game doesnt crash, but for a game that offers rather bland content and a game that costs as much as this one did, I would expect it wouldnt.My personal lesson learned: no more pre-orders of games without actually playing a demo or an early release of the game. Certainly not for a game that had cost as much as this one. I'd think if the game cost $10-$15 maybe $20 it wouldnt be so bad, but the $33 i paid for it as a pre-order and their regular asking price of $40 well thats just too much.I do not recommend this game. If you like this sort of strategy game, buy one of the Total war series or Civilization. I dont think this game will improve as they've made their money and the developers are probably onto the next dev project imho.			"

												Hey this is my first review, i'll try to be as helpful as possible, in order to do that i will split the review in 2 small sections.1. To peole who want to know what this is about Most of the bad reviews on the game right now are because people didn't search properly and were expecting a city building and/or total war type game. This is not that, if you are looking for that then dont buy this game and get dissapointed. This is a trading simulation game mostly simillar to Patrician 4 (and other games like port royal series and rise of venice). The goal of the game is to become succesful in producing, distributing goods in cities  so they prosper and make a profit out of it. Most other aspects of the game like the campaign story, war, raids etc are just small additions. So if you want to play a war game or city building this is nto for you. If you want to try out economy sim games then this is the newest addition in the genre.key points: Short campaign that is purpose is to teach you game mechanics. Trading sim as its core, war/raid armies as a flavour.2. Pros and cons  (this part i write for veterans of previous titles, to hopefully make the review helpful for them too)Pros:- huge map , i mean really huge map comparing to everything these games have offered so far. Map is also nicely partitioned in regions that offer you a title etc. Also option to only isolate the game on any part of the map you wish (if you dont like huge map)-addition of technologies-improved graphics, decent soundtrackCons:- You don't view the city in detail to build it (like in patrician 4), that is no problem with me to be honest, especially since there are so many cities you could build-The trading part seems a bit simplified. For one the option to keep products in the warehouse is gone. And the whole gameplay mechanics of figuring out efficient ways to organise trade (keep warehouses locking products, only selling on max prices etc) is gone too. So the automatic system the AI uses seems like the best choice...maybe with a few interventions of a manual trader.Generally i'd recommend this game if you want to play economy sim, you will most probably enjoy it "

												I dont understand the hate.  People seem to be upset it isnt like total war... idk why they thought it was gonna be the same i sure as a hell didnt.  The economy is challenging, but if its going south you have ample time to fix it as it isnt immediate debt its ""okay i lost 2k this week im going to lose 3k next week, whats wrong and how do i fix it.""  People are saying the economy has no depth, the fact that its supply and demand makes it have depth.  You produce goods to meet the demands when you start to be producing excess you have options.  1. expand and find new markets or 2. drop the production and create a demand for it.  Military is meh, but it isnt suppose to be in the spotlight. (atleast not yet i have a feeling because of all the hate they're change the war aspect)  The one thing i think that NEEDS to be changed is the upkeep on the troops.  Its almost more profitable to let the bandits just pillage your trader than it is to pay for the men to keep them safe.  or maybe i just suck at making money and think 1k a week is a lot while others may think its chump change.

												Many of the complaints about this game stems from the lack of complexity in the game, which is true; the game is incredibly simplistic. It's a very casual game, but a good one at that. Keep this in mind when/if you buy, because the wrong expectations can break a game like this. For me though, it's right up my ally. If I want strategic combat, I'll play the TW series. If I want more in debth trading, I'll play one of the many space sims out there. If I want a relaxing empire builder with toned down elements of all that is related to 4X games, in medieval times no less, I'll play Grand Ages: Medieval.			"

												GA: Medieval.Overal Rating: 3.5/5I'll say my first impressions have led me to see the game differently than most people have so far. I find the learning curve to be pretty steep as the tutorial only serves to help users understand the bare basics of the game. I'd recommend most new players play the campaign before setting out on multiplayer or an open game. I chose to play an open game simply because I learn better through trial and error and multiplayer rather than campaigns.Comparable Games: Victoria II, Civ 5Graphics:4/5No doubt the game isn't absolutely stunning in terms of graphical appearance, but it is ultimately very smooth in all graphical aspects. There have been some reported issues with Nvidia gpus and I am running a R9 390X and have not experienced a single issue running the game on any setting.Combat: 3/5Combat here could be positive or negative depending on what you're looking for. I find the combat to be exactly as it is in Civ 5. Each unit earns exp, can become stronger as it ""levels up"" and winning or losing fights depends on a unit's combat strength. Luckily there is a retreat feature for units in combat, so your units won't simply die right away like they do in Civ 5 if you're presented with a poor matchup. As of now, combat isn't great, but it certainly isn't terrible.Audio: ?/5I honestly haven't really been paying attention to the sound all too much as of yet. I've been entirely focused on learning all aspects of advancing my settlement. I'll update this later on.Content: 3/5So as expected of the growing trend from gaming companies in the last few years, most games are presented in a bare bone fashion with the potential grow based on sales of the product. Since this is the vanilla version of the game, there isn't a vast amount of content readily available. I imagine with expansions the game will get much better than it currently is. The main issue I'm having so far is with trading and economics. Combat is simple, but growing your settlements isn't simple whatsoever. Your settlement is given the option to produce 5 products in each town that you create. You upgrade them just like you do in Vic 2, you aquire the needed resources, wait a period of time, and businesses will begin to attract workers to your town. Based on the overall supply and demand of the products within your towns, the prices of goods will vary. My first few runs through I tried some rapid expansion and found that ultimately, I was trying to accomplish too much too quickly. I've tried both quick expansions wide and tall and found them to put myself in terrible situations later in the game. Understanding economics and the limitations of your settlements is key to success. It really is. Also, having scouts roaming around is very helpful. ""Ancient ruins"" as similar to those of Civ 5, spawn on the map randomly, granting resources and money.Gameplay: 4.5/5No doubt, I've been playing Civ 5 a lot and found the game to be quite simple once you understand the basics of your preferred strategy. Victoria II is a much more difficult game for me as the economics aspect is much more real. I give GAM a 4.5/5 in gameplay because of how smooth the game actually is. The game is live RTS just like Victoria II, you can speed up or slow down the game according to your own pace. There's no lag when experiencing a lot of interaction on the map. GAM is ultimately an unforgiving Grand Strategy game basically taunting all strategy lovers with the most basic question as you grow your settlement with the intent to conquer Europe: are you good enough to win?The challenge is good enough to keep me interested until I can conquer Europe on an open game mode. Also looking at this very idea from a time value of money perspective. The game is roughly $40 USD. In order to make the game worth the cost of buying it at minimum wage of $7.50 USD, a player would have to play GAM for roughly 5 and a half hours. That said, the game has proven to be worth my money even without the vast amount of readily available DLC which will most likely come later on. All hail Brittania!			"

												After playing this for a few hours, i finally understand enough to post. It's a shame soo many people purchased this thinking it was Total War or some other game...To describe this game... It's a mix of some of the following games:Venice/Patrician III/Patrician IV [series] (trade)Hegemony series (Supply lines)Knights Of Honor (with updated graphics, but slightly dumbed down/simplistic combat)Paradox Games styled combatThis game is not:COD (Call of Duky, which I will admit I like... but this is not it)Total War (been a fan since the original Shogun... The combat is closer to games like Super Power 2)Paradox Strategy games (love them and own most of them, but the economy is not ""all connected"")I give it a 8.5/10.The Good... I like the Patrician III/IV economy, which is almost 100% in your control (other's merchants can buy your stuff [i think]). The combat... well, lets be honest, is a lot like risk... but with a heavy weight given to class (much like paradox games, some troops do better vs a specific type).The bad... Well, most people don't like to wait to build their economy (looking at you COD players) before they can build a massive one-sided zerg (like Darkfall). Lastly, the devs need to make a little video on how to develop your economy (for those of you/like me who don't like reading to figure out how to play the game a purchased 1+ weeks back).Once you play it a few hours (which you will need... as well as restarting a few times) you can build a proper network on cities and traders to balance your resources... Then enjoy your ""army funding city networks"".People need to play the game more before they decide to kill it with reviews...Just my 2¢			"

												I spent a good deal of time reading reviews on this game and learning what both sides had to say about good and bad. It is my belief that those people who wrote a bad review, went into the game expecting a full on strategy war game. Let me say this, the game is a simulation game with many bonuses. If you play this game expecting a simulation game you will be very pleased with the extras that the developers have thrown in. I am enjoying the time with this game and spend afk time considering what my next move will be.Let me offer a little advice to get you started, upgrade your products as quickly as possible so you have the full variety of merchandise to distribute to your cities. Keep your trade routes small to mid range and make sure that the route has most products available to purchase. If you go for a high end product in a city, pomp for example, make sure the same city is producing the other items needed to produce that item. When considering placement of a new city, think about what is available on the map around it. Is there access to fish, fur, metal or coal. Can you use these items for a more expensive product and will it fit into the current trade routes you have in the area?Take time to play the campaign. It will teach you some of the basics but there is still a lot for you to learn on your own and that is one of the joys of playing a new game. Try different things and if it doesn't work, well then you learn and add to the replayability of the game.I definately recommend this game. Have fun building your economy and buying out your competitors. Oh, and if that doesn't work, build an army and seige thier cities until they submit.			"

												This game is not a clone of any game I have played, but combines elements I loved in so many others I have played into it!It provides a lot of fun!  Game encompasses war, diplomacy, and trade. Trade is very easy to manage, but hard to master.  It involves picking great settlement placement, and trade routes to get raw goods to places to make them into finished goods.  Such as coal + metal = tools.I have played and still play many in the genre:CIV, TOTAL WAR, and 4X games, Europa 4, and so on.			"

It's impossible to even stay afloat and deal with bandits, let alone the AI once they get involved and threaten you with war if you dont give them everything. And the worst part is that the devs seem to be proud of how difficult the game is. It's literally ♥♥♥♥ing impossible you morons.			"

												LOVE the game.  However, I wish there were a few alterations made.  There should be more trading goods that are relevant  to the region...similar to the military units in the game.  For example, beer makes no sense in the Middle East.  I also would like to see religion play a bigger role in the diplomatic aspect of the game.  These changes would broaden the scope and dissolve the repetitiveness that eventually manifests itself.  Perhaps people much smarter than I will take these suggestions and run with them:)  This being said, this is a great game.  The look, feel and pace are EXACTLY my style.			"

												Okay, so basicly this game is about making a trading empire. You settle cities for resources, build buildings for production, and so on. The combat side to the game is rather simplistic and expensive, the combat system could use a bit of work.Region specific resources would be a nice addition too, but it's not urgent. Alot of people complain about, how depthless the game is, or how it's too difficult and you always end up with massive debt. Not true. The game has alot of depth with the porsperity system and trading system. Trying to supply a town with all it's required resources, and distribute the produced resources is a challenge in it's self.The game has a steep enough learning curve, however, after I played my first game and went on to my second one, I had the trading system down. I quickly gained a large cash flow and expanded like wildfire. Then I built a huge army and wrecked the AI. This game is for people who like Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings and such. It's a niche game which admittly could use a couple of additions, and a combat revamp but, I still really enjoyed playing it.			"

A more laid back strategy game than a lot on the market, If youre looking for a total war clone this is not it. However this different style of play makes for a really interesting game. Commerce and diplomacy are key here and both are pulled off extremely well. Graphics are beautiful to look at and the sound quality is also fantastic. It's worth the full price but if you can get it in a deal or sale then it is a must have for all strategy fans. Put it on your wishlist or buy it now ( then add me up for some multiplayer )9/10			"

Tell the story of other leaders like they did with the beginnings of Sophia.Once my economy hit the 999.999,999 cap my traders were making 0 profit.

												OK, so... as you can see by the hours played, I've given this game a fair play through and this review is based on my initial impressions. I started with the campaign which acts as a tutorial of sorts as well as I'm not one to just jump into a game and then blame the game for not being enjoyable simply because I didn't take the time to get a handle on the basics.So,  I'm giving this a 6/10 soley due to the fact that despite it's shortcomings, Grand Ages Medieval managed to keep me engrossed. There are echoes of other RTS and trading style games here, like the early Anno games for example, but you get no say in layout of your cities - the AI does a lot of things for you in that regard. I can appreciate that on the scale of the map, you may well want some help managing things, but at times this isn't always executed well.I do see potential here if the developer continues to enhance the game. Frankly, I feel like I'm playing an open beta that lacks the finer details and polish that a finished game should have. While I've encountered no game breaking bugs, there is just a fundamental lack of depth to unit rosters, diplomacy and warfare. The one thing that I cannot forgive at this stage is the LACK OF SIEGE ENGINE units in a game set during the Middle Ages that requires so much sieging to be done. Seriously, what were the devs thinking??? To sum up, based on my observations and experience during game play thus far:Pros:- Big map, nicely rendered IMO- Stable with no bugs that I've found to dateCons:- Can get a bit repetitive - the addtion of random in-game events might help this - the only missions from towns are ""get me some of this and I'll like you more"" - needs more variety.- Battle mechanics are annoying and overwhelming force doesn't always mean quick victory.- Sieges favour defenders given there's no siege equipment in the game and sieging forces are easily distracted by small enemy untits. There is also a limit to how many units can siege.-  Ruins / Caves - keep away from them and don't build roads near them. Impossible to clear out permantly and when attacked spawn large numbers of wild animals instantly.  Meh:- Unit veterancy is gained in battle, lost with replacement of casualties but would be nice for immersion's sake if your units could gain some permanent perks for length of service, battles fought.- The late game empires that  seem to form are difficult to overcome given the way battle and siege mechanics work. Micromanagement becomes a chore at a certain point.- Unit cap based on your ruler's rank - not size of your empire. Sigh.			"

												Well its not quite what i expected, Considering the screen shots it looked like it was going to be like Grand Ages Rome, and I suppose if you consider the map to be all of Europe then it is an evoltion of the previous title. The problem with some of the reviews is that when you see a strategy type game published by Kalypso you have to know that a fair part will be trade economics, The biggest issue I have so far is that it seems quite difficult to grow considering the bandits and animals that keep poping up which is fine it gives you cause to fight without a war. The issue is that you need to constantly be patroling for them because if the bandits start stealing all your merchants goods you can go from a groing cash pile to one in the red real quick. And if the bandit camp was allowed to grow in neutral or competitor territory it can be very difficult to eliminateNow I have not progressed enough to know everything about the game, so disregard my compaints if they happen to already be there and I just dont know it.1st- The game needs a recomended help/tip on resource buildings in a town to help guide people as they grow their empire2nd- The game needs an automated patrol action for military units3rd- Military units through discovery or size of empire either need to cost less in upkeep or they need to scale up as you go, an example of something good would be that you get 1 unit at reduced upkeep per city, or when in range of a city4th- This might be there already. but seige weapons need to be put in to reduce siege times, So The Pros= Graphics(Really are good enough), Program Stability (No Problems so far) Cons=Military upkeep difficuty, The trade and econmic system being slightly cumbersom at the beggining and potentianaly tedius as you grow. And the fact that the screenshots advertised make it look like battles are more of an RTS style than a Civ/Risk style. Would I Recomend this game. Yes, if you like this type of game, you will most definetly enjoy it, if your not sure its your thing then watch some videos, and put it on your wishlish and wait till its at a cost that to you, it dosnt matter if you like it or not.

												When I first saw this game I thought it was a long awaited sequel to Grand Ages: Rome.  Turns out it is just another Patrician game.  I like Patrician games so I gave it a pretty good try.  After having played the campaign and then conquering the entire known world in free play I can say without a doubt that this is the worst of the Patrician clones.  It's such a regressive step back from the old games it's not even fit.There is no manual battle mode.  In previous games you manual battled with ships.  In this game you have land troops.  Having a manual battle like Total War or Nobunga's Ambition just makes so much sense.  But it doesn't have it.  Instead you just rally your armies to a battle location until eventually you win or lose that location.The trade is way less complicated but more tedious than previously.  The manual trade is unlocked later on and the automatic trade is simply better.  There's never a real point in using manual trade as automatic routes will always work out better.  Instead you tediously have to build up ""carts"" to add to your merchants.  You can only have a merchant per city so you're adding insanely high amounts of carts to each trade route.Having gotten to the point where I capped out my capital at $999,999,999 it seems like the game breaks down at this point.  There is a cap on how many buildings you can build (albeits a high one), the neutral partners can no longer be bribed without it instantly resetting to older levels, and competitors seem to avoid war while expanding instead.Overall the game is very disappointing and not worth it.  Save your money and get Rise of Venice instead.  It's the same rough experience except it's more polished, has more features, and allows for far more.The only nice thing about the game is that you can build your own cities, and it's a giant map.  Being able to see your cities grow is an amazing feature.  However it doesn't quite fit in with the trading simulator aspect of it.			"

												The game as it is now is broken. The auto-trading routes are a must once you get more than a handful of cities and the algorithm to buy oversupplied items and sell undersupplied items is broken.Specifically, I had two hubs of cities connected by a long road and assigned one trader to balance out the goods between the two hubs.  Once hub produced metal and the other consumed it to make goods.  The consuming cities were not producing their goods because they were short metal. The supply hub had 5000 metal stored (four barrels and the excess production flag) while the consuming hub had only 150 metal stored (one barrel). All this time the trader going between the two would on average take only 35 metal and have only around 125 or so goods total out of the 600 he could carry. Obviously he should have been maxing out with metal.Broken.			"

There is a cap on how many buildings you can build (albeits a high one), the neutral partners can no longer be bribed without it instantly resetting to older levels, and competitors seem to avoid war while expanding instead.Overall the game is very disappointing and not worth it.  Save your money and get Rise of Venice instead.  It's the same rough experience except it's more polished, has more features, and allows for far more.The only nice thing about the game is that you can build your own cities, and it's a giant map.  Being able to see your cities grow is an amazing feature.  However it doesn't quite fit in with the trading simulator aspect of it.			"

												Grand Ages Medieval is a very niche genre. This game is NOT like Total War and instead focus' primarily on the economic side of strategy as opposed to combat. The game does have troop trees and alliances but the main goal is to monitor your economy and make sure that you have the resources to run the network of towns across your empire. The combat side of gameplay is very hands-off.The game currently does feel very difficult keeping your bank balance in the plus however like Port Royal 3 (another game developed by Kalypso and also one of my favorite games), once you learn how to play the game and the tricks that help you win it is very fun and challenging to play.If you are concerned about the price or are unsure about the genre I would recommend picking up a copy of Port Royale 3 which is essentially a naval based version of Grand Ages Medieval.Most negative reviews are due to people not understanding the genre and were expecting another Total War variant or feel the game is broken (don't understand the economic mechanics). The game is fine but does require patience while you learn.I highly recommend the game however do your research first and make sure this game is for you.			"

												After playing this for a while, I'm quite mixed. I really enjoy the gameplay, but it becomes clear rather quickly that the game is really lacking in the long term gameplay. It's more efficient to make a few highly developed cities than spreading out all over the place. With the AI, this becomes rather lacking in the long run, as it seems to have issues prioritizing properly. On normal difficulty, it really wants to give  you money. I will recommend this, but it may just as well have been the opposite. I have a feeling I'll end up rarely playing it once I've put it down after the ""new game"" feeling is gone from it.			"

												Pros:The controls are fairly simpleNice graphicsTrade routes work well (they are basically the same as Port Royale's)Good detail and lively terrainI like the whole ""empire"" aspectThe random pop up locations are neat IE: shipwrecks and suchI like the limit on merchants, unlike Port Royale where you can have an unlimited number of trading ships.Cons:It seems to be a work in progress, or at least I hope it is still going to be upgraded.The lack of trade goods is disappointing. Devs- please add ALOT more goods like triple what you have try adding different weapon types as goods (maybe even require these goods for troops) try adding silk, spices, milk, cheese, cows, goats, pigs, chickens, eggs, bread (you already have pastries but bread would be just grain), different types of armor, horses, clay, paper, ink or dyes, sugar, crabs, pearls, gold, silver, split up the metal into copper,  and iron, add whales, tea, cotton, cocao, split up the different fruits, ale, whiskey, mead, (this should all be free too because the trade system was supposed to be complex but it's not) Those are just some ideas on trade goods to add to help gameplay.Trade goods are not regional, so you can get everything all in one area. There is no need to really expand too far or trade with anyone outside of your empire except early on. Devs- please make the goods more exclusive to areas.Profit margins still need some work. You do not make enough money to cover expenses and actually turn a profit, partially because of the lack of variety and under use of goods in towns (make towns consume more), which causes saturation of the market. Combat needs to be spiced up. Devs-Make up formations and such. You could set it up to where archers can be flanked and wiped out for instance. Add more troops types. Add the ability to patrol areas to troops or make towers have garrisons that patrol between pairs of towers. With this, you could increase bandit activity for them to fight. Take away the heavily armed and armored bandits for some lighter geared guys. Let's be honest, bandits rarely had full mail, shields and swords.Add more buildings in cities and maybe take away 1 or 2 types of production in each city IE: drop it from 5 to 4 or 3, to encourage more cities. Make cities revolt or something to add some depth. You could make buildings increase happiness or order as in the TW series and cause other factors decrease it. Add cultural and religious factors to make cities have more depth.This game has tons of potential and I'm still hopeful that it will become one of my favorites but it really needs some addition content that should mostly be free. I do not mind paying for some of it like maybe different troop types or something but the trade is the biggest issue since this is a trading game. This game should be Civilization, Total War, and Port Royale mixed into one insanely fun game but for now, it needs more content added badly. I can see this with only 10 hours of playing time. "

You can be an emperor.It takes time, it won't be easy.You will need to watch every town of yours manually, you will build it one by one, you will do trade, you will fight, you will survive.To rule over Europe and the surroundings, you need to prove you can lead your people to a better world.I do advice you people to buy this game, if  you like games where you think, where you actually need to do stuff and not just to click and that's all, buy this game.

												Even though it's a Kalypso game and seemed like another Port Royale 3 style game, I figured hey, you know, they've been saying there's more combat in this game.  It was all hype. You live and die by trade... again... I've been fooled for the last time.  I wanted this game, so I bought it. Now I feel it was a waste of $34. (US)  Pretty sure that there's going to be more DLC, and hopefully they'll fix the economy, and add more cities or more area to spread out, since Cities take up so much space.  The resources aren't visible (except Salt and Animals which are obvious) until you walk a Settler over the area you're thinking about settling in.  Even then, setting up a new City is poorly done because they don't have any supplies, they just build the city and it's there.  You have to trade with them to send them supplies to set up the towns Businesses (which give you supplies)  You go broke really quickly doing this.  It sucks.  Out of the 9 games I've started (not including Multiplayer, which doesn't really work well right now - you're lucky to connect, or the games lag or people drop out.) only one has been successful in terms of making money. I obviously don't know how to make money via trade, because I haven't been successful with it yet.  It doesn't seem to matter how many trade routes I have or how many Carts I have in each one. I've tried to build cities on resources I don't already have so that I can trade with other cities for things I don't have. You'd think that would be a successful strategy. So far, it's not. Based on what I've read, and what I've seen, I SHOULD be doing well.  So either the game mechanics aren't polished right now, or their values are off.  I would not recommend this game unless you know exactly what you're doing and absolutely LOVE this style of game.If you're looking for more Comabt-based games, this isn't for you.  Save your money.If you're looking for hours of trading and boring times of doing nothing, then this game is for you.			"

												Fought roving gang of 200 bears 10/10 would get mauled again.The game is a really nice balance in my opinion between not having as in depth combat if you considered the total war battle phase more of an interuption than anything. It also capably juggles the trading that the ANO series had with a little more depth and automation. It took a few hours to get used to the system but I did manage to make it to nobleman in my second game.There are problems at the moment though, balance in the combat department is sorely needed. -Bandits are insanely powerful. If you aren't fielding about 3 to 1 troops it will take months of in game time to kill and for some reason they can hold off your units until the last man.-Bandit Camps, which I asume spawn bandits, are guarded by a force double that of my empire, so Im not sure if I should have been flieding about 30 units at a time, but they had at least 10 units and they do not go down easy. -Animals are very confusing, they are seemingly one of the most effective bandits in the game, constantly traking down and chasing traders losing me a lot of profit. So animals with no leaders or formations should be relatively easy to kill, right? Nope. slightly better with a 2 to 1 ratio rather than 3 to 1, but I find my armies losing hundreds of men to combat with a group of lynxs. I don't have the best knowledge of how militaries worked in medieval times but I think that I could lead 300 guys with swords, axes, and bows against some forest cats and come out on top without needing hundreds of reinforcements. I find myself with the question of what theyre trying to simulate here. Searching/hunting for the creatures? Some kind of wider infestation of creatures? It doesn't make much sense to me that they aren't even routed at some point and take half my unit's health down.-Combat time/siege time it takes extremely long to fight/kill/takeover anything. 1 capable but single town kingdom took 3 years of constant siege (siege timer over 11k) was able to produce peasant units wo delay me, and even with 8 to 1 it was taking so long to run out their timer and so long to kill their 1 unit spawning every minute or two that after 3 years I couldnt keep up the siege and ran out of money.-micromanagement requirements. Having to rotate out units after combat is ok, as long as the loss was meaningful. I had to  rotate units more than 30 times over the course of the siege and still made very little headway. Ran out of money, morale dropped, units route, siege timer goes back up. It was very disheartening.With all that though, I played a lot of this game and had fun learning the mechanincs while playing.  The game is pretty and the game word is huge. Also reminded me of the Heros of might and magic overworld when I was microing my scout. With some balance patches I think the game will make more sense and be significantly more playable. Be prepared to learn NOT to always produce as much as possible before you flood the market and crush your profit margin. It's counter intuitive at first, but you learn to pay attention to what you need to and it becomes much clearer. no crashes so far and alt-tabbing works: stable!			"

You find towns, improve trade routes, improve relations and make virtual money. I like the story and art style of the cut-scenes. I have no complaints at all and recommend it to other fans of games from this publisher, namely the Patrician series and Port Royale.Edit - So, after playing for 30+ hours, I can honestly say this game does NOT SUCK. It is more about making huge amounts of money than about seiging cities. To make moar munny, town placement makes a huge difference. Also, I just discovered the ALT key highlights resource areas when you have a settler selected. Wow! No more running blind.			"

+ Visually stunning with a truly grand size map with lovely environments+ The cutscenes, voice acting, writing, and narration is all absolutely stunning. While watching the story cutscenes I felt like I was watching an upgraded version of the history channel with some great story telling and drawn imagery.+ Very addictive management style gameplay+ The campaign slowly introduces you to new mechanics allowing you to gradually learn how to play one step at a time without getting frusterated or stuck+ The game focuses a lot more on economic growth, trade, and city building rather than military. I loved creating roads, trade agreements, and trade routes with neighboring cities and profiting off my production while growing alliances.+ A great story that really tries to bring you into your characters role as mayor, and eventually expanding to new heights- Since the game focuses more on economic and social aspects of your kingdom, the gameplay itself can be a bit boring to some as combat is often rare and when you do get into a battle you are very limited as to what you can do to influence the outcome.

												Do NOT play the tutorial, just skip it over and learn it by yourself. They just put you into a production trap and you lose money all the time because you have too much production but not enough towns to sell to.Other than that, if you liked any hegemony games and total war games, you'll like this one. It's a mix of RTS and Empire Building like civilization. You can put towns anywhere and manage them however you want. Great game so far to be honest, and looks like I might spend a great deal of time on this one.			"

												Caveat Emptor.  This this game bears only the slightest resemblance to Grand Ages: Rome or Imperium Romanum, the games to which it is technically a seqel.  Instead of building individual buildings on a single map over many missions, you're building cities on a huge map of Europe, a map you'll keep for the entire game.  It's complicated and there's very little guidance, even in the campaign mode.However, if all of that sounds good to you (it did to me), then pick this up anyway.  If it doesn't, but you're a fan of Grand Ages: Rome or the economy side of Total War, wait for a sale, and then pick it up.			"

												the game is very simple, you start with one city and can expand to own more land by setteling cities around the old world as you can choose to start in many places such as ""North Africa"" ""Italy"" ""France"" ""Britain"" ""Germany"" and ""Scandinavia"" there are many more starting areas but theres are just a few examples.the war aspect of the game could be improved aswell as the diplomatic side of the game either way the game is very repetitive in certain aspects as they dont really offer any chance of changes within the game its self.

												This is a great game, but not without its flaws. The biggest thing is it seems like there should be more to the game. For example if you win a game you don't get a win screen. it also seems like once you get your first few big population cities its just a matter of time til you take over the world.The game is a time killer and you will spend at least 8-12 hours in one game.

												Economy driven, Middle Age Simulator.A successor of Patrician 4, Port Royale 3 and Rise of Venice and not Grand Ages: Rome - despite the title. Which is quite confusing because all of those titles come from the same publisher though not the same developer.If you like economic simulators and trading games where the focus lies on buying things instead of destroying them this is your game.If you expect it to play like a ""Total War"" or CIV kind of game you will fail, utterly.Still, for veterans of this genre, this feels like the easiest game from those developers, but maybe that's just me or after some patches it will become more balanced.

												I've mixed feelings about this game, but overall I can recommend it IF you know what you'll get and like that kind of game.Basically, it's an economy / trade simulator, and not a very complex one. It seems as if it's hard in the beginning, but once you understand the supply/demand principles, it's pretty easy to sit on a cash pool of millions regenerating weekly.For the rest of the game, it's not very exciting, because I'm very much missing any kind of serious battle system, which is sad. All you do is build a few defence towers against bandits/wolves/bears, put in a troup of archers which you send to tavern from time to time to restock, that's it about your terretory, even your war opponents won't attack you. If you want to attack, it's pretty simple: Get one taller squad of a good mixed troup (ranged/blunt/sharp/pike) and basically just win. I get along pretty easy with ~10 of those troups, and if one dies, I just build one up in the next barracks and send it into battle - that's no problem as long as the battles last.The basically not-so-easy econmy system as in a lot of other war-centric RTS games mixed with a more complex war and fighting system would be REAL fun. I'm really missing that part.Also, I'm very much missing a lot of diplomacy options as you have in other games, as in example expanding your terretory through marriage. There, a lot of the Turn-Based titles make a much better job.It has had more potential than what it's now. But the game overall is fun and I still like to play it (a lot). If you know what you get and you like that kind of game, go for it. If you like epic battles - don't go for it.			"

												TL;DR: If you enjoyed trade games such as the Patrician series, you might like this. If you are expecting a real empire simulation, you will probably not like this. This game feels like an Early Access title because it is rather shallow for an empire management game.I suggest you wait for a major update, expansion or a sale to make content and price balance each other.Overview===As a fan of the Patrician series, and Rise of Venice after that, I was very much looking forward to this title. What's better than managing a business empire? Managing the business of an actual empire!I started on the campaign on friday night, directly after release, and played till I fell asleep. Rinse-repeat for most of the weekend. It is enjoyable and very gently introduces you to all aspects of the game. I've logged almost 24 hours in the first weekend.While I am enjoying myself, this game is not going to be for everyone. I keep having the feeling that this is an Early Access title and that more content will be added in the near future. I have experienced no major bugs, but it feels like there should be more depth to all the game systems. This might be misplaced expectations, or wishful thinking. Mixed Steam reviews suggest I'm not alone in this.Trade Goods===Grand Ages: Medieval has only 20 trade goods, despite the world being larger than Rise of Venice, which had 22 trade goods. The production chains are still relatively short, with the most complex item (Pomp) only requiring a total of 4 other goods to make. You can create towns at any location that is not in (short) range of another city.  Each town has 5 slots for goods that you can customise based on availability. A city's  surroundings determine what goods are available, so nearby clay allows for Pottery, nearby meadows allow for Honey, mountains for Coal and Metal, sea for Fish and Salt, etc.All manufactured goods are unlocked with research, but they require no special terrain. Basic goods like Grain and Fruite are available as long as there is space around the city to put fields on.This means that you can setup an optimal cluster of 4 cities that produce all the goods in the game. Repeat this in each region of the world map and you don't really need to trade and you can min-max the hell out of it. There is no need to trade large distances to get all goods, nor do you need to do a lot of trading to complete your chains.This feels like a step down from previous games. The Patrician series was set around the Baltic and North seas. It had 20 goods, geographically distributed so you had to travel & trade to produce everything. Rise of Venice was set around the Mediterranean sea and had 22 goods that were geographically distributed. No more region-exclusive goods as in Patrician, but spread out enough to matter.Trade Routes===Earlier games progressed from you manually navigating one trade ship, to automating trade with a captain, to having multiple fleets of ships trade automatically. You could upgrade ships, get bigger ships and had to fend off pirates. In Rise of Venice you even had to hire sailors and equip them with weapons and the ships with different cannonballs.In Grand Ages: Medieval, you start off with a trade caravan that you can manually control, or you can let the trader work its magic automatically. You can add more carts to the convoy to make it larger. After that, they generally do their thing and you can forget about them. You are managing an empire, so micro-managing traders is not what you should be doing.Part of setting up your trade routes is creating new roads and upgrading existing roads to allow for faster travel. Keep in mind that upgrading roads requires resources from nearby towns, and construction silently stalls until the town gets supplied with materials.Military===Protecting your traders is done by hiring mercenaries, or by training more advanced troops as you research them. Your troops are units on the map that you can freely navigate on the map. When an enemy shows up in their range of vision, they call all their nearby friends and attack the enemy. Unit types have Rock-Paper-Scissors advantages against each other.Combat is takes very long and is a pretty boring affair. The need to micro-manage squad retreats makes it semi-interactive, but not really meaningful.Military units are very expensive to maintain, which makes historic sense. A unit has 100 soldiers, who all need to eat and drink like any other person. In game mechanics, this means they ""inflate"" the population of the nearest city by 100 to increase resource consumption that way. If you can't supply them with goods and gold, their morale drops and they retreat to the nearest city until you can support them again.Bandit camps pop up every once in a while that spawn roving bands of soldiers that plunder trade caravans until you kill them. Attacking the bandit camp will spawn half a dozen squads of soldiers to defend it, so bring an army.Diplomacy & War===Diplomacy: you bribe town mayors with huge stacks of money to upgrade your relations to a Military Alliance, then bribe them some more to win their sympathy, then bribe them some more to let their town join your empire.War: use the soldiers you have for defense against bandits to besiege a town for about a year, until their defenses wear down and you conquer them.End result for both approaches: you have an extra town, and probably spent a full year's profits to obtain it. Because there are no rules with reputations, nor populations with negative sentiments, it really does not matter how you obtain a city.This is definitely not Europa Universalis.Research & Progression===Because you now rule towns, there is no longer a need to buy trade licenses, build a reputation and unlock higher tier goods that way. Instead, every time you gain a social rank you get 3 points to spend on the tech tree to unlock new goods, to improve businesses (1 upgrade increases Honey yield by 3x!), to unlock military units, or to unlock improvements for your cities and roads. You gain social ranks by having more map control, which you get by building cities and increasing their population to increase their area of influence.Conclusion===I started with mixed feelings, and after writing this review I still have them. I did spend my entire weekend with the game, but I am not bouncing with enthusiasm to share with the world that this is the best game of the year. The reason is that the developers have released this game as version 1.0. That means from their perspective it's done. Complete. To me it feels like an Early Access title, with a lot of potential, but it is not fully fleshed out yet.If anyone at Gaming Minds or Kalypso reads this, here is what I would have wanted to be in the game:* Deeper trade system. More goods, better spread through the world, longer production chains.* Actual diplomacy. For inspiration, look at Europa Universalis; it has a VERY deep system.* Resolve combat 10x faster or make it deeper.* You rule an empire, but there are no people, no sentiments.			"

												The game has some potential, but missed the mark.  It is almost strictly a trading game, not at all comparable to Civ5.  Its comparable to Kalypso medias Port Royal 3: Pirates, only there’s no combat like there was in that game.  I like the concept of growing from a small village to a major force, BUT…Here’s a hint why some people are frustrated.  If you look at the slides advertising the game it show armies, vast “terrifying” armies and fleets (“armadas”).  I played enough to take over France and Spain and I could barely afford a single squad let alone an army.  That’s it.  Forget the military option, you can never afford it.  I made a couple of squads and they went to fight some bears.  You can watch the weeks tick by on a timer on the screen.  I estimate that these two squads (my entire army) fought those bears for two months before they won.  The only option I had was to run away.   No control over the squads.   If you’re going to advertise armies make it an integral part of the game.  Don’t lie.Diplomacy is essentially trading with a neighboring town, then paying them off.  Since you rarely have any money, it takes a long time.Graphics are nice; it’s got a great zoom feature on the little hamlets.  They probably spent a little too much time on this and not enough on the mechanics.  By the way, I see a number of people are having problems with Nvidia graphic cards.  Beware.  I have an ATI card and have not run across any bugs or crashes so it is solid from that angle.People play the game for 4 hours and say it’s great.  It is fun for 3 or 4 hours.  Unfortunately, shortly after that they realize that’s it.  It just continues on this repetitive grind of trading.  I don’t think it would take a lot to fix the game, increase the income, lower the military costs, diplomacy hmmm … got some work to do there, but hey that’s what troops are for. "

												I find this game pretty much boring.  Some mechanics seem not to have been thought through. For example: Caravan is robbed by bandist > Starting to lose money > Sending my troops to deal with the robbers > My troops lose moral because of lack of money and run back to town > Bandits still robbing caravans >Troops dont want to fight > Economy crashes > End game.So far I havent figured a way to bring back on track your negative balance. Usually if you go on negative is mostly game over. Is this how it's supposed to work?			"

												I was one of those people who was waiting for this game by the hour on the day of release. I was so excited about this game, because on paper it seemed awesome, especially with its massive world. And I really, really wanted to like it.Let me start with what I liked, the music, the way it looked and felt and that is about where it stopped.The game requires HEAVY micromanagement as the prices of commodities change and the supply/demand changes. When I reached more than 3 towns this process was so tedious that it just wasn't fun anymore. It requires quite a learning curve. The idea behind this game is really good, but the execution completely falls short of expecations.			"

												It, at first, seems like a nice building game, but you soon find out that it's an economy-trade game. Still you give it a shot, and for all it's ambiance-all you get is a massive headache because no matter how you play, how much gold you start with, nothing you do will prevent your economy from running negative--effectively ending the game (as you can't do much with a negative economy). So basically, if there is a point to playing this game, it's simply this: how long can you last before you end up w/ a negative economy! Now, to be totally fair; yes, there are people out there who like playing ""doomed to failure"" type games b/c they get some kind of thrill from the ""challenge!"" Me: not so much. I would compair such a ""challenge"" to someone running at full speed and ramming their head into a brick wall. An actual challenge would be if there was a chance or a way to make it through the brick wall and get to the other side. But seeing how many times you can hit the brick wall in such a fassion before ending up at the hospital from a massive concussion is no challenge, and it's no game. Cassino's actually have better odds of winning, simply because there's actually an element of chance that can turn in your favor allowing a win. :(			"

Basic goods like Grain and Fruite are available as long as there is space around the city to put fields on.This means that you can setup an optimal cluster of 4 cities that produce all the goods in the game. Repeat this in each region of the world map and you don't really need to trade and you can min-max the hell out of it. There is no need to trade large distances to get all goods, nor do you need to do a lot of trading to complete your chains.This feels like a step down from previous games. The Patrician series was set around the Baltic and North seas. It had 20 goods, geographically distributed so you had to travel & trade to produce everything. Rise of Venice was set around the Mediterranean sea and had 22 goods that were geographically distributed. No more region-exclusive goods as in Patrician, but spread out enough to matter.Trade Routes===Earlier games progressed from you manually navigating one trade ship, to automating trade with a captain, to having multiple fleets of ships trade automatically. You could upgrade ships, get bigger ships and had to fend off pirates. In Rise of Venice you even had to hire sailors and equip them with weapons and the ships with different cannonballs.In Grand Ages: Medieval, you start off with a trade caravan that you can manually control, or you can let the trader work its magic automatically. You can add more carts to the convoy to make it larger. After that, they generally do their thing and you can forget about them. You are managing an empire, so micro-managing traders is not what you should be doing.Part of setting up your trade routes is creating new roads and upgrading existing roads to allow for faster travel. Keep in mind that upgrading roads requires resources from nearby towns, and construction silently stalls until the town gets supplied with materials.Military===Protecting your traders is done by hiring mercenaries, or by training more advanced troops as you research them. Your troops are units on the map that you can freely navigate on the map. When an enemy shows up in their range of vision, they call all their nearby friends and attack the enemy. Unit types have Rock-Paper-Scissors advantages against each other.Combat is takes very long and is a pretty boring affair. The need to micro-manage squad retreats makes it semi-interactive, but not really meaningful.Military units are very expensive to maintain, which makes historic sense. A unit has 100 soldiers, who all need to eat and drink like any other person. In game mechanics, this means they ""inflate"" the population of the nearest city by 100 to increase resource consumption that way. If you can't supply them with goods and gold, their morale drops and they retreat to the nearest city until you can support them again.Bandit camps pop up every once in a while that spawn roving bands of soldiers that plunder trade caravans until you kill them. Attacking the bandit camp will spawn half a dozen squads of soldiers to defend it, so bring an army.Diplomacy & War===Diplomacy: you bribe town mayors with huge stacks of money to upgrade your relations to a Military Alliance, then bribe them some more to win their sympathy, then bribe them some more to let their town join your empire.War: use the soldiers you have for defense against bandits to besiege a town for about a year, until their defenses wear down and you conquer them.End result for both approaches: you have an extra town, and probably spent a full year's profits to obtain it. Because there are no rules with reputations, nor populations with negative sentiments, it really does not matter how you obtain a city.This is definitely not Europa Universalis.Research & Progression===Because you now rule towns, there is no longer a need to buy trade licenses, build a reputation and unlock higher tier goods that way. Instead, every time you gain a social rank you get 3 points to spend on the tech tree to unlock new goods, to improve businesses (1 upgrade increases Honey yield by 3x!), to unlock military units, or to unlock improvements for your cities and roads. You gain social ranks by having more map control, which you get by building cities and increasing their population to increase their area of influence.Conclusion===I started with mixed feelings, and after writing this review I still have them. I did spend my entire weekend with the game, but I am not bouncing with enthusiasm to share with the world that this is the best game of the year. The reason is that the developers have released this game as version 1.0. That means from their perspective it's done. Complete. To me it feels like an Early Access title, with a lot of potential, but it is not fully fleshed out yet.If anyone at Gaming Minds or Kalypso reads this, here is what I would have wanted to be in the game:* Deeper trade system. More goods, better spread through the world, longer production chains.* Actual diplomacy. For inspiration, look at Europa Universalis; it has a VERY deep system.* Resolve combat 10x faster or make it deeper.* You rule an empire, but there are no people, no sentiments.			"

Started an open game and soon my nearest rival is 5 times my size with seemingly endless traders, again I have run out of money and no way of recovering the situation as you can't raise taxes, buy more goods to trade so you just have to stop playing. I have boundless goods but no one to sell them to as the market is saturated. Can I have my money back please!!			"

												So, I'll be honest. This game in single player can be fun, but it's somewhat slow and flat when you're getting going. And the balance you need for economy can be a heart-breaker. But I quite like playing with friends on it. Specially sending traders to their lands and taking all of their money. Give it a good go, it's a great laugh to play with friends. And relaxing if things go well in single player~<3			"

												This is simply brilliant - if you like building business - such as fisheries wood bricks wine bla bla - which I do.I am a great fan of port royal 3 and all the other ones like it .The graphics are stunning so is the background music but that would be up to personal preferances.I really liked it when I started but couldn't get anywhere and eventually got frustrated with no money.You need to make money to expand and also pay for the military other wise they go on strike and you have no defence or attack.I now do it right after listenning to the writers advice - use carts to trade with your nieghbours and your townsIf you start by expanding your territory as fast as you can but never get into the red as you cannot buy anymore - from your own market also.But once you get the hang of it - it is brilliant and after awhile when you have enough money and trade going you start taking or attacking the enemys trade and watch your stock go throw the roof.You have to be vigilant with the planning of your trade routes and also what you produce as each town as it grows to do other things as new business such as skins may be in reach of the town limits.My favourite game is ""the last of us, and was followed by port royale 3 but this is second now. Also the forest and rust are really good but rust is full of ah players but then that is the purpose of the game like duke nukem.In this game - grand ages medieval when you zoom down close the little people are all doing things and the buildings all operate in stunning detail. 10 out of 10.

												I really enjoy the ecomony mechanics but this combat makes me wanna yell... Its amazing how a bandit hide-away can steal EVERYTHING from trade routes and grind your colony to a halt. The early combat makes it impossible to kill the bandit camp, I've spend the past 10 game years trying to elimanate them but can not. I'm obviously missing something major regarding combat, and can't seem to even put a dent in them. Combat seems pretty ridiculous, even with food business's telling me they are making more than needed. Get ready for ""We've been away from our camp for not even a week and I'm hungry and my feet are sore. Com'on army, back to base! Leave the last 5 men from that unit so they can replenish!""Not only will I not get my money back, even worse I wont get my time back...			"

												Based on the trailers and description of this game, I was expecting a sort of mix of age of empires, ck2, banished and total war, what I found was quite different.....I know many others are dissapointed that this game is not what they (and I) expected it to be, however I've found this to still be a fun game nonetheless.Very early on in the game you realise that a very large proponent is trading, which is where the game becomes a sort of on-land port royale 3 (my only reference point comparitively) with more diplomatic options.So basically, if you are looking for a city-builder or a game with in-depth military campaigns, this may not be the game for you. The idea for this game has so much more potential than is delivered, but you can't have it all.			"

												My graphics card is apparently in a weird place where it can handle everything in the game except the ambient stuff like clouds and birds (which show up super glitchy).  Game runs fine other than that.  Not laggy or anything.  But most games have an option to turn off ambient features, which I tend to do regardless of whether or not they glitch out.  Would've been nice to add that feature so I don't have to suffer through flashing triangles of light that are caused by components of the game that are entirely meaningless outside of aesthetic contexts.  I probably would love this game if I could tolerate playing it, but as it is I'm going to have to wait til I buy a new PC in all likelihood as I don't see the sense in upgrading the graphics card for this one.  And to clarify, my computer does meet or exceed the minimum requirements.  So I'm kind of upset that Kalypso more or less shafted me for 33 dollars until I buy my new PC.  This is why people pirate games.EDIT: Developer was helpful in explaining why I misread the minimum requirements.			"

												First i was one of all the angry people. I was giving this game a bad rewiew and wanted a refund. I cude not ounderstand how this game worked and i loset all the time. but after like 12h it finally clicked. When you understand everything this game is kind of easy. I can have big armies and alot of towns and I always have a big profit. So now i most say that i recommend this game. Having big fun with it and if you dont understad it, the biggest tip I can give is to always check the tab (All towns) in your town and make shore you dont over produce. I recomend that you have between white and green. And think about your placement of towns so your production cycle is effectiv. Ther is many other tips, so look at youtube and forums to optimize your play.			"

												It seems like one more rushed game for which the paying users will be the testers.Most of the times (about 80%) when I start the game the screen seems displaced somehow. I have to click some good 70-80 pixels to the left or to up from where a button is diplayed on the screen to actually click it. These bugs are pretty funny actually, but they do not provide 36 euros worth of entertainment.I can't tell you much about the gameplay because in the first two campaign missions plus 10 minutes of open game I was more focused on where to place the mouse to click on that Continue button in the middle of the screen. From those frustrating moments, I can tell you the game is focused on trade and city management, but mostly on trade.Overall, it is the only game that I am sorry I bought and the only one that got me angry enough to post a review.

												I first heard of the game a week ago. I watched quite a few videos online made sure it was the type of game I would enjoy (love grand strategy and economic games).I've got a whole 71 minutes on the game so far!! (Thumbs up)I went straight into a open game with 8 competitors and made everything hard. I struggled alittle at first with creating excess supply of basicly everything but I managed to sort that out pretty quickly and for the rest of the time had no money issues what so ever.I know you can expand and get new commodities but my two towns were at 100% Wealthy only collecting basic resources.To the real reason for this discussion though, camera navigation and ui control.This game feels like a CONSOLE PORT. I click anywhere and I seem to be setting off some different ui piece and navigating to the menus you want is hard and annoying as you often have to open windows and then sub-windows. The menus navigate better using the keyboard.......The game itself I think could be quite fun, it could perhaps use some tweaking to make it harder or give harder options. It needs to be less forgiving.But hey, that's my opinion.			"

What is Grand Ages: Medieval?""Grand Ages: Medieval"" is an entry in Kalypso's ""Grand Ages"" series of finely-crafted strategy games of DIFFERENT genres developed by different studios. This game IS NOT a sequel to the 2009 title ""Grand Ages: Rome"", a classic RTS with a focus on city building. ""Grand Ages: Medieval"" is a larger scale, real-time empire simulation game combining elements of trade, expansion and exploration with a heavy focus on economical domination.Seriously, those are first four lines of description. None of the people who wrote negative review didn't even bother to read description of this game yet they claim that this game stupid. You can't expect from them basic understanding of the economy, hence negative reviews.I feel really sorry for the dev teams on Steam, that they have deal this type of ridiculous ♥♥♥♥. "

												Lame.Ok. Review done. Oh alright, let me add a bit of rationale then.   1.  The user interface takes 4 clicks or more for things which should take 1. Very badly designed indeed.2.  It has combat in it with no options and no strategy 3. It has diplomacy in it with no options and no strategy This seems to have been an attempt to make an accessible strategy game. It does have its charm, it looks pretty and it is more accessible than most strategy games of late.  However, someone should have said that when people want ""accessible"" they dont mean, nothing behind a pretty bit of nothing.   Or at least I didnt.  I thought this might be a bit like settlers but learning some lessons from that in terms of being a bit more open, having some progression and being a bit less linear in many respects.  It isnt. Its light on content, options and any much to do after a certain point.  It is like a child of a friend or relative that is really annoying but cute.  Cute wears off, annoying never does. One way to overcome it would be to add some depth and character.  The depth just doesnt seem to be there.  A real shame as I can see so many ways this could have been so much better. I am no game designer so I imagine those that are know what they are but were not permitted to develop some of the aspects of the game which seem about 40% done.  This feels like an early access waiting for content.			"

												The AI is improved alot on this game, great for attacking and they AI works well. The graphics of the game looks nice and love the music in the background. There is some improvements you need to make to the game i feel e.g. The resources, because you start with 25% of the resources unlocked by one town. I like the user interface, easy to use and find stuff. combat is not that great atm. I would say it can be improved alot because this game does cost £29.99, its not one of them cheap strategy games you will find on steam. At the min i am 50% yes and no if you should get this game. I think more needs to be done and the game needs big improvements. If you like strategy games then you should get this when more updates come out and when it better.+ Great AI+ Nice GUI+ Easy to understand+ Music- Combat- Resources (Needs More)I think this game will be one of the best if they make more updates and add more to the game!

												Pretty decent eco driven game, playing mutiplayer game its bit short 2600 weeks you get and it only takes couple 30 mins or so to run through 400 days.ECO in this game is probably one of best I have seen, and its not easy to get under control it takes bit of understanding and time to learn how to turn good ECO if you just build willy nilly you tank your ECO very easily.this is a empire managment ECO driven simulation, with war fair in it.if you like games like port royal then you will like this game.if you not into trade simulation and managment style you wont like this.Other thign is miltary miltary is meant to be costly just like in real life. for example USA miltary budget cost half over half of the total income. same goes for this game. its best to have a huge surplus of extra money then build miltary you want send it out and when you are done you disband it.like real life if you keep it around you will tank your ECO.also the miltary pop is tanken out of your civ pop so more people in it less people doing work in the citys and making income.Trade it is best to make alot of citys and trade internaly, each person in a city buys goods, if you open up trade to out side citys then they buy your good but alsot hey sell to your people meaning less goods your people will buy of your own stuff.trade in this game and city managment requires alot of planing and should be done some what slowly.

												If you are going to get any game from Kalypso, i would say avoid this. If you can get Port Royale 3 or Rise of Venice for less than $5 than get one of those, but don't expect it to be fun for long. All of their games use a very simplistic trading system, used in Patrician Series, Port Royale, Rise of Venice and Grand Ages Medieval. They unfortunately use less and less commodities and seem to shrink the map they use for every new game. The very thought of making a game that uses the entire earth, and a much larger range of history? No, because they would have to actually do some design work, instead of sending out the same game over and over again, with a new location, for $40. Again I would suggest avoiding Kalypso games altogether, unless they are extremely cheap. Don't reward their laziness, buying game retreads.			"

												8/10Finished the campaign in about 14 hours, and I believe it's a nice introduction to a pretty in depth economy game. The UI is good, the automated trading is good, the graphics are good, and the sound is good.I like the basic combat as I don't feel particulary compelled to supervise a year long siege when I have larger economic situations to deal with. I just order the siege and let my generals take care of it. There are few nit picky constructive criticisms that I feel I have to mention though. The replayability could be higher... Once I figured out an economic solution all it took to expand was a simple clone of successful trade routes in different regions. Perhaps more diverse regional recources or lesser titles could be added to spice things up in the future. I also didn't feel particularly connected to my regent or dynasty. It would be nice if there was some character building. The opportunity to select a trait (ie. diplomacy bonus, cheaper soldier upkeep, increased production, ect.) every time a promotion is earned could go a long way to flesh out the rulers. Perhaps arranged marriages and children would help shift player focus away from simple expansion to more satisfying long term goals. I think with a well thought out expansion this game could really become a truly exceptional strategy game.Overall a very enjoyable game! "

												The first time I've seen an annoucement for this game I instantly thought about the hours of joy I've spent on Knights of Honor, Europa Universalis series and more recently on banished. Hell, the game trailers for Grand Ages Medieval looked awesome! I've thought about buying it right away. I've bought it on friday just 4 hours before the official release, but I had to leave for the weekend, leaving my computer on to arrive today and play it straight away. And so I did, I played today. And I think I won't play it ever again.See, the game I came to play looked more those free spammy games for Android and iOS, such Clash of Clans or whatever crap... I've found myself really sad as I was looking forward something else, better made.UPDATE: Requested a refund			"

												Not worth the buy, after about an hour of gameplay you are bored.  The campaign mode (tutorial) has some real issues in making you build too many production centres so you have a flood of goods and nobody to tell to. (I say build, this is completely abstracted, you just press an increase number of production buildings, no placement or even representation of the building on the map.)The world map is completely bare, with no countries/borders or cultures on the map, so you may as well be playing a trading game not in medieval europe but on a blank board with city names similar that to European cities.I would have used steam refund immediately but I bought it through Greenman gaming for the extra discount. (I had played for about 70 minutes before I quit.  I went back to it the following morning but still absolutely horrible). The DLC which I should have doesnt register either.Basically stay well away from this game, its horrible.			"

												GA:M is an interesting hybrid that combines colonization, (supply & trade) logistics, (basic) diplomacy, and (rock-paper-scissors) combat mechanics.Is it CIV 5? No. There's a tech tree, though.Is it EU 4? Uh uh. Comparing this game to EU4 makes my teeth hurt. If EU4 is an eagle, this fella is more like a promising hatchling.Is it like Total War? Nup. Combat is not tactical. It's more of a strategic overview (troop composition) with supply logistics as a cornerstone.What about Banished? No, seriously. What? I don't even. I mean, you can build stuff in your cities? Does that count? The architecture resembles. I'm reaching.If you've played Port Royal 3 or Rise of Venice, you'll already understand the flavour of this kind of game. So what does GA:M actually bring to the table?+ You control your own country (including the towns you found).+ Trade is a mix of land and sea trade.+ Combat involves land troops, as well as sea ships.+ Diplomacy allows for various levels of engagement with opponents/allies ranging from a transportation agreement, right through to a military alliance.+ Colonizing strategic locations to add much wanted goods to your supply chain is a thing.+ The tech-tree unlocks new technologies, products, and military units. You get three new techs with every promotion. A promotion is earned by expanding your influence (new cities, or expand current ones).So what does GA:M not do well?- Combat is, well, boring. The most interaction you get in combat is making units low on manpower retreat to nearby cities to re-supply before re-engaging. I won't lie. This is tedious and unfulfilling.- Sieges are tedious X 2. Ugh, just thinking about them makes me sleepy.- There's no limit on resources in cities. As an example I founded a city near a tiny (3 blocks) supply of furs. I then turned that city into a massive fur enterprise that supplied the majority of my 9 city empire and neutral cities beyond. This does not particularly make sense to me.- There doesn't appear to be any limits on metals or other non-renewable resources. This does not make any sense, either. Mines are expensive, they constantly need expanding, and in this time period, controlling a good mine could mean the success or failure of an entire civilization.-- In other words, fighting over limited resources is not really a thing in this game. There's resources everywhere. They don't run out.So is GA:M worth buying? Yeah, sure. If you liked PR3 or Rise of Venice, you'll probably dig this game. That said it is a niche market for games heavily reliant on logistics. If optimizing supply chains doesn't arouse your interest, don't buy this game. If you are interested, go watch some Let's Plays on YouTube first, then decide if you want to invest.Thanks for reading!			"

												Short review: A solid trade/logistics simulator with very basic combat, bit lacking of polish, but still pretty enjoyable once you get through the initial ""combat sucks"" frustration.++++++Nice graphics and atmospheric soundtrack+Solid trade basics+AI can be really challenging for an uprepared player+Convenient and understandable player interface+Huge game map-------- Like i said above, combat is very basic and secondary to the game- Very few tradegoods- Some mid-late game aspects can certainly use more automatization (Carts, i am looking at you! After a certain point in the game, you can completely fill all your towns production queue with carts and it still won't be enough for your traders. 1/2 of my playtime in the lategame is just ordering carts in every city)- The starting map, despite its huge size, feels very...barren and empty. Adding about thrice the number of neutral cities ight solve it, though=====Conclusion:The basics are solid. The basics are enjoyable. The AI (Artificial Idiot) is strong. Lacks some polish, which will probably get solved by some future DLC's (might be a drawback for some). 7/10, would recommend			"

												This could be a truely epic game, sadly its not.... yetIn most RTS games in this era you trade to make money to support an army to conquer the world. This is not the case in this game. In this game you mirco manage trade for the sake of it. For an RTS it is currently very light on strategy and very very repetative. The depth of the combat and diplomacy are truely insulting for a full price title.The developer did not help itself by appearing to willfully misrepresent the game in its videos and scrren shots on Steam in the weeks before its release.But to thier credit the developers are trying to fix some of the problems with the game but I fear that will be a long hard task to get this game from where it is,  a trading/depot development game to the epic empire builder that most people expected.It has some of the tools to get there but as seems fairly common in the past few years of game development, the community has a fair better idea, and many great ideas for how to make a game work properly.As proved by Total War Rome II and Civ 5 people have very high standards when it comes to RTS games, especially when their expectations are not met. I hope one day to be able to recommend this game			"

												Grand Ages: MedievalWell, let us call it Medieval instead. As you probably can see, i did not play it for long before i settled my mind, i dislike this game rather badly, i have never asked for a refund but on this game i felt that was what i wanted.Now the reason i disliked this game and do not reccomend it is that for me, it looks like you mixed Settlers (the board game) with a mobilephone strategy game. It is a economic simulator more than a strategy game but it is simplified, so simplified i will rather sit with friends drawing cards for wood, clay, sheep, and rock while using my gold, books or rolls of wool to upgrade my society and i find that more fun. The game looks promising, but the fact that it has allready shown that you will need DLC's to unlock more of the game when it is brand new is rather bad, i want a game where a DLC is an addition to the game, not a part to complete it with. Otherwise, for you that are like me and loved Grand Ages : Rome, DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT buy this game if you like the Grand Ages Series, This game spits on the Grand Ages, as it is nothing like the previous one. Partly because it is not the same developer, only same publisher. I did see trailers to it, gameplay videos and similar so i knew that it wasnt like the other one, yet when i tried it i felt so locked down. I could not really do much, i was stuck with these allready formed villages that i did not really decide how they would look like in the end. So to summarize i will add some pros and cons to the game.Pros:-The graphic is decent enough, may look bad next to all big games for 2015 but for its genre it is rather good next to the size of the maps in the game.-The Trading system is easy to use, either automatic or by your control-The diplomacy towards the AI is decent enough, simple but okay.-The random events are rather fun, even though historically there would not be volcanoes spawning around Scandinavia (That's where i started) in the medieval times.-The upgrades are well thought off and simple-Animations are decent enough-I like how you can fasttrack or put everthing on pause or superslow, that is good.Cons-The AI's seems rather plain, like there is no real difference between the ones in the game, none of them speak different languages during a game, i dont want the entire Europe speak English, i allready got that in movies. To be hones they kinda reminded me of Skyrim's voiceactors, only two voice actors that do most of the voices in a entire game- Things are too simplified, even at the highest settings (pro) so it feels rather simple for a strategygame'-You can't really design what you build.-No strategy in the army system, like in the Grand Ages : Rome you got special attacks and such for the units, right now it was just big army vs other big army = biggest army wins.-Not remotely close to Grand Ages: Rome-The system of only getting upgrades by increasing in rank is rather boring for a RTS, that would work better for online play then single player.-Gets boring quick as you learn the game fast without any real struggle unless you don't understand english.-All armies look the same, except colour and coat of arms.-Seriously, when did every medieval city look exactly the same? Not everyone had the castle in the middle of the city, some had them outside on hills overlooking the city.-Again, it is not like Grand Ages: Rome and i don't think it should call itself Grand Ages: Medieval, as using a series name without looking similar to it is just bad. I think it could rather just call it Medieval and i would like it better.-It lacks real depth-The Tradesystem is so simple that you try to just get like one more coin than what you got earlier for the same trade to attempt to make some coins.-Seems to be dependent on having a DLC, which is bad as a game should be strong enough on its own, a DLC should not be a part of what makes a game complete.-Seems to much of a mini gameTL;DR If you want a simple minigame that is more suited for a mobilephone, get it. If you want a proper RTS game that challenges you, go somewhere else. "

												This is a no for me, and I'd advise against it.Two hours was enough to convince me that I'll keep playing the game, but I'll wait until the first patch. However, I can't recommend it.Here are the two main reasons why (purely subjective)1) The game's crashed on me twice in two hours. Obviously there will always be game day release bugs, but Kalypso doesn't get a pass, because it's not an Indie company with a tiny budget, where they couldn't have had a decent Beta test. On top of that being CA$44 and, having issues with my nVidia graphics card (as it doesn't detect it. I'm not the only one,) Kalypso is a fairly large company, issues like these should have been caught before release.2) This game might as well be called Patrician V: Medieval, and not Grand Ages: Medieval. While I did see screenshots, and play videos, I was still hoping it would be a successor to ""Grand Ages: Rome"", at least in SOME way. It has absolutely nothing in common with it. In my opinion, they should have chosen a different name. Grand Ages: Rome was a fantastic, and unique game. This game, however, is basically just another iteration of the Patrician series. The only real difference is that instead of buying keys, and towns, you can found your own.I like Kalypso, and its unique games, but if you're wondering whether to buy it, I'd wait for a 50% off sale. By then the bugs will be fixed. Or unless you're desperate to play what may as well be called ""Patrician V: Medieval""			"

First of all, having your empire survive and not fall into an eternal hole of debt is way to difficult.

												It could have been such a good game. Still it is not.So let me start with saying that even if I do not recommend the game for other people, I have enjoyed it. In addition, I do not regret buying it, and will possibly play it some more, so even if the game is nice still seems empty and lazy, and so not good.I like how the various city and the trade works, but there are too few resources to go around...only 20 in the whole world. Come on people.In addition, there are no revolts...for real? No real problems...yes ok you have a famine...but no one complains, you get food and then everyone is happy again...even if like 2000 people died, what the hell?Warfare is laughable if compared with TW series, but even with the patrician series, you cannot even produce weapons, oh come on, how can you have a F... army without weapon production?Also religion? Where is it?I've conquered an empire buy attacking the capital once, in 1 turn I had 20 more cities....and it was unmanageable, what the hell.In conclusion, there is room for improvements; I see a good game here, in its development stage.If they do add some dlc, like the CW2 series, it come become pretty good with some improvements (on the points I selected, but there is some more as well).I will keep an eye on the game, and update this review if needed be.

												This is a difficult game to recommend because it's one you're probably either going to love, or hate.  If you are looking for a Total War style strategy experience then just forget it.  This game is primarily about setting up profitable manufacturing and trading routes and using the income from this to finance your plans for world domination.  If you've enjoyed playing games like Patrician and Port Royale then there is an excellent chance that you will come to like this one, so long as you are not put off by first impressions, as I so very nearly was.The campaign serves as something of a tutorial, but it is all too easy, even when seemingly following instructions to the letter, to screw things up and find yourself running out of cash near the start.  The best thing to do is have some patience early on and don't rush to carry out each campaign task as quickly as you can.  Take some time to learn the interface and where you need to look for information regarding your production and the supply and demand details for each of your traders. My first few hours of play were very frustrating at times, but now I've got into it, Im really starting to enjoy it ... so a qualified recommnedation from me.			"

												Ive played this game for about a day now and i do like it but there are alot of problems with it. 1: the resourses are the same everywhere, i mean everywhere, just the basic things youd expect to have in every kingdomw or country around the world. There are no exotic resources like spices, ivory even gold which is a basic resource in all games trading and grand strategy. Also a city may have 10 resources avalible but you can only use 5 of them which i feel is a little poor. So if a developer does end up reading this please add more resources as it is really boring and also allow for cities to use all the resources surrounding it. 2: unlike in most grand strategy/ empire building games you do get to pick where your cities go, however you dont get much choice in the way of buildings, each city can only have 5 resources utilised and even then you dont see them on the resource tiles you only see the buildings in the city which is also poor cause you would expect to see where there are trees to be a logging camp, where theres iron a mine etc. Also there arent many utility buildings avalible which is also very poor. 3: trade, to call this game a game of immersive trade is plain lying. The trade system is completely flawed as you cant do much trading and to set up a manual trade route looks easy but it rarely works and is so much hassle. With 5 cities you can be manufacturing all resources avalible so there would be no need to trade with other cities.4: Diplomacy is terrible, everything requires gold to do, theres no just offering a treaty to them you have to pay gold and after a while it becomes a rediculous ammount of gold just for a trade treaty despite the fact that the city wont even be worth 1/100th of what they demand. so its utterly utterly poor.5: combat is also poor, its not bad but still not much choice in terms of units, and when attacking a city it not only takes a rediculous ammount of troops but also when attacking a city with no walls what so ever, population of just 200 and no troops in it even if yoy attack with 10,000 men you still have to wait which is stupid if a town has no walls and no defenders then you should just be able to walk in and take it not wait 50 in game weeks to take it over.This game has the makings of a great game but its still really a game at 0.5 level, still needs soo much work done to it still needs so much put into it, this is not worth £30 , Its worth £10 cause there is very little in it and very little options to reply it as youre doing the same thing over and over and its too repetitive. Kalypso youve kinda robbeb people here with this, if you dont add more stuff in then you need to reduce the price as this is not worth what youre charging for it and you know its not.			"

												Seems to be too raw.Economic aspect of the game that relies on trading and a small portion of taxes from your town, too simple and feels incomplete. You set a trading route and then you wait for money and then you can buy out neutral towns using the money you've just made by practically doing nothing.Military combat is a rock, scissors, paper style thing. Basically having more troops wins the fight. To capture a city, simply get enough men and siege it and then you wait until the defenders die out, just make sure you have enough money and don't go negative, otherwise your soldiers simply abandon the fight and retreat to your town.5/10 Was expecting something more.  Would recommend to perhaps wait a little for an update or something  and get it later.			"

												It could have been such a good game. Still it is not.So let me start with saying that even if I do not recommend the game for other people, I have enjoyed it. In addition, I do not regret buying it, and will possibly play it some more, so even if the game is nice still seems empty and lazy, and so not good.I like how the various city and the trade works, but there are too few resources to go around...only 20 in the whole world. Come on people.In addition, there are no revolts...for real? No real problems...yes ok you have a famine...but no one complains, you get food and then everyone is happy again...even if like 2000 people died, what the hell?Warfare is laughable if compared with TW series, but even with the patrician series, you cannot even produce weapons, oh come on, how can you have a F... army without weapon production?Also religion? Where is it?I've conquered an empire buy attacking the capital once, in 1 turn I had 20 more cities....and it was unmanageable, what the hell.In conclusion, there is room for improvements; I see a good game here, in its development stage.If they do add some dlc, like the CW2 series, it come become pretty good with some improvements (on the points I selected, but there is some more as well).I will keep an eye on the game, and update this review if needed be.

												This is a difficult game to recommend because it's one you're probably either going to love, or hate.  If you are looking for a Total War style strategy experience then just forget it.  This game is primarily about setting up profitable manufacturing and trading routes and using the income from this to finance your plans for world domination.  If you've enjoyed playing games like Patrician and Port Royale then there is an excellent chance that you will come to like this one, so long as you are not put off by first impressions, as I so very nearly was.The campaign serves as something of a tutorial, but it is all too easy, even when seemingly following instructions to the letter, to screw things up and find yourself running out of cash near the start.  The best thing to do is have some patience early on and don't rush to carry out each campaign task as quickly as you can.  Take some time to learn the interface and where you need to look for information regarding your production and the supply and demand details for each of your traders. My first few hours of play were very frustrating at times, but now I've got into it, Im really starting to enjoy it ... so a qualified recommnedation from me.			"

												This is a wonderful game I think I am about 18 hours in and thats just in 3 days. I like how it is more economy focused than militarily focused. And the map is huge, takes forever just to get the  borders opened up from the intial area. One downsided is when in the campaign and doing diplomacy stuff the amount it takes is dependent on your current wealth. Took me 8 million to gain Izma's sympathy and only 700k to buy it after I went broke. Don't know if it's intentional, or just a♥♥♥♥♥♥happens kind of thing, But my traders soon made me a millionaire again. I think the people who struggle with this game, or think it sucks is because they do not realize the most money is made off the townspeople buying and not the traders making trades.  All in all, it is definitely worth a try if your looking for a laid back strategy game.			"

												As they call Grand Age: Medieval in France; Port Royal with Cheese.I'm going to be fairly brutal in this review, but the game itself is fairly addictive.The entirety of this game is a focus on trading, with the focus pretty much on just making sure each trader (each city gets only one: WFT?) has a growing supply of carts to perform more trade, whilst, adding or removing commodity production facililties as required.The campaign is good, as it provides direction, rather than just random expansion, though it does feel like it ends suddenly (and easily).  Once I reached this point, I kind of lost interest, as all the technologies had been researched and there was no real competition.  Don't take this as meaning this game is boring, I played for a solid 12hrs straight before this point.Regarding diplomacy; if you have enough money, you can pretty much buy anything.  You can pay other leaders, and once they like you enough, you can simply buy their towns from them.  If this sounds too easy, then you can build up armies...Armies: They are expensive as♥♥♥♥♥♥to maintain, and the lower level units give better stats per upkeep than the higher level units.  It's pretty strange.  What makes it even stranger, is that you'll spend most of your time using your armies to fight wild animals (who take a fair bit longer to kill than bandits....strange; it's like the molerats and radroaches in Fallout: Shelter).  Additionally, the inability to fully destroy the structures containing wild animals led to me having to build a fort next to them, and keep rotating in fresh, healthy troops into it, just to fend off wild animals. You can create forts, but they can only stock one unit at once, which makes them only really useful for fending off a single unit attack, rather than possible enemy armies (of which I never saw one).  The combat itself is really, really, really simple.  There are barely tactics involved. It's just who can have a larger stack of units with higher combat value; with a little bit of alteration depending on which units types are better at fighting other unit types (doesn't effect it that much).  A bit of theft from the Total War book would have helped them out.  That being said, the resource management/trading side of things craps all over Total War.  And that is why this game is not a flop; and it gains my recommendation to play it.			"

												It's a fun game, for the most part. If you enjoy Patrician, chances are you might like this game. If you expect, and want, exciting, engaging, and awesome tactical combat... you won't get any... at all. It is all about trade routes and founding cities in sensible locations. Figuring out how to manage the trade routes to return a solid profit may take a while, but the economy can be balanced. Expect to restart the campaign a few times to get it right. Take your time, don't rush through the objectives. Producing too many goods can be tempting, but will eventually collapse your trade-routes and your economy. You can produce up to five different supplies at each town - and deciding what to produce where - is important to your trade route and economy. There is simple diplomacy. You barter for transit agreements, trade agreements, peace, alliance, war and so on. And, for this part I recommend the game for those that enjoy a pure economy sim. But, only if you can suffer the frustrations below:You will need a Kalypso account (I'm so tired of signing in with every single developers useless ""social"" platform). You have little to no control over what your armies do. When engaged in combat, your only tactical move is flee. You compose your armies of units with strengths and weaknesses and pit them against enemy cities or units. You are a passive observer to combat, watching a siege that might take years, or a combat between 12 men lasting a month or two (ingame time). You discover a monster den here and there that seemingly cannot be destroyed. Packs of 70+ wolves, lynxes, and what not, will harass your traders. Bandits will spawn camps so big defeating them has a good chance of ruining your ""empire"". I have not tried multiplayer, and I won't. All in all the good outweighs the bad to a small degree for my part. If money isn't an issue in the decision, give it a go.			"

												Okay, I decided to have a proper go at this game before writing a review (27 hours). I love these sort of realm management games and I'd recommend this game for just that. There's been a bit of moaning about trading problems and comments that suggest that the game is unbalanced......no so.....the game work perfectly; youjust need to spend some time learning the ropes. In my opinion this game has been carefully thought out so that it's balance is the very essence of the game.....yeah; perfect for a realm sim and very Tai Chi !I had a few goes to start with and I found it hard to make the books balance but after playing it for a while and getting to know how the whole thing works (plus a few new starts !) I eventually got a nicely balanced game going on. For me, this is a good sign; the more complex and balanced a game is then the more game play I'm going to get out of it. The graphics are gorgeous and the interface is reasonably easy to operate giving some of the complexities of the game.Like I say, I'm 27 hours in and I'm loving it....with no signs of an end game coming soon.....proper campaign stuff and well worth my money !

												Sadly I can't quite recommend this game.  It is similar to many other strategy games I have played, just with less features and control.  I will keep giving it a shot but so far it seems like you are just doing the same things over and over again.  I don't completely suck at these types of games but I don't think that you should be going broke in the tutorial so that you can't even continue.What makes the game close to a positive recommendation is the cost.  You are truly getting what you pay for here.  This is the first time I am hoping for some DLC to come soon.			"

												I was worried a little as having pre-ordered the game, but not played immediately due to commitments, I was hearing bad reviews. Most of those reviews are from people who have played it for very little time. I have played it for a bit and found it enjoyable. Trade and production is the core of the game and you need to try using the all cities tab and other indicators like caravan profitability to make serious money. There are real annoyances like almost unkillable bandit dens and similar for some wild animals, but they don't overwhelm. I have played games like Patrician from the same company and this does have resemblances in the trade engine. The ai opponents are capable and hopefully they are not cheating. I for one am happy I got this game. It adds to the 4x genre. It still needs some fine tuning, but the developers have been efficient in release patches that deal with annoyances. I hope the animals and bandits are sorted soon, but other than that, this is a very pleasant game.			"

												*5/10If this was a release date review I woudn't recommend this game.  It came out at $60, and there just really isn't anything in this game to justify that.  The game has it's highlights, and I'll admit, it is rewarding to build a true empire, but since there is only a euro map, with areas segmented off for smaller games, there really isn't much actual content.  Warfare is far too simple, and the tech tree is a joke.  They really would have been best served to have set this kind of game later in the timeline, and opened up the entire world.  That would allow for unique nations, that would have really added greatly to this game.  All in all it's worth the $30 now, but just barely, also with no DLC coming out, the game kind of falls flat.  All in all, if you're a fan of this kind of game, you'll like this, but if I where to give this an actual rating, it would be a 5/10, which is just meh. Oh, and the whole preorder only DLC fiasco is complete BS.			"

												Review Grand Ages MedievalI'm writing this review because I feel the steam reviews are going in the wrong direction.I like this game - but I understand that it's not for everyone.You should not just buy this game and see how it goes.Be informed before you buy it.The :(- The name is too similar to ""Grand Ages: Rome"" although these are (from what I've heard)  very different games. People may have been mislead by this.- It's not for everyone. You have to be a fan of economic simulations to like it.  Even Wikipedia lists it as ""City building, Real-Time strategy""... which is not totally wrong,  but pretty misleading. It's an *economic simulation*. With a little city building, and a little warfare  mixed in.- I would have liked it more if you could actually choose locations for buildings in your cities. You can't. The :|- The map is pretty big. However, cities take up much more space than in real life. So you can't build as much cities as are  in Europe, but you can build a whole bunch, I guess around 100.- The user interface could be more intuitive at times - but I got used to it fast.- The sound and graphics are not outstanding. Though it is cool that you can zoom in and out from  a view of Europe to a view of a single city. Unfortunately the zoom is not as seamless as it could be  (There are 4 zoom levels - hard to explain, watch a video to see it).- The story seems mediocre (so far), but the illustrations and voice overs are nice. The animated models are not great though.- I have not tested the multiplayer mode yet. I think it could be fun, but I haven't tried it, so I cannot comment.- I don't know how it plays if you have half of Europe ""conquered"", because I only have about 12 cities now.The :)- I have always wanted a game, where you have different places(cities), that produce different goods  and have to exchange those goods. There are several games that are similar in this regard - like  Anno or even MiniMetro, Factorio, or SimuTrans. (I have to say at this point, that when I first saw GAM,   I thought ""Civilization"", but Civ does not focus on trade.)  However GAM also makes use of the principle of supply and demand.  So you can't just build huge amounts of one particular (expensive) good, and sell it all the time.  If you produce too much, the prices will fall and your production costs will exceed your income.- You have to define trade routes between your (and others') cities. You can limit these to certain goods / amounts, or  just let them ""buy cheep, sell expensive"" which works good in most cases.- Armies play a minor role. For me, this is a plus. I have spent hours defeating a bandit camp (of 200 guys)  because I just couldn't pay enough soldiers. Whenever I defeated a bunch of bandits, I ran out of money.  Then the soldiers just wont fight any more - they go back to the next city and wait until you have money again.  And those damn bandits regenerate pretty fast.  It was all my fault. I had to build this one city next to a bandit camp.  The thing is: I could have survived without much fighting, and I like that in this kind of game. I like  the fact that you cannot just buy a huge army and overrun everyone.  That could be fun, but there are already enough games that do that, and it just doesn't fit into this simulation  kind of game. Technical stuff:- I just found one weird bug: It keeps telling me that this savegame was played by someone else, so I cannot unlock  achievements. That's not good, but I don't care too much for achievements, so I'm fine. Also, I read in the changelog  that they fixed this bug, but only for new savegames. As far as I understand it, it shouldn't effect you, if you haven't  played yet.- There have been two patches in the first week. They apparently fixed a lot of bugs, but I didn't run into any of those.- There's this Kalypso installer thing which starts every time you start the game. You can register an account there.  It's a little annoying, but it's only two clicks to skip it, so I don't mind it. - I heard this game will be released for consoles. I would strongly recommend it playing with a mouse!   Overall, I can say that I have played 15 hours of this game, and I still want to continue.If you are into those kinds of games, you should definitively check it out, watch an hour of a Let's Play -and then decide. It definitively does not deserve the ""mixed"" reviews that it gets on steam. "

												I don't know how to even put into words where this game fails... but I am gonna try.Cons:Poor AIPoor Trade MechanicsResources are the same in every region of the world and have the same value regardless of where they are grown. Sure I bet the grapes you grow in the desert are as good as in the fields of France.... Honey in the desert too? Sure a bunch of it for no reason. Nobody has unique resources. Everyone can produce and trade anything someone else can.Poor Combat MechanicsLittle contentPros:It certainly looks nice (they seriously used that in the video)Really nothing at this point unless you like poor simulation with no real incentive to care what even happens.Seriously though trade is the only thing actually going on in this game and it is poorly done. How about some depth or individuality based on your region? This game needs an overhaul if it is to succeed. Based on recent game history though that is unlikely to happen so I wouldn't bother, I get the feeling this was made to turn a quick profit or move into a new game type, and it shows in the lack of love they put into this effort. Save your money and get Civs, Europa or CKII if you want some strategy done by people who LOVE it.			"

												I am really enjoying this game, while it looks simple from the outside, on the inside is a deep and somewhat complicated at first, empire building game. It took me a while to figure it out but once you learn the systems you get a interesting and challenging a game. If your looking for a RTS full of combat and big battles then this may not be for you. the combat is more of a numbers game then strategy, but war is just a part a deeper story of diplomacy, trade, and economy!

												Grand Ages: Medieval is a true challenging game.I like the focus on the trading aspect, where it is less focused in big strategy games such as the Total War series. The trading system is deep, with an option for micro supply management.Also, the campaign is surprisingly interesting and challenging as the open world option.It is recommended if you are looking for a new kind of a strategy game with challenging core features.

												I enjoy playing this game and dont fully understand why there are so many negative reveiws. I did notice the majority of bad reveiws are coming from people who have only played the game for a few hours.I do think the trading aspect of the game is a little hard to get in the beggining and even think that it may benefit from a little changing around but the game overall is very enjoyable if you take the time to figure out whats going on, play the campaign and even check out a few guides.I felt compelled to write this reveiw because in my opinion it is a good game with the potential to be even better and deserves to be better represented by the number of positive reveiws.

												I was expecting so much more from this game, but it's 35 euros down the toilet. This game is so shallow and boring plus has few annoying bugs, but nothing major. In the end it's your typical modern Kalypso game- designed to require 20 DLCs before it becomes an actual game. So the correct price of this game is not 36.99 but more like 99.99, because that's how much you'll end up paying if you actually want a decent game. Right now at the launch i could not recommend this game to anyone.Edit: Did i mention that the pre-order price was 38 euros which was supposed to be -15% off, but the launch price is 36.99? What a scam.On this day, let it be known that I will NEVER buy a Kalypso game again. These people are the cancer of gaming industry!			"

												The game essentially attempts to be a Patrician 4 or Rise of Venice across all of Europe, with combat mechanics and more focused on ruling than trading. I found Patrician 4 and Rise of Venice both to be okay games, and while I expected it to fall short of them because of its lofty ambitions, I'm surprised by how much it was. By the way, before I go in depth, let me preface with this: in the open gameplay, there is no Constantinople. It doesn't exist. What the campaign centers around is completely missing in the open gameplay. There are many other settlements, like Venice and Genoa, which are really conspicuous in their absence. Trading:The trading is significantly worse than in Rise of Venice or Patrician 4. Even though there are possible more cities, they're on a much, much larger scale, and you'll usually only find communities of 3 or 4 cities that would trade with each other. Also, each city is limited to one trader. In order to compensate, the consumption that cities do is drastically lowered, to the extent that it's really only super profitable to deliver goods to facilities that consume them. Not only that, but because each settlement can freely choose what it produces, production is actually less interesting. Resources become really common, and instead of a well balanced, hand-crafted system, you have just a jumble of weird production.Combat:Combat lasts a ridiculous amount of time. It's silly how long it does. It can take 6-7 weeks. Early combat, where your scout is attacked by bandits, is the most boring thing to watch, because on a scale where the weakest true military unit has 100 strength, scouts have 2, and bandits have 1, so they'll almost never do any meaningful damage to each other, and it takes months for anything to happen. It's also absurdly expensive, where trading isn't profitable enough to really make any difference. Ruling:Ruling is boring, and poorly done. You make barely any money from doing it, and the trading system is tied to it to poor effects. Constructing new buildings isn't interesting, taxes aren't useful, building new cities is essetially what caused this game to be as bad as it is through the vast amounts of open territory, and the tech system just feels like the game hiding things from me for no reason, such as telling my traders what they should trade on trade routes. That's a basic feature of automated trade routes. Why is it locked behind tech? The upgrades to military should cost significantly less upkeep than they do now, but instead be marginally better. Rather than tier three costing 5x as much but being 3x as effective, it should be 1.5-2x as effective but cost 1.25x as much. After all, you've already sunk very valuable tech points into them, and they're unique units for the place you started. They should be outright better.Overall, they game tried to be something that it wasn't, and failed at being both what it wasn't and what it was. This happens all the time in the game industry, and it always ends badly.			"

												This game takes a view hours to get into, especially with regard to the trade system. However once you realize how to use the goods availability overview of your traders with regard to which industries to expand and where to settle, then the economy becomes manageable and the game starts to be fun to play.After 15 hours of playing I managed to finish the campaign and the open game and multiplayer will add a few hours more. Though replayability after the campaign is low, it's in the core a fun economy management game.

												The game is sold as a global strategy game and for me it does everything I expected of this kinda game. I can choose where to start my empire and expand it all over europe by founding, buying or taking new cities by force. Considering the available resources I can set up a trade routes to supply my cities and make big cash out of it. And claiming a competitors ground puts me in the shoes of a mighty emperor. And I think the visual presentation is pretty impressive. It still hits me when zooming out of my latest founded settlement to get an overview of my already huge empire! But I do understand the critics about the simplistic battle system IF I would have expected a Total War-ish type of game; but I don't and so the battle in Grand Ages Medieval is a tool I can use to expand my empire. Not more and not less and therefore I would really recommend the game to everyone looking for a challenging and trade-based type of strategy game. And regarding the all present ""dlc""-criticism: there are two dlcs until now available and they are both cosmetics and no game relevent stuff. Also they are both included in the Day1 version which is sold everywhere (even on steam, where I purchased it). And right now there are no announced dlcs, yet. So stop hating on unanounced dlcs just to give a bad review.			"

												As it stands, the game tries to be too many things, yet never reaches either of them.AI is totally broken and is not challenge at all to conquer.Game mechanics are all over the place, like merchants that never buy things that are needed in your towns/markets, they buy the resources you make and just occumulate like crazy until you go broke.If you're looking for action, you won't find any as the fights are just random and no control or viewpoint.Everything is random, that is fine, but there should be more to it than just random, it should make sense.I would give a 0 Star rating, but cannot.If you really want to waste about 30 mins, and that's all it takes to see how mucch of a mess this game really is, then wait until they give it away. Even then you'd be wasting your money.			"

												At Summer (or presumably Winter) Sale prices, this game is a good deal. It's got great 3D graphics, and enough challenge that you should be able to get your moneys worth by taking over all of Europe before the game is no longer a challenge. It would have been nice if they came out with an expansion or some free patches to address some of the short comings, which revolve around the tediousness of some of the trade networks. It has a lot of potential and I hope it gets used as a model for future games.			"

												Ok. Just completed my first full playthrough of this game, and I liked it. The map is huge. I mean really really big. Really. Best as I thought I had a good corner of the world sliced out for myself, a few alliances quickly revealed to me exactly how vast the world I played in was, and how little of it I in reality controlled.But, and there is a but. The game has some shortcomings.It is built around a simplified trade and millitary system, without much progression. You unlock a few specialised units as you advance (locked to regions; e.g. Longbowmen in Great Britain etc) - but the trade/commerce system never changes from the start until the end. There are no regional supplies, basically only some very basic consumption type goods for food, a few ""component"" type commerce items (like wool for cloth, grain for beer) and a few ""business items"" (finished products, like clothes, jewellry, tools) - and that's it. So you basically end up having 100 cities or more, all producing the very same goods, and moving them around in a simplified ""balance all"" traderoute system. This works ok in the beginning, when you have less than 10 cities and choosing what each city builds and distributes actually makes sense - later on there is no point whatsoever, and the whole idea of setting up and min-maxing your traderoutes is just pointless. You don't care what they build; you just add production facitilites to cities for them to grow.But all things said, I did enjoy the game. I just feel it falls slightly short for much replay value. Also; I conquered the world, but didn't get to grandstand in a massive throneroom being worshipped by the world. What's up with that?   Game just carried on, like a sandbox that never ran out of sand. "

												I have only been playing the multiplayer ""sandbox"" with a friend so my review is based only on this.However at start the game may seem confusing and i caught myself annoyed by not being able to maintain a stable economy. However after slowly getting the concept i was able to get a flourishing economy and at the moment with only 5 cities i have 5.5 millions. Also the i like the combat however at the moment sometimes half your army will just stand and watch, but game has just released and despite from this i didn't experience any bugs or errors at all! I will list some of the pro's and con's that i've experienced about this game.Pros:Decent graphicsStable engineNo major bugs or errorsStable multiplayerGood AI (Actually make proper invasions with full force) Battles look and feel epic (And very long, however sometimes using a half hour fighting  bandits can feel a bit annoying)Cons:Battles could be optimized a bitConfusing at startNot shared supply lines with allies (I couldn't assist my friend who was in war due to this)Lacking a few diplomatic options like sharing etc. supply lines, becoming or vassalging other players and AI.Could use a few more city buildings or modificationsMy final score for this game is 9/10I was pleasently surprised by playing this and have done so for the last 11 hours. I won't comment on the gameplay itself since it's different what people like and enjoy but in my case i like it.			"

												It looks like developers tried to mix ideas from many different games and it didn't work out. Combat is terrible, comparing it to Total War is a joke. Making units fighting on main map was a mistake, when pretty much all you can do after battle started is to give an order to retreat. I guess ""Grand Ages"" refers to how long fights take when enemy is outnumbered 10:1. Medieval is only in title, its hard to feel the historical theme when most of the map is empty and there are no differences between any countries/areas/regions. It is possible to be self sufficient with just 4-5 cities, there are no points of strategic importance.Diplomacy doesn't really exist - it is just: send money to city ruler until he agrees to be annexed.Technology tree progress depends on number of owned cities, same for number of traders, so there is no way to play non-expansive game.Ships can't transfer armies ... what the hell?In other words - if you want to create great trade empire go play EU4/CK2 as Venice, it will fill much more satisfying.

												many reviews of this game are poor becuase they come in expecting something it is not. This is not a military game, it is an economics game. It does that very well in my opinion. It does have a hell of a learning curve, which most people whine about these days when death comes in negitive numbers, not in battles lost. Having a military is extremely costly, that is truely to deter anyone from trying to turn it into a military rush game. THIS ISN'T A TOTAL WAR GAME, and it has nothing to do with the earlier grand ages rome. If you wanted combat, go else where. the combat model in this game is set up so that you dont have to pay attention to combat, troops are very fire and forget, and no amount of tactics will save an inferior army. The bandits are a little over powered for my tastes, given the massive military costs, but thats it for military complaints. As towards peoples failures, this game was set up to be like the middle ages, in the middle ages NOT EVERYONE SUCCEDED. The best players of this game will still lose because of a random plague at the beginning or something of that nature. there are parts of this game that are not intuitive, but anyone who has taken a college economics course will tell you that economics rarely is. And as i said before, this game is true to the economics of the time. Can you have a max size city? Yes, larger is always possible, but you have to be a master at logistics, and almost no one is.TLDR: This game is fun, but has a harsh learning curve, and is about realistic economics, not warfare.

												Have not finished it yet, but this one need a review while it's on sale.This game comes with new Ideas for strategy games and does well on almost all of them. The single player campain/tutorial is intriguingly written with a good learning curve and well presented story. Buildings options though tend to run out quickly and the management consists of mostly simple repeating steps. The game balance/difficulty is overall easy and plays slowly. Here I can see what other reviewers hint at and must agree with most of the criticism. On the other hand the game works very well in it's strong fields like UI, presentation, graphics and visiual feedback. The latter meaning a thing I really love: all buildings, in progress or otherwise, the resources of a city, everthing reflects in the game world, a game world with free zoom I might add.So shortly, If you only read this bit and fly over more reviews - Grand Ages: Medieval is visually nice, technically well executed and has a intriguing story. It falls short on balance or big strategy things and is as easy as repetitive.I recommend it as the relaxing strategy game for the casual medieval fan. Definitly get it on sale.PS: Multiplayer is to slow and not relaxing, I guess (not tested).			"

												So far so good. I'd challenge that the price point is at a high end even with the discount i got. I wish it let you design a little more detaily like port royal where you put stuff. Feels like Civ 5 but stuck in time centry. Music is ok.Very few bugs for me with launch. The customize options are super limited. At this price point I should be able to super impose my face in the game like Madden. But it only lets you pick from a few pedifile looking people. The design for emblem is limited too. I like the game idea and hope they keep improving it as it does have a lot of potential. Just feels like it could add more depth in customization for my money.			"

												Working on trade and production is my favorite but after Patrician, I cannot understand how they missed so many management details. I was expecting something more developed and sofisticated than Patrician but alas, it was the opposite. Even for someone not really kin on Total War-like combat, the combat and military is too dull. Why not have much more micromanagement and decision making in technology? Why not a more complicated and varied market? Why not more things to sell, buy and produce? Why limiting me on my minimum price to sell, when I want to sell for more profit with my automated routes? Why cannot the merchants interact with the warehouses to take in stock to sell somewhere else but just buy from the market? Why not more type of buildings? Hospitals, theatres, libraries etc. that would effect the growth of the city? etc...I'm sorry but too many lackings...Too many for  a game so ambitious in its announcing			"

Also it seems like you need to micro manage to get things done. Production costs and upkeep of traders seems a little high or the trading itself is bad. I am still attempting to give the game a chance. I was really excited for this game because of the mix between civ 5 and port royal however, I think there needs to be some patching.			"

												ok so hear me out, those of you who came here for a guide to win will be sad after you are finished reading this, to put it simply the economic system of this game makes it so that you will always run out of money no matter what. i have tried everything, and i still usually end up going under, this needs patched ASAPthat being said if the economy is broken, it makes it hard to fund growth and an army (Armies are not a huge part of this game sadly however i wish they were so devs if you read this add some more in depth military action.) you will basically have no army to defend yourself or to conquer should the time come. so without an army or any depth of military strategy in this game what does that leave you with? The answer is Trading. it is the most boring and repetitive thing i could think of and i am actually regretting preordering this game, and even if all you do is trade your economy will still fail.now im sure given time all of this will be fixed as any game that revolves around DLC has. i will continue playing and i shall see if i can find a way to keep the economy above water enough to get established to actually have a decent game. besides the negativety the graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing however it does not fix how broken this game is.another thing is this game does not detect Nvidia graphics cards so you will have to manually add it, i unkowingly played for a couple of hours on my stock graphics card and was wondering if mine had gone out!right now my verdict is wait for a year or so, dont waste your money yet i beg you!anywho, any advice or suggestions are welcomed, constructive critisim is also welcomed so dont hold back on calling me a retard if i have made a mistake!thanks for reading and i shall make more guides soon on how to win at a broken game.

												I pre-purchased this game when it was on sale, and I'm glad I did because it keeps crashing on me, apparantly this game is far from bug free. first it crashed on the direction help screen ADW, and later in the game it again crashed when I zoomed in. I hope the developers read this and fix the bugs asap, apparantly there is a problem with Nvidia and maybe more. other than that, from what  I have seen so far, which isn't much btw, I really like this game, I can see my self spending a lot of time playing this game. unfortunately I can't tell you more than this, at this moment at full price I do not recommend this game, and that is because of the bugs, if it where bug free then yes! this seems like a fantastic game. you should probably wait until the developers release some bug fixes, or there is a big chance you could be really disapointed. I am not sure if these bugs will affect everyone, maybe you are lucky, my graphics card is Nvidia quadro FX 880M. if you have a newer card then maybe you will be ok, but don't count on it because there are a lot of other reviewers complaining about graphics issues. so now you have been warned.if it where not for the bugs and crashes I would recommed this game 100% but not right now. I'm really disapointed, I so wanted to play this game :/ the updates better come soon!			"

												I really wanted it to be like ""Grand Ages:Rome"" (GAR) but medievil time. No one seems to mention this past title which I still play and for some odd reason they are compiring it to Banished/Civ 5. Unlike GAR you cannot place buildings and when you build/upgrade somehing the village just pops up remade under the build panel before you even close it, nothing gets build like in GAR and no options.  Infact hardly anything to build and the village just fills like a single tile that changes.  I am not sure this is a good idea and shame its missing so much compired to GAR.  I do like the map and trading, but it needs the level of detail seen in GAR as I wanted to be in command of what and where to build within my village area as this makes for a chalenge in GAR with limited resources and space and to be honest looks better. The trading looks fun but with only 20 item types to trade kinda boring as there is not much of a production line, feels to simple, I like the grandness of design with the map but I hate the simple design and operation of the village tile. This version mainly feels like a merchant trading game and not a civ building empire and there are better versions of merchant games out there and a lot cheaper.Based on what it could have been, what is and the lack of detail its no way worth £30, better getting Grand Ages:Rome.4/10			"

(like having wool and weavers in adjacent towns). If you liked Port Royale 3, Rise of Venice, or other such trading games, you'll love this game.If you're looking for Total War or some kind of military conquest game, go elsewhere.

												This is an awesome game. A lot of negative reviews are because people don't understand how to expand and trade. Everything is interconnected. The bigger your city, the more it consumes. You can't have 100 cities with 30 thousand population each. You have to balance your empire, and don't overextend it. However, people don't understand that, don't calculate resource consumption vs production, and their empire collapses.If you like resource management, deep tactical resource and logistics strategy, I highly recommend it.

												What this game is:A large scale city/empire management game focused on economy management.  You manage your cities' production levels, and the traders that trade between them.  Conduct diplomacy, and when that fails, war is always an option, albeit less interactive in engagement.What it is not:Total war, or any other similar nation building/warring game.  This is a unique, in depth economic management simulator!Should you get it?If you like managing cities, dealing with the economy, building europe from the ground up, conducting trade and diplomacy with simple combat features, this game is for you!Pros:-In depth economy management, manage trade routes, production levels, and product needs for your population.-Large world, untethered map means you can put your cities just about anywhere-Opportunity to expand with no limitations on numbers of town or territory you can control - no pesky vassals to worry about.Cons:-You have to micro-manage your traders and city production - to me this is a plus, but is seems many people don't like that-Limited combat.  Troops fight CK II/Knights of Honor style with little to no intervention needed.  I did notice that you can move them around, i.e. make your cavalry skirt the battle and engage the archers - I don't know how well this influences the outcome.-Failure to pay attention to monetary gains and losses will easily lead you into bankruptcyAll in all, this is a GREAT game.  Every negative reviewer on steam I have seen apparently does not understand the concepts of supply/demand, supply chains, or that this is an economy based game, not a military one.  So if you want military empire strategy games - go for Total war.  Want something new?  This game is for you! "

												The longer I play, the more I enjoy this game. The premise is similar to Civilization (and most other empire building games): you start with one small town, build the economy, settlers, armies, then spam cities across the map till you bury your opponents under the weight of your empire.  However, the gameplay is very different from most other games of this type. First, there is much less warfare. The barbarians are relatively passive, and do not constantly attack your cities. Also, armies are expensive, so you fight fewer wars with fewer units.   The biggest difference in Grand Ages compared to most empire games is the economic model. Grand Ages is primarily a trading game. There are 20 commodities you cities need, but  each city can only make 5, So trading is required. A large interlocking trade network is key to success. However most of your trading can be automated, so you don't constantly have to keep track of dozens of units like you do in many empire builders. I said I like this game the longer I play, because the economic system is so very different from other empire building games  and takes time to learn. In some games, once you get a few key technologies, your cities will earn obscene amounts of money. But in Grand Ages, the cost of production comes very close to equaling your income from sales. So building more factories to produce more goods is not always a good policy. You must balance production against demand. If you produce more than you can sell, prices will fall,  your production costs will be greater than your sales, and you quickly go bankrupt.  It takes practice to learn to only build businesses which have enough demand to support them. (I recommend watching some Utube videos dedicated to explaining the economy to help understand how this works.) One huge annoyance is that some of the most important charts on managing your economy and trade routes are buried under layers of screens. Read the forum and watch some videos to find these key charts.While they are great games, Civ, EU, and Total War have been around for decades, and I find the game play getting really stale. Grand Ages Medieval introduces what I find to be a fresh approach to empire building. My main gripes are with the poorly organized economic charts, and the very poorly optimized campaign game. I thought the campaign was supposed to introduce you to good gaming practices, but I learned more about  game play watching 30 minutes on Utube than in several hours of playing the campaign. The campaign progresses at a snails pace, and did more to hinder my understanding than help. I had to restart several times because my economy kept collapsing when I tried to followed the advice of the narrator. I would rate this game 8/10, and worth the price compared to similar games.			"

There is no real action. It is somewhat slow moving, time is ticking and can be sped up a bit, you get the picture. Don't buy if your're looking for something else. It has instructions that require complex thought. This is not for Total War fans. It is more like the Civ series in the battle area, with the ai conducting outcomes, but trading and city/empire expansions are way way more complex.			"

												At its core, Grand Ages Medieval is an empire building game. Found your own cities, and expand your empire through either peaceful negotiation, military means, or creating settlers.  Each city location has access to strategic resources, and it is up to you to decide what is produced in each city, based on those resources.Each city can manufacture up to 5 resources (out of 20), which are either consumed by your citizens, or used as trade with other cities.  Whilst trading is a big part of the game, it is more important that your citiznes in each city have access to a wide range of products to ensure prosperity.  Provide your cities with the goods they need, and your empire will flourish.  Fail to do this, and watch your empire crumble. The balancing act here is to ensure your cities produce a wide range of goods, and then establishing trade routes to pass goods through central hubs to ensure each city has a wide range of products available, and balancing production to ensure you have enough to meet demand, without creating excessive supply which can lead to financial hardships on higher difficulties. The campaign acts as a basic tutorial, and while it explains some game concepts very well, it completely ignores other key aspects of the game, and if you try to follow the story to the letter, it will probably lead to bankruptcy and frustration.  It took a couple of re-starts for me to finish the campaign, realizing what i did wrong and going back and doing things different to get through.The tech tree appears pretty basic, but depending on what your towns can produce, will depend on what order you unlock things.  Quite often, a manufacturing shortage can be solved by investing in a research that increases production, saving alot of money and resources building new manufacturing sites.  Also, depending on your starting region, will determine how your military progresses, as regions have basic units they can all produce, as well as units specific to different regions.The game also gives you a choice on what level you would like to micro manage your empire.. You can manually set your own trade routes, detailing exactly how much to buy and sell in each city on the route, or select auto to have the AI run it for you..  Whilst I am sure the AI does not run 100% efficiently, it does a pretty decent job of ensuring cities have what they need, as long as your hub has the resources to supply.  Overall I have really enjoyed the game.. I find it quite challenging to keep abreast of eveything, and finding the right balance is key.. Building 2 new sites in 1 city, could cause shortages of other goods in your empire, as the population growth leads to more demand for all goods..  It can be difficult to get into, but once you 'get it' I find it to be a fun game, and the devs have so far shown they listen to the community and respond, and are here to make the game better.			"

												Grand Ages: Medieval is a real-time strategy game from Gaming Minds. Lead your people and advance through the decades by utilising construction, research, expansion and conquest in an area extending from Scandinavia and North Africa; to Portugal, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Rise from the humble role of a simple mayor governing a small settlement and rule over all of Europe. Experience an exciting campaign with elaborately designed cut-scenes, play by your own rules in free play or test your skills in multiplayer against up to 8 players!At first I thought this game was like Total War cause of the World Map. But it is not an RTS game. It is a classical simulation. You can still create great armies but without propper economy you won't be able to maintain it.If you like to search for the best trading line or for the ultimate building space for your new city then this is your game.I really can recommend it to everyone who like games like Civ but don't want be a War Lord.

												I do enjoy game so far, petty much mostly forced on trading, planing where to set up a city and set city work on and forced on what to product to work with other city as team work, while this game isn't forced on military war, but they do had simple military/war, do had all basic sure as spearmen, swordmen, archer, knight but core is a  economics with well place town/city with wise choice what to product to work with other town/city. You don't had to use military to taken over city, I think you could buy town/city as well with trading stuff,  It's fun game! I don't think I see much of bug, just tiny bug there, but nothing major. I do recommend for player who love to do peaceful economics or don't mind had a war if they wish, but for player who love fighting all the time or major time but isn't interesting in economics planing might isn't for them.

												I make this review because some of my buddies asked me how is the game for me. I should say first that i didn't play it a long time so i probably pass through good points, but here is what i feel about it:The map is big, and doesn't seem to lag on my computer. So it's a good point.The economic system seems to work well, but it's hard (at less for me) and that's a good point too.You can't place buildings where you want or design castle like you want like in a Stronghold, it's more you choose the type of building like in a Total War, and the ai place it where it can. But i believe with the number of cities you can create/conquer and so manage, it may be necessary to do so.The Battles. I believe it's due to the system (real time on a big map) but, even with the rock paper scissor system with the types of units, battles look like big melees, i hardly manage something, you don't have any siege engine, you make the siege of a city with a timer to get it, it's less good than a Stronghold battle, and so far away of a Total War battle feeling.I don't regret to get this game, because i was waiting for it, but if you ask me because you are not sure, i don't recommend it. :/ "

												Game is not entirely what expected, I jumped right into the open game, however after reading alot of reviews went ahead and did the campaign.  The game is very obtruse, is nothing like EU4 or Civ 5, and is mainly a trading game (which is fine).  However, due to the trading system in the game, there is a very large learning curve, and since the game is centered around trading, you'll most likely find yourself scratching your head for a few hours before shelving it, the game has *much* potential in the future, but in it's current state I cannot recommend this game and requested a refund, I do have 4 hours played so I might not get that refund, but we'll see.

												Don't listen to all the naysayers, this game is actually great, if you play it for what it is. It's not a Civ game, it's not a City Building game, and it's not Total War. It is, however, a well done trading Sim game. In order for your faction to prosper and expend, you need to build an economy through trade. The sheer size of the world means you can trade your way to insanity before you run out of potential trade partners or room to expand to.  To expand your empire, you can build new cities and roads or shipyards for your traders to do their thing, you can annex existing cities through diplomacy (or more accurately, buy the Hell out of them), or conquering them. The military option is there, but it's extremely costly and in the end, not worth the effort probably until way later in the game than I'm at. I played the campaign a bit, but I didn't care for it. Instead I played Open games, which offer different maps and starting conditions so you can change things up a bit.Overall, a very decent game that is sadly underrated due to players expecting a different game than what it is. Negatives :-Somewhat repetitiveWhile the game does have pretty much unlimited replay value, at its core, it's all about building the right industries and sending the right goods to the right place so you're basically doing the same thing all the time : building industries and sending traders away. -Slow paceThere's not a lot of action going on.  Few events happen and I haven't had to fight anybody yet other than bandits and wild animals here and there. Positives : -Interesting economyThe game is based on your ability to play supply and demand, not overproduce, and build towns to complete industrial loops. Not as simple as it may sound.-PolishedSome people may say otherwise, but I have yet to run into a bug, or into anything that did not function as intended. No issue with Windows 10 and a Geforce 660 graphic card-UnrestrictiveWith the world being so large and mostly empty at first, you can essentially build and expand anywhere you want, which in turn affects your strategy. You can expand by building new cities, winning over existing cities through diplomacy, or conquering them (honestly, the last option is the least efficient)			"

												Grand Ages: Medieval is a decent game. It is first and foremost an economic simulator with war and diplomancy thrown in for good measure. You take the role of a small city cheifton and from there you manage your village into a city that trades with other towns/cities in the region. You expand your influence by settling more cities as your hometown grows. You have to be able to micromange your economy to be successful in this game, it is not a  build a base to destroy your enemies game. What it does accomplish very well is its level of detail and replayablity based on what region of the world you play in. As you explore there are different events that can help or hinder your fiefdom. Natural disasters, bandits and wild animals hinder your trade and kill your people. So maintaining a balance of defense and economic prosperity is absolutely crucial to your success. My only real compliant with this game and this can be easily fixed, is the map can be to large when playing the whole of Europe. you can literally go hours without seeing an other opponent. The game stops you from adding no more than 8 opponents on a giant map and adapts if you chose to regionalize, which is fine for most players, but if your looking for a small arena map with alot of opponetns, than this is going to dissapoint. The learning curve for Grand Ages is about 1-2 hours in my expereince learning how to trade properly can be fustrating but really rewarding if you take the time to read the prompts and consider the laws of supply and demand.Overall the game is pretty solid as it is more of a economic simulation that compares to Europa: Universials or Crusader Kings.

												This game from what I have seen so far is a very creative approach to an RTS game. I am kinda surprised that people are surprised by the way this game is developing. I have enjoyed GAR, Tropico 5 and Imperium Romanum and I am happy to add this one to my library. They have fixed the main issues that impacted me playing in the meantime and that deserves some credit. Having said that, the economy does need some tweaking to make it work better here and there . The tutorial/ campaign could stand to be more explicit in the hows and whys of economy building during the campaign if there isnt going to be more of a tutorial separate from the campaign. Learning how to build profitable trade routes are a challenge to figure out but not impossible. There is a lot of good stuff in there.- During the campaign, it seems no one wants to offer a trade alliance without a significant impact to your cash reserves a bit too early.  - Focus on building traders and carts according to trade capacity on each route and only get additional traders seemed to help me but for a game that is trade intense, there should be more about how to set the trade routes up effectively in the campaign.Video graphics are right on target for me and I really enjoy being able to still go in close and see the people doing different tasks. I also enjoy the seasons changing. Overall in this area I am happy with it. I enjoy the voice overs and would encourage you to do the same with the mission pop up dialogues during the campaign to further enhance the player experience. Bottom line, I like what they have done so far and I look forwars to seeing more. I am glad you won't be microcharging for additional content. I think the approach for future plans for a big expansion like tropico had are on target and look forward to playing more multiplayer too. :P Don't let the mixed reviews fool you, if you appreciate RTS and city building, you should add this to your library.

												Let me start by saying I thoroughly enjoy this game and do not regret spending the money on it but........unless they are planning on crusader kings 2 style updates patches further releases etc I think this game will always be a could of been a great rather than actually being a great game.It is a good game and I enjoy it a lot and the Campaign is engaging if a little repetitive once you get a long way into it. Music is lovely but sound effects are sometimes jarring especially if you zoom in on any battles; the battles themselves are simplistic but good enough as this is more about trading and empire building than Total War Combat. Essentially the enjoyment comes from building new cities watching them grow and flourish or fail depending on how well you have grasped the game. You have to trade between your cities and friendly neutral towns with different resources to allow expansion and population growth until finally you reach metropolis size. Some of the features such as the warehouse I'm not sure are functioning as intended and the better you do at the game the more you are punished for it in diplomatic relations. I.E if you have 100000 coins you will have to pay 10% for a friendship bribe with a neutral city but if you have 5000000 coins its 100000 coins........so a bit a poor game mechanics there but honestly once you have the hang of trading you don't miss even a million coins which is what it costs to buy the average city once you are friendly enough with it. My first game play on campaign was also exceptionally frustating as I hadnt gotten the hang of trading and I was 250000 in the red and unable to trade and couldnt get out of bleeding money and with only the auto save I had to start the campaign again from scratch as there is no re-do chapter button or staggered saving......you have been warned ;)The biggest problem with the game at the moment and possibly something they will hopefully rectify in the future is the lack of resources and building slots so once you have all the required resources built in a chain of cities you essential admire your work for a little while then build a settler and go do it all over again and this is not a bad thing I'm just saying once you have played it far enough into the game you will find yourself wanting more diversity. There are twenty different resources to manage so maybe they didnt want to overwhelm you at the start and getting to grips with it can leave you a little dazed and confused until you get the hang of trading.If you want a relaxing engaging game that requires strategy and planning then this is a game for you. If you are looking to get stressed and kill stuff then go play World of Tanks.I can understand certain negative comments as the balance at the start does seem a little well unbalanced. It is very difficult in the begining i.e one mistake with your economy and you go bankrupt; you get usually one peasant with a spear to defend your city/cities and can barely afford their upkeep but in comparison when you have I can't remember how many developed cities I have now in the campaign mode I earn around 100k everytime i touch the x10 button and have swordsmen cavalry coming out of my ears with so much cash floating around I just have nothing to do with it so yeah maybe eventually they will rebalance the game.It does have a steep learning curve but stick with it as its very rewarding. The help guide has typos and errors and I often couldnt find what I was looking for but I figured it out in the end; mainly in the start its just wanting to know what resources combine with what to make whatever and that is not very clear unless you hover over the icon in a certain menu.*Update*So having now logged over 30 hours of gameplay I am still enjoying the game and have found a few things out such as you can specify upkeep costs,troop costs, economy stability, disaster effects etc in a menu before you start a an open game but again I found this by accident rather than design and if only the developers pointed a big sign post to this menu it would wipe out half of the negative reviews right there. You know troop cost too much.......building upkeep too much etc etc. The truth is though having played it at the start I found all the complaints that everyone else has but having mastered it my little French Empire is swimming in gold.......I kept my finger on the space bar for the x10 effect, which you can set to on and off when you hit the space bar instead of holding it down.......another complaint by players and another missed sign post by the developers, and before I knew it I had 12 million coins. I wish a wall would appear around my city......hint hint development team. I do find it jarring that the game has been developed with consoles in mind as the controls are there and that is perhaps why it has a simplistic feel to it......after all P.C users are a more intelligent breed than the average button bashing console owner and probably 20 years older too.You can also broker treaties between the different factions and it actually works which is a nice touch. Usually games are very much about the A.I ganging up on you and you battle the world but in this I felt more like the U.N which was a cool feeling for a change.The A.I does however spread like a plague across the map and if you play it on the whole of Europe you are only allowed 7 opponents and there are erm 11 or 12 starting locations so yes you guessed it.......while you potter around building up the French Empire for example they have already expanded from Italy into the Balkans.....Spain........North Afrika.........and beyond which would easily be aleviated by allowing an oppenent in each starting location.For the game to last and to turn around the negative reviews it needs economic diversity based on location and of course more resources to trade meaningful upgrades and a tweaked combat system.Also I liked the whole puppet master feel you get when you are selling French Knights as was the case for me to two factions fighting on your borders and watching them slowly grind each other to dust with your mercenary troops.........their long suffering peasants naturally turned to me for salvation in the end and their empires collapsed slowly.Oh and who's idea was it to have a giant beaver as a statue???? I like beaver as much as the next man but a giant beaver statue.......Would I recommend you buy this game, no.Wait until it is on sale then purchase it.Do I think it could have been a great game, yes but for now I think its just good with room for improvement.*Update*Sadly I'm just simply bored with it now.......even with a good imagination you can only rinse and repeat so many times and there is simply no depth or lasting appeal to it. It has been a pretty dissapointing year for game releases in general. Oh well Total War: Warhammer to look forward to until them I will go back and play Crusader Kings II which has HUGE lasting appeal and depth and has over 600+ hours logged on it. Are P.C games just getting harder to make or are playtesters just getting worse?			"

												So far so good -- 1 hour into the main game and I'm not gouging my eyes out - so that's a thumbs upTutorial pretty decent - and refreshing after needing to refer to youtube for the last 3 indie games I bought...A nice blend of Medieval total War. Civ and something else (I don't know, I'm only one hour in...)update: 2hrs in and I'm running at a loss...20k in the hole and I'm in the tutorial part...geesh			"

												Nothing like Grand Ages: Rome, which is basically what I expected the game to be like. Very in depth global economy, which is not at all what I was looking for. I won't go so far as to say this is a bad game, but if you're looking for Grand Ages: Rome with a medieval theme, this is not even close. I get economics, I wanted to build a cool medieval town.			"

												This game is nice. I can't really tell what i enjoy about it, for the only things that come to my mind, while i write this, are the flaws/annoying things i notice.Such as the economy. Managing all the goods is fairly easy as soon as you understand the system and get a cycle of 4 cities together. But until you reach that point you have a very very annoying meantime, where your towns are still developing and growing.The combat has a weird feeling to me aswell... the circle is fullbut my troops are still in combat for ages... yes i know it means that my troops are outmanning the enemy by far, yet the fight seems to be endlessNegotiating with NPC mayors doesn't have a loot of benefit to me anymore. They don't send traders themselves it seems and i have to build my own buildings around their productions, so it's just easier for me to run over them with my army real quick and re-build the town from scratch. With the NPC players i didn't have to much contact yet.. just found the first one of them and yea...when i look at the scoreboard i am like ""♥♥♥♥ this guy, i dont need to trade with him""And why don't i need to trade with him? because i have all goods for myself already. That's a big issue i think, because it makes trade agreements really unnecessary. the only thing that differs from each nation is just the one empowered troop you can train there. So what i am missing are important ressources like in Civ V, that you just dont have like almost everywhere per default. I want to get something out of trade agreements, like importing goods that i just don't have in my own lands.  But this is just not the case, because there are no such important ressources and every 4 town cycle has all the needed goods almost guaranteed, if you used your brain while founding a new one.  Also this system doesn't really allow me to just go for one good that i want to produce, like make one town a freaking wepaon factory and sell those into the entire continent, while i import food and lumber from NPCs/players around meAnyways, as i said: I don't know why i like this game. You can see i only pointed out flaws, but yet i still play the game every day for a few hours.			"

YES its really fun building up your economy and seeing your empire grow.My point is that im trying to make is that you had a amazing idea but at  the wrong points, fot examble: Its medievel times so why dont we through in some fiction in like trolls,giants,orcs or evan werewolfs... people like that stuff( i dont really but i would still buy the game and ++++ PLUS++++  fiction lovers) add a better war consept and war lovers would also buy the game.SEE that im trying to tell you...i only bought your game for the trading part but if you put in war,fiction (OR maybe minigames....MAYBY!!! dont do it)deploymency,naval conqeust, ex. you will have a divercety of gamers buying your game...sorry for my spelling my english isnt the best...just remeber wat i told you...Thank you			"

												Cannot play the game as it crashes faithfully every time I launch a new campaign, within 30 seconds. Tried several different settings to no avail. Other users are reporting identical issues. Sent email to Kalypso support regarding the problem and still haven't heard a peep from them. Cannot recommend this game at all until this extremely common crash issue is fixed. If they don't fix it soon, I'll be opting straight for a refund. Which is a pity cos I was thoroughly looking forward to this game having seen footage of it from several Youtubers.All going well, I hope that the game can become playable in which case I will gladly re-review it then. But until that happens, there are too many people reporting the exact same crash issue therefore I urge others not to buy the game until then.			"

												I do not know why people feel the need to bash a game that they could not understand how to play even after the 50+ hours of youtube videos out there explaining the game is not like Grand Ages: Rome. Those complaining just have nothing better to do with their troll, basement dwelling, useless excuse for a life. I for one, and many other, are enjoying this game. It is a lot to learn but the campaign will teach you the basis. Trade is your friend and so is the manual. This is not a city builder, its a builder, trader, diplomacy, conquer, and all that. It is multifacet in its whole. I love this game.			"

												I would recommend this game to any Strategy lover. Grand Ages Medieval is challenging to manage your economy and yes, trade is a big factor in economics. But once you spend a few hours learning the mechanics, you will be on your way to understanding just how to stabilise trade and take out bandits and hostile invaders, including many wild animals disrupting your peaceful settlements. It is rather satisfying knowing that you or any other faction cannot steamroll their way through the game. Soon you will be able to conquer neutral or enemy settlements and explore the stunning map.Criticism >The game does require a few economic and military tweeks. As of writing this review, the first patches have just been released and I expect the Developers to continue improving the potential of the game...			"

												I was really looking forward to this one for a while now but after having played it I'm pretty disappointed.From the trailer videos you'd think this game was all about building a strong kingdom in the medieval ages and conquering your enemies.Instead it's simply a game about economy with no real combat or conquering. You buy and sell hoping to turn a profit somehow but in the time I spent with it not even my automated ai-controlled merchant could turn a profit.The combat is what I was looking forward to the most. I had thought that I'd get a nice economy going then conquer my enemies with pikes and bows but even that was a let down. You simply send your unit to attack the enemy unit and have no influence over the ""battle"" at all.To put it simply, sitting there tweaking a production & trade menu for hours on end just isn't my thing.

												Overall, this isn't necessarily a bad game, but it isn't the right game for me.I was really hoping that this would be more of a medieval city simulator. However, all of those aspects of the game that I'm into are completely autonomous. What I'm left with feels like a real-time version of Civilization. For some people, this may be exactly what they are looking for, but it simply doesn't have big appeal for me.A big part of the game seems to deal with trade. Ordinarily, I like trading games, but again many of the aspects that I like about trading games aren't here. I like more management in my game, while this feels a bit too casual for my tastes.For die-hard Civ fans, I'm sure you'll love it. If you wanted medieval-style SimCity, you won't find that here unfortunately.			"

												This game is horrible for anyone who is slightly OCD like myself and an avid fan of History.This is due to the city name generation when you build a city NO WHERE NEAR ITS LIVING COUNTERPART.If the game ever makes me build Paris off the Seine again I will scream.However I know that this will never happen as I fully intend on never playing it again.Like so many reviewers like myself, this game had so much potential but turned out to be ourPC master race worst enemy......a casual game.

												If this game was a meal it would be baked potato with nothing on it, microwaved with the skin taken off needs 10x speedThis game is fun for a short time, paid 9 pounds for this title and I would say that is a slightly generous price for such a short game. It runs fine havent had issues in that department it just seams you can have everything researched and built within a few hours. It would be a great browser game for a few years ago as for a steam game maybe not. Some people might enjoy it for a while but definetly limited replayability			"

												Nope, I understand it isn't an RTS were its kill kill kill war war war, but this is unbalanced to me, I've been in this one game for over an hour, have 4 settlements, and lots of trade going on, making a good amount of money, I build like 2 units in my gold went from 800k to 500k and is still droping... nope			"

												This game is amazing, and fun to play, if you know how to play, and have the patience that is required. I'm in love with it, and first had it on PlayStation, but immediately bought it for PC upon transition, don't make the hasty judgement to say that the game sucks, play around with it, enjoy it			"

												Nice game in case of Economystrategie but too expansive for that what it is and gives.There sure would be enought space for improvements in case of potential the game has.In case of Bugs and playability its since release absolute playable but the values was needed to balance more cause it was too hard even on low difficulty but thats fixed.If you want to buy this game you should wait till it will be for around 20€ cause if i would know everithing i know now about the game i wouldnt buy it for the actuall price (~45€).If they introduce some more content for free in a way it will be equal the price i will change my actual mind about it.Edit: ""Since the time i wrote the review nothing has changed (except fixes & balancing) that would be important to tell. My mind about the game now; if you really interested to buy this game look for else this game is waste of money. Why i changed my mind? Cause nothing changed and of course the publisher dont want to use the potential the game has so its a waste...""			"

												ok, first off this game has some buggs and issues that i will trust that will be fixxed soon, what ive run in to have been mostly graphical though i did run in to one that ended a game bucause a city was bugged and couldnt get or send goods.  prosthis game has many things it does fairly well it is a decent litle empire trade simulator that has fun little micro manegment the game looks greatthe game is what it says it is, a trading game with some combat in itconssome buggssome parts of the game are totally unballenced trade wisenot a lot of tools to help starting outthe trading is generally solid, many people have been complaining that its not a total war like battles or that the game is two hard and the campaine doesnt give you the ability to beat it ie. you cant get past certain points because you dont make enough money but from my playtime ive found that the campain isnt supposed to be rushed through and that you need to grow slowly actually building up an empire not just spaming hrough the levels/objectives and i tried to play like that at irst and failed terribly but it taught me a lot about gameplay and how to organize an empire in the game.all in all ill give it a 6/10 now and a 7/10 when they do bug fixesedit, ive still had issues with the game so i cant recomend			"

												One of my greatest delusions, right after Duke Nukem Forever. I can easily say that this game has NOTHING, NOTHING of what it tries to do, right and fair.Depth: none. After you play for 20 hours, it's over. You played through the whole game. Sure, it's easier for veterans, like me, of commerce simulators like Patrician, to play this game, but in the end after you learn how to play and what are the most important things to do, it's over. Not even like Patrician. Patrician wanted you to pinpoint manage structures. One city crumbles, other cities crumble. One city arises, others can, with your skill. But in the end? In the end here Random events do basically nothing. They are random, sure, but they come and pass and you don't even notice them. Trading: Probably the worst part. 20 resources. too few? too many?Patrician III has the same amountSureBut patrician expands on merely a quarter of this game! This game could be HUGE. If only, if only a subroutine for weapons, siege weapons, more detailed production charts... Instead, you basically set up an economy, trying to make the best of your cities, and In the end you copypaste your scheme over and over in the whole europe. Corn-fruit here, Brick-Wood here, Coal-Metal-Ironwork here, and so on, over and over and over again.Which is a pity because it could have been much more detailed, with many more things.BUTAnd there comes the WORST partIf they ever tried to do a thing like that it would have clashed with the trading system.Oh Gosh the trading systemManual Trading? Said no one ever. That's how you can summarise it.You will NEVER, EVER do manual trade. But the worst part is the AUTO TRADE systemthere is no way you can defend it. On one side, auto trade is everything you need. Connect 3-4 max 5 cities with the one  of spawn of your merchant. On the other, when you unlock the possibility to manually set the quantities and pricing of each thing, Suddenly you realise that it's WORTHLESS doing such, because you can't Autobuy in one city and manual sell in others. No. EITHER ALL ARE AUTO OR ALL ARE MANUAL. And MoreOver, there is no single digit customization. Pricing ranges only can go from 120% to 100% to 80%. And you are stuck without being able to actually doing a smarter trade because it's clunky.War system is uselessYea there are synergies between units. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THERE IS NO WAY 2000 TROOPS TAKE WEEKS TO KILL 100. Not realistic, not even cured. It looks like everything is based on Percentages. There are no siege weapons, either. Sieges are all a matter of how can pull the most troops around the city and keep them there. From the closest city. Regardless of the content of the city but only if the city is prospering or not.More, there is no use of having lots of troops. You will NEVER overwhelm the opponent. You will have to wait patiently that the percentages work and SLOWLY kill the enemy units. completely Nonsense. In the end this game need more work. More depth. You can't have 20 resources in a game which is 5-6 times larger than it's predecessors. I really look forward because the concepts are great, and I, regardless f what it said, really love this game.			"

												I'm not sure what people were looking for when playing this game.Grand Ages: Rome was part economy, part SimCity, part simplistic combat.  Medieval is hardly recognizable in the latter two respects.  Warfare is dealt with even more simplisticly, to the point where you have little control of your units once you've produced them.  SimCity has been replaced with SimWorld: you make new settlements on a Total War-esque map.  Your economical management skills are the prime focus of this game, while many other aspects have been simplified to accommodate that.Not a bad thing.Aside from an early crash, the game's run perfectly for me.  Polished, responsive, and streamlined.  Voicework is impressive.  Soundtrack suprasses the average.  It's a very good game.  I argue it's worth having a look at if you're into this genre.			"

												The game is completely disappointing garbage.It is about buying and and then selling and...that's it. Don't be fooled by the lovely castles screenshots - the real game itself is just ugly and messy. This is the last time I preorded something. "
