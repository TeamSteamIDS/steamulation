												Terrible.  I dislike the way the company that does Train Simulator (2014 as of this writing) does business and hoped to find an alternative to satisfy my love of simulations and trains.  I have been told several times that Trainz is the superior product anyway and that I should get it.  I have no idea what the people who said this to me were even thinking.The instructions are awful, essentially non-existent, so you need to try to figure out the interface yourself.  This is possible but takes time to navigate the proprietary lingo and general disorganization.    I somehow deleted (or it just disappeared) a section of the HUD that gave me info on upcoming speed limits, the grade of the track, etc., and I never got it back, making the game unplayable unless all you really want to do is try to derail everything.  The only online communities I could find for help were all geared toward content creation, which seems to be the only thing people really enjoy about this since, I suppose, they can charge unwitting suckers like myself for it.  The section of the official wiki dealing with driving the train doesn't even exist.  The ""manual"" tells you the keys for doing things, but this is very basic and covers none of the actual problems you'll face.The map?  You navigate it by right-clicking on individual points that are all buried in a massive amount of labeling, none of which tells you any information you might actually need until you've zoomed in so close you've lost all context.  You can't rotate it, but it will rotate on its on depending on the orietnation of your train.  There's no helpful color coding for cities vs. depots vs. any of the countless other things you need to find.  I am offended that this map even exists.Also, on modern computers (i7) with good graphics cards (GTX 660) -- the performance is worse than on Windows XP and an old Geforce 8600.  I mean, bad.  Textures won't load sometimes.  When they do, they load very slowly.  The game simply stops working for seconds at a time.  The whole experience was just awful, bad enough that I actually took the time to write this review after finally giving up.I could go into more detail, but no one would bother reading it anyway.  Suffice to say, I spent hours on this game just trying to do one scenario.  I got through it and immediately deleted the game.  I wish I could delete it from my memory.			"

												Pros:Trainz simulator 12 is a very great game that you can do lots of stuff like do some industry things like pick up coal and drop coal off and much more. The passenger system is great but the passengers just dissaper so thats a little bit disapointing. You get lots of trains and Coaches and that. The scenarios are fun because it takes 30 minutes or an hour to complete them so it should keep you very busy. Ever since N3V games made multiplayer, me and my friend did lots of scenarios together.Cons:Not a lot of maps to select which was dissapointing because in Trainz Simulator 2010 you get a big selection of maps and more mods + it had the LMS Flyingscotsman and the Mallard but in this version you dont get those.First class tickets for download station are expensive so I think its a rip off.You get very big lag spikes even though I have a high end PC so I had to turn off the shadows.                                                                          OverallOverall I think its still a great game. The price is right and you get a lot of dlcs so you should check them out.I think Trainz Simulator is better then Train Simulator 2015.Thanks for looking at my review :) "

												Despite the graphics engine the game is very good, cause of the variety of routes, vehicles (engines or not), very good HUD, easy to operate editor, tones of freeware and logical price payware.If you are train enthusiast you are going to love it, if you just like playing with simulators, its the best choice for sure and if you just like to play driving games compared to Train simulator 2014 it has lower quality graphics but way more routes, locomotives and the DCC mode (easy to operate mode, no hard times with the realistic things) and all of this without the DLCs, plus it is way more cheap than ts 2014 (DLCs).I strongly recommend this game!

												I hate trying to review ""mixed"" games.This game is good if your really into trains, setting up your own routes, playing multiplayer, or just wating time.Pro:MultiplayerScenariosSet up your own routesOften in bundles for under $5Go find the download stationCon:LAGMultiplayer can have very low (sub 20) frame rates on modern systemsNo steam cardsNo Workshop .... Seriously?  This is exactly the type of game the workshop was made forIf your not into trains big time it will be boring as hellVERY VERY CON:The price and the DLC price.OK so this game is 90%+ 2010 so the additional cost would be, relatively, minimal. The DLCs do cost to develop but we're talking almost $200 for everything (not on sale)This is a $15 -$20 game (half that if you have 2010) and the DLCs should be in the $5 to $10 range.I guess it's cheaper than setting up a H-O track in your basement, but still this is NOT a $200 game.Overall:If your into trains and don't have 2010 get the game when it's on sale and find the download station.Avoid if your actually paying full price.So thumbs up or down .... STEAM WE NEED A SIDEWAYS THUMB!Thumbs up, but only if your into trains and can get this on sale. "

												Can be amazing... when it works. Unfortunaly, a fun game and a powerful editor gets slapped with a terrible engine that will lag horribly ON THE MENU SCREEN. The amount of user-made content is pretty good; however in one of the most shameless cashgrabs I have seen, you are limited to a download speed of around 5 KB/s and a download limit of 100MB unless you pay up. Could be great, but in short, avoid.			"

												I have spent many hours happily playing this game, but I can't really recommend it as a ""game"" because of a couple things:1) Framerate, audio, entire application responsiveness takes a massive hit without severely limiting texture qualities and draw distance, making for a high cost to actually take advantage of the game's optimized graphics options.  Two upgraded computers later, I still have to cripple the draw distance and texture quality in order to play without the game regularly freezing up for a few seconds every time a bunch of new content needs to be drawn, such as when you pan the camera around.2) Included sessions (for which there are steam achievements) are often glitchy or tempermental in their willingness to aknowledge your progress.  A signal which should change automatically doesn't, resulting in you being unable to complete a session after investing an hour or more into it.  Or a session will suggest you are driving a long train, however you are only driving a locomotive with no actual stock attached.  Usually I like retail ""games"" to have more polish than this, and feel that this superb simulator is, unfortunately, not so superb a ""game"".Further dissuading me from pushing this game on my friends is the fact that the developer, n3v/auran, has now embarked on a kickstarter campaign to fund creation of the next revision of the Trainz series, ""Trainz: A New Era.""  I don't expect the glitches or engine to get any extra polish/performance at this point.That all said, however, I have enjoyed this game quite a bit since I got it.  The driving experience lets you choose often (in some sessions you are forced to use one or the other) whether to use DCC or CAB mode.  DCC seems to emulate an electric model railroad with a simple knob to control movement.  CAB mode attempts to emulate real railroads (I am not qualified to say how close it comes) by making the user interact with the reverser (forward/reverse/neutral), a range of throttle notches from -9 to 9, and, for when the engine is pulling cars and the e-brake won't cut it, a complex train brake where you cycle through initial -> lap -> application and watch the various brake pipe/cyl pressures adjust as they eventually bring the train to a stop.  The graphics can be nice, and seems many in-game objects have detailed dynamic behavior, from trees which have different graphics for each season, to train cars which have specific loading/unloading animations.  The content update hub is also a place for users to post their own content, and for other players to add it to their own collection, not unlike the steam workshop.  One can download locomotives, stock, scenery, routes, sessions, etc. which the community has uploaded simply by searching the interface and choosing to download it.  The system addresses revisions by content publishers in the community so that new revisions are included when other players with their content perform normal content updates.The game has a surveyor mode, where you can create your own train routes and sessions, laying out terrain, tracks, signals, scenery, triggers, session start/end points, etc..  I played with it a little, covering the wireframe ground with snow and a loop of track that had a switch leading off to a roundhouse, in which I had some community-provided engines.  I got distracted long before I created anything fancy.   As others have documented, building a world is a very time consuming process, and some people take months or years on works which they still consider incomplete.  While working on your route/session in surveyor mode, you can fire up driver mode to drive through your creation and test it out and have some fun.  If you are happy with the results, you can then publish them to the hub of community content.All in all, I think this game is a great sandbox, with some crazy demanding requirements for full graphics performance, and a handful of glitchy/buggy sessions.  While the community may continue to contribute content to the game, allowing content to continue to evolve, the engine is dated and not looking like it will ever have its performance-based frustrations addressed.  For the retail price, there are almost certainly more actively developed train simulator solutions.  If you already own it though, or it is on sale, you may get many hours of fun out of it.			"

												I love this game. It has some issues I would agree (not a real speed ""feel"", gameplay gets laggy on most maps no matter your hardware, ability to eat way to many hours), but it more than makes up for those issues and more with the surveryor alone (the surveryor is what they call the building overlay. You can play for six months with the content that comes with the game, and their are huge amounts of addon routes and cars and engines available on the download station through  auran.com. The longer you play with it the more you realize you could do with it. As an example I live in northern Mi (USA), and I have built myself most of the tracks in the state (excluding the upper peninsula). Then you find the download station and realize there are most routes and sessions than you could ever drive, ranging from beginner to simply evil in difficulty, and taking anywhere from a few minutes to a full day in drivetime. I am happy to have this game on steam where it kept up to date, common links all in one spot(again updated for me),  and is mine for the forseeable future no matter which computer I manage to kill. Oh and once you get a handle on how the portals work give me a shout. Drive right from your coal mine through a tunnel and come out where ever you want (other maps, turned around, different location on same map, community maps).Anyway I highly recommend this title even over the dovetail games title just released. From what I've read 2015 is a pretty much reskinned copy of this game anyway.			"

												I have been playing simualtors like these for many years, so here's my review:This game is Alright, it's very balanced in nature, quite flexible orders and rule system, while having a mid-range graphics capabilities, with very friendly, yet stupid AI system.The forums have been very good to me over the years.CMP is alright for keeping track of content, it is very friendly for the beginner for managing and sorting content, but it gets less and less flexible as your experiance grows.The thing I like most aobut CMP, would be its ""Content Creator Plus"", it gives you the tools to create content pretty nicely, CMP also sorts content for you into diferent catagoriesI do like the concept of CMP as a whole, but what I don't like, is the trainz database, if it gets corrupt, it has to do an ""Asset repair"", which fixs all of the descrepencies within the database, which is why I'd prefer Windows Explorer to do it, and trainz to just load the content in.The lack of beginner tutorials, espechially route creating / steam locomotive tutorials really doesn't help beginners get used to driving driving steam locomotives for the first time.Creating routes is hard without advanced DEM tools (Digitally Elevated Maps), which is sold seperately, so what you're left is oversimplified terrain tools, which doesn't really give enough flexibility when creating rotues.I'd much prefer an external tool handle DEM maps, such as L3DT.Creating routes using the default tools makes route creating tedious and it doesn't really give a realsitic feel when it comes to the finsihed product.The inability to create vertical structures using the default game grid restricts multiple players and forces them to build models which gives the effect.The 10M grid is way too low resolution, the 5M resolution is too big as well.Soo, I have to ask this, if trainz can support models which have so many polygons, why does trainz baseboards lag so badly with anything below 10 or even 5?I can almost guarrantee that the baseboards are going to be lower poly compared to rolling stock and locomotives.I bought this game because of the ""Multiplayer"" aspect of it, which everyone wanted since 2007, which, at the time, the thread had 800 replies to it, Unfortunitely, when multiplayer came out, all of the data was routed through Auran / N3V's servers, causing lag for practically everyone, which sort of continues today.Now you rarely ever see more then 5 players playing on multiplayer at a time, compared to the thousonds of people playing Garry's mod.It's a shame that multiplayer turned out to be less popular then anyone at the time would have anticipated.I admit, trainz isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, and it has its pros and cons, but I feel this game is okay. I'd recommend it for the beginners and seasoned players, because of its ease of use and the concept of the game is moderately easy to learn, but again, the lack of tutorials is a let down for the game.

												Following the purchase of Microsoft train simulator back in 2002 I have always gone out looking for other simulators (especially train simulators) so I can confidently say that I KNOW Trainz, from Trainz, Trainz 2004, Trainz 2006 and Trainz Classic UK. What is this game? = answer its bad, it’s a simple money sock soaking up the cash from every innocent customer. I mean really guys this is just bad... don’t even debate. Where do I even start?Firstly and this is my biggest point that drives me up the wall. This is NOT a new/newer game. By the use of clever branding and publishing your led to believe that this. OH WOW, IT’S A NEW TRAINZ!!! ... Well don’t get too excite sat at ye-oldie computer because it’s not. If you simply go into your “Rail yard” (which lists each loco/rolling stock for you to observe) you can see that 90% of the content, YET AGAIN has just been copied and pasted from the previous versions. I mean Big Boy ??. for crying out loud that was made for Trainz 2004 it looks a pile of A*** for one of the latest’s lines of train simulators.  Its laziness, pure and simple..However that being said, they have made some, and I mean some, new locos and stock that actually looks ok.The sounds are awful, again like the locos, sounds have been taken from the Trainz backlog of games. This game screams nothing but laziness, essentially what you looking at is trainz 2004 with mix and matches on certain locos and routes in truth. In terms of simulation there isn’t any,  well no more than some buttons that make you go forward and backwards, ok there is the complicated control system but its miles from simulated, it feels like someone who has a basic grasp of what things do and has just botched it together how he thinks is best.  So it’s not a great start is it?The menu and in game overlay/system is far far far complex than it needs to be, like seriously what was wrong with a button that just opened up individual trains to place, here you have got to go create a consist somewhere and then once that’s saved you can load it up in game, it is just stupid. Want to know something that amazed me? I find it amazing how a Post PS2 era game with the same level of graphical detail can run THIS badly!!, ¬ seriously. I can run Train Simulator 2015 on full graphics reaching about 20fps in lag spikes and running normally at about 35-40fpsthis game however runs like a slug, RUBBISH, I get 9fps at best, I turn down the graphics so it looks EVEN worse for very little improvement. The only thing worth crediting on this game is the first appearance of Train Simulation in Multiplayer...ok it’s a short lived compliment because you can only drive from one map unless you come off the game and fiddle around with the content manager thing to get more, the trains are already placed even if you’re a server host and this far complicated menu system just makes the whole experience even more un-enjoyable.  However when you finally do get set up it can be some full playing with friends. But again short lived, because every time a player joins the game will send you miles and mile away from your own train for no apparent reason and it’s a fiddle to find “where you once where”I got this cheap but even cheap feels expensive, I would pay at best £5 for this ....Out of curiosity I bought a bundle of 16 Trainz DLC the other day for £2.99 to try out.... and there amazingly rubbish.  Just avoid at all cost is my advice. In fact go play train simulator its better ;)  "

												==== TL;DR version ====I'd recommend this game with caveats IF you can get it cheaply during a sale or in a bundle.  I would feel a bit cheated by the lack of quality control if I'd paid full price. ==== Full review ====First, let's note the genre we're talking about here. This is a simulator, not a game as such; it's a bit like Flight Simulator in that if things are exciting, you're probably not doing very well. While it does have some less realistic modes, people who want a ""toy trains"" sort of game should probably look elsewhere.  However, if you want a taste of what it's like to take a mile-long freight train over Tehachapi Pass, using fully realistic cab controls, this is aimed solidly at you.The locomotives are carefully and lovingly detailed, both inside and out, and each have their own unique sounds and handling characteristics.  While I'm by no means a rivet counter, I found the physics of both the overall train and the locomotive itself to be well-modeled, or at very least plausible.  This goes for both the diesel-electrics and the steam engines, which are a physics challenge all on their own.The graphics feel dated; they're about what you'd expect of a big-budget game circa 2005.  They're certainly sufficient for the purpose, but I wouldn't play this game just to sightsee.  There's a nice mix of terrain and parts of the world, though, including the US, Britain, China, and Russia.  In spite of the relatively dated graphics, the game requires a fair bit of oomph to run.  Those whose gaming rigs are more than a few years old will find this game to be jittery.  There are also object and texture pop-up issues that can be distracting given the continual forward movement.Both the routes and driving sessions are essentially fan-created.  This is understandable considering the effort involved in modeling hundreds of miles of railway.  Unfortunately, though, this means the quality varies wildly.  Some sessions are particularly well done, especially on the ECML Kings Cross-Newcastle and Mojave Division routes.  Others are frustratingly buggy, sometimes to the point of being impossible to complete.I did not try any of the multiplayer features, so I can't comment on those.Overall this is a reasonably engaging simulator, and the non-buggy sessions provide a nice spread of challenges.  If you're the type who needs to complete EVERY achievment, though, the buggy ones will frustrate you.			"

												I recommend this game, but with serious caveats.  First of all, this is going to appeal to two very specific kinds of people:1. Those people who want to get into hyper-detailed train simulations.2. Those people who just like driving trains around, probably with their kids.I fall into the second camp, so I can't speak to the first camp at all.  I've spent my time with the game playing with my four year old son, just kind of driving around, trying not to exceed the speed limit, trying to stop at the stations, and looking at the scenery and inside the cars.The graphics are dated, but things like the skies and the countryside are beautiful in their way.  There is a sense of verisimilitude that I really like, and the fact that the trains are fully animated throughout all their pieces is a big plus.  I'm able to show my son various parts of trains up close while they're working, and he's gotten a much better sense of how trains work than through some other explanations or even riding on them (he loves trains).The controls are mildly awkward, the constant trouble with speeding or slowing too much is annoying, and the sense of speed of the train is... not very fast.  Slowing down is like stopping a truck full of bricks, it just doesn't want to happen.  Warning on when an actual platform that I care about is coming up would be nice, although via the map I was able to figure out more about it.If you disable Hardware Transform and Lighting or don't use DirectX, expect interminable lag as you pan around.  With those on, it was very smooth for me.We have yet to complete any of the runs, and don't really care.  We just hop into one and drive around, trying not to break the rules long enough that it will let us actually play.  I bought this on some sort of extreme discount, and at that price (maybe $5?) this was absolutely and positively worth it.  We've spent a couple of hours having a blast with it, and we'll likely spend several more.Would I play this on my own, without my son?  No.  I'd find it pretty frustrating if I was actually trying to complete goals.  But then again, I'm not squarely in the target audience for the adult side of this game.  Be sure and check out reviews from folks like that if you are.			"

												This game may look like a small overpriced piece of garbage at first.Many people get this game and tell people that it's just that.However, if people haven't realized it yet, you can click Content in the start up menu and you're greeted with thousands of custom assets, from british steam locomotives, to australian diesels, to american electric engines, to even fictional Mars monorails. That's not even the end of it, that's just the built-in download station. If you go onto the internet to download mods you'll be greeted with THOUSANDS of addons (including Thomas ones which are the main reason why I still play this game). Another feature people glance over is the surveyor option. Majority of people who get this game usually go into Driver mode and play some boring slow tram sim. However if you go into surveyor, you're able to go on any route you have and put any train on it (eg putting Thomas carrying an airplane on the tiniest train track ever) and do whatever. Plus there's the route creator, which lets you create your own little detailed railway. Or you can create a rollercoaster. Do whatever.TL;DR: my friend made john cena as a train 10/10			"

												This game is a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to when played the original game back when I was little and then again when TRS2006 came around. This time I managed to actually keep my key code and actually do some modding which has proven to be this game's strongest point. Without the community the library would be bland and unusable, with the already disappointing removal of region and type seperation. Over all though it is a great game that needs some optimization.

												Although this game does not have the best graphics compared to it's competitor, Train Simulator(Railworks), it is still a great game. It has a MAJOR advantage over the world/route builder mode. In Train Simulator 2014, the builder mode is pretty complex & complicated, as for Trainz Simulator 2012, it is fast & easy as well as fun. Also, one part that I enjoy in Trainz Simulator is the easy access to change junctions easily. It's a fun & easy game that I recommend due to it's easy world builder & simple controls.			"

Game looks quite similiar to Trainz Simulator 2004 (funny thing, my NVidia drivers detects TS2012 as TS2004) and works like S**T. The only thing you can do is to make a cfg that will tell the game to use more RAM memory, but that led my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad Y580) to hellish temperatures. Less maps than TS2004, less trains too. I see no point in buying it. Gladly got my copy from Bundle.			"

												Cons:After downloading the game, it seemed to take half and hour to launch the game after it was ""setting up assets"".  Once in game, it was extremely confusing and not clear on what needs to be done.  Took several minutes to jump through all sorts of hoops and perform dance rituals to get mutliplayer actually started after having to venture off to a website and signup/register cdkey.  Once in the multiplayer, we were able choose from a selection of WWII verterans with beards which appear to be ""photoshopped"" on using mspaint.  The in game graphics were nothing like what was displayed in pictures and controlling the train was far different than what was portrayed initially.  Everything looked like cardboard cutouts and yet still performed sluggishly on high-end systems.Pros: It had multiplayer.  Didn't require NAT rules or port forwarding to allow others to join the game.  When CTRL+Right Clicking trains, it gave the option to ""Run around train""... but my fatting/olding/bearding conductor merely stared out the window of the train in hopes for meaning in life.Overall:  Game did not last long.  There was no question for us to quit playing it immediately soon after we started.  I wish I could remove this game from my inventory and gift it to someone else as punishment.			"

												I would recommend this game but I can't. Reason why i can't is because 1. This game will lag the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out your computer. You need a good computer to run this. 2. It's like the other Trainz game, same old horns (some new) and If you remember the good ol DDA40X cab and the SD40 cab thing back then? Still here! 3.) Not that easy installing mods..... There is new and upgraded engines and rolling stock but all in all, its lags unless you have a GOOD PC.			"

												wow... where to begin. Well lets just make it easy...  compare screens from TS2014, or MSTS with those of this game, of the AEM7 engine... if you think that this game looks better, then seek help. Trainz plays like junk, its arcadish in its looks and lack of any real physics is just the final straw.. the Station is a mess - who wants to wade through that garbage to find things to enhance the game?  MSTS and RW (TS2014) have a huge following and massive community support thats easier to navigate than falling off a unicycle.. in short- stay away... far far away from this.			"

												I don't know what it is about the trainz series but it seems to keep getting worse, Less and less trains, more and more bugs.  (Nice graphics though)TIP - go buy an earlier trainz game like trainz 2004 or something and just download user content for more locos, routes and such.			"

												Trainz 12 is a big step up from Trainz 9+10. The graphics have been ramped up generally, and performance is better for me. They finally added some new content to this game, mostly ATSF deisels, but also a pair of SP deisels. There are two steam engines added in this game. However, many of the locomotives and cars in this game are basically taken from older Trainz games and thrown into this one without any updates, including at least one of the steamers. This game naturally is just OK, but downloading content SEVERELY improves this game. I'm not talking about Trainz content manager crap either (which, most of the time, does not support the things downloaded there in-game). I'm talking about stuff from the internet. Even though much of this is payware, there is also some freeware. I reccomend Jointed Rail as a good content website because it has alot of good freeware and a HUGE selection of payware, although I only use freeware because I'm not made of money.			"

												I picked up this game looking for an alternative to the buggy and poorly supported TS2014. Unfortunately Trainz 12 is a backwards step.The Big Issue:Graphics are bad. Doesn't look that good, and the graphics are very poorly optimised, so they cause graphical lag problems when they really shouldn't. The sound is not great either, feels contrived much of the time.The Rest:The DCC controls are for model train enthusiasts. I feel that as a computer game it would have been best suited to W <-> S for simpler controls. More complex controls do indeed follow an expanded version of that model, and have some level of satisfaction in their implementation.Gameplay is fine, exactly what you'd expect from a sim. I feel that there could be more creativity in this department, and that TS2014 does it slightly better.UI requires too many clicks. Simply changing camera angle takes a lot longer than it should. Probably because of graphical issues, clicking on the levers in full simulation mode doesn't always work.Ultimately one to avoid unless you get it free.			"

												>my current PC runs Doom 4, Overwatch and GTA V at a consistent 60FPS, high settings.>plays this game at 30-40FPS and constantly drops from there on low settingsI'll admit though that if you're a train enthusiast or just have an interest in trains in general, this game can be pretty fun. I like the trains, scenarios and routes to go on, plus there's even more good routes and trains to download from the download station and whatnot. If it was optimized better, I'd probably give it a higher rating, but as it is right now, I'd probably give it a 7/10. Worth checking out if it's onsale and you're into trains and whatnot, but even if you have a high end system, don't expect this game to run at a smooth, stable 60FPS.			"

												Okay, I must say that I gave this game a rather harsh, bias, unfair review the first time around.  I did not possess a computer with the same abilities as I do now, so I will give this review another shot!Now that I can play this game, I realize how wrong I was about it!  The game comes with a good selection of routes (alot of countries, unlike *cough*TS2015*cough*).  And, plus the routes, it comes with an absolutely astounding amount of locos and rollingstock.  The engines have pretty decent sounds, but alot of them share the same, but are easily changed like TS2015.  The rolling stock actualy has awesome track sounds, once again something that TS2015 does NOT have.Now, we roll around to the content for the game.  Using the Content Manager tool, you can download and install a RIDICULOUS amount of content.  Best of all, 99% of the content is ABSOLUTELY free.  The only thing I can complain about is the slow download speed of the content manager.The graphics for this game DO leave a little bit to be desired.  But, once again, I can not have them up on full, so I can't judge.  And, I lied the first time around, there IS an option to change screen res, but its a little wierd to find, and when I put it up to my compter's res, it lags like crazy.And lastly, this game posesses one thing that separate's the hypothetical ""boys from men"" in Train Simulation: MULTIPLAYER.  I personally have not used Multiplayer yet, but it opens up a range of opportunity that other games fail to give...Finally, this game is one of the better Train Simulators that I have played, and I would not hesitate to recommend this to friends, or anyone for that matter!*Note* does require a good computer with a decent processor to work!

I have 11 hours on record, and around 10 hours of that has been waiting for the game to actually respond.Crashes at least 60% of the time when just trying to load a route.  And then when it does run, the performance is so stuttery as to make it completely pointless.  Not enjoyable at all.So, unless they've got the required specs on this completely wrong and it actually requires a much more powerful PC to run than it states, this is a waste of time.			"

												Ok, so I have been playing the Trainz series for a while and I have come to the conclusion that I have wasted my time and money with this game. In hopes that the new version would come out and be better than the previous versions, I have been wrong EVERY time.I have a very powerful machine that can handle any game on the market. This game is not smooth on my machine at all. In fact it is nearly unplayable. I know for a fact I am not the only one experiencing this issue for the forums are littered with this issue.Now I do know that many of the routes are very intense graphic wise. But like I said, I KNOW my machine can handle it. But it still skips and stutters and even freezes.I am leaning towards Steam being the issue. I have experienced this issue mostly on steam. The steam versions of games are crap and are not worth the money. I am going to purchase this game (hopefully at a discount) off the traiz site directly and see if it is just the game itself. I will write a review on that version as well.My final thoughts are this. If you want to waste money with steam games, I obviously cannot stop you, but I can at least WARN you. You will get what you pay for and steam games are NOT worth your money. If it costs a little more directly from the game makers, I would recommend spending the extra cash. DO NOT get it from steam!!			"

												Honestly, let me start by saying , I'm a huge fan of sim games always have and always will be, but Trainz 2012 has got to be by far the biggest dissapointment thus far ( even bigger that Ea's sim city 5) At first I was excited to get back into the rail sim style game and found even less content than TS 10, the multiplayer is a joke only managed in a week to actually connect to one game..They get an additional $10 ( 9.64AUD) for the FCT which is the biggest croc I have seen to date given the pricepoint of the Game at 40.00 USD ( bassically you have to pay to get content DL speeds faster than 56k) The amount of bugs in this game is truley astonishing, rails seemingly appear in grass, clip through the terrain, cab interiors are bland feature-less and look like horrible representations of the real thing. I can say Auran should be ashamed to put this product out ( leave it to steam to push anything for a buck) All in all I give this a 2 out of 10 ( for at least one route worked, and was optimised properly)			"

Don't pick this one up for full price because it is NOT worth it. Also even if the graphics are kicked up all the way, it doesnt look that great. I want immersion in my simulators like euro truck.

												It does not work.!! It says I have played 78 minutes, but all I have done is restart the game about 25 times to watch it crash before getting even the first tutorial to start. What a waste of money. I have sent several crash reports to N3V. If I don't get a solution by tomorrow I will be uninstalling the game and steam. The only reason I joined steam was to get this game and all I have accomplished is to by a game that does not work and read steams policy that there are no refunds so I am done with steam tomorrow too.

												This is a great game for those who like trains and want make a model train set when they can not afford or don't have room for one.  It is even enjoyable to watch the trains make ""runs"" between locations and see what happens when they collide into each other.			"

The trains are good and the routes are Third Party. Still I believe that N3V can over take Railroad X. Good on you Australia for buying this game.Aussie Made "

												once in a while i like driving a virtual train and got this game, probably from a bundle years ago.However: the interface is a mess, the controls are non intuitive and most of the time i spend trying to figure out controls..practically no instructions, the help function isnt very usefull either.The forums online are almost exclusivly about content creationand the grinding achievements... to get all achievements you MUST play the game for at least 20.000 hours according to the description.i assume its ingame time, but still its nuts..Game performance is also rubbish: On a I7 6700k with 24GB ram and a R9 290 it still reacts very slow to any user interactions..

												I have mixed feelings about this game.  While I like the premise and the graphics are not too bad, I just don't think it is realistic enough for train fans.  Many of the things are far too simplistic.  I think that if you are into train games, go for Train Simulator instead.  It costs a little more, especially for the DLC packs, but I think it is a much more realistic and fun game.			"

												Well, where do i start? I had this game before I bought it on steam, but I lost the disk, then the data got lost when my computer went down. Then I thought to my self: ""Hey, there's Trainz 12 on steam, might as well buy it there so this won't happen again!"", and so I did. When i had this game before, there was no performance issues at all, even on my potato of a computer! I had the same thought that this would be the case w/ the steam version, in fact, it was worse.After installing it, I fixed it up the way it used to be, graphics settings, driver settings, everything to the way it used to be. I was ""Soo"" (Get it? no? k i'll keep typing...) happy to start the simulator up.... and then it started to stutter, HORIBBLY stutter! every signal, stutter, overspeed? stutter, activating a crossing that is out of view with atls? stutter!I looked it up, Google, Yahoo, even Bing couldn't find me reliable fixes! And thats not even the worst part!I'm going to paint a senario for you. so, your downloading files, no biggie right? but then, your power goes out! *gasp* i lost my data! AAAHHH! Then, power is restored, your computer shows that good old ""Windows didn't shut down correctly..."" you check your downloads, everything is good! Exept that one file that was downloading, now its corrupt, and you have to re download it.Now, think about that, but now your computer has to do a file restore, which takes 1-2.5 HOURS!     Thats pretty much what happens to me almost every time Trainz crashes for whatever reason. and when i go to boot up trainz, its always ""app failed to start, already running"" but it aint! task manager says nothing at all, and i have to restart my whole pc!Alright, in summary, if Trainz crashes, be prepared to wait forever, and hope that all your locos still run. oh and that stuttering that pisses you off? yea, nothing can fix that my friend.My rating?  Before i bought the steam version: 10/10 would work on the railroad all the live long day!Now: Steam version: 2/10 PLZ Dont crash, imma give you anything you want so you dont crash!Wouldnt recommend unless you can deal with Hours and HOURS of frustration...

The game is inferior, rubbish, not properly realistic, the cab not even moves according to basic physics and atop of that the game sucks. The editor is bunch of bull-sh*t, and the game feels like an arcade in Expert mode even. It is crap, but the utter crap.I highly doubt that N3V games will be able to make a proper train simulator game ever.			"

												Seemed the developers just went into lazy mode and instead reused the old game code form the previous releases. As a result, graphics are still dated, the atmosphere is just unrealastic (who in the world boards a freight train?), some maps that came with the game are incomplete, the rolling stock and the controls looked and felt mostly unreal, configuration for you train consist is just too confusing, broken and unreliable and the whole game is too laggy even on a high spec PC.Plus, the download server for the mods is broken and even if you managed to find one for this version, the would even ask you to pay for just a simple mod you could make and get it for free. The developers never bothered to look up into this issue. Even so, there are hardly any interesting mods for this version.Overall, game is barely playable. Still enjoyed and learned something from it at least. Buy it if it's for free. I'm hoping for a community made version of another train simulator that contains minimal bugs and glitches and the mods actually downloads and works and that the community is more active.			"

												I am saddened by the fact after my computer crashed, none of the DLC wants to work properly. I have the PRR T1 and Blue Comet DLCs and they are acting strangely. the T1 pack at first would have missing textures and now it won't even show up at all in the Railyard train viewer. The Blue Comet didn't even redownload after the crash and the game thinks I haven't even purchased it. Another problem with the game is that it runs poorly, even on high power systems, like 10 FPS. I'm amazed by the fact that this game managed to keep me entertained for over +300 hours, but now, it has lost all value to me. Going back to the poor performance, some levels wouldn't even want to load just because they were too detailed. This had a lot of potential to be a great simulator, but it ends up being mediocre at best. 3.5/10			"

												Do you like trains? No? WHAT IS YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PROBLEM? This game doesn't have trains. it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TRAINZ. That's right, with a Z instead of an S. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you better buckle up and pull some levers because you're in for a trip of a lifetime. Trainz Simulator 12 offers amazing and realistic train gameplay, with only some downsides. Still, it IS at its core a train simulator, and the fact that some of the more modern trains have emergency brakes that go off as soon as your train goes over a speed limit is only good to show that jackasses nowadays don't know how to drive a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ train with style. Still the vintage models and routes are still a lot of fun, and I have yet to try the multiplayer out due to FOUR HUNDRED UPDATES that download at automatic-brake-train speed. That's right. This game has so much content that it has to update FOUR HUNDRED times before you can play online. And you have to do it SLOW. The game is also so powerful it breaks every single time you quit.EDIT: Floydell. R. Iffy: everytime i go to look at how expensive the train sim dlcs are *often*Floydell. R.

After Installing the Game on Steam the Game needs up to 4 Hours to patch itself with an internal Manager, this Manager / Browser ""Download Station"" is a Pain to use. The Steam Version is older than the Digital Version on their Website. 25 € (with all DLC) thrown out of the Window.

												Having played many simulators in the past (several being other Trainz games) I find Trainz Simulator 12 to be quite a realistic simulator. The controls are intuitive (a bit of getting used to, but easy once you understand them). Most people who say that they can't play the game or that the tutorials are bad obviously haven't read the in-game messages. Every time something happens in game, a text box pops up to tell you. Unless you close every one of them as soon as they appear, the game explains how to do everything to the T. The tutorials take you from your first steps to driving freight across the rails in a very short amount of time due to the level of detail put into the explinations of how to do everything. Bottom line, whether you are a new Trainz player or a Rail-ridin' expert, you will most likely enjoy this game.NOTE! You will probably NOT enjoy this game if you intend to do a mission in 10 minutes. This game is a SIMULATOR. It is intended to be realistic right down to the amount of time it takes to do things. If you can't handle that, don't buy this game.			"

												This game is NOTHING like the trailer... This is probably close to the worst graphics engine I've ever seen... It almost looks like they went to downtown london and took pictures of the walls and photoshopped them into the game, and for the  people, they look like civil war era men taken out of the text book from school and pasted on badly shaped people. The Interface to load into the game looks bad. In the trailer is shows a smoothly running game with easy to use controls, but that is no where near what it is like... The game has a glitched curser that doesnt work right, and the controls are wacky at least. The game is slow and buggy, and visual glitches are all too common. I've played as much as I can handle and dont believe I'll ever play it again... It has potential, but I don't feel like playing in the magical cardboard box from spongebob...			"

I was so frustrated by the spikes and lag that I just didn't have the patience to play it for more than an hour.Perhaps if they do something about the ingame optimization, it could turn out pretty decent.

Fantastic simulator, but...Trainz Simulator 12 is a great simulator that will appeal to many train enthusiasts and the like, however, the game looks like total balls. Or at least it did on my laptop. I'm willing to admit that my laptop isn't the fastest thing on the block and it pales in comparison to the beacon of graphical wonderment it once was, but it should at least be able to play a game released in 2011 with 30fps. I couldn't even reach 20 with the settings set to the lowest they went. Which is a great shame for something that should've been all right as a time wasting distraction. There is great promise in its mechanics and how the trains handle, but utimately, I can't even look at this pile of trash. Because of that one flaw, I couldn't possibly recommend you hand over money for this. Why pay for something great if you can't make out whats going on? It's like buying Citizen Kane full price, and watching it without the TV on. Try the newer Train Simulator 2014 if you're looking to play a train simulator on Steam. Not sure how it is, but it can't be worse than this.3/10			"

												I have not played long on Trainz 12, but have previous versions of the game aswell.  This game has it's pro's and con's, but for a modern train simulator it is probably the best at the moment. It is surely going to get alot better when there new version from Kickstarter starts to come into the mix.Graphics wise i have to say i was fairly dissapointed, as i can run this on full settings and still not get anywhere near the quality shown in the videos and screenshots shown above. The world looks fairly bland and the cabs look flat and undetailed compared to Train Simulator 2014.But, and there is a big But!,Gameplay wise it does what is says. it is a Train game for Train people, it also adds a more arcade feel to the mix so new train simmers can find this game immersive without reading  5 manuals to get started. Unlike Train Simulator there are a wealth of free content from Trains, Routes, Scenery, Scenario's etc to download for free. And its all managed by a proper installer so you do not run into problems.The company seems more customer focused, there is little in the way of overpriced DLC. And the payware DLC available is reasonably priced.I have had to contact there customer service for a few issue's and they replied and sorted my problem out within a few hours, so i can say they do communicate with there customers in a positive way. Trainz is miles ahead of the current competition, and once the graphics are sorted ( in the pipeline ). They will have one of the best simulation games on the market.Pro's: Vast library of free content, Good Customer Service, Realistic DLC prices, Easy to install mods, Currently the most stable game for the genre. Backwards compatibility for old contentCon's: The graphics need to be improved			"

(maybe some chattering / birds/... when the train is at the station)5. the tutorial is not the easiest to follow.other than the above, i find this game pretty entertaining.would recommend it if you want to get into a train sim. (but of cos, you should get the latest version instead of this outdated one though.)			"

And H for horn? Meh, anyway... The load time first time starting up sucked. It had to load all the assets. Other than that, the graphics were slow to draw, and didn't impress me one bit.I'm going to stop here. The time I've played was the time I spent trying to figure out how to add a locomotive to begin.

												Good for simmers who do not expect any action while gaming :) I'm mostly a flight simmer and used MSTS in the past , tried the first TrainZ when it was launched . TrainZ 12 comes with a multiplayer functionality which will be good if you have ""simmer"" friends otherwise it will be useless .Graphics are good but the game performance itself is not in it's top form . With an 8 core cpu , 16 gigs ram and a 660 GTX gpu game still have performance issues like pauses during rides , long save and load times ...Anyway , if you are really a ""simmer"" this game will give you the feeling of riding the heavy metal on the rail .

												I picked this up, as I was intrigued to try a different Train Sim other than TS2014. I have a 4GB 770, I can run many modern demanding games on Max settings at well over 60fps without any trouble, yet this pile o'turd can't even reach 20fps, and it's on an old♥♥♥♥♥engine from the mid noughties using OpenGL. I know the graphics in this aren't meant to be pretty, but come on, the pop-in is horrible, even UT99 didn't have this kind of load-in! I noticed others have had trouble with this even on high end cards too. My advice is to get TS2014 (or stick with it if you already own it), don't waste £20 on this sh*te.			"

												Trainz 12 has something other up to date train sim's don't. A wide range User made add-ons which are able to provide maximum train simulation experience so you are able to personalize the train sim, MP ability, powerfull editor. The user made addons are extremely advanced, detailed and the sounds are captured well. Some may feel dis-couraged with this train sim because not all add-ons have the same quality in textures and advanced features. Due to the extreme quality of the user made add-ons some are not free but are much cheaper than Railworks's Addons, they do not feel like you're in it for the money. The Full Cab drivng mode  dose make provided a proper simulation experience as the dificulty is increased to real life. It's all down to the Content creators to put the time and effort into the routes, locomotives and rolling stock.			"

												Terrible game. Before I could play it it was updating some database for many long minutes, then it didn't started at all, but didn't close either. After manual restart it was updating the same database again. Then it started and after a minute or so it crashed the whole computer. After restart it was updating the same database again. After 2 hours I was finally able to play the game. I have completed the tutorials and tried to play one scenario. But even after many hours of trying I wasn't able to complete it. Because most of the time it is not absolutely clear what you are supposed to do. Even when you figure it out, often you are unable to do it, because some lights will just stay red no matter what you do. Sometimes when you give over the controls to the AI driver you are able to continue, sometimes not. Sometimes when you save the game and load it again you are able to continue, sometimes not. It is a complete lottery. After many hours I was almost able to complete the scenario, but I have lost all my patience already. Moreover the graphics is not very good and the performance is absolutely terrible. While the other Train Simulator (2016) game on Steam is also very far from being perfect, especially with its DLC policy but also because of other problems, it is in many aspects far superior to this game. Hence I am rather recommending that game for train fans over this one. I am not recommending this game at all, only if you have more patience than Buddha which I have not.			"

												it's a solid train sim that in some ways beats DTG TS20XX. First off its cheaper, on a good day you can get trainz 2012+ all its dlc for under $10. Also the freeware is a lot easier to find as most of it can be downloaded via the content manager. Yes DTG TS20XX has freeware floating out there but a lot of it still depends on payware to run unlike 90% o trainz freeware. I have downloaded many loco's and routes so far with little to no problem.on a site note one of my biggest cons with the game is the gated download speed of the content manager. it's a little more then $7 for a 30day pass for unlimited download but if your going to only get a loco here and there your better off just taking yor time with the gated speed.

Two Lack of mutiplayer Players..sounds like a given that a Multiplayer game would need Players to play it right???  Three ease of use...Not only do you have to Create or download these Sessions for use in multiplayer you have to UPDATE the assets within the sessions to the current version of the game to make sure its compatable, a feat that takes great effort and determination.  I give this game a 4 out of a possible 10 the single player is its only saving grace.			"

												Trainz has been an awesome game series for anyone that loves Trains, especially model trains.  There is tons of content available for download from the Download station (granted that you purchase a subscription through Auran / N3V).  The minimum listed system requirements seem seem to be a little misleading and don't really provide for acceptable performance, so those with aging CPUs and GPUs will have difficulty getting good performance out of this simulator.  I recommend only installing on systems that meet the recommended requirements not the minimum.			"

												Honestly this is my first REAL train simulator i have ever played and enjoyed. And this have proven it will not be my last. So much fun to be had in just playing this game i havent had for ages. First it scared me because i had no clue what to do. But after beating the tutorials i was certified ready train driver. I did loose many times but i did never give up. And it paid off.Anyway be ready to drive for hours. Some maps are massive and takes about 2-4hrs to complete. Lucky you can save and continue if want to do that. Anyway be sure to have loads of time over for you will be sitting there like me hooked for hours. and a wife nagging if you have that lol. :)Gfx 8-10 (The gfx on the tutorials was a mixed match and the interface ugly. But the rest of the game is top quality if you consider what the simulator engine must handle. Zoom out to map or zoom in to close up. The details are amazing on the trains and wagons. If there are something to complain about i think that some few trains could use some improvement inside driver cockpit. Overall its great so dont take me wrong. The landscapes are massive and does for the most part look amazing consider there HUGE size.)Sfx 9-10 (Cant complain here! The sound from the trains are so realistic made i got chills in my bones)Gameplay 10-10 (This game is just amazing with all details but still manageable by a beginner like me)Will i recommend it YES!!... Already bought the Train Simulator 2015 wich is a huge step forward. But i still think you should not leave this one out. Just one last note! This game requires quiet alot of your hardware so be ready to have a good cpu and gfx card. Memory wont hurt if you have more than 4gb. Me myself have 16gb of ram and Windows7 64bit, Cpu Intel i7 4770k, Gfx  MSi Geforce GTX 780 Gaming edition OC.			"

												Yes, I've played this game for like a few hours. Now, why don't I recommend it?Firstly, I'm not really into trains. Or driving them. It sure is interesting in ""real life"", but in a game it sucks. I've bought this game for one thing, and one thing only: The Editor.I've spent many hours just creating my own routes and scenarios, watching myself getting better after every map created was - and still is - a pretty nice joy. The content available for free on the DLS and the internet makes it even more fun creating routes, and the easy content creating makes it also easy creating your own things and then seeing it in-game and/or sharing with the community via DLS or the wide internet. But don't get muffed by the hours I've spent on this game: Since it's Steam-Bounded, Steam counts the hours where I was running Content Manager and downloading some DLS stuff - since DLS download sticks to a few kB/s if you don't pay extra. So at least the half of the time was just idling in Content Manager.If I like it so much, why do I don't recommend it?There was this patch - somewhen last year - that ruined the game. It added some useful functions but ruined the performance. Now it's laggy as hell. The graphics aren't that nice but since it was running just fine, it was forgiveable. Now it's running with up to 15 FPS on bigger maps and lag everytime you turn the camera. It isn't playable anymore.This is a Train Simulator, that sucks in physics, graphics, sound, controls, performance, but has good editor.Your choice			"

												Terrible game. Before I could play it it was updating some database for many long minutes, then it didn't started at all, but didn't close either. After manual restart it was updating the same database again. Then it started and after a minute or so it crashed the whole computer. After restart it was updating the same database again. After 2 hours I was finally able to play the game. I have completed the tutorials and tried to play one scenario. But even after many hours of trying I wasn't able to complete it. Because most of the time it is not absolutely clear what you are supposed to do. Even when you figure it out, often you are unable to do it, because some lights will just stay red no matter what you do. Sometimes when you give over the controls to the AI driver you are able to continue, sometimes not. Sometimes when you save the game and load it again you are able to continue, sometimes not. It is a complete lottery. After many hours I was almost able to complete the scenario, but I have lost all my patience already. Moreover the graphics is not very good and the performance is absolutely terrible. While the other Train Simulator (2016) game on Steam is also very far from being perfect, especially with its DLC policy but also because of other problems, it is in many aspects far superior to this game. Hence I am rather recommending that game for train fans over this one. I am not recommending this game at all, only if you have more patience than Buddha which I have not.			"

												Been playing Trainz since 2007 (way back to Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006).As the newest stable release (Trainz: A New Era Community Edition has been giving me grief because my graphics card is obsolete; thanks DirectX 11!), Trainz Simulator 12 has its pros and cons.PROS:*Great route selection*Nicely modeled locomotives and rolling stock*The Download Station cleanup has updated old favorites*The new features are all greatCONS:*No compatibility mode like in Trainz Simulator 2010, meaning that if it shows faulty in Content Manager, you can't use it unless you repair it or update to the TS12-compatible version (build 2.9, Trainz Simulator 2009, means the item will work in TS12); this actually stopped me from getting TS12 and staying with TS2010 SP3 until now*Content Manager still tends to freeze up (but if you ask me, it's not CM if it doesn't freeze up every once in a while; ah, memories)*Stability issues inherent to TrainzIf you're not into simulators, go play some casual train game like TrainStation on Facebook or TrainPlayer. If you like train simulators, don't go for Train Simulator (formerly RailWorks, nee Rail Simulator). Go for this less graphically-intense, sandbox-like masterpiece of Australian game-making.			"

												This game requires patience! The best way to learn the game is to immediatly go to ""create route"" option. Create a very small RR. Become familiar with all the options, SLOWLY. Use the help option OFTEN! Go to YouTube and see how others have created their RR's. I learnt more from this than anything. The game is fun using pre-existing routes, but creating yojur own RR is the best usage of the game.			"

												Despite the cool graphichs, new functions and such, this game is one of the worst TS games I've ever played. ""It have better graphic"", and even if I got 12 gb of graphic card the game keeps freezing or crashing every 5 seconds, which is quite painful if you want to edit or create your own route. About the community content, the Download Station is exactly the same from 2004 and still have the same problems: bad search options, thumbnails not loading, and sometimes most of the parts of a model are not available and you have to search on Google for them, otherwise the content will not work. The worst part? For downloading at high speed you have to PAY a ""ticket"", otherwise the download speed is atroucious. I strongly recommend the 2009 version.			"

												This Game Is Not Too Bad, it looks very realistic. Play The Trainz Version Of Train Simulator 12, Not The Other Guys Who Did A Peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. I Hate The Other Train Simulator, Because it is just slow and laggy and costs more.			"

												First train sim game. Having played about 30 hours learning how to operate the different trains and understanding the controls, finally starting to feel comfortable. It is overall a very good simulation. It feels amazing when you learn how to manipulate a powerful locomotive and start accomplishing objectives. Really satisfying sitting in the cab with the train humming along and watching the beautiful scenery go by.Couple negatives. The interface is really rough - sometimes finding where you need to go is a challenge in itself. Locations and points on the map are poorly labeled, sometimes they are written in other languages, so you have to spend time figuring that out. Also, some sessions lack defined objectives. Often you have to fish for alerts and messages which are necessary to proceed to the next point. And figuring out what some of the options do, huge headache. Click an option to see what it does and often you'll get no feedback to understand what happened. Hopefully, these items were addressed in future games although this edition seems to have been left as is. I'll give this game a 6.5/10. Really enjoyable but could have been so much better with some minor tweaks. For those that want to experience detailed a train sim, feel confident that this game is worth the time.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I really truly did, as it was a game I had on my wishlist for months if not years. So naturally, when the Winter sale came around, and I got some money, I went ahead and bought it, ignoring the reviews that discuss performance issues in regards to lag and stuttering in the game.Once it was done downloading I started it up and was actually excited to start driving trains around. That was until it had to update and download a few hundered thousand assets. ""Okay, it's a new game so I can understand it having to download some stuff."" It didn't take too long to do (5 minutes roughly) and then I was all set to go.First time starting it ran just fine however, the second time that I started it, I decided to check out the content manager to see what there was to download. So the content manager opens, and it works for about 5 minutes or so before it locks up. Naturally, I bring up task manager and close it down and wait for it to stop running on Steam to try again.Except it doesn't. I let it go for 15 minutes before force closing steam itself and restarting it.Needless to say, the 7 hours I have logged into this game are mostly issues with the content creator freezing up or the game having to delete and update assets. Very little of the time has been spent actually in game, which, once it's loaded in and works, I have no issues with at all, even in regards to performance issues.Overall, no I would not recommend this game as it is rather buggy in the curret version and it appears that it will stay this way as N3V has T:ANE to focus on.TL;DR - Spend money elsewhere because this game is full of bugs that don't even allow you to get to the game itself.

												I just wanted to be able to easily pick out a train, throw some cars behind it and drive around but after 2 hours of trying I gave up. I'm sad that I wasted my money on this game, it doesn't even let you pick a random train... you only get a few options. Avoid this game and find something better. I wish I could return it, what a shame.			"

												For anyone who loves trains and railways and wishes they could have a model train set that matches the scope of their imagination; this is the simulator for you.It's not without some major issues, from the complete lack of 'how too' in the world builder mode and terrible lag that can cripple maps (even on powerful rigs). The download station is a great resource for assets however the download cap of 4kb is pathetic (unless you're willing to pay!).If you can get past its many foibles it is a great tool to create the railway networks of your dreams, if you have the patience.
