												If you take a quick look at some of the screenshots you might think you’re dealing with an action adventure game here, but you’d be very wrong. See No Evil is actually an isometric puzzle game focused on sounds. No, this is not a rhythm game, but a game where you have to manipulate sounds in order to advance through the levels.The (rather vague) story of See No Evil takes you through several chapters, each chapter consisting of a good amount of levels that will test both your patience and intelligence. Like pretty much any puzzle game out there the game starts easy but progressively becomes harder. But, to be honest, there are some pretty easy levels later on as well (or easier, at least). So it has a nice mix of both. Great for the gamers that usually get stuck later when puzzles sometimes become too difficult to solve (like me). But it’s not so great for those that are looking to be challenged until the very end of a game. I do think the difficulty is a bit inconsistent here, because the game doesn’t need to throw easier levels at you in order to tell its story. Still, I appreciated the fact that it made things easier every now and then. After a hard day of work I don’t want to think too long about how to solve a certain puzzle.So, the game is based on sound manipulation so whenever your character moves pulsating circles can be seen at your feet. These circles mark a certain distance before anyone hears you; get too close to an enemy and he will hear you and finally start chasing you. But push a box in front of you and it will block a part of these sounds and because of it you can easily get past this same enemy. Later in the game horns are also introduced. Scream into one and the produced sounds will travel further. These horns are shaped like an L so if you rotate enough of them you can let the sounds travel around in circles, or other any way you want them to, until something (usually a row of blocks) stops it from continuing. There are even more things that you have to manipulate before you can continue; for example, snow leaves a trail so it’s recommended to walk around a few blocks so that you aren’t immediately noticed by an enemy. Switches also have to be used to solve puzzles, sometimes with blocks, other times without them. The later levels will combine all of these elements together to create deep and tough puzzles.Graphically the game looks pretty. It’s all made in 2D and the game itself has a somewhat dark atmosphere. But not too dark. There’s nothing twisted, freaky or creepy here, just some weird stuff. The main character reminded me a bit of the character from Bastion. This could just be a coincidence I guess. Anyway, everything is well animated and it all looks good. Your character does walk rather slow, though, and it’s one of my minor complaints. Speeding things up with a patch would only break the game so I know for a fact that it won’t be fixed and it’s not even game breaking, but it is slightly annoying if you ask me.The sounds effects are fairly basic, with some guns rattling and a whole lot of screaming. I must admit that I’ve heard more comforting sounds in my life, but these do fit the game’s style.The music on the other hand is quite good. Good but also repetitive.So far the game has taken me 3-4 hours to get where I am (I think I’m near the end of chapter 3) and since there are 4 chapters I guess it could take one roughly 5-7 hours to finish it, which is more than enough for a puzzle game these days. For the hardcore gamers the developer integrated New Game+. I only assume the game will mix puzzles up should you choose to do this, and maybe there are some extra puzzles in it as well, who knows ?See No Evil is a love it or hate it kind of game I think. But, this is usually true for most puzzle games. I for one enjoyed it (still am enjoying it actually) because it has a good mix of simple and complex puzzles and its mysterious story kept me intrigued up until where I am now. I will definitely finish this one soon, that’s for sure. If you enjoy puzzle games, even for just a little bit, then this is a game you should absolutely play. It can ‘easily’ be finished in one long sitting or in smaller sessions where you just finish a couple of levels each time. It doesn’t really matter; just take your time and enjoy the ride.[Rating: 77/100]			"

Great idea, unfortunately wasted.Soo i'll probably get a lot of hate because of this review, but whatever.Lets begin with what I actually LIKE about that game:  The story is interesting  Voice acting is great  Good, artsy, comic-like graphics  Amazing concept""So if you like so much why the negative review??""Don't worry, son. Here comes the juicy stuff:  You're really slow  Music, main protagonist's scream and sound in general are just painful  You can't see a whole level, so you have to move around to figure out a puzzle... Did I mention you're really slow?  The ""tips"" in titles are sometimes obvious, sometimes meaningless (at least for me)  JUST GRAB THE DAMN BOX!!!  WHY CAN'T YOU SCREAM THAT WAY YOU PIECE OF.......  STUPID HORN MOVE THIS WAY NOT THAT WAY!!  Frustrating  There's sometimes more than one way to finish a level... Because it's broken..  Walking animation sucks. i.e.: he just snaps instead of turning like a normal homo sapiens  Plays veeeeerryyy slowlyI expected something special, not just pressing buttons, moving boxes and avoiding stupid enemies. BUT OH WELL,  that is exactly what I got!(Future people - do not look at my playtime! I'll replay the whole thing one day, because I need these achievements..) "

												Man, this game is a must play.  The soundtrack is such a treat.  I love how everything I do generates the sound that threatens my life.  Danger, suspense, stealth, manipulation, and a deeper meaning expressing how we might be holding our eyes shut in our everyday life.   Wait until you see the colour green. It'll be the prettiest thing you have ever seen.			"

Initially Interesting concept that just fell short of being fun4/10Worth the price?:It plays to much like free flash games, just with better graphics, buy on sale.PROS:-Decent FX-Nice to see the leaves/paper move around when you walk by-Voice acting-Game logo is pretty-The cryptic and helpful level titlesCONS:-Puzzles feel very generic-The sound design and music are painful-Uninteresting Story-Plays very slowlyGoing into this game I was hoping for a fresh concept on this puzzle genre, unfortuantly it ended up being like all the rest, avoid the enemies, push some boxes, step on some buttons. See No Evil started out with me feeling immersed in the world and story and wanting to know more about this character I has taken control of, the feeling ended very quickly as the game just became what felt like generic puzzle room after room, losing the sense of adventure I had started out with. As far as difficulty, no level had me stumped, most people should have no issue with solving these puzzles especially if you have already played similar games. All in all this game just didnt meet expectation and ended up falling short, though I did only pay $0.54 so I truly have no reason to complain.			"

												I'll make this short and sweet. This game is fantastic. Very few games utilize sound as a game mechanic, and this one pulls it off perfectly. Your footsteps make noise and alert the baddies, your voice calls them in your direction. You should to manipulate the  puzzles. Simple premise that is rarely used and has so much potential and variety.The game controls very easily which leaves you to focus on the puzzles which will sometimes cause you to take a step back and think twice before entering into a level. The animation and art styles are unique and beautiful, and the puzzles are challenging but not rage quit inducing.Definitely worth every penny and I recommend everyone give this game a try at least once. No regrets here!			"

												There are a number of indie, puzzle games out there, most of them very similar in both concept and functionality. A lot of the time using a simple graphical style, with a mostly basic story-line and more often than not, reusing the same puzzles and mechanics. So what sets See No Evil apart from the endless stream of clones and failures.To begin with I’ll start by mentioning the fact that it’s not too dissimilar from a lot of games in the genre. The puzzles are somewhat familiar; pushing boxes, standing on switches all to reach the level’s exit. There is a bit of twist, however. Sound plays a very important part in the puzzles, in some more than others. Blind but dangerous enemies patrol some of the levels. If they hear your footsteps or your shouting they will hunt you down. Standing still can sometimes help you survive, but very rarely. This gives See No Evil a slight stealth feeling to it. Watching the enemies patrols and waiting for the right moment to move can feel very sneaky sneaky. You can distract them too with bell flowers or huge horns, allowing for you to tiptoe past while they check what’s going on. Some of the puzzles are quite complex and take time to think about before actually setting things into motion. Some blocks will lower when the matching pressure plate is pressed, which in turn can raise other blocks instead. Sometimes enemy patrols will prevent you from getting to where you need to be. There are a number of different obstacles to overcome in order to reach the exit, and as you progress through the game things gets tougher and a lot more complex. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphically the game has a charming, hand drawn style to it. Levels are mostly simple, with an obvious theme running through them. Whether its through a crumbling castle, a lush, green woodland or an abandoned factory the style is somewhat refreshing. As well as that, it’s not overly cluttered or distracting, allowing the player to easily see the sound indications as well as which objects can be interacted with and not.The sound effects are very clear as is the music. Each area has a different music track, which at times can get a little bit grating as it plays on a constant loop. But it has a somewhat retro or classic feel to it, along with most of the game for that matter. Even though the game has a dark and foreboding story running through it, the music almost lightens the mood. Talking of the story, you play as a Seer, whatever that is, and are guided by a journal left in your prison cell. You’re opposed by a group of blind evil doers that are afraid of what they don’t know. It’s not all that in-depth, to be fair, but it stops the game from feeling dry and emotionless, not to mention it helps with that feeling of progression. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lastly lets talk about the games mechanics. There are always small problems with indie games, when it comes down to mechanics. Sometimes they’re things not even worth mentioning. But there are some that affect a game in such a way that they can’t be overlooked. In See No Evil there are a small number of glaring mechanical problems. Interactions with certain object require the player to be in a particular spot for it to actually work, which can be frustrating when you might be against the clock or trying to avoid an enemy patrol. Alongside that, some of the walls seem to be made of glue as the player might find themselves getting stuck to said walls. This doesn’t count for every wall, infact I found it to be a rare occurrence, although it was a small annoyance when it did happen. Lastly it would be nice if the player were able to move even a smidgen faster. Moving about the levels seems to take a long time, a small sprint function or maybe just an increase in movement speed would be a welcome thing. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But, to conclude, I’d say See No Evil feels almost original in its ideas. The graphical style is pleasing to look at and the music is refreshing to boot. The story is lacking however, but I guess you can’t have everything. If you want a different angle on the indie, puzzle genre then See No Evil might be worth your time. Good Day!			"

 Keep your eyes closed. Going in, I really wanted to enjoy this game. The synopsis was fascinating, and the reviews were mostly positive. I somehow had it figured for the next Bastion. But after playing it, I can only picture See No Evil working as more of a free internet flash game than something I would pay actual money for. See No Evil is a puzzle game primarily, not the story-rich fable I had gone in expecting. A series of vague, proverbial journal entries from a book you find next to a dead man offer supposed clues to the puzzles you face in each room, and a female narrator occasionaly remarks on your journey as you progress from room to room. As far as I can tell, that is about the extent of See No Evil. The gameplay is unbalanced and frustrating. The music and sound design choices are strange, questionable and, at times, uninspired. For example, your character uses sound to navigate and activate parts of the puzzles. While this is an interesting concept, his scream (""Loh!"") gets old quite quickly. Simply adding a few variations of his scream could have alleviated this. An example of unbalanced gameplay is that your avatar moves much slower than your enemies, making them nigh on impossible to avoid when they detect you, and as soon as they do catch you, you must start the puzzle all over, regardless of the progress you may have made. The only checkpoints are at the start of the level. The puzzles, might I add, can become very tedious, and the prospect of starting one over after making a considerable dent in one does not appeal to me very much.Despite all this, I did enjoy the visual aesthetic of See no Evil--the style minded me of Bastion--and it did seem like there was an interesting story hidden in there somewhere. However, from a very early point this game failed to catch my attention or stroke my curiosity enough to overcome these shortcomings. All it has done thus far is frustrate, confuse, and dissapoint me, and for these reasons I cannot in good conscience recommend See No Evil. I shall continue to play, perhaps with the assistance of a walkthrough, but at this point I doubt my oppinion will change.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

Yes, sound plays a major part of this game as you try to work out ways to get past the guards and solve the levels. It's unique, different, and very challenging. If you like Stealth type games, the sound element offers this by the bucket load - Just saying! < I've always wanted to say that in a video game review!   ;)			"

												It's a puzzle game and it's NOT revolutionary. You manipulate the world around you by shouting to distract guards, push and pull objects to manipulate your shouts. Steam achievements are an essential addition, I wouldn't say it lives up to SOME of the reviews I've seen, I'm definately enjoying slowly progressing through the campaign and the puzzles are becoming more and more difficult, as you would expect. Other than that I really can't think of much else to say.. I guess the atmosphere is ok, I'm not getting the full benefit playing on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop though.The only controls I've come across so far is UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, SPACE BAR (SHOUT), E (PUSH/PULL) - nice and simpleNot sure if it's worth £10.99 to be brutally honest though - although still early daysIf you can get it on offer go for it			"

												This game is great (for indie puzzle), especially given that I bought it for nearly notning ($0.035).BUT:1) No subtitles?! Is it hard to make subtitles? It seems that the game have a deep philosophy, but Its difficult to understand by ear if english is not your best side;2) Small bugs and unfinished details (you have to reset a level sometimes, if you are unlucky or too curious);2.1) Bug with achievments (you cannot achieve some of them)3) A bit disturbing (for a PUZZLE game) music, but not so bad and pretty dynamic;4) Two or three levels, when you have to do stupid things (quick-clicking things)All the rest are good and worth it. Puzzles are varied and interesting, but, mostly, with only one solution available and may seem too easy. "

												Basically, See No Evil is a nice puzzle game with okay music and story and, which sold me, a clean, original and interesting art style - but a few things sour the experience.Hint: Restarting a level does not count as a death, probably since there are actually a few places where you can get stuck. Make use of that when going for ""no death"" chapters.+ Okay music+ Okay story with cool delivery of the end+ Great art style+ Two instances, Game and Game Plus0 Spikes sometimes walkable- Some invisible walls and edges- Some odd or inconsequent decisions regarding controls- Some achievements are brokenBasically, you play the Seer, a pretty literal description of the avatar and you try to escape a dystopian society, reminding me of 1984 and The Giver. In order to escape, the Seer needs to pass levels by solving mainly lever-based puzzles. Don't worry, there is a sufficient variety of ""levers"". At the beginning of levels you get encouraging and instructive text messages and discouraging voice messages, both vying for your attention and compliance. Those two types of messages well fit the background story.I really like the delivery at the end of the game, although the first time around I wasn't prepared for the end to come and couldn't completely enjoy the composition - well done.What made me play the game, apart from it being a puzzler, was the art style. It's clean and pretty, functional and decent. Congratulations on that.I did not quite catch when the second instance, ""Game Plus"", got activated. I guess it activates after the first playthrough and provides more levels as well as modified, read harder, versions of the levels in the first instance.The second instance makes ""no death"" runs a challenge, although I couldn't be bothered to go for the corresponding achievement since a few of them are broken and if I can't get them all I'm not too enthusiastic about getting any.Specifically achievements connected to the third chapters in both instances are broken. Each chapter 3 has one achievement for simple completion and one for ""no death"" run. Additionally, there is one achievement bound to a specific level and one OCD achievement - both of which can probably be earned in either instance (in theory). Of those six achievement I have earned all, with the possible exception of the OCD one, but I've been awarded only the level-specific one. By logic alone I should also have at least the simple completion achievements.There is a number of odd decisions in the game. I didn't like that the Seer needs to stand still to scream.Levels are presented in an isometric fashion with its horizontal axis corresponding to the screen's horizontal axis and its vertical axis being skewed a bit to the left. Yet, the Seer moves along screen axes or diagonal.The Seer has eight moving directions, less than enemies, and only four directions to look in, NSEW.I guess, the four looking directions come from the puzzle design and the moving directions got diagonal movement added so it doesn't feel like an '80s game. One problem here is correspondence of both type of directions. Looking up or down is favoured over right or left, so moving diagonal makes you look up or down. That makes the analogue stick too unreliable for puzzle elements requiring rather precise controls.So unless you are in sort of a binary puzzle element keep your thumb away from the analogue stick. The Seer only grabs boxes when grabbing after running into the box. Since the grab button is not used for something else I'd rather have it also grab when pressing the button first then running into the box.The double-horns, i.e. phonetic redirectors, have inconsistent turn mechanics. Depending on the Seer's position relative to a horn pressing, for example, left will turn the horn clockwise or counter-clockwise. It's the same rotation for standing left and right of the horn but the other one for standing above or below. Turning horns felt somewhat sticky, i.e. I often turned the horn involuntarily when I actually wanted to walk away.I encountered only two or three invisible walls but a lot more invisible edge, i.e. obstacles where the Seer wouldn't move on without any visual representation. This may be connected to the movement not quite fitting the view.Cutscenes are unskippable which might be just acceptable for the first time around but is irritating when repeated. There is not a lot of cutscenes, so that's not too much of a problem.The scream ability sometimes doesn't make it across switches.Despite the above, See No Evil is a good game and I recommend it for people who look for the next puzzler. I might come back and see if I can get the broken achievements.			"

												Like with many games, I bought this one because I liked the initial concept. This is a Puzzle-type game that utilizes soundwaves to advance in the game. The actual mechanics themselves are easy enough to understand, And nothing is really too difficult to work out without the puzzle being unfair.The only things I disliked about this game are a few instances where the actual solution doesn't act like it should, Or levels being possible to skip entirely. Overall I'd score it at a 6.5/10, It's rather short so I'd recommend you purchase during a sale.			"

												Unfinished, unpolished game. Several bugged achievements and a nice big crash when quiting the game. Maybe you are lucky and Alt + F4 works. Otherwise you have to restart. Great work. Beside that? Graphics are freaking scary. Our hero looks like a cartoonish LSD version of our beloved witcher Geralt. Musics are good, sounds are basically screams.Just don't buy it. Trust me.			"

												See no evil Review - Raymond KTSee No Evil is a ridiculously engaging, unconventional sound-based puzzler developed by a small team at Noetic Games that blends original and challenging gameplay with a thought-provoking premise. It just dropped on Steam for $15 after a successful Kickstarter campaign earlier this year, and sports a surprising amount of polish.Players are abruptly dropped into a discomforting alternate reality where humanity has sworn off sight and progress in favor of comfort and consistency. Voluntarily shutting their eyes, ostensibly for generations, the protagonist opens his when a body crashes through the roof. Belonging to another Seer, as the dissidents are known, the late individual’s journal is read, line by line, as players advance through the initial set of levels. He must use his newly-acquired sight to escape the dystopian realm.See No Evil is a dark, isometric puzzle game about sound manipulation. A harsh fantasy where the willingly blind are hostile to the nonconformist. Sometimes, the world seems darker with your eyes open. Unfinished, unpolished game. Several bugged achievements and a nice big crash when quiting the game. Maybe you are lucky and Alt + F4 works. Otherwise you have to restart. Great work. Beside that? Graphics are freaking scary. Our hero looks like a cartoonish LSD version of our beloved witcher Geralt. Musics are good, sounds are basically screams. "

												Liked the concept, but finished the game in less than four hours. Wouldn't recommend buying it, unless it is in a sale.Pro's:Awesome conceptGood storySome good mindteasers, but nothing too toughCons:Controls are a bit offAchievements are bugged (sometimes you get achievements without completing them, sometimes certain achievements don't trigger)Fixing the achievementswould make a 2nd playthrough more worth your while.

												5.5/10 The game is decent, and the soundwave mechanic isn't one i've come across before. It's not especially long but you're mostly working with the same puzzles over and over so if it were longer it would probably get boring. It has some decent brain teasers though, some of the puzzles will probably cause you to pause and think about them for a few minutes, the angles and the enemies both.The only real problem i have with it is that it becomes more and more heavy-handed with the metaphore and parables as the game goes on until the end when you're suddenly bombarded with some dude's ""deep"" slam-poem about how everyone needs to ""Open their eyes"" (subtle, right?). I'm really just here to play a puzzle game, we all get that the world's a shambles, i don't need a videogame to teach me that.As far as free content goes, this is a good quality, solid game. I would definitely recomend it if you've got an hour to kill here and there and you're on a budget.			"

												I cannot say enough good about the game.Pros:Thought-provoking concept and philosophyControls are taught by experimentation, not a tutorialRequires critical thinking and reasoning to get through puzzlesSeveral puzzles require coordination and setting up elements to go off simultaneouslyCreepy as hell antagonistsSuspenseful atmosphereCons:Some of the puzzles are REALLY HARDProtagonist is unable to run, which makes timing more difficultCan only scream in four cardinal directionsI love this game. I get scared and sucked into stories very easily, so just the idea of sneaking around and nearly getting caught because of the sound of my footsteps is enough to raise my heart rate a little bit. The narrator raises interesting questions about the world of the protagonist and the philosophy they live by, and on occasion makes me question my own philosophy. Introspection win right there! I've had no issues with the gameplay itself, very smooth. The art is reminiscent of dystopian novels and movies, everything is familiar (everyone has seen boardwalks, boxes, and flowers) but vaguely unsettling. The soundtrack is okay, it's not too fantastic to distract from the story, but not mediocre or repetitive enough for me to hate it.Having played with both the keyboard and the controller, I recommend the controller because it lets you run SIDEWAYS!
