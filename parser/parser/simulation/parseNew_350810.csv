												Ok once again a jigsaw puzzle game from  the Decaying Logic team.Positive changes from the others No stupid erase your progress Koi!You are not being seiged by zombies.Game now SAVES your progress. You place a piece right, it's there waiting in place the next time you play that puzzle.Negative changesYou can't kill/punch/mute that stupid fairy!Yes that's correct each version of this series has an anoying factor. This time it's a constantly chattering floating scientist fairy that micro fairy dusts you in small slow slow increments power ups. Hate her so much.  Cool changesNow you're going to have to rotate pieces. Adds wonderful chalenge to each puzzle.Basically  though there's a new game anoyance factor to go with the puzzle theme change. But at least now you don't have to restart a puzzle from the begining. It'll save your spot. BIG plus!Worth buying if you enjoy a good jigsaw puzzle.			"

												I was tempted to not recommend this based on the very irritating fairy swimming around your puzzle and interjecting obnoxious comments every thirty seconds or so.  Then I discovered that the fairy can be removed with the delete key and life was suddenly much better.  This does, unfortunately, also disable her hint functions, but since I personally wasn't interested in using hints (what's the point in that, it's a puzzle!), getting rid of the fairy was well worth the lack of hints.The game itself is a straightforward jigsaw puzzle set, with various piece counts and pictures.  The pieces do require rotation which adds some challenge that was absent from previous games in this series (I enjoy the other installments but they went much faster).So in the end, since I was able to disable the fairy from hell, I will recommend this for anyone who likes a good jigsaw.  However, if you do want to use the hint function attached to the fairy, bear in mind that you'll either have to listen to her prattle or you'll have to shut off the sound for the whole game (as there is no separate volume control for voice vs music/sound effects).

Short version: 43%If you like generic anime style pictures, you may like this entry in the Pixel Puzzle series. But, like in the other games, don’t expect any replay value over the pre-defined two dozen or so jigsaw pictures.Long version:One of the advantages—and at the same time, the main disadvantage—of the Pixel Puzzles series is that all games are essentially the same: you get a set amount of jigsaw puzzles with pre-set tile shapes and numbers, and that is it.The result is that each Pixel Puzzle game boils down to whether you like the theme of its pictures, which in our cases is anime style ones. (None of the pictures are from any actual anime, they are just decent-ish drawings.)The inherent problem with drawn pictures instead of photos in a jigsaw puzzle is that sometimes it is a lot more difficult to determine where a tile goes. In some of the pictures here, this goes to rather extremes; this never reaches frustrating levels, but the game feels like a step back from other entries.Also, as a final note: while the ambient music is not bad, I really advise to mute the game, because the overly enthusiastic fairy helper can get on one’s nerves rather fast.

												What is Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime?Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime is a strong contestant for the ""doesn't know the difference between anime and manga"" award. Other than that, it is a puzzle game. You are presented with 25 puzzles that range from 60 to 350 pieces each, with only one having 350 pieces. There is one assistant flying around giving you bubbles you can use for optional help.The graphics are fitting for a puzzle game, but the puzzle pictures sometimes, as you will know from the puzzles by a big German company ""Ravensburger"", if you ever laid them, make it difficult to see where you would want to fit tiles. This however is remedied by the gameplay (see below).The music is not disturbing and fitting for the theme, but the spoken words are annoying. In fact I shut the sound off completely after a while and heard podcasts while playing this, as I prefer to do with relaxing games. Your (fairy?) helper always tells things that are funny the first time but get annoying later. For example while she gives you energy bubbles (see below) she says ""This is because I love you"" and such nonsense. I'm not certain if this is aimed at cliché nerds with anime bedsheets or a parody of their hikikomori lifestyle, in either case it is an annoyance to me the third or fourth time, losing its fun to become a Navi-esque bother.The gameplay is where a puzzle game rises or falls. There are several aspects to be considered by a developer, and I think in this case they are well covered. At first there is progression: The levels can be progressed through on a grid. Progress within levels is - surprisingly, I must say after playing the previous game - saved even after exiting a puzzle. Great plus! I did not test if you can have multiple puzzles saved at the same time, but I assume so since I started others up in-between, although not laying any pieces there, and the developer says on the forum that every piece laid is saved.The second aspect is on the puzzle itself, the motifs. These are okay but repetitive. You usually see some kawaii guy or girl, rarely a couple, in front of some background. The third aspect is how you grab pieces. This is well executed in the entire series. Around the puzzle there is a basin filled with water (see the store page screenshots). You can take any piece at any time. If you want to save it for later, just lay it somewhere on the board. A propos ""laying on the board"" - if you lay a piece correctly rotated close to where it should be, it snaps in automatically and can't be accidentally removed. This is the same in the entire series, but worth mentioning. The fourth and final consideration is what to do if you get stuck. There are some optional hints which you can use. I never used any of them, so I can't say how they work, but from what I gathered you can see the board motif (which could be done outside the game in a gallery as well, but here you see it directly on the board) or show where a piece you hold belongs to. There are several other buttons but I didn't press any, as I said. Probably you can also change the background color of the cardboard you lay the puzzle on.The controls are easy: You only need a mouse, and once the space key to enter the main menu. This is actually annoying, as each time you want to play, all puzzles except one are accessed on the second screen only for which you need an additional click and spacebar press.So what is the length of the game? Assuming you take your time without resorting to any of the help features, you can realistically expect 15-25 hours of gameplay, depending on how good a puzzler you are. If you use the ingame help, this might be shorter, I can't say it since I did not test it.Would I recommend this game? Only to puzzle fans or such looking for a relaxing gameplay. If you need fast action, you're wrong here. If you want puzzles, you can grab this. While this is far from perfect, it is a game puzzle fans will enjoy - even if most likely with at least the speech turned off.			"

												if you like jigsaw puzzles you will love this game for sure.i enjoyed all 4 Pixel Puzzles games that they released so far, this one has the rotation feature same as the one in Pixel Puzzle Birds ( you have to rotate the piece to figure how and where it should be placed) which made the game harder than the first 2 and it will take more time to solve the puzzles, i really recommend them all to any jigsaw puzzles fan.i would suggest Putting your own music while playing.

""At least you can delete that annoying Fairy 10/10""PixelPuzzles Anime is another game from the PixelPuzzles series. It's still a nice and entertaining jigsaw puzzle game. But this time it has become a little bit harder. Puzzle pieces can now be rotated into four directions. So more possibilities to do it wrong. Thankfully there is a sidekick NPC that helps you with some powerups. Unfortunately it's ""Pixel Pixie"", a permanent blabbering fairy that drops you time by time some pixie dust into your powerup meter. So the game keeps being remarkable for that little devil.			"

												My first Pixel Puzzles game was Pixel Puzzles: Japan which I really played the heck out of. Perfect for someone who likes jigsaws but doesn't want half finished puzzles lying around the house. But Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime....ugh! I really regret buying this game. Firstly, unless I'm missing something, they have still not installed a save function. So unless you are certain you have enough time to finish a puzzle of several hundred pieces, don't start. Mostly though, I haven't met a ""helper"" I've hated more since the Microsoft Office paperclip. With constant jibberish like ""I know where that piece goes but I'm not gonna tell ya!"" the only answer is to turn all the sound off since there is no option to get rid of her or turn her annoying voice off. Not that losing the sound really matters as the soundtrack seems to want to turn doing a jigsaw into some sort of aciton platformer with it's stress inducing rushed melody. Anyhow, if you want a jigsaw puzzle game, for for the very zen Pixel Puzzles: Japan. Much MUCH less stressful. Because hey, if I wanted a game to stress me out, I'd play Dota2!			"

												Im not a huge anime fan, but I am into puzzle games and I generally enjoy them when I get some time to sit down to play them. When I got this one I was expecting it to be like the other Pixel Puzzle game that I had owned, but it had some different elements that I did like and some that I was not a fan of.I did enjoy how the snap to worked in this one, a lot more fluid and easier to get where the pieces go if your not completely sure which is big. The music was not terrible and there are plenty of puzzles to complete.My one big gripe with the game is the puzzle slices, generally the way a puzzle is cut up makes a huge difference and the way they are cut in this game is incredibly frustrating. The pieces are stringy and hard to tell where exactly they go, being that the colors are so bright and there isnt a huge amount of contrast on some of the puzzles so its hard to tell where exactly some of the pieces fit. When they are floating in the water though its hard to pick them.If you enjoy anime and puzzle games though id suggest giving it a shot.			"

												Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime belongs to a series of games focusing on jigsaw mechanics on a thematic. The previous ones are about Zombies, Japan or Birds. Here, you'll get images in an anime style - remember, anime is the term often used to describe cartoons from Japan.The goal is the same: unlock more complicated puzzles (more numbers, more shapes, etc..) and rebuild the picture. You can use bonus if you collected enough fairy dusts, like the right place of the piece, or the complete image shown for a few seconds. While the pieces are floating in a sort of water, they're not necessarily already in the right direction. I mean by that that you'll need to rotate them to find the exact fitting.I enjoyed the art as it was well drawn, like I've enjoyed the soundtrack. However, while I understand the pseudo-need of putting a fairy in the game, she was speaking too much with her screams or her reflexions. After a while, you just want to make her shut up because her voice is really really striking your nerves.True, it's a classic jigsaw game but every game in the series is bringing something different: Japan is probably the basic game, UndeadZ added more actions and Birds got a new menu and a new way to bring bonus. Anime is adding rotation and a character to guide you and to help you. However, I can understand those that can be bored by it, as it's a question also of patience. Some puzzles requires really time to be finished and once it's done, the satisfaction is great.Yeah, I recommend this one. I suppose that the fairy will annoy many of the players but don't let the game being reduced to that. It's still a good moment to pass. "

												Although my favorite game of the series was Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ this one wins hands down as the best in the series for the simple fact that it actually saves your progress (seriously, why was this not thought of sooner).  It also ups the challenge of having to rotate the pieces which I really liked. The worst thing about this game is the annoying fairy, but luckily you can remove her (just press delete). The other thing I didn't like very much was the crappy background music, I didn't think it was very calming for a puzzle game which I play to relax, but this is probably more of a matter of tastes than anything else. Overall a nice game for people who love puzzles and anime!			"

												Someone decided to turn their DeviantArt page into a puzzle, the game lacks 'charm' you are getting exactly what you pay for I suppose, it works. The chibi angel NEVER stops talking, NEVER.... Seriously every second it repeats the same 4 or 5 lines so play it on mute if you value your sanity. Do not buy this unless it comes in a bundle and even then.... it is not worth it so not recommended.The game also has a huge flaw in how puzzles work, all you need to do to win the game is pile all of the puzzles in a single spot and when you click to take a piece it will automatically grab the next piece in a left to right pattern so you do not need to find where the pieces go, just place them all one by one in rows, huge oversight.

												It's a jigsaw puzzle simulator, featuring the world's most unbelievably infuriating mascot.  The rules are fairly simple, and made simpler by the fact that the pieces ""snap into place"" even when there's no other pieces nearby to snap into.  This means you can blindly try pieces in all the locations until it fits... but since some of the puzzles have hundreds of ""slots"" to try, you're going to be blindly slapping around for hours if you try it.  Unfortunately, the oftentimes repeated patterns or large swaths of flat color, combined with the same piece ends repeated over and over result in blind guess-and-check play, like it or not.Also, the ""harder"" puzzles (although there's no lose condition, outside of getting bored and quitting,) have pieces that are at times downright TINY, and you're going to be staring at them for a while.  If your vision isn't so great, prepare for headaches and eye strain, beause we're talking about searching for straight edge pieces when the pieces are only about 12 pixels across to start with!There's a few ""pixel dust powers"" you get whenever the insufferable ""pixel pixie"" feels like giving you ""pixel dust"" (which is at random time intervals and randomly after placing a puzzle piece) that let you automatically rotate the piece to the correct spot, get to view what the picture is supposed to look like, or just tell you where that one individual piece goes, but they cost progressively more pixel dust for each one, and so it's usually best to just use it to get the (cheapest) right rotation on the indistinguishable background pieces, so you only have to blindly push it through every possible slot once, instead of once per possible rotation.I only got this game in a bundle, and would never have bought it specifically because the art is only mediocre, and the pixie mascot character is such a terrible Deviant Art monstrosity even BEFORE I heard her speak.  Move over, Navi, there's a new champion of annoyingly excited lines said a billion times.  Prepare for a fairy that will shout ""WOOHOO! YAY! YOU GOT THIS! THIS IS EASY! YAY! YOU GOT THIS! YOU GOT THIS!"" for every piece you place in puzzles that have hundreds of pieces.There IS a button (appropriately enough, delete,) that makes the annoying pixie go away, but it also means you give up your pixel dust powers, so you're stuck blindly moving your background pieces around until it snaps into place.  Ultimately, if you're someone who would like to make a jigsaw puzzle of anime characters, you're probably better served getting a real one, and sparing your nerves the annoyances of this game.  Then again, real ones cost more, so maybe you can consider this a discount puzzle game where you have to put up with the infuriating mascot as a pennance? Still, I can't imagine there aren't free browser games like this that don't have that horrible fairy in it.			"

												It was fun, really! specially the moving background, the limited color choice (trust me, it does makes a difference), I've done rotating puzzles before so I don't mind nor share all the complaints asking for it to be disabled.Guess if you want it really bad, it could have had an option to disable rotation (making it super easy!) disable moving/animated background or at least being able to select a plain less distracting one. It's ok.Fairy voice wasn't a problem for me nor the music &sfx as I just lowered the volume all the way down and listened the radio or some playlist, so I never got tired. Did left it on during a few puzzles so I could laugh of fairy's jokes. Still, beats the ""hey listen"" from Zelda, huh!

												Good puzzle game.You get presented the solved puzzle, the puzzle parts get randomized, floating outside the placing area, and the solved-/target-image fades out.The helper fairy is pretty annoying (but kind of fitting/consistent at least), and you can’t configure music and other audio volume separately either. You can disable the fariy though, with a keypress.When you get stuck, you have the option of letting the fairy help you with hints, for example where your current peace goes (you’ll have to figure out its rotation yourself).Contrary to a traditional (physical) puzzle, I found myself try-placing puzzle peaces, rather than only placing it on fitting positions. Especially since it snaps from pretty far away (a whole peace away) its a viable strategy.In the more complex puzzles, my strategy/workflow was:1. Try to remember key areas of the image (how many people, distinguishing color areas)2. Pull a lot of border bieces on the placing area as well as strong colors/structures3. Try-place the border pieces until it randomly snaps in place4. …5. Only for the harder/later pieces did I check for the connectors of pieces, which peace fits where (especially when they do not have structure you can locate them by)So it’s not how I would (have to) play a physical puzzle. But that’s ok.Good game.			"

												FYI this is NOT fanservice anime.The Pixel Puzzles 2 series (Anime, Birds, Space) certainly has improvements over their first 2 tries (Japan and Zombies). 25 puzzles (26 if you count the like 20 piece minigame)Pros:-Good afk time killer that you don't need to pay attention to-The pieces no longer are rotated to the correct position making this series a decent amount more difficult.-Decent powers that aren't 100% tied to dice roll of putting down the right piece to fill a bar. Now there are 3 powers 1- Correct rotation for piece 2- Ghost image 3- Show placement on board for current piece.-The ""puzzle moat"" where the pieces are is much improved in this series-It's a puzzle game you really should know what to expectCons:-Unplayable with sound. There is a ""helpful"" fairy that won't shut up and there is no options to disable so just turn off audio and put on whatever you like listening to since the sounds don't add much anyway.-Each puzzle only has X number of pieces you can't play any with different piece counts, same as the first series.IMO it's worth it on a sale. I play this afk at work so this is great as it never requires 100% of my attention.Edit: They apperently did update where you can press ""Delete"" and it will remove the fairy but the game does not tell you that, had to read it on a forum.Had ~25 hours when I finished all of the puzzles but that is time the game was open and not actual gameplay.

												Great puzzle game. Includes 25 anime themed puzzled. Number of pieces are between 60 and 350. In comparison with a previous game (Pixel Puzzles: Japan) they improved a lot of things. For example the floating pieces around your table don't get stucked anymore and the puzzle is saved on exit, but pieces on the table which are not on the correct spot get resettet.Another great improvement is the special abilities you can use (either show the original image, correct rotation or show correct spot). But the anime fairy which will grant you magic dust is very annoying after a while. You can disable her, but then you won't get any dust and can't use those special abilities. The HUD element showing your current dust meter yet remains.The big puzzle with 350 pieces was very hard, not because there were so many pieces and it took a while to get them all places, but the fact that you cannot zoom onto floating pieces. They were so small, my eyes hurt after a while.


So many pieces 
A Screenshot of Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime
By: Daerphen




Another ""eye-hurting""-feature comes with the background. In some images yellow is a very common color. Too bad when the pieces with yellow color a floating on a yellow background, making it very hard to see textures. Especially hard when pieces contain horizontal or vertical lines where another color starts and you think: ""oh yeah, an edge piece"", but after picking it up it turns out to be something from the middleFairy and dust meter are above the floating area, makes it hard to spot the right piece, when those are floating under it.Although there are still things I didn't like, I can recommend the game.

												This game....i don't know what to say... except it's disappointing. To be honest, i planned on enjoying this game. Unfortunately some of the features ruined it for me. What i like:+ It's anime, anime is always good+ Background music sounds nice+ It has a good amount of nice looking pictures+ And it's doable despite the weird looking tentacles on each puzzle pieces, which makes it look harder than it is.What i hate:- The super-duper wonderful, praiseworthy, and unquestionably annoying little fairy that just won't give me 10 seconds to relax. It was cute at first, but after a couple of minutes it's like listening to my little sister. Over and over and over...and over.... again. I can mute the game, but then what will be of use of the background music?- What can make the situation even worse? Answer: The ""wait until you have enough pixie dust in order to rotate"" feature is just absolutely excruciating. I can probably urge enough patience to listen to the fairy, but not enough to play with the fairy AND with this ""wait-to-rotate"" feature. That's just double the pain. Overall, the game just didn't do it for me. As the saying goes, nothing's perfect. Once you find the positives, you will also find the negatives. Sadly, for this game, the negatives overrides the positives. Except for the annoying fairy and especially, the wait-to-rotate features, everything else was good for me.			"

												Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime is one of 4 jigsaw puzzle games developed by Decaying Logic and published by KISS ltd. In this game you are presented by 25 different ""anime""puzzles ranging from 60 to 350 pieces, and you're assisted by an annoying ""fairy"" that throw on you some kind of dust that helps you to correct the rotation of the piece, show the location of it or to flash ghost the image which can be very VERY helpful in the big puzzles with +200 pieces. The developers have done a really great work with this game, the graphics are nice for it's genre, i don't know about the music because i muted it just after few minutes or so because of the annoying fairy .. just a friendly advice, please mute the sounds as i did .. because that little ****** will never shut up ^^ **the is an option to remove it, but you'll lose it's assistant (you know, the magic dust thing)** There is many new additions/features in this game:-now your progress are saved even after you quite the game! if you got bored or you've to go & do something else you can just quite & comeback later and continue.-you can rotate the pieces, which make the game more challenging, realistic and fun.-when you press T a try will show up in the bottom where you can put peaces and organize them, or just to save them for later or something.-you can zoom in/out the puzzle.-they fixed the annoying problem with the pieces, now even if you click it on the water it will stay in it's place (this is a note for the guys who played the japan game)-there is a gallery for all the puzzles pictures for anime lovers.The good things about the game (the things i wrote up there are compared to their old games, Pixel Puzzles: Japan to be precised):-nice & enjoyable puzzles with different difficulties-easy 100% & have trading cards-good controlling, much better than before-the game offer 15 to 25 hours of fun, depending on how you're good in solving puzzles & on your use of the fairy's help-probably you can run it on everything, doesn't require much space. probably you can run it on a potato with smooth 60 fps (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ  The bad:-repetitive music-of course the fairy, she can be cute for about 30 mins or so but i can't imaging myself listening to the same thing for 18 hours every 15-30 seconds .. if you know what i mean. But you can just mute the sounds, play your own music/watch YouTube and leave it running on the background or whatever. Overall, i give the game 7.7/10! recommended!			"

												While I liked Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ, I didn't care for the absurd minigame or playing zombie defense while I tried to solve a puzzle (to be fair, the zombie attacks are optional). PP2: Anime keeps it simple, and focuses entirely on the puzzles. That alone is enough for me to give it a strong recommendation. Yeah there's an annoying fairy and the music isn't particularly good, but that's easily dealt with. I got several hours of play, and cut into my prog rock backlog at the same time. ..... Wait ...really? I can't think of anything else to add to this review. I spent over 10 hours on this game! Usually I'd have some overlong diatribe lined up to pad things out, but I guess that ain't the case.Dammit!			"

												This game is terrible.  Not because it's just a jigsaw puzzle game.  I wouldn't have bothered getting or playing this at all if that were the case.  The issue is that pretty much every aspect of its design is flawed.  It plays background music in the form of a single track that loops endlessly, which is a harmless enough little tune, but gets tiring with no variety for any of the 25 puzzles the game has.  Thankfully you can mute it in the options menu, which you'll do if for no other reason than to shut up that stupid fairy.  Whoever programmed that in was a jackass.  The fairy talks way too much and says annoying things, taunting and harassing you constantly.  Even though you can make it go away as you work on the puzzle (which removes the ability to use hints), because at least somebody had a shred of common sense, it still bothers you in the menu screen.  I can go to the puzzle select screen and before five seconds have passed, it'll start bugging me to hurry up and pick one.  I could understand if I was just sitting there for a minute or two without choosing a puzzle or exiting out, but when I have barely had a chance to look at any of them it needs to shut up and leave me alone.As you work on the puzzles the pieces float around the edge of the board, constantly moving, which is really annoying.  It isn't helpful and it doesn't make the game more interesting, so why make them move around?  If nothing else let me turn that feature off so I can find pieces more easily.  The puzzle pieces snap to the correct spot on the board, if they're rotated the right way, but even if you have two pieces lined up properly, knowing they fit together, they will not connect unless you find their proper place on the board first.  That's really annoying when you find pieces that line up but aren't able to work out where they go on the board, meaning you have to use a hint to find out where one of them goes.Rotating the puzzle pieces can be annoying because in order to do so you have to hold the left mouse button down, selecting the piece, and then right click it.  If you aren't holding it with the left mouse button and right click on it, it gets flung back in with the other pieces around the edge.  I don't need a button that does that, as I can always easily drag a piece off of the board.  Instead, allow me to easily rotate each piece by simply right clicking while my cursor hovers over it.The pictures used for the puzzles aren't really interesting.  It just has people standing around in various environments.  There's no action or dynamism to what they're doing.  It could have involved pictures of combat, magic, slapstick, or anything happening, but that isn't what we got.  Many of the color palettes were quite aggravating as well, as they would use similar shades in multiple parts of the same image.  This wouldn't have been such a problem if you were allowed to reference the image of the puzzle whenever you wanted, but to do that you have to use one of your hints.  Why does reviewing the image require the use of a hint?  It doesn't help you place any of the puzzle pieces.  It's no different than just looking at the picture on the box and nobody would call that cheating or using a hint. This game is a great demonstration for why real-life jigsaw puzzles are better, as the biggest puzzle in this game is 350 pieces.  In real life, that would be a pretty small puzzle, but it's a nightmare to play on the computer.  The pieces are so small that it's very arduous to work on it.  The best puzzles were the smaller ones, making it feel like more of a punishment than a reward as you unlocked the larger ones.  To think that a 60 piece puzzle was even programmed into this game, when that wouldn't even be bothered with by a child over the age of 7, is a real testament to how poorly this game was implemented.I don't recommend this game at all and am honestly shocked it's reviewed so highly.  It's a puzzle to me.			"

												Nice puzzle games featuring very well drawn art~Nothing much to say but it's literally just puzzles you'd find on a free mini game site.All in all, it's nice to have a game like this on Steam; for trading cards. Badges. Records. Showcase etc etc...I have no concerns except.I wish the Fairy would through more glowing balls more regularly because waiting for the bar to go up so I can use the rotation is quite... Slow and degrades progress. It makes me do something in the background while I wait :<Can't really complain, it's all about patience- I guess I'm too used to fast paced games but oh well, I'd still play this game regardless how so it can be.Overall, 8/10 from me and yes I recommend this for a friend!

												If you're a fan of anime (and let's be honest, if you're looking at this game, there's a good chance you are) and are looking for a nice, simple way to challenge yourself and keep yourself occupied - you could do a lot worse than this game.There are a wide range of different puzzles/images, of varying sizes, which allows you to choose the difficulty level and challenge ahead of you.  Controls are simple - click and drag - and it allows you to ""snap"" in the pieces that are in the right place.   The system requirements are low enough that it ran without complaint on my aging laptop, too.If I had any negative comment, it would be that when you're doing one of the much larger puzzles (with many, many pieces) then it can be a little hard to select the piece you want, but it's a minor gripe.If you enjoy this, then there are other games in the series - they're all just as enjoyable, especially the Japan one.

												I checked this out as it was one of the few jigsaw pizzle type games on steam. Unfortunently a lot of severe annoyances prevented me from enjoyed it.First, having to continually hold the mouse button on the pieces I need to rotate it got rather tiresome on my fingers, the pieces floating around in the background made keeping track of them uncessarily difficult, and the lock in distance for the pices was huge, to the point where half the time I could just drop pieces on the board randomly in order to fit them in, negating any sense of accomplishment. I felt. The mascot fairy is annoying, though thankfulyl she can be turned off with the delete key. Also, not having cloud storage is really unforgivable for a game released in 2015.I could only recommend this if purchased as part of a bundle, and only then to people who really are desperate for a jigsaw fix.

												Okay, I'll say this once: I like the Pixel Puzzles series and thoroughly enjoyed the Japan and Undeadz flavours. The Anime installment brings piece rotation to the gameplay and a very vocal helper fairy. While the gameplay is fun yon 'helper' is almost as annoying as Navi from the Zelda series, constantly urging you to use the dust-powered powerups (iow cheats) or lavishly congratulating you for placing a single piece correctly.Honestly, a nice gimmick, but poorly executed. I would urge anyone to take this into consideration before buying this game. Hopefully a future update will allow you to turn her off or at least mellow the constant barrage of remarks flung your way. Beyond that, the puzzle images are kind of nice, including a few very cute ones.			"

												Every Pixel puzzle has been uniquely different and Anime is no different. this time you have to rotate the pieces to make them fit. Unlike Pixel Puzzle Japan, and Zombie games. Your progress is saved so you don't have to restart a puzzle you were working on when you quit the game. (Thank you Devs). The only thing I hate is the little fairy who never shuts up. Mute Please. I highly recommend Anime just turn the volume down so you won't have to hear the fairy. 10/10.			"

												Its a puzzle game where you find the pieces and put them into place.  I will recommend the game, but there are some annoying things to the game.There is only 1 sound slider so you have to put up with the music along with the sound effects or nothing at all.  The biggest annoyance of all is the fact that you can't turn the puzzle pieces without having some pixel dust or what ever its called.I found it far more effective to look for any pieces that are in the right direction and change any that were not, then drop out to the menu once out of the dust, and hop back into the puzzle to get a bunch of the needed rotation dust (this worked on the first puzzle not so far on the second puzzle), check for any pieces that might have turned to the right direction and turn 2 or 3 and then again hop out and hop back into the puzzle for the refill.  This way you could finish a puzzle in minutes instead of an hour for the small ones.And if I put pieces on the tray, even if I leave the game, they should stay on the tray.  I had it loaded up at one point dropped out to do something came back and all the pieces were gone... thats annoying.So out of 10 I would give this a 5.5.  If it was not for those 2 annoyances, I would give it a higher mark.			"

												Pixel Puzzles 2 Anime was a mistake, it's nothing but trash:* Annoying fairie character that won't shut up (but CAN be turned off, thankfully)* You now have a power meter that slowly fills up as you play or place pieces* Puzzle pieces can now show up rotated and you can't place them until you do so* Rotating a puzzle uses up your super meter* You run out of super meter really quickly.I WANT MY 25 CENTS BACK, GROUPEES!Edit: On the plus side, the devs finally added puzzle saving.

												Worse than the first one. Usually developers learn from their mistakes from their first game. Not here. They took a step back. If you play it, prepared to be annoyed. The opening menu is huge advertisement. This should warn you that the product is utter garbage. If we like your product, we will look for more. Just add another page to menu for more games from us or something like that. Controls and information is not clear. Can't change key mapping.  Pros and cons are listed below. One thing they finally did right was puzzles save now. Pros: It is a puzzle gameNow saves puzzles rotate pieces Cons:Big Ad opening the gamePictures are dull/boringAnnoying FairyFairy's uses improper grammar Power ups can be slow to receive Controls are not clear Lack of options in options menuStill can't piece together pieces that fit together and move as a set			"

												Might've given this game a positive review if it wasn't for the game being broken as ♥♥♥♥. While the art is very beautiful and well drawn the game doesn't save progress from time to time. Finished 9 puzzles in one sitting including a few of the pesky 220 ones. Closed the game, came back to find progress only saved the first 4 of those. And this wasn't the first time either. After first time I tried the game I returned to find that either nothing had saved or all my progress had been removed. And what about that fairy? Well, lets just say sometimes I wish to ducttape her mouth shut. Rather enjoyed the past installations but this is the worst one in the series yet. And that's coming from an otaku. I feel bad for my friend who decided they'd give me this.			"

												This game makes me want to die.I was gifted this game by a friend a week or so ago, and cringed when it popped up in my gifts tab. I thought to myself ""why would this kid spend ten dollars on a weeb game just to make me cringe a little bit?"" Unfortunately for me, ""a little bit"" was a huge understatement. I load up the game and am met with a extremely cringey transition, and the words ""PRESS SPACE TO PLAY"" appear on my screen. At this point, I could feel my organs begin to fail, but am kept alive by the fairly catchy beat of the song in the background. I push space, and the cringe hit me all at once.The catchy song turned into some f**king J-pop sh*t, and the title screen appears showing some anime girls with at least 90 lens flares in the picture. A high pitch voice tells me ""Welcome to Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime!"", and that's when I knew what had to be done.I ran downstairs, and quickly grabbed some bleach, and a half empty bottle of Antifreeze. I ran back upstairs into my kitchen, opened the cupboard, and grabbed a large Coca-Cola glass. I began to mix the Antifreeze and bleach together into a nice delicious beverage. The glass was about three-quarters of the way full when I stopped. I then reached down under the kitchen sink and pulled out a couple Cyanide tablets. I dropped them both into the mixture I had just created, and listened to them sizzle as they dissolved. Satisfied with my creation, I quickly ran to the fridge and grabbed a freshly bought Kiwi. I took a knife, cut the Kiwi in half, took the half slice, and cut it again. I put the quarter slice of Kiwi onto the side of the glass to add a nice decoration, and began to down the toxic mixture.I finished the glass, and I stood there surprised at the fact that I was still alive. In fact, I didn't feel sick at all. I was completely fine.But that's when things got way worse. I heard the voice again. ""Welcome to Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime!"" I wish that was all, but it kept repeating itself over and over. I then saw my walls change into the design of the title screen. I fell to the ground, blinded by all the lens flares in the picture, I was defeated.I am broken now. I sit here writing this review begging you not to play this game, and if you gift this to one of your poor, unsuspecting friends you are a terrible person. The voices won't stop.They never stop.			"

												this game sucks. The puzzle piece shapes are weird, and whoever thought of putting in that gay fairy is stupid. Whoever voiced that gay fairy probably eats cold, wet noodles for breakfast. The voice of the fairy makes me temporarily deaf, and the drawing of the fairy looks like the work of a second grader with severe down syndrome that can barely grasp a Crayola (crayon).			"

												Jigsaw puzzles are something I love to do when there's nothing to watch on tv, but when I saw this computer game puzzle I just couldnt put it down!The floating pecies just great and quiet a concpet. The only groan I have though is that there wasn't more and more than 1000 peices! The pictures for the puzzles where OK but something with a challenge would have been better. 7/10			"

												After a while you will be tempted to kill the fairy, especially if you leave the game open without selecting a puzzle to play (she's nagging), but overall it's a nice puzzle game.It's not timed, so can be played while relaxing, without having to think about trying to position pieces before time's out.

												This is actually a tough recommend for me... $10 is a bit much for 25 relatively small ""anime-themed"" puzzles.  (I used to do 1000 piece puzzles irl)  I'm not overly fond of the system they use.  Rather than ""Piece A fits in location A"", I prefer the ""Piece A connects to Piece B"" style of digital puzzles, though as long as you don't accidently fit a piece close to it's location when it's properly rotated, you can still somewhat play it like that, just without the connection.Long story short:All in all, I'd say get it at maybe 50-75%, and remember to shut off the fairy.

												Glad to see this series get better than better. The UI has gradually increased from being terrible to actually decent for ""Anime."" For once you can actually click on the pieces you want and can now rotate pieces as well. I found the art-work nice as well, with a good variety of colours that introduce different challenges. Unless you hate Anime for a reason, this is 100% the best ""Pixel Puzzles"" made so far. Highly recommended for people who like jigsaw puzzle games.			"

												Game is really good, puzzle are entertaining and the art is great. Except for one thing and everyone say it so of course I going to say it. THE FAIRY....she annoying but that is bad is that you can push delete to get rid of her however it take away your special and you can't use them for the whole puzzle.Pretty much it annoying nagging voice with use of special to help you on the puzzle or peaceful slient with no specials........reminds me of movie saw with the jigsaw killer......do you want to ears to bleed from listening to an annoying voice or get a headache from no help with the puzzle as you stare blankly at the screen think what to doMusic is pretty basic could be better but easy fix is just turn the music down in the game and open up your music player on your computer and now your able to relax as you puzzle out			"

												The game is entertaining. Reachable achievements and Steam Trading Cards kept me going. Overall good game if you like jigsaw puzzles. I got this game in a bundle of ~8 games for $2 or $3. For that price, it's worth it. However, I would not pay $10 for it. I would probably pay up to $5 for it so I recommend only buying it when it's on sale. Also, I want to punch the fairy in the face. Overall score: 9/10Edit: I just found out from another reviewer that you can kill the fairy by pressing delete while in a puzzle. I just raised the score from an 8/10 to a 9/10 because of this. I must have missed this when I first saw the controls because the fairy was yelling at me and said something like ""Hurry up and read this! We need to get started!"".Edit 2: WARNING! As I just found out, after killing the fairy, you will not get any pixie green goo power crap so you may not want to do it.			"

												Really liked this puzzle game, it's fun and the images are great (I like Anime)..I don't understand why some people seem to nag about needing dust for rotating the pieces, you don't need dust for rotating the pieces, you can just use the mousebutton for that. Yeah you need dust if you want it to automatically rotate to the correct position..Also some people seem to hate the imp, but you can just turn her off with <delete> (or use the option)..And there is a save function, if you leave the puzzle, and come back later, it's still as you left it, any loose pieces you left on the board are floating again, that's all.And the floating pieces makes the game more interesting, at least to me, it adds another dimension..The only thing I didn't like was not being able to hide the dust container on the left, as I didn't want to use it and it sometimes obscures some floating pieces..There is one thing I have to agree with, sometimes you only need to be almost a whole piece away from the correct spot and it'll click into that spot.. I would not have minded if there was an option to set the 'autolock' to a much smaller range..But all in all, it's a great puzzle game, and I wasn't even annoyed by the little imp, I even missed her when I accidently turned her off with <delete> and there is no way to restore her (until the next puzzle) if you pressed it accidentally..To be honest, I bought this game in a bundle with Pixel puzzle 2: birds (which I propably won't like as much due to the images) and some other games on indiegala for only 2 euro's..

												This is my 2nd Pixel Puzzles game, my first is the Japan-themed one. I have to say, I got exactly what I expected for a sequel to that game. I recommend it to anyone who likes jigsaw puzzles or has enjoyed a previous Pixel Puzzles game.Best Features:-	Really nice artwork featuring a good variety of anime art styles-	Helpful user interface for those who have trouble with puzzle games-	Enough puzzles to justify its price•	(Although, it's always better to just buy it on sale)-	Easy achievementsWorst Features:-	Subpar soundtrack •	(Just mute the game and listen to your own music)-	 The fairy who:•	Blocks your user interface•	Is needed to make the puzzle easier•	Has a really bad art style•	Will not be quiet for 10 seconds			"

The pictures are very beautiful, the trade cards are also cute, and the more pieces in the puzzle, the more thrill. Although I can't bear to see the annoying pixie. If you delete her, you can't get hints. 11/10 would recommend for trading cards and pictures.			"

TL;DReview: Typical jigsaw puzzle and not deviating much from any of the other Pixel Puzzle games in the franchise. It's not great but hey, it's a jigsaw puzzle. Can't expect too much from a jigsaw puzzle game.Defining feature: Floating Pixie that won't stop talking. May have to mute the game.Bugs: None encountered.Achievements: 100% completion possible in a single play-through.Final Verdict: 5/10The pieces float in water around the table frame for the puzzle. Holding them and right-clicking will rotate the pieces and they will click into place if let go near their correct location. There are three bonuses you can use (ghost image, correct rotation of piece, correct location of piece) to make it a little easier but is by no means required in order to solve these. There is also an option to show a small strip along the bottom to temporarily place pieces without them floating about so you can organize some by color and such before final placement.The main difference in Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime from the others in the franchise is that there's an anime pixie floating around when solving puzzles who is extremely hyper and will not stop talking. It can be considered cute and funny at first but that may end very quickly once you keep hearing the same lines on repeat (including one which is grammatically incorrect). It is not possible to disable the pixie and the lines can not be muted apart from muting the entire game. "

												While a lot of Puzzle games would have the common goal of putting the pieces together, if the developer started to integrate other means of effects, with a level-up or achievement system then it could be a masterpiece.

The tutorial is there, plus there's also adorable little blue-haired character who acts as our guide as well as adding some comedy and joy in our gameplay. ^_^ I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys some light-hearted puzzle game, but also seeks the challenge in completing all the levels and attaining every (steam) achievement.

												Took me 2 & a half hours to notice that I can rotate the pieces freely, instead of just using the ""Dust"" to rotate.7/10 just for me experiencing that waste of time I just did. I could've finished like 4/5 puzzles in that time.Anyways, the ""Fairy"" is really awesome and annoying at the same time. Plus Anime Puzzles... I had more fun doing the puzzles, once I figured out that I can rotate freely.			"

												Overall the game is good but features like the annoying♥♥♥♥♥fairy, the same music being looped and very ugly peices that hurts your brain to look at/solve makes the game terrible. This game should not cost more than $5 but funny enough it's nearly $10. Not worth it, just buy DLC for the other Pixel Puzzle games.			"

												Pixel Puzzles are very tedious - first it starts with only 60 pieces, but when you encounter 220+ pieces... everything is so small... and it takes a lot of time to find proper pieces (since you see very, extremly small piece).This part features very annoying talkative fairy.I only picked up this to get cards, to be honest. First time I played Japan part, it was cool, until very small pieces appeared.Edit: Generally idea is awesome, but, comparing to real life puzzles, at least there you can see the image you are supposed to make ALL the time.I forgot to mention, comparing to other parts, like Zombies/Japan, this one has some great features like saving progress of puzzle. Disabling fairy (that makes your dust income disabled).			"
