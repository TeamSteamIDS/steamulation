												""0.2/10"" According to My Own Rating.Fails to deliver what is promised in the game description. The only ""feature"" they promised and delivered was the intuitive control. The navigation is pretty much the default for 3d software.Incomplete. Not a work in progress. Not an early access. It's simply a pre-alpha quality release being sold as a final product. Typos, bugs, endless crashes. Not Steam quality standard. You can hire extra engineers, but can't get them to do anything. The development was aborted before that. You have a tooltip they call a tutorial on description. But it explains what they planned to develop, not what they actually did. You can sell your skyscraper. And sometimes you'll be able to buy it back for the original land value... and sell again for the skyscraper value... and repeat... If for some reason the game sells you two vehicles with the same name, your save file is wasted. the game will crash when you try to sell or move the vehicle or when the building process is over.For ages 6 and below. Not challenging. One of the only simulator games where anyone that can read will probably get everything right since the first attempt. If you sell your buildings, you'll get rich. If you rent them out, you'll get rich. You can just set the price to maximum and ensure maximum profits. Nothing to calculate, no need for operations research. Any building will sell for maximum price within one year. And you can't build a new one faster than that anyway... no need to hurry then. If you set the rent out price to the maximum, you'll get the maximum sale value every 4 years. You'll start slower, but will build up steady income faster (exponential income growth). You can use your steady income to ensure you won't run out of money when investing more than you have.As a matter of fact, your only job is to allocate workforce and machinery. Too bad that's about half a thousandth of the skyscraper building costs. In other words, you can fail pathetically and will still look successful.For some reason, you can rent out your skyscraper as soon as it's about 20% done constructing (60% total building time). That means you only need money enough for 60% of the building process. From that point on, the rent will give you more than you can possibly spend on its construction.No maps or modding. No scripting to fix their bugs. Simulators really need modding capabilities. Especially if the developers decide not to finish the game before (or after) selling.Only worth buying if it has a 98% off discount. The only two challenges in the game are:1 - Play for one hour without quitting out of boredom or having the game crash.2 - Try to have fun playing this. Your role is irrelevant. There is no real challenge.3 - Go bankrupt without intentionally cutting all your revenue streams.TL;DR: the official game screenshots will bring you more challenge and fun than the actual game. They've worked harder on them than the development.			"

												This game is just terrible. I don't know what I expected, but it wouldn't even be a fun flash game. Basically skyscraper construction on rails. You control how much construction equipment you own and how many people you hire and not much else. And this determines only how quickly you finish building. And that's the whole game.			"

												What a total waste of money!  I love building sims.  I saw this in the store... checked out youtube  - looked interesting so i bot it.  Guess what - it wasn't the same game with the same name I looked at on Youtube.  This is a one dimensional game where you select workers... wait wait... select workers... wait... wait... get the picture?  Oh and I thought I would be able to choose different building types to build - dummy me.  Two hours of playtime and uninstalled in boredom.			"

												Complete disappointment.  Please watch gameplay videos of Skyscraper Simulator before any attempt to buy. There is very little interactive gameplay:1. Start with a set amount of money.2. Purchase an affordable piece of land.3. Choose desired size/shape of building to be built.4. Buy construction equipment5. Tell “crew” to start building phase one.6. Wait…7. Tell “crew” to start building phase two.8. Wait…9. Tell “crew” to start building phase three.10. Wait…11. Sell construction equipment.12. Decide between selling new building/property or renting it out.13. Repeat.*Since the developer, United Independent Entertainment GmbH, feels the continued need to keep making their horrible “simulator” games, I feel the need to start writing reviews about their games. My hope is to prevent people from wasting their money. "

												This might be my shortest-ever review...This might be a game you'll enjoy if: You enjoy watching nothing happening at various different speeds of play Appreciate the novelty of trucks bouncing back and forth but nothing else happening You find 10 workers needed to drive a cement truck is feasible Watching paint dry is your ultimate hobby.However, you shouldn't buy it if: You were hoping for a fun tycoon game You expect a more modern take of Sim Tower You like FUN!Redeeming feature: lightning fast performance of the uninstall routine.  That at least pleased me.  It's a shame.  This could have been a good game!  Won't someone somewhere give us a modern-day Sim Tower yet?!tl;dr: ""Move along folks, there's nothing to see here."" "

												I bought this game to play with my 6 year old son, who loves construction vehicles and skyscrapers, and it's easy enough for him to play on his own. What little gameplay exists is very simple and repetitive; there is no escalation of difficulty at all, and hardly any variety. You're pretty much just going to watch skyscraper after skyscraper being built. It seems like there's potential  for a much better game based on what's here, but as it is this doesn't feel complete. Still my son did get a kick out of it, so maybe a recommendation if you have small kids who love construction vehicles, but otherwise this just isn't a very good game.			"

												This is a bizarre ""game.""  The only gameplay seems to be hiring and allocating workers to the various construction tasks--then waiting for the current stage of building to complete.  Whether or not you do this well doesn't seem to matter too much; the building will eventually be constructed, and you can sell it for plenty of cash. There's no meaningful strategy to the thing and it's just not any fun.  Stay away!			"

												So I got this in one of those crazy bundles where you get about 15 games for 50p or something. I am not sure it is worth 3.33p even. Wow. This is made by the same people that made the narcolepsy inducing Airport Simulator 2014, a game where you drive vehicles around an airport. So what do you think Skyscraper Simulator is all about? Driving vehicles around a construction site. Except you can automate the driving this time around, wonders will never cease. You start off with $40m Euro and buy a plot of land in New York. You'd think they'd be after dollars, but who am I to query the knowledge of these master game developers. Then you buy a couple of vehicles, so far so good. The vehicles have super weird randomly generated names like ""Doleful Elizabeth"" or ""Freaky Dylan"". Bewildering. Then you hire some employees. Some of them might take weeks to turn up, whilst your digger is sitting there doing nothing. Great. Eventually they turn up. Now you can dig a hole. You can let the game do this, I advise that you do exactly that. Wait, I advise that you do not even try and get this far. Anyway, I watched a digger dig a hole and trucks cart off mud for fully 10 minutes. I had completed 20% of the excavation. So I went back to the main map of NY as I was bit bored and wondered what else I could do. ""EXCAVATION FINISHED!"" flashed up the message 1 second later. Then I quit the game, although I saved first. You never know.			"

												Absolutely terrible. Its nice to indulge in all the ""micro"", if you can call it that, managing of the construction process, but it mostly involves finding the best people in your budget, which involves very little strategy. Once you've built your first tower, you have to wait for quite awhile ingame to build up enough resources to attempt to build a second, bigger tower. Otherwise, you'll either end up building smaller and smaller towers or bankrupt. Literally the second you wind up with $0, the game is over. There is very little depth, very little replayability, very little strategy, and very rough graphics. Easy pass.			"

												As a person who loves playing simulator games this one is a no no. Save your time and money, this game is is a huge letdown. Bought the game thinking it would be a strategic business and management sim and its nothing of the sort. Theres no variety in construction vehicles, only how quick they break down. The man management consists of clicking to add or remove workers, nothing more. No management of material resources need to build a skyscraper. You cant even take a lift to the top of the building you've spent millions building, to spit off! This game could of been quite interesting if more indepth and actually provided the player with challenges and problems, in the end its just a point, click and wait.All in all, very boring game, crap graphics and sound, no gameplay what so ever.

												Don't go by the screenshots, the gameplay isn't as slick as the graphics indicate.Oddly for a Steam game, it wouldn't work until after a reboot (Win7).It's more like one of those time-and-resource management games than a simcity-style game. You control how many people, dozers, cranes, etc are working on your tower. Gameplay is oddly linear: you can't do anything until you've finished ""excavating"", then you have to build a foundation, which is the most boring part, and then construction starts. That last phase is the most exciting -- you get to play duelling cranes by allocating your cranes between the concrete team and the steel team.Not much to it. The beginning is frustrating (not enough money), the middle 5 minutes are okay, the rest is boring (you have too much money). I think I paid too much for it.			"

												Let me start this review by saying something very important: DON'T BUY THIS GAME.In case you didn't understand, lemme repeat: DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! STAY THE F*_*CK AWAY FROM IT!!!This was one of the first games I bought on Steam and, boy, what a way to start.The first thing that struck me was the bland and undetailed graphics that just made my eyes share some tears for how bad they looked. I'm not the kind of guy that judges a game by it's graphics. But, damn! The graphics of this game sucks right across the board! The world overview is just a Google Maps image used as a texture and slapt over a overly simplified 3D ""model"" of a ""city"". Do I need to go further on how the graphics on this game sucks? In case I do, lemme tell you that you have only TWO models of skyscrapers to choose from and, as you might expect, they look like HORRIBLE. And when I say HORRIBLE, I REALLY mean it.The gameplay is so bland, so poor, so repetitive and counfusing that I actually felt sad experiencing it. You will spend maybe five to ten minutes micromanaging stuff to get your skyscraper done and that's it. Your skyscraper will be finished and you'll not feel a single dent of accomplishment for it. You will, in fact, feel sad for having wasted your life with such a poor and boring excuse of a game. Wasn't it enough, there is a bug in the game that will start playing thousands of samples at the same time making a hell of a noise, just like a freaking stun grenade, and, if this bug don't blow your eardrums instantly, will definitelly leave your ears ringing for a while. Sound fun, eh?! This game is an offence to anyone who bought it. And the best part is that the developers just don't give a flying f:3ck about it being bad; they just don't bother paying attention to the feedback given by the costumers to improve it. Well, if the developers made this ""tvrd"" (that's latin for sh*t) of a game only to make some quick buck and not improve it any further, I say ♥♥♥♥ the developers and ♥♥♥♥ this game. Have my 0, ZERO, ZED, NONE, NULL out of 10.			"

												Got it for absurdly cheap, was expecting an updated Sim Tower clone, instead it's more of a construction management sim.Gameplay is fairly simple, dividine a workforce across 5 different types of machines, moving machines across jobsites, and moslty just waiting for a job to complete.Honestly, there are facebook and flash games(Corporation Inc. from armor games) that are more rewarding and exciting.If you can get it for the same 16 cents I got it for, go for it, otherwise go play Corporation Inc.

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordI expectet a worse version of Cities Skylines. Its not even that. It is what it says it is. ""Skyscraper Simulator"". Just... yeah, bad.-GraphicsThe graphics are insanely bad, i like how they display the working progress though.-GameplayThe gameplay, probably the main reason why you should never get this game. Not even for 4€. Not even for 50 cents.So, basically, you start out with some money, can get a property to build your house (i chose the insurance at the middle of the map) and then you basically hire workers and watch the progress over some years. Thats it.Seriously, thats the game. The whole game. You watch those workers building your skypscraper in 3 different phases, there is nothing fun about this game.-SoundsNot much to say, except that the music is even worse than the music from the other 6 simulators i've been playing for the past 24 hours. I didnt hear any sound effects or anything, just that weird music.-ControlsYou just use your courser to do things. Clickity Click Click.-QualityThe overall quality is pretty decent, didnt notice any bugs, except for the game starting in 4:3 mode ♥♥♥♥ing up my whole desktop ...-Overall ExperienceProbably the most boring game i've played for a year now. Even that bad farming simulator was a better experience.I would defiently not recommend this game to anyone, except you want to stack up games on your Steam account.			"

												The game idea had potential - simulate the construction of a skyscraper and then sell them or rent the space in order to build an even bigger and better one.  There are some major flaws with the game though that prevent it from being enjoyable beyond the first attempt.  There's no skill required The process of hiring and firing people, buying equipment, and scheduling tasks is practically automatic.  It requires very little of the player and the game even tells you when it's time to do something. Economy Simulation lacks info You don't know if you rent out on a monthly. quarterly, or yearly basis.  I couldn't find any sort spreadsheet of my assets or anything like that.  You have to wait forever before you can make your second skyscraper and then... ugh. More waiting. bad graphics, lack of interactivity okay so google maps do a better job than this game does, and frankly it looks like they stole images from google maps anyway. Furthermore, you can actually go back to your skyscraper and enjoy the look of it, get close, see inside etc. A real shame considering that it's a simulator about skyscrapers.Not worth full asking price, I got it as part of a humble bundle package, it's worth about 99 cents.

												So, I bought this game expecting it to be kindof underwhelming, even as someone who likes management games. Unfortunately, it didn't even match my lowered expectations. Initially, I thought I could have input into the skyscraper's design; fiddle with floorplans and construction methods and so forth. What I got was 3 arbitrary choices for sky scraper design and 4 slider bars to tweak quality/quantity/type of rooms in the building, and the number of floors. That's it. At this point I thought 'oh well, maybe they make up for this with complex and engaging mechanics in management of the actual construction. I could dig that.' What I expected now was a game with plenty of 'make sure this resource is managed well' and 'hire/fire staff as needed', but also a game with slightly complex decisions like choosing companies to contract with, or buying resource sources. Also random events, and a solid progression as described of 'start with multistory houses, and work up to mega skyscrapers'. What I got was a game of 'hire/fire people as needed. that's it.'By the time I finished the tutorial/learning process (completed one skyscraper), I decided I'd build another. I maxed the speed the whole time, and found myself entirely and utterly bored. This isn't really a game so much as an add-on for some other, non-existant game with the other 90% of the process. I am generally not critical of games, but this game is only worth a dollar or two as it stands. These simulator games seem to be turning out to be a money grab, rather than a genuine simulator. Much less a fun game.			"

												A good looking game with a great idea. The only problem is, it isn't challenging at all. Building a skyscraper should be all about the innovative solutions that you come up with to get the building built on time and on budget to specifications. This game, you can't possibly fail. You just assign your workforce, ensure you don't go below $0 and you're fine.As soon as you finish your first building, there is no humanly way you can fail the game if you rent it out.If the developers can integrating some big problem solving and an entirely custom way of designing buildings, this game will be a massive hit that will eat tens of hours of gamers lives...

												There I was, as a new Steam user who couldn't afford something like SimCity. When I saw this game, thought it could be a good micromanagement simulator, but it started to drive me crazy even before the gameplay because I couldn't launch it (actually I spent more time trying to make it work than playing the game). There's no strategy in it, it's a one way road where there's a right path, and everything different will result in game over. And when the ""road"" is just twiddle sliders, most people will get bored within less than 10 minutes. I don't blame who greenlighted it (because I think I would too), but it's the first game which made me want my money back.			"

Total mistake, u get here thinking it is a simulator? That you are going to have some control over what you do right? NO, NO, NO. Listen to this: All you do in this game is watch. That is right.You can assign workers by clicking on arrows.....thats it, u click on arrows....and u watch as they build default buildings....u cant choose what the building can be, u cant do anything but watch. just watch numbers and images changing. i give this game 0/10. I think thats the only game that holds such grade in my book. Not only because it is trash but because it misleads the buyer. Plain and simple garbage.			"

												Skyscraper Simulator has a very good concept, but just does not deliver. The interface can be very confusing at first, but once you understand it, you just realize it is boring. After you build your first skyscraper you sit back and hope people start renting space out to make money to build another. There really is nothing you can do and just hope that you built in the right location. It could have been a much better game.			"

												Very very very boring. All you do is move sliders and watch these little computer people do the work. You don't really get to do anything. If I had to sum this game up, it's more like an interactive video then a video game. This game should be taken off steam (and like the old game ""ET""), should have all hard copies and original hard drive it was made on, taken out to the desert and buried.			"

												The negativity for this game is undeserved.Sure its not HYPER interesting but its a simulator. The initial instructions you receive tell you EXACTLY what to do, how to do it and when to do it, but will only do so in a manner where you will succeed ""averagely"".It is then up to the player to optimise their workforce to increase production speed, reduce costs and maximise profits when renting and choosing the opportune time to sell the building.It has a similar play style to KSP in that, its all about your prep work. If you don't prepare well, you will fail.The complaints about bugs are again, undeserved. The only major one I had was that I had to change my system audio quality from 24bit 48khz to 16bit (this is common for older simulator games), and even this is stated in a pinned topic on discussion, yet there are still regular complaint threads cropping up because the pinned material is not read.Unfortunately, the ""casual"" core of gamers have managed to perpetuate the myth that all these simulator games are ALWAYS buggy and ALWAYS boring and the staple of germans everywhere, but then the kind of people who say that generally aren't the audience for these simulators and probably picked them up cheap or because their ""favorite youtuber"" did an episode on Farming Simulator 2013 and think Lolcats are still funny.The game is NOT recommended if you are expecting a simulator where you can constantly tweak stuff, it is NOT recommended if you think this is anything like those simulators which are not simulators *Cough* Goat Sim*Cough* and it is NOT recommended if you have the patience of a 6 year old.If you want something to play while you stick on some tunes or chat to some mates in TS/Voip this is for you, if you want something where you can spend time minmaxing staff and finding an ""optimal"" method, this is for you.

												This game is okay.  Honestly, I'm not sure why it was rated so horribly by so many.  There are fairly clear directions that pop on the screen (are easily removable/recallable) telling you what to do.  [The biggest complaint I've read was that equipment was purchased in perfect condition, but then was rated horribly.  You have to fill the equipment with people by going to the lower selections and highering people.]  I built 8 skyscrappers in probably 7 hours of real playing time (at my computer).  The only thing I didn't read, but easily figured out was when you reach a maximium of 6 properties, you have to stop 'renting' one out and sell it.As you successfully build them, more properities around the city and more varied designs become available to build with.The game does not come without flaws though.  There are bugs, but none that crashed my computer or prevented me from playing at all.  One was a display of my money in the upper right where it'd keep jittering every once in a while.  Another was where I built a skyscrapper on Battery Park and when it completed it (though still listing it as the Battery Park location), placed it in the middle of central NYC.  It also enlarged it by a factor of 3.  (There are screen caps in my profile on the game).  (Note: after building the next skyscrapper, it did reset the size of the one to a normal level.)All in all, it's not horrible.  I got it as part of a bundle and took a chance, despite the reviews.  I played on a lower end laptop and though lowering the video graphics on it to it's lowest setting, it all ran smooth.  The biggest complaint of mine was the factor of time.  You often would basically set everything up to build and then just fast forward.  Which when doing so, still took a long while even at a factor of x10.  Again, it's not the world's worst game as the ratings indicate.  It's playable and kinda fun.  It's not intricate or mindblowing on dynamics.  But it's alright to pickup and play for a dozen or so hours.			"

I will try to uninstall and reinstall and see if that works.I have deleted them, shredded them, uninstalled and reinstalled and still they are there.

												I am not one for writing reviews, but this game forces my hand.Skyscraper Simulator bills itself as a skyscraper construction simulator. This is a blatant lie; in reality it is an ""not responding"" window simulator.When you first load up the game, you are greated by a series of company logos; Developer, Publisher, etc. Then as the last logo fades to black, with much fanfair absolutly nothing happens. The screen remains blank. The Steam overlay freezes in place, and the game stops responding.The issue lies not in my hardware. My i7-4790k, gt740, and 16GB of ram well exceed the minimum specifications. The issue lies purely in this peice of software(search online, many people suffer the same affliction).As far as I can find, there is no fix. The game is broken and in an unplayable state. I would strongly recommend not purchasing ""Skyscraper Simulator"", save your $10USD for something else.TL;DRPros: -A dang fine black screen before it crashes.Cons: -Lacks any kind of depth/gameplay in its current state, because it does not work.Other Thoughts: I am used to Early Access games being flawed, however this is beyond that. This is by-far the most broken Early Access games in my library of 400 games.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Skyscraper Simulator 

			Views: 15		

			Ever dream of watching a Skyscraper slowly be built? The intent was to simulator what it's like to be in the world of skyscraper construction and management.		

Ever dream of watching a Skyscraper slowly be built?  The intent was to simulator what it's like to be in the world of skyscraper construction and management.  The result is a very rough UI to show various meters filling up.You do control the hiring and firing of workers and equipment but once it's built your towers are completely hands off.  The construction itself offers little player interaction, just click until you have enough stuff then wait...and wait.			"

												AVOID THIS GAME! It doesn't load. I've read post after post about problems people have with it loading. I went on the game's website and learned this company also makes Agricultural Simulator, the only other game of my 160+ Steam games that doesn't work. The people who go through all the rediculous steps to get it working find that all you get to do is pick your site, budget and employees. THE GAME DOES THE CONSTRUCTION!!! Steam, I want my $5 back!

												I enjoy this game. If you do not think you would enjoy the process of building a skyscraper then this game is not for you. I always wanted to build one, and thanks to this game I have. I don't think I would ever want to build sky scrapers in real life because it seems too risky, and I fear bankrupcy. I played this game while dogsitting.			"

												This game is absolutely terrible. I really dislike everything about this game, except one thing. Now, you may ask, ""then why did you recommend this game if you dislike it?"".Well, when I said ""except one thing"", I was speaking about the soundtrack. This game has the most amazing soundtrack I have ever heard. The game itself is quite silly, and there's not a lot of fun to be had in it, but honestly, if it's on a sale or something, buy it for dirt cheap, download it, and just listen to the soundtrack. I bloody love it!In conclusion, the game isn't worth the price, but the soundtrack is!			"

												I launched the game, was treated to seeing the dev's logos and then given a black screen to stare at for a couple of minutes before the program closed itself. This happened all three times I tried to play it. Judging by the negativity of all of the other reviews, I'm going to have to give this a thumbs up simply because I quite likely enjoyed it more than I would have if the game had actually launched properly. Plus it's impressive that they managed to fit all that black screen in just a 260MB download!Edit: Right, I'm going to add my review of Airport Simulator here because it's made by the same people. Unbelievably, there's even less substance to that game than there was to SS. It crashes within the first 2 seconds, which means that it would take a lot more time and effort than I'm prepared to spend to get to the required 5 minutes of playtime before leaving a review. Sure, I could try to figure out what's going wrong and find a way to launch the games, but do I really want to?No.			"

												Day 1 started with high hopes. Bought a solid building site and my plan was to make 2 towers made out of glass and steel beams. I wanted to become the hub of world trading.  I hired a foreman called G.W.B ( he would not tell me his full name). I sent him to work and over see my project. little did i know the lies he would coverDay 2  work started. materiels were plenty ( glass and steel beams) i pressed speed up and sonic appeared and made it all go faster. the project was nearing an end when the FBI called. they wanted to talk to my foreman about a recent Jet fuel robbery, i shrugged this off as a joke and hung up. Day3- Building work is completed. it was fast but it was expensive ( 420,333,911 million)skips to day 9 Day 9  building is evacuated for smell of jet fuel. could this be real.  i can hear planes in the distance.Dayy 11  the planes come closer and one hits. my steel beams are melting   could it be to do with the jet fuel?? . how can 1 aluminum plane penetrate steel beams?my work and money is ruined we will never know who G.W.B is and what really made my steel beams melt.i r8 8/8*spoiler*ted cruz is not the zodiac killer.

												You're a constructer and you’ve specialized in the ""bringing up"" of skyscrapers. Due to your specialization over the years you constantly get new orders for higher and higher skyscrapers in town. Within your responsibilities are the planning, the supply with construction materials and the worker management. In the beginning you are dealing with multi-storey town houses, but later on you find yourself in realizing magnificent buildings for the rich and famous. A level is considered to be solved, if, within the specified time, the received contracts and tasks have been fulfilled. During the game the player receives more and more new tools, machines and experience points. On the hunt for the high score, the game can be played with friends too.			"

												Oh my god...What...WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DID I BUY?!? Skyscraper Simulator is a Simulator of building Skyscrapers in Manhattan Island in New York City, New York, where you play as the main character who came off the ship from Europe to New York City, starting your life as a Constructer in New York.Only problem...NOTHING ♥♥♥♥ING WORKS! First of all, the graphics: And-is it me or was this ripped off from Google Earth? Because it feel JUST LIKE THAT! And the areas where you build your towering Skyscrapers are nothing more than green, non-existing grass! And the worst part is: after completeing your building, it still remains. Oh, and during construction isn't even better at all. It looks like a low-poly version of Red Fraction. Yes. Red Fraction. A game that was made in 2001 for the PS2, Xbox (Original), and PC looks much better than in this game...Well, only one good thing about it is...At least the building design you can pick are kinda nice...Maybe...? I mean, you can build an American shameless rip off of the petronas Towers...So that's a good thing. Right?Second, Gameplay: I, for one, was ready to face the challenges of building a Skyscraper over New York City. What I wasn't ready for is some of the WORST GAMEPLAY I EVER EXPERICES IN A SIMULATOR! EVER! I can't even discribed the gameplay, except for this: AVOID IT AT ALL COST!Well, maybe one more thing about the Gameplay though is: WHAT THE HELL IS THEIR A HIGH SCORE IN THE GAME? NO ONE IS GOING TO PLAY THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥! And lastly, Sound: .....CUT MY EARS INTO PIECES, THIS IS MY LAST RESORT! DEAFNESS, NO HEARING, DON'T GIVE A ♥♥♥♥ IF MY HEAD ARE BLEEDING!DON'T BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥!-10/10 ♥♥♥♥ IT! ♥♥♥♥ IT TO HELL!			"

												Oh my god...What...WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DID I BUY?!? Skyscraper Simulator is a Simulator of building Skyscrapers in Manhattan Island in New York City, New York, where you play as the main character who came off the ship from Europe to New York City, starting your life as a Constructer in New York.Only problem...NOTHING ♥♥♥♥ING WORKS! First of all, the graphics: And-is it me or was this ripped off from Google Earth? Because it feel JUST LIKE THAT! And the areas where you build your towering Skyscrapers are nothing more than green, non-existing grass! And the worst part is: after completeing your building, it still remains. Oh, and during construction isn't even better at all. It looks like a low-poly version of Red Fraction. Yes. Red Fraction. A game that was made in 2001 for the PS2, Xbox (Original), and PC looks much better than in this game...Well, only one good thing about it is...At least the building design you can pick are kinda nice...Maybe...? I mean, you can build an American shameless rip off of the petronas Towers...So that's a good thing. Right?Second, Gameplay: I, for one, was ready to face the challenges of building a Skyscraper over New York City. What I wasn't ready for is some of the WORST GAMEPLAY I EVER EXPERICES IN A SIMULATOR! EVER! I can't even discribed the gameplay, except for this: AVOID IT AT ALL COST!Well, maybe one more thing about the Gameplay though is: WHAT THE HELL IS THEIR A HIGH SCORE IN THE GAME? NO ONE IS GOING TO PLAY THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥! And lastly, Sound: .....CUT MY EARS INTO PIECES, THIS IS MY LAST RESORT! DEAFNESS, NO HEARING, DON'T GIVE A ♥♥♥♥ IF MY HEAD ARE BLEEDING!DON'T BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥!-10/10 ♥♥♥♥ IT! ♥♥♥♥ IT TO HELL!			"

												I like this game, its a chilled back game where you can build a skyscraper. It is fun too play when talking too friends so you dont get bored or play on your ipad while waiting (I suggest hearthstone :P), I like this game, its a bit confusing at first but after a while you start too understand how to build stuiff correctly, there isnt really anything with replayability though, its pretty much the same each time.

												Many have problems launching this game.I came to understand that the resolution that was standard didn't play ball with my card.Changed some setting within a file. After that i ran like a dream.Fun game but sometimes its a bit slow.But i love it.*Problem solution*I may have found a solution that worked for me.The resolution the game wants to start with isnt supported by my grafix card. So i change the settings in the device.icomThat file is found in the data folder within the gamefolder.Played it for hours since i got i running.It wanted to run at 1024x768.I changed it to 1152x864 but the game will alos run at 1280x720			"

												Short version:  Don't waste your money!Longer version:  Seriously.  Buying temporary kiddie tattoos from the vending machines at the front of KMart is less of a waste of your money.  There is no point to the game.  Some of the mechanics that you're promised just are not there.  I wish that I'd read other reviews before I bought it.  At least I got it for a couple bucks, so I didn't lose that much.			"

												I didn't mind this game, as little to this as there is.But twice, about thirty minutes in the games fatally crashes and damages my video and sound drivers leaving me having to completely re-install EVERYTHING.I recommend avoiding this gameIt's just a virus diguised as a steam game			"

												Despite the negative reviews, I still looked forward to playing this from a bundle.  It interested me enough to play for several hours today.  However, once the game crashed, I decided I was done.  It's got some bugs in it, kinda a stale game, and crashed.  It's a game I would like for a couple hours, but after that, no longer interesting.  Due to the staleness and unstability, I do not recommend this.			"

												This game is absolutely terrible. It should be called waste of time simulator. It took me 35 minutes to watch my sky scraper get built. All the while not being able to do anything else but watch. Couldn't even start building a 2nd one. I'm sure you can find something else to do with the time you don't waste playing this game.			"

												This game is rubbish. Irredeemably so.It's all waiting. Just buy land you don't see, build skyscrapers, hire workers, buy machinery, and WAIT about 5-10 minutes. And there are THREE stages you do this.Then sell or rent the building for cash, repeat. That's all it is, no actual skyscraper simulation, but really should be called Construction Simulator.But I still like it. Why?Because it is a game you can play if you just want to relax. Minimal management, get the equipment and staff, and watch the building just grow. Just for all that's holy turn off all the freaking sound, because it's terrible.I got this in a bundle with a bunch of UIG's other pieces of trash, but I genuinely actually enjoy this.But then again I enjoy Sacred 3, Flatout 3 and the other UIG turd Airport Simulator 2014 and actually find them fun and entertaining so make of it what you will.(Changed to not recommended because it's still ♥♥♥♥)			"

												I played for some time a few years ago and then thought the game was buggy. The controls were bad, but I can't remember too much of it. Now I tried to play it again (thinking it had had some updates) but the game crashed after the starting titles. I wish there was a way to get my money back...			"
