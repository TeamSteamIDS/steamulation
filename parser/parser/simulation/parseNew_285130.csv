												Clunky system that in entirely too fast paced to enjoy.  The AI is pretty terrible.  On the Bull Run scenario the entire Union army tried to cross a single bridge and one regiment killed 20,000 men, I lost 400. The battle ended in a draw because I did not have a unit sititng on the victoy point that was way behind my lines.  The over emphasis on victory point over casualties inflicted make it a game of chase the flag rather than fighting the enemy.  The artillery mechanics need a lot of work.  The game had potential but falls flat on its face.  The campaign is less a campaign and more a string of skirmish scenarios that have no correlation to each other.  Nothing is carried on as far as I can tell from battle to battle.  They simply progress linearly.			"

												The game is very similar to a wargame from the mid-late 70s that was for the Napoleonic period.  That game was strategic and used rectangular counters, similar to the ones in this game, to depict forces.  The game that I played almost 35 or so years ago may have, in fact,  been made by Avalon Hill.I purchased the Battleplan ACW game after playing the demo.  I was glad that the developer had released a demo as I always like to try before I buy.  The demo proved a couple of things to me: first, to see if it ran under Windows 7-64bit, and second, to see if I like the way the game played since I read a lot of goods & bads on the forums.  So far, I like the game.  I also saw that the developer had released a patch today so players could slow the game down if you wanted to.  It is a strategic wargame so you should be commanding large units (battalion/regiment & above) and not a tactical game where you command squads, platoons, and companies.  I went through the tutorials and found them to be sufficient to learn the mechanics of the game. Overall, you can't beat the price.			"

												Battleplan: American Civil War could get by with its minimalistic graphics if, upon closer inspection, it had some real depth in the gameplay by the way of ultra historically correct maps and commander and unit details. It doesn't have any of these elements, and so I'll go ahead with the only two positives I can think of: 1) One interesting function that this game has, that I wish others did, is that all commands issued by the General must be received by a messenger. If the messenger dies, the message is not received and the unit you're attempting to move stays where it is. Sometimes unit commanders will refuse a command -- no reason is ever given, but both of these elements add some character and unpredictability.2) The Steam wallpapers are pretty cool. Yep. The flaws are manifold, but I will go for the chief hang ups that I have with this game: it rarely works, and it has zero support. I have an ASUS G73jh that cannot run this game, and yet a low-end Dell at work, that barely runs Minesweeper, can somehow get the game running. Take a few minutes in the forum and you'll see that it is a crapshoot if this game will run for you -- and the only pseudo-representative of the company can do nothing but forward e-mails after asking you to jump through diagnostic hoops. As Steam customers, I believe we deserve a little more.Stay away from this title.  "

A simple scratch for that strategy itch // Recommended for the more casual of strategy gamers**You'd likely prefer it at sale price+ Includes a multitude of mechanics that showcase the uncertainty of combat; depending on various factors, for example, units can refuse orders, or delay their implementation+ Many small, impressive attentions to detail, such as troops' refusal to build pontoons too close to bridges, or that units will not move until messenger horses arrive with your orders (from the 'C-in-C')+ One can pause game-time to take stock of a situation and give orders+ Effectiveness of artillery takes elevation and wind into the account of its effectiveness+ Unit controls are simple, efficient, and smooth in practice+ Tutorials are more than sufficient to acclimate the player to the game's mechanics+ Pace is somewhat lively; enough so that the player is consistently engaged+ UI is practical and easy to navigate+ Seems to run smoothly with no obvious bugs, glitches, or crashes- Unit AI often struggles to cross bridges/pontoons- Woefully short campaigns (3-5 hours each)- No multiplayer, variance in objectives, or additional game-modes; this does little to help increase replayability beyond the campaigns- When beginning a match, it is not made apparent from which directions the enemy will be arriving; this makes it difficult to determine the nature of one's initial troop movements and positions (there is also a crippling lack of a reconnaissance element)- Selecting/Deselecting units is often clunky and awkward- Constructing earthworks will typically force involvement of units one does not intend to be involved; this can drastically ruin a well-formed defense at critical moments (earthworks also cannot be destroyed or undone)- Visual and audio are both universally underwhelmingLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												What a fun little no-frills real-time Civil War Game... that doesn't work. The graphics are kind of bare bones, which is fine with me, and the interface is very simple and easy to use. But it is damn near impossible to consistantly get units to do what you want them to do. (This is as of 1.3).The major problem with this game is getting units to move is an uncertain affair. There is a kind of cool mechanic where sometimes your orders don't get through, simulating the communication difficulties of the second world war. I can go with that. What I can't go with is when you give an order, it get's accepted, and the unit doesn't move. Even after you repeat the order. Again. And again. And again. And again. Units will just randomly ""stick"" in spots and will be essentially worthless for the rest of the battle.Worse are river crossings. I played Chancellorsville as the Union. Most of my force started across the river. There are several bridges. I must have re-issued my orders three dozen times before I got them across. Meanwhile, the few who stragged over the bridge got savaged one by one, because no one followed them. Most of the game can be more or less played and even enjoyed if you really try, but on a battle like that where you have to cross a river... forget about it. Don’t bother.Beyond that, the game really doesn’t do a good job at communicating what is going on. The units are represented with boxy little symbols, which is fine with me, but half the time, I can’t even tell who’s firing. Sometimes, my units just suddenly die. No warning, just poof. Sometimes it’s because there is a hidden enemy, but sometimes, they will just randomly panic and flee, even if not under fire.The sad part is there is a really fun game hiding under here. This is one of those games that I want badly to recommend, but cant. I love the design idea, love the genre, love supporting indies, but the game just doesn’t play right. Unless you are willing to put up with some major frustration and love Civil War RTS, I’d pass.			"

												I'm leaning more towards Battleplan ACW rather than Ultimate General Gettysburg. Battleplan keeps its promise adding depth and realism while keeping a managable fast paced tempo. The formations in Battleplan have their own character, something I see sorely missing in Ultimate General. For example, Leaders are sorted as either agressive, steady, or cautious folk. An agressive subordinate will be instrumental in conducting an assualt where as a cautious one might delay or flat out refuse the order. In addition, it also features a decent take on command and control amongst other features here and there.  For example, choosing where you move your HQ isn't only about the bonuses it applies to troops. The effects of longer or shorter distances from HQ to ordered unit affects the uptake of said orders. All in all Battleplan ACW is a meaty pocket sized wargame that trades graphics for depth of gameplay. I think it's a fine game for strategy game fans but may be too easy for hardened wargamers.    Check out this Let's Play for gameplay and more information.	  "

												At first i thought this game was fun. But then I lost the 1st Battle of Bullrun because i pulled a unit off a victory point at the last second to chase another unit away. The game has a lot of potential but in it's current state is pretty terrible. I attacked one unit of union militia with four units of confederate veterans and they were all routed after they lost literally ten guys. Instead of militia retreating, they literally fight to the death. But the biggest problem is probably units completely dying without getting shot. I attacked some artillery with 800 veterans and the entire unit died instantly. Nothing shot at them. They just died. So yeah this game is pretty crappy. Not worth the money			"

												I have been interested in the Civil War, since a childhood field trip to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in 5th grade. It is a time in the political history of our country, not unlike the ideological gridlock of our society today. This game attempts to be a top-down, strategic gameboard-type game where you can select and direct individual units to capture objectives, outflank the enemy and win the war. It uses historical information to show you the win/lost statistics compared to your own actions, but doesn't offer much in the way of substance. I would not recommend this game if you are interested in a great strategic battle, as it is very simplistic.			"

												A fun little game for the casual armchair general. Playing out the great battles of the civil is kind of fun when you stick to the tactics that were actually used. The AI has a number of battleplans that they use against you in any given battle, and while that is where the depth ends, it is still enough for replayability. It is a very easy game to learn without taking much time to figure out the controls and it has a great tutorial. I really like the messenger system to give out orders, so it make you have to move around your commanding general in order for the messengers to not be intercepted by the enemy's formations.There are some problems: -AI pathing, units walking into the rivers and drowning, or just getting stuck on the riverback, unable to move, when selecting multiple units, they take the route of the unit being dragged around, not taking into account obstacles.-the aforementioned lack of the AI's ability to adjust to your strategy (which as the battle unfoldes, you adjust your men to theirs, but they seem to lack the ability to adjust to yours). this make the computer very easy to beat after only a few playthroughs of each battle. Once you recognize the AI's battleplan you can adjust your men accordingly, because they won't stray from their strategy-Artillery is still a bit clunky and unresponsive and needs a bit of work still-lack of multiplayer. While this game is fun to play, how much more fun would it be to play with a friend? I don't really see how hard it could be to implement something like that.-This game is centered on three capture zones rather than defeated and routing the enemy. So all you really have to do is to hold two zones no matter what and wait for the time to run out. Makes the game kind of dull and fairly easy to beat.Overall, i would recommend this game as it is fun and not too hard to learn. But it does require an update for two to make it a real gem. Right now it's a diamond in the rough, just needs a bit of polishing.===if you've made it this far, thanks for reading, and I hope this has helped you make your decision===			"

												Cut the crap, let's get straight to the point:Pros:- easy to learn, not that hard to master to on two first levels of ""easiness"". (militia and regular)- nice ui - nice movement system. You just draw a line mith a mouse and  units follow it- fast battles (win or lose in 5-10 mins for each battle). It can also be a cons.- civil var flavour  with historical units- terrain bonuses- some small things like adjutants who carry general's orders (they may become lost/intercepted and the orders get lost with them), hidden personalities of unit commanders - cautious may ignore some of your orders, agressive may charge needlessly into action, etc.- basic logistics (artillery runs of ammo and must be resupplied by a wagon train)- decent AI. Cons:- absolutely no graphics to speak of. Units are represented by rectangles composed of little squares. If such squares are in disarray you unit ir broken/routed/not in good order. See screens above and that's the battle  in its entirety. Environment consists of a few copipasted houses/trees- battle can run on one speed only or be paused. Maybe you can change it but I didn't find out how- no tactical formations. Column or two rows. Fullstop- engagements between units are affected by terrain, morale (milita, regular, vets), number of men and flanking mostly. Units have other stats. like fatigue but since battles are so short it's usually on maximum. Weather/wind direction are also there but mostly irrelevant. Night affects visibility for engaging, however, and you can see campfires where units are postioned (including enemy units)- dumb building ui. Bridges/covers are hard to place and cannot be cancelled. I once lost a battle because I misclicked, all nearby units started building something and noone was left in control of my victory points- about 20 battles for each campaign (I found it really short at the pace the game was running)- units have no independent thinking beyond personalities of their cammanders. If a neighbour is attacked  a few meters away most prefer to stay where they are and enjoy the show. - some simple but annoying bugs. The ones I encountered during almost 6 hours:units get stuck. Usually in rivers. I had to fight without artillery entirely because my wagon train got stuckunits have trouble crossing bridges. Some can cross only after second/third attempt.if you want to get some regular/vet achivements (regular Bull Run, etc.) set to zero your campaign of a previous difficulty level. I.e. I beat the Confederate campaign on regular + vet. for some battles, but because I also had Confederate militia campaign started earlier I got only militia achievements.  Verdict: worth playing if costs less than 3 $ and you really like US civil war. Want something more complicated and/or with graphics try Civil war Mod for Medieval TW.			"

												Hi!This is the best Civil War game I have played so far, it's almost as good as Total War Shogun and Age of Empires 2 were, when they were released. There is a feeling of oryginality, of experiencing something that is coming entirely from the minds of the developers and not at all from the opinions of investors, managers, marketing gurus and rest of the SCUM floating in the game industry.Sure, the game had 1 annoying issue with those damn pontoons - it's fixed now.Rest of the issues is just people complaining because they think that if they read 3 books, 20 articles and 100 posts about Gettysburg it makes them a specialist about the VERY first major battle of the war.Graphics - you either like it or you don't - I love it!!!  Clear view of the battlefield, lack of unnecessry detail, simple beauty of a haiku - perfect!!!There is no multiplayer ( yet - 09.09.2014 ) - I hope they get it done for Christmas :-)Love it!!!I really do love it!!!Good job developers!!!

												I like this game because you can get into the action fairly quickly, and because I was (and still am) a big fan of the PBS/Ken Burns Series, The Civil War.    I first found this game on my Ipad a year or two ago.  If you want just a quick and dirty game, by all means get this one.  If you are looking for a more in depth strategy/tactics experience, then maybe find another title.  I picked this up cheap during the summer sale and it is well worth it to me.   PROS+ Quick to get into.  While the tutorial helps and clears up issiues the game is pretty intuitive. +  Even though this game has been out for a while, the devs are still updating it and actually listen to player suggestions+ Relatively Bug Free+ Small - It's a small, bare bones game.  Does not take up much space, a laptop from the mid 90s could play it easily, and of course, it's cheap.  CONS+ It's small.  It's not a high end, graphics intensive game.  Does not really matter to me, but I know it does matter to some. + There is a campaign mode, but it's not at all a real campaign.  The campaign is really just a mission list that you play through.  + No real depth:  This is what bugs me the most about this game:  The chain of command only goes down to brigade level.  So if you wanted to play, for instance, the 50th Maine's Heroic Stand atop LIittle Round Top on the second day of the battle of gettysburg, well...too bad.			"

												For the most part, it has potential to be a good game. But, it's so broken. A Brigade of 3,500 Soldiers will lose 5 people, become disorganized, and route from the field. Unlike other games with Morale systems, if a brigade routes in this game, they most likely will never come back. The Morale system is broken in this game flat out. The disorganization system in this game is broken, and is likely the worst part of this game. Units will become disorganized if they walk through ANY other unit. And a lot of times just simply become disorganized flat out when doing nothing. I just have some units in reserve, and right when I need them, they become disorganized. I would say if you want an interesting Civil War experience, then buy it. But for the most part, they have a lot of things to fix before I would suggest it as a MUST BUY for Civil War Game Fans.			"

												Battleplan is a decent quick strategy game that keeps things basic. It has a very clean design and easy to follow interface. I also like the historical background information with maps that prefaces each battle. It might not be grognard level, but I thing the developers have done a fine job of capturing the essence of what the American Civil War entailed on a broad tactical level. I have plenty of more complex war games such as Combat Mission and Grisby's humongous War in the East, but sometimes I just want a  short, no-nonsense battle, and this game fits the bill. It has several levels of difficulty and you can tailor the type of enemy AI you want to engage. I hope there are games of this type in the offing. I'd love to see something from the English Civil War or even ancient battles utilizing Battleplan's system. Battle of Cannae in under fifteen minutes, anyone?			"

The biggest problem with the game is the user interface during battles. All the units are boxes. Which would be fine if there would be a clearer difference between different kind of units. There is a lack of feedback from units what they are doing and why. There also some annoying bugs like one that makes it hard to deselect artillery units.

												If you are a Civil War buff or a fan of tabletop skirmish sims, this game is for you.  Be aware, this game is all strategy...no tactics to speak of.  Just think of yourself as a Field Marshal in the war tent, issuing orders over a giant paper map!Haven Review: Battleplan: American Civil War[gamers-haven.org]Heroes of Gamers Haven:  Forum[www.gamers-haven.org] "

												This game is fantastic, i've always wanted a game like this. However, the moral system kinda sucks, i mean, a regiment of 2,000 going against another regiment of 1,000 will turn and run when they take like 10 losses.... idk why? if its a one on one you'd think the 2k would win but nope. they turn and run. Kinda ♥♥♥♥s up your battle plans. But either way, ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic game. and to the dev's... MORE PLEASE!!!			"

												Obviously this is not Total War. I like the mechanics that you actually have to issue orders and send them out with messangers. Those messangers can get killed and commanders can delay your orders or ignore them completely. For people who do not wish to be One-Finger-Gods of battlefield will like this closer to earth feature. Also i wouldn't say that this game tries to be more realistic. After all units are simply coloured blocks.Any way. I personally would recommend this little title. If ti is worth full price or you want to wait until sale is up to you.			"

												It's a very casual strategy game, similar to Ultimate General: Gettysburg. But Battleplan is a very casual version compared to Ultimate General: Gettysburg. I think both are fun, but I personally enjoy Ultimate General: Gettysburg(got this on copy/paste) more since it's more realistic.Basically, you can play as either Union or Confederates. You have Infantry, Artillery, a General, Supply Wagons for Artillery, and Calvary that are represented by various sized squares. You order a unit by dragging a path for them to follow, and they automatically engage. When you issue an order, a messenger runs from your General to the unit you ordered. When the messenger arrives, then the unit begins it. But depending on the Unit Leaders personality(Cautious, Steady, Aggressive), they may either delay doing the order, or even ignore it altogether.There are 11 battles altogether. I recommend the game if it's on sale.			"

												Very entertaining, and realistic. It is an extremely realistic simulation of what commanding an Army in the civil war was really like, Each battle has a lengthy article filled with usefull information, Regiments are placed historically and named Historically, Enemy forces are challenging, and often move historically and The campaign covers most notable Major battles in two Theatres (Virginia-Maryland and Tennessee/Slightly western states). While this game is fun, It is not something someone would spend hours playing, and quite honestly the campiagn is a little bit short coompared to many o ther games. In addition to this, Many Major battles are left out which would have made the campaign Longer, and More entertaining. Major battles such as Fort Donelson, Vickburg, Petersburg (I think), Bentonville, and Fort Fisher are all Left out.  Weighing all of the Pros and Cons, I would give it a 6.5/10. Even though it is saddening that they left out many Major battles, their are still many battles and scenarios to play, and It is still EXTREMELY fun to a History buff. I would highly Reccomend this game if you have a passion for history and or strategy, and this game is chalked full of it!			"

												FIRST STEAM REVIEW!Overall, this is a fun and simple game. I'm a strategy wargame fan, so this is a game I would naturally enjoy. I was able to skip the tutorial and get right into it. There was a bit of confusion at first, but this was made clear once I reviewed the tutorial (which is quick and simple in its own right).During gameplay, feedback is good. The status of units is generally clear and easy to read. It would be nice to be able to cancel pontoon and entrenchment orders -- especially when these orders are issued by mistake. Also, I would like to be able to interrupt/redirect a unit's move order (solution: don't order them too far).Also, others have mentioned that units seem to get stuck in rivers. This may be by design. If so, I would like to know the unit's status. More feedback here might be useful.Entrenchment needs some work. I can trace an entrenchment, then when I click on a unit, that unit gets a small secondary entrenchment to dig first. Maybe I'm doing it wrong? Actually, the unit's click-target is really small (the small star above the unit).The CinC likes to help with entrenchment, which is really strange. They go right to it. Do keep the generals away.Challenge-wise, entrenchments might occur too quickly. It's almost too easy to dig in.Others have complained about the Victory Points or unit confusion. I have no problem with these. This is how good wargames are designed. Unit objectives and dropped orders reflects actual battlefield conditions. It can be frustrating, but you have to deal with it.The graphics are okay. As a wargammer, I don't need great graphics -- they're not a priority. So long as I can identifty units and terrain, I'm good to go.One issue I found is that Confederate victories only produce a Milita achievement. I verified this on the game's Statistics screen (0 Milita games).  As a Reb, I've won on both Regular and Veteran modes, but have not received the achievements for these. I'm getting Militia achievements instead.My only complaint is that the game is too easy. So far I've only played (and replayed) the first two battles: Bull Run/Manassas and Shiloh/PL. I've won as both Union and Confederate on Regular and Veteran modes. It would be nice if there was more of a challenge.7.5/10			"

												Overscan/DPI issues prevent mouse control from working in this game when running 4K with DPI scaling enabled.This is standard practice for all new PCs with resolution greater than FullHD. Because the user interface is unusable on modern PCs, it's impossible to recommend this game.			"
