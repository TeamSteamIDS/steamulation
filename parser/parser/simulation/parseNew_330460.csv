Early Access Review
								I originally reviewed Celestial Command on 21 October 2015. Since the game is being actively developed and updated, it's only fair that my review reflects that. I will leave my original review below.My opinion hasn't changed: This is a great little game with a ton of potential to grow into something fantastic. The game and the people behind it really deserve to be supported.What has changed in the past 9 months?- Graphics were pretty much overhauled and look even better now.- The game was optimized a bit more, increasing the game's performance. It definitely runs smoother than back in October.- Several important mechanics were added; Notable examples are improved functionalities of NPC space stations, and new modules like the shipyard and hydroponics.- The game now has (partial) translations into several languages. The localization effort is powered almost entirely by the community.- The small CC community now has its own Discord channel! If you're looking into the game and can't decide whether or not to get it, just visit and there will probably be someone to answer any questions you may have. https://discordapp.com/invite/HY4XJaK- Multiplayer performance has increased significantly, but it's not where it's supposed to be just yet.What has not changed?- The devs are still doing a great job communicating with their player base; about updates, ideas, bugs etc. They reply to almost everything, and in a timely manner at that.- The game's core mechanics are mostly the same. It's a slightly simplified space ship building game in a 2d sandbox galaxy where you can pretty much decide for yourself what you want to do with your fragile ship and crew.- Multiplayer still isn't quite stable. It works alright on fast connections and with all users under 200 ping. Otherwise hiccups and lag spikes become disruptive to game play.- Multiplayer still only works through direct IP connections, meaning you have to give people you want to play with your IP. Connections through Steam as well as official servers are planned, but are not here yet.- The game is still very much in early access and I expect that it will stay like that for the forseeable future. There are bugs, anomalies and incomplete features. If you cannot stomach that, do not under any circumstance get lured into any EA title whatsoever. For your own sake ^^----------------Original review from 21 October 2015----------------Give this a try. Perhaps, several tries :-)I'll be honest, your first times playing this will be confusing and possibly even frustrating. As everyone rushes to point out, the game is not finished and in extremely active development (more on that later). Eventually though, you get the hang of how everything works and it will be smooth flying from then on.It may be smart to tick the ""sandbox"" option the first few times so that you can first in peace check out the many options this game gives you, as well as figure out where some of the things you need are hidden.The game at its current stage (version 0.692 just came out as I'm writing this) is simple. You're in command of a space ship and you'd like to, well, not die. Or maybe you do want to die. It's your choice. You start in a reasonably safe orbit around a planet, along with several meteors and two space stations. You can mine the meteors for resources and you can trade with the space stations for food (so your crew doesn't starve). Other than that you're completely free, there's not really a story or objective at this time.About the development: I'm a huge fan of these devs. They are super responsive to anything and everything you post on their Steam page's forums, they actively deal with bugs, discuss ideas and future plans ..and they speak funny English :-) To be frank you'll notice this in the game as well but it's all perfectly understandable.tl;dr? SUPPORT the awesome people working on this game, be a part of the seemingly small community and make a difference in the development of this already very good game with the potential to be AWESOME.Celestial Command is worth it "

Early Access Review
								If you've played the excellent SimpleRockets, you are already familiar with terms like gravitational sphere of influence, apogee, perigee, Hoffman transfers, retrograde and prograde burns. If not, you may want to try playing SimpleRockets to give you the basics or read up on the terms online. You will need to know what these mean. To begin, this is an awesome game. You can travel within a solar system using several modes of propulsion. You can orbit planets and go to space stations. You can mine asteroids and shoot at things with a ship of your own design. You can do all of this in sandbox mode (it will give you things you need from a sandbox menu) or not (in which case you better know what you are doing). I really suggest using the sandbox mode until you are comfortable navigating and modifying your spaceship.I haven't tried muliplayer yet but I did start my own instance of a server so I can experiment in. Set a password you will remember so you are the only one to get into your instance. In this mode you are given a ship and are in orbit around a planet randomly spawned. Read the F1 help text carefully as it will get you familiar. Anything you need to build or remove from your ship is done in engineering.  You can build and destroy engines, power sources, solar panels, , reactors, corridors, cargo holds, command decks, struts, fuel tanks, a radar system, various weapons, a grapple hook, and a mining laser.Before you can use the object, it must be either connected to a power source or a tank. That's done easily by dragging and dropping nodes from the source to the object. You can connect multiple objects to a single tank or power source but remember you will empty that source faster if you do. Adding more sources of fuel or power will help, but it will increase the mass of your ship which will make it slower to turn.Moving around a solar system is not a simple manner of pointing your nose at a planet, star or asteriod and then firing your rockets because everything including you is in Newtonian motion. It's like trying to drive a car on ice. You have to kill one direction of motion before attempting to move in a new direction (retrograde burns come to play here) or slow down or speed up at the apogee or perigee points of your orbit. Failure to do this will result in your ship skidding and slidding off course.For a game that is in alpha, it is very stable. The game cost is insanely reasonable and there is a lot of play value provided you get past the learning curve. There's very little tutorial info here about the game to explain all the basics but two guides written and available on Steam will help you get started. If you keep in sandbox mode, experiment with ship design and orbital mechanics, and ask questions in the community area, you should get the hang of it.One  thing I would like to see added as  a feature is the clicking of planets to show info on your approach vector (both tangent and radial). You can do this with asteroids but not planets.A ship editor for creating and modifying a library of ship designs before entering the game would be great as well.Time dialation for up to 8x speed is not enough to see a discernable change in orbits and intrasolar system travel...perhaps 24 would be more appropriate?Buy the game! For 3 cups of coffee you get something that will keep you entertained yet challenged for days.			"

								Thumbs up for a great concept, looks very promising even being in a very early stage.However, keep in mind this is not 'ready to play' by any means, at this time I'd consider buying it only if you like the general idea and want to support the devs with funds.Has the potential to be a very unique and great game though.

								I've been waiting for a game like this for a long long time. This isn't your typical arcade/causal nonsense - the game is as sophisticated as the games I was raised on and it takes realistic space to a whole new level.Be advised that the game is still in early development and is nowhere near fully playable. Still, I'm waiting eagerly for updates.			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of those gems that need and deserve more attention. So far only 6 reviews have been placed. Meaning, probably not many players have this game or know about it.For anyone thinking of buying the game, i'll explain to you why you should.The price The price of when buying while it's still early access, is just 7,99 EUR. Not so sure about other currencies. This isn't much. When it's fully released, it will be doubled If im rightGameplay The gameplay is very smooth. Especially for an early access title. The amount of things you can do is pretty limited at the moment, but of what the developers have told us, this will be much more fun to play. Don't get me wrong. I'm already enjoying this alot. What im excited about the most, is the amount of updates and the developer-community relationship. The developers actually view the discussions, reviews and questions. And update the game according to what the people want to see.My personal favorite will be multiplayer.And while im at it, will there be planet interactions? Something i would really love to see is being able to inhabit a planet and build al kinds of structures on it. Miners, defence systems, that kind of stuff. And automated transporting between those planets using actual npc ships or something. Gives the player the feeling of power and accomplishment.			"

Early Access Review
								At first glance Celestial Command just looks like just another spaceship game, but if you take time to play it you will discover a very well designed sandbox experience. Even though the game is at a very early stage in development a lot of the really important features are there to enjoy. At this stage in development you can free build whatever ship your heart desires. Want to build a small mining ship to collect everything in the solar system, or what about a battleship to kill everything that comes across your path? All of this and much more can be built. The building mechanics themselves are intuitive and easy thanks to a snap in style feature. You can easily see what components will snap in to a given space and if you have any free points left. The only complaint I have to building is the unintuitive linking feature the modules use to become operational. Now, the feature isn’t bad in any right, in fact I love that everything has to be connected to work. My issue is that I have nothing to show me how or what to link in order to activate the module. Of course this issue can be easily fixed with a small tutorial for the game. After playing the game for a while I discovered the physics to be very well done. If you are familiar with any type of realistic orbital mechanics then you will feel right at home. If you are not then it may take some getting used to. The mechanics remind me a lot of Kerbal Space Program and at times Celestial Command feels like a 2D version of it. Of course in my case this is a good thing. The realistic mechanics give the game a welcomed challenge and add another layer of fun and experimentation. The overall design of the game is great from what I have seen up to this point. Although the game is being made in a 2D space the design is crisp and well done. When playing in HD all the textures and models look great. I will definitely look forward to seeing more from the team.Overall I would say development is coming along nicely. Of course you can see that at the time of this review the game has just released. With that being said, even at its current state the game is well worth the price. If you are looking for a fun game in which you truly free build any ship, fly through realistic space physics to kill and mine then what are you waiting for?It should go without saying but this is a review for the current EARLY ACCESS version of the game. If you buy the game it is at your own risk. "

Early Access Review
								After spent 3h mining minerals from asteroids, I finally arrive to space station 3 to trade them (+2k credits) for FOOD.Haven’t realised the space station was in collision course with a planet. We all died during the transaction.10/10 I would try to buy FOOD again.——————Celestial command is an early access game. It is not the same type of early access as Factorio, but it has surely a lot of potential and it is already fun.The game is currently centered around a spaceship that you can modify at your will to navigate in the solar system in search for resources to mine, to sell them to space stations, in exchange for money and food.While the game is currently in a very minimal stage, I believe that the developers have explicitly warm you about it and the game is already fun.

Early Access Review
								Celestial Command gave me a very plesant feeling when i first opened it. The interface is very polished and i can hardly distinguish that it is actually an early_access game.The reason i bought this game is because i loved this genere and wanted to get away from static ship modules and shooting all the way through galaxy. I wanted something that allows me to build what i like and run it in some realistic environment.So i waited and see.There are some good games that lets you do both:KSP,SimpleRockets,Reassembly,Istrolid,etc.But there was always something missing--KSP and SR was good but there was no sense of being in charge. Reassembly and Istrolid was great,too,but there isn't enough realism--void friction slowing you down,etc.In a way this is the game i have being waiting for....forever.The thought of flying real orbits and firing shells at whomever i want while always in charge and ready to send a fleet of starship to my enemy simply blows my mind.But i faltered when i saw it was Early_Access.I have learned my leason through many notorious Early Access titles that they were not to be trusted---NoMan'sSky was just another example of not-responsible developers that ruined their creations for the dollars.So i watched.I waited.And then i saw the devs updating very often(at least more often than Windows Security Essentials) and i saw numorous improvements--correcting Multiplayers, adding community guides,correct speed inherentment......and i saw the devs answering almost anyone in their threads and almost always very polite. That's when i decided to buy the game.I decided that i am going to support this game because of its great concept and encouraging devs. I bought the game. Frankly speaking i wasn't so sure that this is going to be the right investment.My first 10 mins in game made me change my mind immediately.I saw the integration of ship builder with the real time orbits. I saw seamless scrolling between starmap and the individual ships. I saw the extremely tech-looking parts the devs did. and i was overjoyed when my friend got into the game and blow me up.Seriously,this is the coolest thing i have ever seen.This is well worth the 31RMB I've invested.and considering that this game is just starting to be developed, i think i have made a great purchase.Although somebody may think that i have only played 5min or so when i wrote this thing,but the fact is that i ran the game from the installaion folder to save my time.In the process my 5hours play time wan't logged.(and i donnot like steam tempering my saves anyway)All in all, i would like to thank the devs to give us this great game and hope that they will use the money they earned to make the game better.So i do recommend this game.

Early Access Review
								I dont really know how to write this review because its both early access which means it might fail as a game, and its actually looking good at the moment. Here is what i have so farPros:º This game is fun (for at least a few hours untill you completely give up and decide to crash your crew into the sun like i did which is also fun)º The graphics at the moment are nice. no real problem or lag.º I like how you can pretty much make your ship and add stuff like weapons, power sources,  and other miscellanious things to it.º the Keybinding and every thing else works good, so you can change the keys to fit your playstyle (unlike other developers that dont let you keybind or make it impossible to do so because of an unfixable game crash.)º can play with my friends pretty easily, i dont know if it'll be that way in the future though, most steam games started out with easy to make servers, but eventually become tedious and anoying when they start making you port forward, and blahh! blahh! blahh!.Cons:º Their has to be a better or easier way to harvest the space rocks, i often find myself crashing into them and now im at the point where i just play sanbox only and i give myself the ores and all i ever do is fly around in space untill i run into another planet or space rock.º Nothing to do at the moment. Just fly around. and crash ur crew into the sun.º The game gets really super♥♥♥♥♥laggy when i make a really big ship.º And getting from on point to the other is teadious as well, its takes forever to get to my space station.My End resolution:This isnt the type of game that i play for hours and hours at a time, its fun to come back to it and do som ship building in a while but shure needs more development. Non the less it keeps me coming back to build and crash my crew into the sun. so im giving this a thumbs up because its fun in some way and i want other to see this game as a new possibility, and i dont want to discourage the devs, it shure is  a fun game  and it needs to get more developed. I also dont want to crash my crew into the sun anyymore so its also for a selfish ambition to do something else.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is my first purchase of the ""Build your own ship"" genre that seems to be budding in the indie game world, so I have nothing to compare it against.I really wanted to NOT recomend this game but it wouldn't be fair to the developers, they are doing a pretty good job at keeping the community updated on progress and sending out changes rather quickly. At the momment this is a bare bones space sim with (most) of the merciless physics of space. The negatives (as of November 30th, 2014--keep that in mind and read the changes logs)No storyline. Bad guys look like your ships. Have a basic AI.No missionsNo use for some of the mining resources.No in game tutorial. Read the guides first. Lots of information is missing at the momment or not apparent. I expect that to change.No mercy for the uninitiated. Fuel runs out and you'll be spinning and or zooming off to the great unknown.The good (again as of November 30th)Quick to play space ship sim. Guides are a quick read.Easy to build ships. Again, no tutorial yet but its not too hard to figure out.Physics! Also a curse if you want a action game. Things float away. Explosions send you (or your enemy) zooming away. The more mass you have the more fuel you consume. Fuel is a big deal here. Pesky objects block your solar panels preventing you from powering your defences.  "

								So far? It's pretty great. It's more of a simulation than an action game.Getting your orbit trajectory right, managing fuel and thrust, and power; it's all pretty interesting and adds some depth to simply flying around space collecting resources.See that asteroid with the ice you need? Well you've only got about 1 minute of thrust left, total, and it's going faster than you around the sun.You'll need to slow down and widen your orbit so it can catch up to you, and you can reserve fuel.That sort of thing!At the moment you collect resources to build modules for your ship, sell excess for funds to buy food for your crew, and defend yourself against the occasional space scum. More will come. If you're looking for a faster paced space game, this won't be for you. If you're looking for something more akin to Interstellar, or creating your own space stations with really well done top down graphics? This is a good buy.			"

								This game has really nice orbital mechanics. Obviously not quite as polished in terms of trajectory calculations as KSP, but still quite nice. The parts look really cool, and ships can be quite impressive. I have a few minor issues such as the RCS being so ridiculously powerful it can deorbit your ship while you're trying to dock, as well as with ships having insane amounts of delta V, meaning Hohmann transfer orbits are completely useless, although they would be exceedingly difficult anyway as the game doesn't have a maneuver node system like in KSP.

								I feel like the game has a lot of potential, and of course the game is listed as early access (as it has been for the last 2 years), but I simply can't recommend the purchase due to the fact that the UX is lacking and written tutorials for the game are nonexistent.Normally, I wouldn't ding a game so hard for lack of tutorials except that the developer's stated attitudes towards tutorials is inconsistent with how I think a developer of a publically available, for-sale product should think. I say this as a fellow developer of a beta product.The official stance towards wikis is that they ""don't like a wiki for games, because they are contains [sic] a lot of spoilers about game features."" [1] and they don't seem interested in prioritizing tutorials because they would ""spend a lot of additional time on any changes, which eventually will slow down the development."" [2] Technically true, but they're vastly overstating the amount of effort they should have to put forth to produce a wiki or document that goes over basic game mechanics! It simply isn't true that they would have to change everything for every feature because not everything changes with every feature!It's definitely true that a finite and non-zero level of effort would be required, but that's just part of sound development practices: documenting the functionality of your product. In the product that I work on for a living, we document our stack, the APIs we produce, individual libraries and classes, as well as protocols and the bigger picture because without that information, the barrier to entry for development is just too high. The exact same concepts apply to users playing the game.If they truly are changing every feature enough that they would have to change all of their documentation with every release, they have an entirely different problem altogether: instability and indecision in their development process. I know they don't really have those problems (at least to that degree) because the game appears to be functionally the same month after month from my naive 1.0 hour playtime perspective and changing everything for a release simply doesn't happen. Not here and not for any other game.I know some of you would say that I just need to give the game some time (1 hour is incredibly low, indeed), but it's pretty damn important to provide some help to new users given that Steam now allows refunds, no questions asked, for 14 days with less than 2 hours of playtime. It would be very telling to see what the refund rate is on a game like this. Don't worry, I'll check back in another two or three months and see if/how the game has progressed. If it looks like it's in a playable state, I'll give it another shot and update my review accordingly.[1] https://steamcommunity.com/app/330460/discussions/0/604941528474257819/[2] http://celestialcommand.com/?p=659 "

								When I first started playing I thought it was awful! The updates and the ingame text dont always match up, the controls are clunky/impossible.Then I thought about what I was doing. Remember kids make sure your solar panels are plugged into the same battery as your miner ;)Good:Engaging/frustrating gameplayCan learn the basics of flight with sandbox mode on (useful if you manage to nab an asteroid without Al too ;))Basic game mechanics show SO MUCH potential. Warp drive is a ton of fun! Stars are so pretty that you can crash into themBads:Havent been through a Dev update so don't know how much progress is made in each update. Save/Re-Load causes some headaches (building a mining base only to reload it and have the asteroid no grabbed and crashing into my base).Even better if:Flight control was improved/simplified/automated- We don't all have wizard like reflexes and wiping out star ports seems to be my thing...Drones (mini ships)Production/tradeNPC combatIn game goals (could support the desperately needed/wanted tutorial)All in all a good game with great potential. Barring the usual early access shennanigans this game could be super,fantastic and amazing :)Edit: Dev goes bug hunting regularly which is nice - You wont have to wait until a new increment in the Dev cycle before fixes happen :)			"

								I got this as soon as it was on steam, and it was 'meh'. As Update 0.693, it's difficult, but in a fun and challenging way. By challenging, I mean enjoy always being 1 resources short and having the only source of food crash on a planet/drift out of the solar system. But with some good warp-drive maneuvers, I was able to bring the station into a stable orbit.			"

								Great game!Love the orbital physicsLove the complexities of construction/power/miningCombat rocks! Really easy to loose while winning!Totally dont mind the learning curve and needing to utilise external tutorials(DEV's don't waste your time on tutorials yet keep pumping out the content!)One small gripe though:It's far to easy to change your orbit when just turning with RCS. I understand and approve that poorly mounted RCS layouts will result in an unstable ship but feel that a multi-ton ship should not be able to accidentally modify it's orbit without a more substantial engine or a constant directional RCS burn.Overall great work!This game will be one to watch, especially when people get their hands on the modding API!I should also mention that the developer seems very involved in the community and is really listening to his fans!

								A good concept nicely implemented; A top-down space flight / resource / construction simulator that realistically handles gravity.Very smooth graphics and gameplay, but you'll need to understand and know how to implement orbital mechanics in order to play this (the latter of which is more difficult than it sounds). Not to mention it has a reasonable power and resource system which is easy to understand.The developers just implemented multi-player, and it shows; Even for a single-player game you'll have to start a server. This is all done in-game and very clear and easy to understand as well. Not actually tested it, but from what I understand its just as stable as the game itself.Can't wait to see more.			"

								Reccomended to keep an eye on, but as it stands - it needs balancing.Its a fun concept game, a great ammount of effort and detail in it but it almost ends up with too much realism vs fun.The physics driven and oriented flight is a fun idea, but it struggles at the moment against a balancing act of knowing what to do down to the last inch of space and it tests the player's patience to conserve resources to make the most of what you gain. Over-taxing your thrusters can leave you adrift far too fast at the moment.The orbiting mechanic and gravity effects are neat, but to me its just out of reach of the perception to make it really sink in well to shift your flight easy. Hard to tell which direction your path is going, ending up with a bit of a problem if you pass the mark too far the wrong way.Sandboxing is fun and interesting, but its a bit more of a conceptual phase at the moment I would argue than anywhere near a working platform.Great promise, plenty of heart and attention to detial - just needs that gaming tweak to let the fun aspect sink in.

								This game is a Gem that popped out of nowhere it may have seemed basic at the start and yet with its Early Access state has been making a lot progress. I would say it's (Honestly) a lot of fun everything is free cost build right now so it’s fun in the sandbox so as always Imagination is the limit. If you like space Sims, mix in combat, Snap-On build like system, Mining, Missions, little bit of micro manage of resources and they keep adding. I would say honestly pick up Celestial Command give it a shot.Plus you can see the Devs honestly do care about this game because they are constantly active take a look at the forums.I honestly enjoy it. –Stalker1o2 "

								//  Warning:  //  I've got about 13 hours when I wrote this review and that's roughly when the game //  became unplayable for me.  UPDATE: After reading Flaagg's review, I'm going to //  try this again.Even in its current pre-alpha state, gameplay is really very engaging.  It just kept me up until 4am!I would call this a 2D KSP.  But it's also artful, as you can see from some of the screenshots.  Reminds me of Factorio that way.I only recommend this game if you are already familiar with controlling orbits, (maybe if you've landed on the moon with KSP).  It also doesn't hurt if you've watched some of the youtube videos showing people who are hopelessly lost trying to figure out how the game works.  I know that helped me at least.The main gameplay (within 1 hour of picking up the game) is to keep the crew fed.  So landing on space stations is a big priority.  Along the way if you can mine an asteroid and sell some of the ore and use the money to pay for the food, then that's not half bad.  It also doesn't hurt to try to figure out how to optimize the ship to make it more maneuverable and hold more cargo, along with solar panels to recharge the batteries.And landing on the space station -- yeah whoever made those space stations was a complete dufus!  They put the landing ports in between the ship and the solar panels so there's all this maneuvering to try to connect without breaking things in the process!  :)  It's pretty fun and there's NO PAUSE, so it can feel a bit extreme getting the hang of the controls, which I tend to get mixed up (rotate left, rotate right, forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right).  Maybe reassigning the keys would make that more intuitive.You can make a ship very similar to Reassembly, something that handles very much the same way.  This means when the ship is upside-down on the screen, somehow the brain figures out how to reverse steering just like controlling a remote-controlled car.  Except in Reassembly fuel was infinite, and here fuel is finite, and so it requires great attention and planning.In the current state, beware that it's pre-alpha.  But also the flip side is don't miss out.  The experience is worth your time.			"

								Definetly an amazing concept. As a Kerbal Space Program addict I must say this is one that you should pickup if you are too and would like to support its development (it is EARLY ACCESS after all).It is in essence a 2D space sim where you build a ship part-by-part in space and go about mining (so far) and surviving. Your crew will need food and your ship will need power and fuel. Build a bigger ship with more storage and more power, lasers and crew, and you will find yourself having a blast.It's space physics/orbital mechanics is quite well simulated but do note, this is an early access so expect there to be lots of work to be done until release. You will find there is little content but the devs are working hard at it. For now your challenge will be trying to get more and more food and fuel to survive without flinging yourself into an asteriod.It has a fairly steep learning curve for new-comers and even more so new-comers to the space sim genre but I'd highly suggest to take a peak at the guides and experiment how modules connect and transfer resources.More parts will be coming as well as AI ships filling the universe with life and dangers throughout its systems.A work in progress but looks very promising thus far. Going to keep an eye on this one as it develops.			"

								First I will say this game is beta as hell. it is going to be abruptly apparent your first 5 minutes. Things will mostly work, but then there are things that work as intended but just irritate the hell out of you because F@#k you space.hmm, what to say, this game is 7.99 but it feels like it should be more, in its current state, while frustrating, is just fun in 2D. Figuring out how the physics work and having space sax with an orbiting space station trying desperatly not to rip it in half was the most intense 2D experience ive had in my life.Wanna build a fleet for absolutely no reason and create an enemy fleet to go to war with that fleet? go for it. wanna build a great big ole block of nothing and smash it into things for no reason watching the resulting 2D kerpops? go for it. Or do you want to try to survive in a giant Vacuum gathering materials ofF OF MO-FU ASTEROIDS MOVING IRRADICALLY? (epic mispell) Gathering resources and maintaining your eventual fleet you create from said resources block by block. Love this game.			"

								Celestial Command is a true Indie-title being lovingly made by three Developers. I dont know if these guys really have a solid longterm-roadmap on what this game will really be when its done but does that bother me? Not at all.Right now what 'CC' is is fun to toy around with. Obviously there are still some elemental things missing und weird stuff can happen like you would expect from Early Access, but steady progress and the friendly & responsive Devs make it fun to watch this game take shape. Whether this will turn out to be an arcadey deathmatch in orbits or an everlasting exploration game with proper mining and manufacturing of parts - ill take it all.In a way this game is like KSP in 2D - so expect meneuvering being tricky at times. Use proper orbital-mechanics like you would in KSP to get around and conserve fuel. If youre having trouble start by googling the terms ""Apoapsis"", ""Periapsis"" and ""Hohman Transfer"". "

								5.1 hours played. never knew i played that long... kinda got lost making ridiculous creations and messing around by flinging rocks at ships...for it's price i can definightly say it's worth it, the gameplay is a bit... ergh right now but the artwork is amazing. you can tell there's been alot of love put in this game, even the Dev who doesn't speak english as his first language tries very hard to convey dev notes and replys to comments in broken but understandable english! that gets 5 stars from me :Dnow the game itself... if you don't have an intrest in space or physics in space and orbits and planets and such then yes you are going to have a hard time understanding why your ship is stuck in a circle and why it doesn't just warp to different planets at the push of a button.but if you have some experience with space games/ semi-realistic space physics then you're going to have about an hour to understand how the game works then another hour understanding how the ship system works but in the end after those two hours you'll have a small ship which can surport itself and defend itself ready to go.albiet my ship turn to char as soon as my engines got shot out and i flew into the sun but who cares? it was fun!

								Having only played the game about an hour, it seems to be headed in the right direction, but it definiely isn't there yet.As the warning in the ""Early Access"" window clearly says, this isn't a playable game yet.  The obvious comparison is with EVE Online, but there is a lot this game wants to be that Eve is not; mainly, a physics-realistic, 2D, space sandbox that isn't MMO and riddled with microtransactions.  On the downside (IMO), this is much, *much* smaller scale than EVE is.  On the upside, it's far more intimate than EVE - I could easily gather one or two friends and start playing around with no issue,  I could see some people having fun with this in single player, but it's multiplayer where this game really stands out, which is good since it's multiplayer that seems to have the most potential.  The game itself looks good, albeit simple.  This isn't a limitaion of the game, it's a design choice made by the devs, leading this to be a game that's easily accessible to all, and even opening the possibility of a mobile port waaaaay down the line.  I really appreciate this choice, if only because I've lived the majority of my life gaming on low end machines.  The sandbox aspect of the game is embraced whole-heartedly, giving absolutely no tutorial or instruction aside from a popup windows in the beginning that's shorter than this review.   The game does help with the more difficult stuff, like rendezvous with meteors and other ships by showing relative velocity vectors, but it took me a while to find them.  It definitely reminds me of Minecraft, but Minecraft could get away with it on account of it's relative simplicity.   Learning orbital mechanics without any help isn't my personal idea of fun.All-in-all, I like the direction the game is going, and I can't wait until there is more of it to play!			"

Early Access Review
								I had quite a bit of fun with this game and I expect to probably get about 10 hours out of play in its current state. That is however because I enjoy semi-realistic simulations, love orbital mechanics, have a taste for cience fiction, and am generally going through an indecisive phase in terms of entertainment.This game is far from finished but I am cautiously optimistic. I've been burned by titles like Starbound and Towns (early access before steam greenlight) in the past. Naturally I didn't expect much. This game however, is seeing regular updates. It's also changed a lot. Most of the guides are outdated and there seems to be quite a shift in how manufacturing mechanics work.Lets start with what you should expect from this game at the time of writing. There are lovely orbital physics, even thought they feel a bit clunky compared to KSP (which is this game's nearest comparison). The idea of having to collect lots of resources (12 at this time) is actually kind of cool, but again clunky. By clunky I mean the following. So orbital physics works, but as a vetran of KSP I know how imporant it is to know your prograde/retrograde vector (i.e the line that runs at a tangent to your orbit). This isn't difficult to code but is not in the game at all, all intercepts have to be done manually (you get no intercept vector) with lots of tedious course correction which would be fine if fuel wasn't such a massive concern. This leads to resources, to get fuel you need to mine ice, which can then be broken into oxygen and hydrogen by using a fuel maker. This gives you your propulsion, and you will need to carry huge quantities of this fuel to get anywhere significant. On top of these 3 resources you will need at least 1 cargo container for each of the 8 other elements which are commonly used to manufacture components. You'll find yourself frantically managing these containers because once a resource output has filled up the container it dumps it dumps it in another empty  one. This wouldn't be so bad if the same output wasn't also the input for when you want to use that resource to build things. What this leads to is a module being half built and you having to figure out what resource isn't properly connected to allow the build. This can legitimately take 2 to 5 minutes as it's like trying to untangle a pair of earphones. Resource connections being represented as lines that you have to trace to a point.So why do I like this game and why at 3 or so hours will I play it again? Simply, it's a great idea. A bit more casual that KSP in terms of gameplay and realism. It's also fun in different ways. The nearest comparison I can make is that if Celestial Command is to KSP what Terraria is to Minecraft. They're similar but enjoyably different. If you liked KSP but had a hankering to blow a few things up or just chill out and do some silly things like destroy a station with a mining laser, then give Celestial Command a go at some point in the future. If however you're bored of KSP and want a variation on the theme, you'll get about 3-5 hours out of this game.A final note is the game's language. I know the devs aren't native English speakers but it's just lazy. Get someone in to write tooltips for all the modules so they explain themselves properly. Otherwise it's really difficult to get into the game. Hell I'd write the tooltips for a copywriters fee. I want to see this game become a fully fledged product. I want to play it again after the major updates. So devs, if someone you know who speaks English is reading, make a few core tweaks to your resource management, orbital mechanics and your tooltips. It will make the game much more playable and much easier to recommend in it's current state. Also ditch the whole one element for each cargo container, it's just boring.			"

								definitely a fun little space game, much like Kerbal Space Program, the game is definitely a learning curve, I do recommend that if your new use the right click to move tab on the left to allow your ship to do it automatically, atleast until you get the controls, because so far ive crashed into a trading station, a planet, and the mining station(XD). I dont really see where the 2d portion comes from, it might be the art style or something else. But so far I love this game going to buy it for a friend so we can do multiplayer coop and battle. 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Here we go again, writing a Celestial Command review for the second time. I wrote my first review back when CC was in pre-alpha, and now that it has just come into alpha it felt a good time to rewrite the review to reflect the changes in the game.The original review had me listing the problems with the game:Insufficient info and not enough tools to aid flying a shipA mess of a transfer systemNo info as to your centre of mass (later pointed out to me by the dev in his response)A lack of a real goal.So I had another go at the game. And I have to say that point 1 has been dealt with by a new RTS mode, that replaces the player actually flying their ship with the fact that your ship will fly itself. Great. Solves all the problems with point one. Except that the autopilot will kamikaze ram through anything it's path to rendevous with something. Once I had to stop it rammning the station I was docking with, another it succesfully rammed a station, destroying the only docking port on the ship and burning up all the fuel.RTS should not mean babysitting all your units so they don't trash everything. There are games where you do that, but they're not RTS's, they're more the kind of free app you get on your phone to pass the time.Number 2 has been dealt with quite well, as the new arcs coming out of the 2D into 3D space can make the mess you call a ship quite easy to understand, so no more gripes there.Number 3, as I already said, the dev responded to. However, the only reason I didn't find the button to view centre of mass (or anything else) was because the game doesn't have an official tutorial as to all of it's buttons.Number 4. Oh dear. So a sandbox game, like Celestial Command, there is no ""aim"" of the game. That I appreciate. I've logged more hours in Minecraft than is healthy and KSP has sucked a good portion of my time, as has Factorio, OpenTTD and Prison Architect. All of these games don't have a main objective, or it is completely tangential to the enjoyment of the game. CC does not have a main objective. And this is the point I failed to address previously, is it's sandbox fun? Will I have fun building something for hours on end, will I reach a point where I can be proud of what I've made? I hate to say it, but no.Building something is either incredibly hard in ""survival mode"" as the player has to mine all the resources, mine enough ice to make fuel to move to mine the resources and then spent time assembling their ship. I found the enjoyment dieing at the ""mining resources"" bit. In sandbox it feels just hollow that I can slap together a ship easily.So yes the developers have made some progress, but if I was given a refund of this game and asked would I buy it again, the answer would be no, as it's not something I can really enjoy. Maybe later, when the game itself is better, but for now I know of several other games in the ""Space Sandbox"" or ""Space RTS"" or ""Space Combat"" genres that do everything CC is trying but better.

								It's a work in progress and has a long way to go. Indie gem with potential but it does feel like a lot of ambition and learning going on all at once for the small team. I worry the game has a long tail on development and may suffer some lofty goals but if you like tinkering with parts, orbital mechanics and chilling out then this early access title is worth playing around with but don't expect any navigation assistance or hand holding... this is all about 'feeling out' your vector on orbital intercepts.

								So this game has the potential to be Excellent. On my inital download of the game I played it a bit - like the mechanics and some of the ideas. Now for the huge game breaking BUT. The game is unstable -  might work might not, porbably won't, the developement team seem to be focusing on polishing the graphics and making a multiplayer available.That is fine if for paying what ever token amount of cash, you pony up for this you actually get to expereince what the game play is actually like. As it stands you won't, as of Version Alpha 0.694 the game doesn't work.Now I truly hope, the development team sort this out and perhaps take a leaf out of other developers hand books - Besieged and This war of Mine are basic fun little games that is adding new content all the time, but they still had a core idea that was interesting, engaging and above all.... Worked.			"

								For a small playthrough I hav efound two things that or annoyance, lack of a small tutorial or quick to refer to help page, and build mode not disabling engines. It's a little frustrating to have to pause the game while you build, so that you won't fly drunkely all over the place. Otherwise, I love it!It's really enjoyable and after getting a hang of everything I feel like I'm really going to be having fun with the game, a Mirror function would be nice to have for making Symetrycal ships, but that's really it.Flying and having to constantly be aware of your heading as well as where you're headed as far as gravity goes is amazingly fun and  I can't wait to get even deeper into things.another hope for this game is that they release a modding API so that people can build upon the work these three wonderful beings have already done to provide an ever greater variety to the game.TL;DR :This game is amazingly fun and very esoteric right now (especially with it's lack of tutorials), but if you're patient you'll have en extremely deep game that won't be very forgiving on mistakes because gravity actually affects you. You also look liek you'll be requiring food and a myriad of other supplies to keep you and your crew alive by what is seen right now.			"

								I posted this review originally in Feb of 14.  It was much harsher but I toned it down a bit in deference to a PM from a Dev.It is nearly June.  Major issues with game play have not been addressed. Tthe Devs appear more intent upon adding content  than  fixing what is broken.  Added content will not make Celestial Command playable.Save your pennies.---(earlier comment follow)--This game had an interesting premise.  Build a space ship & mine the asteroids using simulate somewhat realistic orbital mechanics.  There was a solid single player game in the making.Celestial Command was progressing nicely & becoming a playable game.  Then a couple months the Devs decided to focus all of their attention on multiplayer.Now long standing serious bugs are not being addressed.   Content is no longer being added.  Prior content is left incomplete.If you  purchase CelCom based upon your expectations of the finished product, be willing put  up with some serious playability issues.If the bugs get stomped and this game comes together it should be worh the wait.@Artanni: I think that MP is more important to the devs than it is to the players.

								My initial - and it is a very early comment is that this game is very very very difficult - it isn't obvious in anyway what one is meant to do, let alone how to do it. I know it is an Early Access game and therefore no tutorial, but don't expect to be able to orbit, dock or anything straight off, unless you are well versed in orbital mechanics, and you can work  out what the keys do.I will continue to try to play for a while - and wait for updates which improve the game play - but this might be one game which despite havig paid for it, it still gets left on the shelf.

								I really liked the idea of real orbital mechanics (having played KSP and loved that game!), however I had forgotten how darned hard it is, and how much TIME it takes! Waiting to set up orbital maneuvers and fiddling to rendevouz with asteroids and stations.The game was simply too time-consuming and hard for me, I wish there were some simple tools to make it easier to align correctly with other objects. The resources node system also got the better of me. I played half an hour, and got too frustrated to continue.If you've got the skills and the time, I think this could be a very interesting game to follow. For me, I'll just be looking for something more casual for the time being.			"

I still to this day dont know how to generate electricity, nor use Rockets/put them to a keyI began building random crap such as stuff with alot of Fuel tanks, i figured how to load fuel n, but not generate it.As i began building i realised alot of stuf in-game is hard to understand.After i began understanding, i ried out some stuff. Other than that i never got into the real gameplay aspects.Do i recomend it?Yes, if you understand most things such as unloading fuel, making it, stuff like thatIts not bad, just complicatedSuggestion: mak eit easyer and finish wepons, or it is a glitch im having (Cant place wepons)			"

								This is a fun little game where you can start out a spaceship and mine some asteroids and make a bigger space ship. And then the game sort of just ends. (Alternatively, you can try trading.)It is a complex game, but you will have trouble finding the information you need to play it because the developers think that wikis and other community resources spoil the game content and so they don't want you to have them. Instead you get basic introductory posts and two-year-old YouTube videos that don't answer your questions on why the warp drive refuses to work.Don't take this game seriously.			"

								I picked this up because I liked the idea of a space/orbit mining simulator.For a few dollars it would be neat to ""kick the tires"" on the future of NEA mining.The physics are broken - the orbital mechanics aren't close to real-life.They are close enough that you start playing thinking this is awesome and then weird things start happening.e.g. I deconstructed a large thruster and suddenly my ship achieved escape velocty from the planet.Despite the description on Steam that they are aiming for a good physics simulation the devs have posted that is not their intent and do not consider these things bugs.Unfortunately that makes this sim garbage.Also, bugs that are claimed fixed are still present. I believe that they fixed something but this suggest they are struggling with code-quality which does not bode well for the long-term playability of the game.			"

								EDIT: The dev keeps harassing me about this negative review, and feel the need to add several responses jut to repeat what is cleary labled above, ""EARLY ACCESS REVIEW"". We know it's early access alright? But when your basic tutorial is a mess a whole year after you release in EA, it probably tells us something about your planning.First of all, this is another one of those ""gather resources and survive"" type of games, as if we don't have enoug of those already. Second of all, this is has a HUGE learning cliff, and I'm not talking about the orbital mechanics, which alone would drive off most casual player. I'm talking about the most basic things, like how to even build your ship. To even start building, you need to follow these steps:1) ""right click the eingeering bay"" as the ""tutorial"" tells you1.1) click on every modue because you don't know which is the engineering bay, it's not like the game tells you, maybe when you hove over the part? nope, it doesn't. You just have to click every single module.1.2) find out that none of the modules brings out the engineering bay and start feeling frustrated.1.3) figure out that you need to put crew into your engineering bay, like yea why would I not do that? like isn't it basic game design that anything a player would do anyway, should be automatic?2) press c to bring up the crew panels3) drag a crew into the engineering bay4) now right click the engineering bay5) now you can build things6) find out that the things you build don't do anything because they need to be connected6.1) read that the ""tutorial"" says you need to connect the engines to whatever module 6.2) find out that you don't know which part is the engine, because again, it doesn't stell you which part is what, at all.6.3) I see where they're going with this, realistic space ships would have engines like that, but do you really expect normal people to look for engines on the SIDE of a space ship? Wouldn't they loot at the back end? and fall on their face attempting that?6.4) even though you had to drag the crews for the crew panel, you can't drag the connection nodes, yea it sounds minor but subconsciously you expect consistency from a single game so you try to drag the connection nodes and get frustrated because it doesn't do anything.6.5) and it's not a simple left click either, nope that would be too straight forward. You see this time it's right click the nodes you want to connect. 7) find out that the mining laser and the power generators they tell you build have no connectors, even though in the tutorial it tells you to connect them to whatever they have to be connected to.7.1) find out that in the ""guide"" section of this game's community page they just tell you to build the mining laser but don't tell you how to use it.7.2) find out that no matter what you do you can't make the modules do anything what so ever.8) refund this game and write a negative review.

								I have no idea what to do. if there was an actual tutorial it would be much easier to learn the basics of the game.			"

								The first game I ever ask for a refund on.  Yes it is THAT bad. Do not be fooled by the fanbois whom only give postive reviews based on what they hope and think this game will have at some point in the ""future""  In its current state it is G A R B A G E and decidedly not worth the 7$.			"

								Don't get the game.  If you did, get a refund.  Controls don't work, and gameplay is not as advertised.  If the developers had put more effort into the game than the advertisements, it might have been worth the $8.			"

								Not enjoyable. this is not a game that you can just drop in and learn to play on your own. You need to rely on various guides and video's. there is NO in-game help what so ever.I don't mind a steep learning curve, but this game basically starts 20 feet above your head and you need to go find a ladder just to figure out how to turn on your mining lasers.

								Total crap. Nothing happens when you try to build smt. Just stays forever in the building ""mode"" will never finish. No manual no nothing. Wait until game is more polished. Totally crap :(			"

								Travel is very complicated. Spent 2hours playing and still not comfortable with it. Everything else about the game is awesome! Too bad one thing ruins it for me.  "

								Not enough information on how to fly the ship.  Like it's trying to do Kerbel with apogee and perigee and no navigation assistance. Not worth the $11. Maybe worth $2.			"

								Great idea but I just can't recommend it.There is totally missing tutorial and even when you get into it after few WTFs/fails, it's not fun. Currently I think it's not EA ready, this is more prototype and will require much work to get it to playable state. When this happens, I'll be back. And I'll review this.			"

								I paid 10 bucks for a game with no instructions on how to play it.  Sure it links to a guide when you first start it, but it isn't a very good guide.  Figuring out how to play this game isn't fun, its work.			"

								This game show me, how you refund a game in steam.Despite beeing quite charming in art style, sounds are porly made, no control over ship at all, no tutorial at all (steam community guide after 2 years of development ony??) GUI is not consistent in functionalities. Please dont support this game developer. After 2 years of active development no progress has been made in core functionalities.			"
