												You think your parents are disappointed when you waste your life playing video games now? Just wait until you see how disappointed they are when you waste your life playing a video game that simulates being a janitor, while sitting in a messy room in real life. Soul crushing disappointment...100% complete update:I enjoyed this game when it was in EA, but I really fell in love with it when I came back to play the release version. The core mechanics are basically the same, but the details were greatly improved. Each map is unique and interesting and it can be approached as a bunch of individual missions or as part of a larger narrative thread. I really can't recommend this game if you are looking for a chill out game or if you are very meticulous. It's not a game for everyone because there isn't any action or enemies, but it's a delightfully unique puzzle-esque game.This is one of the few games that I wasn't ready to shelve once I 100%'d the achievements and am keeping it installed to hop in occasionally.

								This is almost inevitably going to be the new youtube craze (ie: Surgeon Simulator, Slender etc)  so before the storm of Pewdiepie and TobyGame hits the shelves, I just want to say that I absolutely freaking love this game. I could sarcastically just say ""GOTY"" and move on, but I feel like that would undermine how much fun this game actually is. When I saw people play Gmod or Surgeon Sim, I always used to wonder how some wobbly mechanics can cause such reactions. And then before I knew it, that game had me on the floor, literally crying and unable to breath with laughter. This game kicks♥♥♥♥♥PS: Someone please do a speedrun of this game. PLEASE.EDIT: Thanks 'Conditional Love' for pointing out that I misspelled ""surgeon""			"

												I'll admit, I bought this game ironicly.  100+ hours later and I'm considering getting a part time job as a janitor IRL.  There's something seriously zen about mopping up the aftermath of all these 'incidents' and not having to worry about trying to stop them for once!  As a bonus, the devs have a great sense of humor which is sprinkled throughout the various notes and incident reports in each level.If you're not into the whole zen thing, there's also a p sweet speedrun mode.  There's even character progression of sorts, in that your office is persistant and has its own secrets.My only complaint is sometimes it's not obvious when my mop is saturated with gore due to colored lighting, but I could probably just pay more attention.9/10 A+ Would clean again			"

								This game is a news flash for me, it just screams ""HEY You remember those days back in the 90's of running around a 3d map shooting 2d sprites of nazi's, cults, Zombies, Demons and aliens? Well, time to clean your f**king mess you prick!"" And just slaps me in the face with well designs maps, a mop in my hands, and a little sniffer device. This game is like your mother. Endearing, loving but down right damn unforgiving. You spilled a bucket? ""TOUGH NIPPLES Clean it up and get another bucket!"" The bin machine just dumped a few giblets down and stained the flooring with blood? ""SUCK IT UP AND KEEP CLEANING! Not my fault the machine just trolled you!"" A gib just goes haywire and the floor absorbs said gib and you cant get it to burn it? ""Restart the bloody map and start all over!"" <---(Fix this glitch please TwT) But at the end of the day, You can't hate it, Cause it is unique and feels nice to clean a map 100% and get a promotion from your advisor!But seriously fix that glitch...10/10 Would spill another blood filled bucket.

								Did you play DOOM when it was released in the 90s?  What about the original Half-Life or Unreal?  Did you ever wonder who the heck's gonna clean up after these heroes?The answer has finally been provided by the developers of VCD, and the answer --- is you.There is no story.  There is you.  There is a mop.  There is a bucket of water.  You have no idea who is responsible for the carnage; you only know it's your task to clean up after it.For such a strange idea for a game, the developers have really outdone themselves in my opinion.  They have taken an idea that likely only tugs at the corner of the minds of .01% of the total FPS-gaming population and made a game out of it.  They've made a game that seems incredibly boring actually fun.As a Janitor for the Viscera Cleanup Detail company, each facility you visit must be painstakingly mopped; all the trash must be picked up; and all the body parts must be incinerated.  How you complete this task is up to you, but that facility had better be spotless when your supervisors arrive, or you risk losing your job (and that's actually an Achievement).After completing a facility, you return to your ""office,"" and can read reports on your progress.  These reports vary from employee commendations to tongue-in-cheek company newsletters, and really add to the experience.  You are also able to take ""trophies"" with you should you so choose by placing them in the blue trunk that you take with you to each job.People who don't enjoy ironic humor, or never played an FPS, should stay well away.  But if you love watching the gibs fly on any contemporary FPS game; or even enjoyed the pixelated trips down Memory Lane of DOOM or Duke Nukem 3D;  or even the bump-mapped polygons of Unreal and Half-Life, this is a must-have in your collection.  You already blew the place to smithereens; didn't you mom teach you pick up after yourself?			"

								#1 - This game preys on people with OCD.#2 - I didn't know I could jam 1.5 bodies into a bio hazard box, maybe more if they're in smaller chunks.#3 - I now know what my mother went through when cleaning up our house while I was growing up.#4 - This must be what experienced serial killers have to go through on a regular basis in order to get rid of evidence.#5 - Over stuffed a bio hazard box with gibs, tried to take it to the incinerator but hit a wall, knocked almost everything out, fell on the floor, splattered blood and guts everywhere. Went to clean I up with my mop but it was dirty so I only smeared it around and made it worse. Went to go find my bucket only to realize I left a trail of bloody footprints down the hall and gave me three times more work to do.5/5 - would burn body bags again.			"

								Most realistic janitor sim ever when you play with friends. Everyone starts the day trying their best to clean up, and you even start divvying out jobs like bucket brigading or mopping while someone else gets you water/boxes to help put stuff away. And then someone discovers that the equipment dispenser can fire like a cannon. Or that it'd be cute to make a mess behind the guy cleaning up. Or you try and slam dunk buckets into an incinerator and one gets stuck in the rafters, so you have to start stacking crates to get up there. My mate Charlie even got so into it that he started doing sick tricks like putting buckets on the heads of corpses and doing live puppet shows for us with them. And Jamal thought it'd be 'real pimp' to stack a bucnh of buckets until they fall over and completely cover the floor in blood. But hey, what are friends for.Ridiculously useless. 10/10.			"

												This is not an easy game to review. So I'm just going to wing it.It's long, it's boring, it's dull; and that's explicitly why I love it.This is not a game about shooting, bleeding, goring, slashing, looting, any of that; this is a game about cleaning after all the aforementioned has been said and done..You're not a space marine, you're a space janitor. There are multiple tools, water buckets (which will dirty as you clean off your mop in it, don't spill it either or it'll make a bigger mess), brooms (only efficient for sweeping tiny things), sniffers (to find missed messes though these can be turned off), stationary incinerators (how you get rid of garbage), wastebaskets (to put the garbage in to carry it) and maybe one or two other things I'm forgetting at the moment.There's something cathartic, something calming about this game and others like it that completely break the status-quo because they try to simulate what is ultimately mundane and boring, but in a game format. You're not getting shot at, you're not getting killed, there's no real threat (as far as I'm aware) on any of the levels; just you, your mop, and whatever level of determination you have to actually get the job done.The maps will tell you an estimated time they take to complete, and boy can they actually take HOURS to get done, which is why it's nifty there's a co-op feature so you can call in your friends to expediate the process. Graphics wise, it looks very nice and is very well optimized.So, if you want a good looking, boring game about cleaning up bloody messes, then this is definitely the game for you!Post Edit: Please don't add me and expect me to A) Buy the game for you.B) Play with you. You would think this would be common sense but it apparently isn't.			"

												This is an excellent co-op game with friends! The game first might seem like cheap youtuber bait that's fun physics for an hour, but actually it is a really solid game that I keep wanting to play again and again. It might not sound appealing (yeah you're cleaners and handymen and you have to do your boring job, no shooting), but I've yet to play a session that didn't have tons of laughter.In theory, it could be described as an efficiency puzzle game. What is the best way to sort out this mess? Do you start collecting body parts first because they leak blood around? Do you start mopping the blood first so others don't leave more bloody footprints around? Do you start with the welder to fix bullet holes which will definitely cause some fires and leave messy scorch marks? What is the safest path to the incinerator? Which one of you put this stick of dynamite in my biohazard bin?In reality though, it becomes this slapstick Laurel & Hardy simulator. Cue the Pat & Mat theme, you're carrying something explosive carefully to another part of the level for safe disposal, but on the way your friend is mopping the floors and walls while having his bucket full of bloody mess in the middle of the corridor. You fail to spot the bucket, trip over it, spilling the red muck all over the clean hall and then whatever you were carrying hits the wall, setting it off, at least causing a fire if not outright explosion. The mess gets hilariously worse, some of you probably die and you're laughing your asses off.The workplace safety is atrocious here, you can trigger deadly defense turrets, switch on the gravity while your friend is floating 15 meters up, nudge your friend into a Sarlacc pit while he's cleaning near it, you can crank the company boombox volume so loud it will detonate nearby explosives with the bass. All of this would be terrible in an actual cleaning job, but here failure just creates more hilarity (and deaths). For added stupidity, I'd suggest trying out a control scheme you're not too familiar with, spilling buckets with the Steam controller's gyro was amusing.On top of carrying brains, mopping blood and supplying vending machines and repairing machinery, you can be a detective by discovering clues and investigating the death scenes. What event took place here and killed everyone? Rogue AI? Bioterrorism? Madness-inducing artifact? For bonus points, in the post-level survey you can try to deduce the actual causes of death for each corpse. Was this guy eviscerated by an alien lifeform, but the other guy in the room actually shot himself before that?The levels are really well designed, full of hidden details and endless nods towards movies. For example, there's a pretty accurate Event Horizon map, complete with toggleable gravity and an accident-prone airlock! There's even a sort of on-going plot throughout the game, one of your colleagues has gone crazy and has hidden clues over the levels, you're supposed to deduce where his hideout is located and how to get there.Some of the missions take just half an hour, the longest ones might take over three hours if you're really OCD and want to 100% clean every corner. It might work as a solo game for some, but it's definitely best in multiplayer, progress is quicker and there's more possibilities for funny mishaps with a crowd. Because this game isn't actually a shooter or just a walking simulator, it's something really unique and I would recommend everyone to at least try it if they have the chance, unless you can't handle blood and splatter comedy.Finishing a level is optional, it's even pretty funny to just pick a map and make more mess with the bucket physics so it ends up looking like the lawnmower scene from Braindead. But then again, just cleaning after a horrendous massacre so all that's left is shining chrome and polished corridors is oddly satisfying...			"

								If you and a group of your friends regularly play co-op games together, this is a must have for you (voice chat is a must).  You've heard of first person shooter games?  Well, folks, this is a first person cleaner game; the shooting has happened, the world is saved, and you are the janitorial staff tasked with cleanup.   I have never hated saviors of mankind as much as I have while picking up their discarded ammo casings and fixing bullet holes in the walls.Reasons why it's great for co-op:1.  The satisfaction you and your friends get when seeing actual progress in transforming the unique environment of the game you're playing.  Seriously, this sounds weird, but we feel great seeing what we had to work with and what we made it into.  I never expected to enjoy playing the game as much as I did and I was shocked at how much fun the friends I gave my four pack to liked it.2.  Hearing them argue about the best methods to dispose of a body (record for blackmail later!).3.  Seeing them walk into a room, look up, and exclaim, ""Oh god...HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!""Early Access Tips:Remember, if you play the game now, it's not going to be at its best.  Early access means it's rough and there's definitely some code optimization and collision detection going on that can be frustrating (and sometimes funny as hell) to work with.When hosting a game, it's a direct connect type.  So make sure the person hosting has a pretty decent computer and a solid internet connection.  If you can't connect to their sever, they may need to setup port forwarding.  The ports used by this game are 7777 and 27015If you get a ""too many actors"" error message on your server, it means there's too many unique items.  This can happen from tracking too many player bloody footprints around.  Happened a lot when we were doing a 4-man cleanup team.  To solve this, have someone get rid of all the ammo casings on the ground (pick up and drop in the incinerator) and the rest of the group should focus on getting a specific area of floor clean.  Of all blood and gore.   To prevent this from happening (until it gets fixed) try making little clear footpaths to all the necessary machines (incinerator & bucket maker).			"

I played a level for about 2 hours without even realising it, I just got into a routine and just played without even realising it.One thing I will say is the physics are tempermental to say the least, put too many body parts and bullets into the biohazard bins and it will go crazy and half the bullets will fall out the bottom and the arms will flail everywhere and get blood all over your nice clean walls. Which brings me onto the water buckets, knocking a bloody water bucket over to see it spill over your nice clean floor is the most depressing thing that has happened to me.On the whole, a good laugh and a new take on sci fi violence that makes you feel sorry for the cleaners in Gears of WarCheck out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Fridayhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg "

												So, if you're the type of person who looks at the reviews first, you might be wondering: What is Viscera Clean-Up detail? To quickly summarize, it's basically a game where you clean up the aftermath of your average old-school FPS level/sci-fi movie mishap. Mopping up blood, burning the remains of gored aliens etc. It's a game almost certainly born from a joke, but it's execution certainly isn't one. You're given a variety of cleaning implements to perform your job, from things as low-tech as a simple, if slightly stylized mop to as futuristic as a laser gun that can mend bullet holes, and actually doing a thorough job takes an understanding of all the gadgets on your toolbelt. It's bizarrely relaxing, and perfect for doing things like listening to podcasts or audiobooks over. Much like the games it lampoons there's also plenty of fun secrets to find, including a bunch of momentos you can take back to your office at Aerospace Sanitation and put on display. Speaking of your office, even it has secrets to discover! There's even a sort of larger narrative one can slowly piece together across the game's many levels if they take the time to really search every nook and cranny. It's a lot of fun. This all comes from someone who played the game entirely single player, so I can't speak to the funcitionality or fun factor of the multiplayer personally, but having seen the YouTuber Criken's video on it, I get the impression it's a blast, whether your friends are actually interested in cleaning or not. Overall, I'd very much recommend Viscera Clean-Up detail.			"

								First off, VCD is not finished yet, hence the 'early access' thing.  With that out of the way, RuneStorm's drudgery simulator is bloody good fun.  Taking on the role of the poor fool who has to clean up the mess the hero left behind him, your basic kit is a mop, though you can also get a broom if you see one, plus a bucket and a bin.  As a sandbox game it also does a good job of simulating worker boredom in a way that's far from boring for the player.  If anyone's ever done a really dull, manual job with no redeeming features, you'll sympathize with the Space Janitor as he scatters boxes, abuses the spot welder by melting random stuff, makes amusing piles of body parts, writes on the floor with the blood on his boots... all that good stuff.  When you're not incinerating things that don't belong to you and treading blood into the carpet, you can also steal stuff via your special Janitor's Trunk.  For every Rambo and Ripley out there, you'll find an army of long-suffering Space Janitors armed with nothing more deadly than a mop, rolling their eyes and tutting as they get down to the real work.  Go on, give them a hand.  They need all the help they can get.			"

Simulatory Goodness!Viscera Cleanup Detail is easily one of my most favorite titles of 2014.  From a premise so insanely simple comes one of the most interesting, gloriously monotonous games I have ever had the fortune to play.As a space-station janitor, your life is a thankless one. Wake up, go to work, come back, get shouted at by manager and go to sleep knowing that the day after will no doubt be exactly the same. So what makes this game so awesome to play? This is a game for the people who want something to play, but don't want to work their mind too much... This is a game in which you can watch a TV show, listen to a podcast or some excellent music whilst you play. Many hours have been spent catching up on podcasts and cleaning away to my hearts content.While it is indeed early access, that should by no means put any potential buyers off, as it is frequently updated with new maps, janitorial tools and in the near future, workshop support, meaning that a multitude of mods will no doubt arrive to spice up the game even further!In summation, this is an early access game that does it right, in a sea of so many underwhelming titles. I would DEFINITELY recommend it.Now what are you waiting for? Go grab a mop and get to work!			"

Recommended on a conditional basis*!Also, prepare for a long detailed read.First of all, understand what Viscera Cleanup Detail is about: You're a space janitor; You have a mess; You must clean the mess- or you'll be fired.Seems simple enough, but the devil is in the details- and single detail is this: This game is hard. Based solely on the fact that you cannot meander about doing a bit of one thing, and a bit of another; You have to have a strategy on the order in which you do things. You can, and will spend an hour or two on one level- if you let yourself go that far.""This sounds like a commitment."" I hear you say, and yes! It is- and it has to be one that you find enjoyable in order to truly appreciate the subtle fun that this game has to offer.*This game is fun, because it offers a challenge that current games lack: Self management, and to an extent- self control. You will not have some computerized message on-screen to tell you: ""Pick up the body parts first"" or ""Mop a path to the incinerator and bucket dispenser in order to minimize bloody footprints"" you learn these things as you go, and you have to be willing to experiment, and keep an open mind in order to succeed.So, on a closing note- if you like experimenting with processes, as well as organizing yourself in a productive manner- then congratulations! You'll likely enjoy this game a lot!If you're more the sort who likes to make a mess of things, and loves playing with body parts, and spilling buckets of blood everywhere, then you'll still like the game, but you'll likely get bored of it quicker, and lose friends over playing hockey with an intestine.

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is one of the most relaxing games I've ever played.You'd think it'd be annoying to pick up all those bullet shells--and you're right, it kind of is--but mopping up all that blood and dumping those body parts in the incinerator really helps you to unwind after a stressful day.

												This is one of those games that really shouldn't be fun, but somehow is. Take one bloody mess, add some barely functioning machinery and a lot of darkly amusing little bits of janitor ""lore"", throw in an uncontrollable boombox that vibrates its way around the room when you turn it on (with funky electronica that can be entertaining and utterly irritating at the same time) and stir it all together to make a super-gory, toingue-in-cheek Janitor Sim.Kick back, turn off your brain, and get cleaning. Or make an even bigger mess, possibly with the help of some friends,  maybe even get fired (there's an achievement so it must be possible). Whatever floats your boat. Don't forget to steal the identity chips for all the poor dead souls and pop them in your janitor's supply chest. They don't need them, right?			"

								There's just something zen about throwing the human remains in to the bins followed by nice meaty squish sound. Or your gloves and your mop squeaking while you clean stuff. And incenerating EVERYTHING!I've gotta be honest and say that I never thought this game would be this entertaining when playing alone. But it is.I've got no gamer friends, so can't say about the multiplayer much, but I can imagine it would be a blast. Especially the unearthly excavation map, where you could nudge your friend in the monster pit.The developer is doing frequent updates and gives much information about the development process.And there's the factor of waiting in excitement to see what cool things the developer has added this patch.28 hours played and not even done the 2 newest maps yet.

								I'm obviously in the minority on this, but as hilarious as the concept of this game is, it just isn't very fun for extended periods. Yes, it's hilarious in theory to be cleaning up after horrible sci-fi accidents, but running back and forth between a few rooms for hours to clean every last drop of blood and gore doesn't have much lasting appeal. It's a work simulator, and it starts to feel like work pretty fast.edit: As a side note, I've only played single player so far, and I have a feeling it's probably much more fun playing with friends.

												I've played so much of this game, it's to the point where, in the middle of playing DOOM, I was thinking about where my bucket and mop are.  As someone who likes to put things in order, and make progress towards a goal, this game is like the satisfaction of playing a perfect game of solitare, where all the cards eventually fall into place.  This game is like a zen experience.  Just you and your mop, working towards a goal.  There's no time limit, no limit on the number of buckets, or anything, so you can always make progress and finish a level if you have the desire to.			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail is a unique thing. Those of you who've played the gory games like Dead Space, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, will maybe have once joked that you don't envy whoever has to clean the mess up that you, in those games, makes.Turns out that is EXACTLY the case in VCD. YOU are the shmuck who got sent to the blood-drenched space station AFTER the Bald McAngry Spacemarine protagonist of another adventure had passed through. YOU are the poor sod who has to pick up all the limbs, the guts, the organs, all of it. YOU are the janitorial staff hired to clean up after the incidents.That is what makes it so oddly satisfying and brilliant all at once. There is no big bad enemy bosses, there is no universe to save, there is no multi-level demon destroying slaughter. There is only you, and the aftermath of the previous examples. Something had happened here, judging by the abundance of guts and trash and casings...but that isn't what you're paid to think about, really. You're cleaning up after the story has happened.The levels are quite diverse, ranging from a trashy, smelly waste disposal area to an entire digsite or even a zero gravity chamber, all of them filled to the brim with things that need mopped up or incinerated or both. Some even have their own unique gimmick, such as the Sandtraps of Unearthly Excavation that can be fed items, though it may just regurgitate other items and cause further mess.The game is somewhat passive aggressive in it's design. Your automated waterbucket dispenser can jam and sometimes spew out bodyparts, which can make a mess. Or your Biohazard Bin dispenser can spew out some gibs...which needs cleaned up as well. The game does it's best to let you know that your job is grisly. You will need to take bloody buckets to be incinerated, you will need more buckets to mop up a spilled bucket. You'll need bins to carry all that viscera to the incinerators too...but that might just make more mess if you spill any.It becomes oddly satisfying to turn a gory scene entirely on it's head. Make everything nice again, put it together, organize boxes. Do well enough and you'll be promoted. Do even better and you'll get an Employee of the Month award! The 'feedback' given to you outside of Speedrun mode gives the game little snippets of flavor. If you do well, you'll receive a meaningless promotion with very minute and insignificant changes to your lifestyle, such as a 5% salary increase, or a slightly bigger locker. Of course, your colleagues begin to hate you for this, because then the company expects higher performance from them too. This has no real changes evident in gameplay, but you CAN collect multiple Employee of the Month awards to decorate your office with...All in all, VCD is still Early Access but hell, if it can make a strangely tedious job like janitorial work satisfying in a weird way, money well spent.Also if you see Bob, notify security immediately.

												On paper, the concept of Viscera Cleanup Detail is remarkably mundane.  As a space janitor assigned in the aftermath of a brutal conflict between humans and aliens, it's your job to get a mop, a bucket and a bin and go around tidying up.  That's it.  In practice, however, what you get is a massively compulsive and fulfilling experience.  There are a good handful of varied maps available, from simple maintenance tunnels to more advanced zero gravity setups onboard spaceships.  Each scenario can take anywhere from 45 minutes to a hefty 3-4 hours to comprehensively clean.  Using your mop, you'll rid the floors and walls of pools of blood and dirt, sweep up spent bullet casings and discarded litter with your brush, and deposit the mutilated remains of humans and aliens alike into your handy biohazard bin.  There is also a nifty tool called the ""laser welder"", which allows you to remove bullet holes from the environment.Once you near the end of your janitorial duties, you can use the sniffer tool to help you find any small bits you might have missed.  It has two settings: one for detecting organic material, such as body parts, and the other for detecting inorganic material, like empty food containers and drinks cans.  When you're confident you've found everything, you can ""punch out"", whereupon you'll be greeted by a post-assignment screen informing you of your overall completion percentage.  If you're the OCD type, discovering you missed even a mere 0.5% can be devastating.I've found Viscera Cleanup Detail to be the perfect ""chill out"" experience.  There's something oddly satisfying and calming about moving slowly through an area, cleaning it as you go, knowing that you're edging closer and closer to returning it to a more presentable standard.  Now if only these feelings translated into how I feel about real life housework.			"

												This game is strangely facinating. The music gets kind of old after a while, some of the bins and boxes and stuff spazz out some times, and there is no tutorial, but other than that, it is a really fun game.This is not just a game about cleaning floors and limbs and stuff. There is lore hidden in each level, and you have to figure out what really happened. There is also a mysterious person by the name of ""Bob"" who you have to find, and you can pick up clues on various levels. You can also customize your office by bringing collectables and other objects from various levels back to your office, so there's lots of fun with that.			"

												It's a very interesting game. There's a certain zen that comes from just sitting back and completing a task. It's similar to the satisfaction from making deliveries in Euro Truck Simulator.In any case, one of the more interesting parts is simply exploring a giant level and seeing all the cool sci-fi crap sitting around. Some of these levels are beautiful, sans the blood and guts.My only complaints would be that sometimes it's a bit vague whether the level is clean or not and the grading is very unforgiving (it hurts to do a full level for the first time, meticulously clean everything you think you need to clean and get a 76% rating). Once you read a bit and figure out all the crap you need to do, it's a little easier. It might ruin some of the magic of a first time playthrough though.It's on special so I'd definitely pick it up. I'm sure it's a good laugh in co-op. I have no idea if the developers will provide any support or content past the release though.			"

YouTube™ Video: Viscera Cleanup Detail Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 569		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘Viscera Cleanup Detail’ for Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

We all know about horror games and how gory they can be. Now we live the role of the janitors after the horror games. The poor underpaid overworked janitors in whom have to clean the mess. I thoroughly enjoyed this game however, it's a boring concept which is so fun. (how does that work out?) I mean - If we wanted to clean, we would do it in real life? Naaah!I would recommend it to those people who are weird like me, in the fact they find simulations fun when in fact we could be doing it in real life and getting money for it. Those who have a severe case of OCD and from the screenshots are already twitching in anticipation and people who are a fan of cleaning. Cleaning enthusiasts unite!I would avoid if you're looking for action, adrenaline or stories with a deeper point.I have documented much more into the short preview in which you can view to see if it's your cup of tea.

								Is your room a mess right now?  Have you been thinking, ""Man, I need to clean this up?""  Then this is the ultimate procrasinator for you.The obsessive-compulsive be warned, this is a game that will finally end the horror of opening and closing the fridge door 7 times in a row, but never ease the time commitment.  Why?  Because you'll develope a new tick:  Cleaning up video game slaughter using only a handful of janitor's tools.  Imagine cleaning the corridors of a DOOM game days after the hero has left?  Imagine cleaning a museums of artifacts held by an evil private collector after a fatal gang shooting?The player enters a game with a mop, bucket, trash can, and incinerator for body parts and other subversive materials.  If the player is careful, all can be cleaned up fairly quickly.  If the player is not careful, he could create his own mess.  Pro-Tip: don't spill buckets of blood and don't drop body parts.  Blood gets into carpets.There is something very satisfying about this game.  It appeals to the sense of accomplishment.  We all feel down now and then, and this game hits on that nerve.  We're offered the afrtermath of a slaughter and need to clean it up.  And when we do clean it up, we get this great sense of accomplishment, eventhough only virtually.  It's silly, but one of the best things you can do when depressed is scrub your toilet.  It sounds silly, but it makes a person feel as if they have accomplished and done something good or great.  It offers a sense of cleanliness and goodness.This game does the same.Unless you play muliplayer.  Then this game turns into a vindictive bloodbath after someone bonks into another player and blood is spilled...and tracked all over that floor I just cleaned!  This game can be a Cinderalla's nightmare.Is it fun?  No.  But it is rewarding.  It is the gold star you never got in 3rd grade.  It is the redemption you deserve for cleaaning your friend's vomit at a party.  It excuses that one time you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants.  This game is worth it.			"

												This is a game to zone out to, listen to some music, or put on a podcast and chill. Starting some of the maps feel like you've been dropped into the middle of a pacific oil spill with a pack of tissues and a bucket of good intentions, but that just makes it all the more pleasing to see the level be transformed as you work away at it like the gameplay equivalent of trying to get a gobstopper to fit in your mouth comfortably by licking away at it until your tongue bleeds. The graphics are surprisingly great, and there's more to it than just mopping up messes and carting out bodies. You get bonuses for repairing level specific objects and stacking things in the right loading areas, or by using a welding gun to melt an eldritch tentacle into a single cauterized blob for easy transport. (That is a real tactic)You can really be very tactical/logical about the whole thing, and for some people - myself included - many hours of slow methodical not-quite-work is a wonderful way of spending the time.The levels are all interesting and distinct; from the enemies to the colours used in the lighting. There's a bunch of references and homages to horror and scifi throughout the game, and plenty of easter eggs, some you can even take with you to your office to start a trophy room. You're absolutely as much a traveller as a Janitor, it pays to be observant!Music is...interesting. Apparently Polka really takes off in the future.Workshop support is icing on the corpse. They even give you a copy of UDK to do your own things, no messing around with loading packages, it all works right from the menu.Only problem I can see with it is multiplayer isn't especially user-friendly - I've never been on a multiplayer server since the browser doesn't work too good. That or there are no internet servers. LAN probably works fine though!			"

Viscera Cleanup Detail is easily one the most addicting and flat out amusing games i have played in my entire measly existance.Would rate 12/10. Lasers and dynamite. Even a sarlaak pit.			"

												After more than 30 hours I have to admit I long for more and more levels. I want to clean up more and on even more varied stages. If only the creators had named their child The Space Janitor! Or something a little more catchy!The pictures speak for themselves: as a janitor you need to clean up the leftovers of a huge massacre. Imagine your favourite horror movie or video game and that particular scene where a battle ensues between people and monsters or aliens and the ending result is a huge pile of body parts and pools of blood in every which way. This is what Viscera presents you on different stages and this is what you're gonna spend hours and hours with in order to have everything cleaned up. Now, the game is not as easy as first seems: your mop quickly becomes dirty and the bucket of clean water eventually turns red. You go back to a machine to get more and the same goes for the containers that are used to collect trash and body parts.Eventually, you drop everything into a huge incinerator and, if desired, you can even stack all the crates and barrels on the stage to one of its corners. Oh, and you also have secondary objectives such as plant some seeds or get rid of some nasty pit monsters. And in case you are interested to know what caused the massacre you can look for tablets or notes telling you the horrible tale behind each level! Finally, it all comes down to the work you have done: a perfectly tidied map that is spotless from beginning to end!At this point the only downside of the game is its early access stage. Playing with somebody in multiplayer requires the IP address and even then connecting is a bit difficult. Moreover, I haven't had any session without issues - my team mate always experienced connection problems and he was unable to see me or move certain objects for a short period of time. At this point the only polish I need from the developers is a better - flawless - multiplayer experience.Viscera is a game with an original idea and playing it is just huge fun. Once you get hooked, you'll soon find yourself accomplishing all objectives on all levels but thank god we have Steam Workshop!UPDATE:A lot has changed since I wrote my review. The game has finally been released leaving its early access stage once and for all. New levels were added along with a radio to each level (the soundtrack is quite neat). Plus, a Halloween-themed DLC has been released not to mention the many achievements that were added to the game. This is now a superb game that's worth every penny! Net code has also been optimised and it's nice to see the community creating new levels!			"

								Before I get to it, I want to mention I can only handle this game for about a half hour at a time. Less if I dump a bin full of body parts on the way to the incinerator! That said...PROS:1. Fresh and unique concept2. Physics sandbox with body parts!3. Open ended! (not really, but you CAN CHOOSE to punch out early and be a failure)4. Makes me realize what a mess I made in Dead Space! Ewww...CONS:1. No backpack vacuum for tiny things like shell casings or intestine chunks.2. Makes no reference to Roger Wilco besides the game itself (none that I've found anyway)3. Does not have Astro Chicken arcade machine with working mini game in the office. C'mon devs!It's one thing to take an over-powered weapon and lay waste to every living thing in a game map... it's something completely different to take your under-powered mop and make it all better after the fact. If you're not sure, wait for a sale, but if you like any kind of first person game, you should at least try it!			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is a game where you a janitor in space cleaning up horrible incidents and massacres. You get many tools to help with each situation for each map, for example: The laser welder helps get rid off bullet holes and certain broken-in spots on the maps. maps range in size from small to huge, The multiplayer co-op functions suprisingly well, i haven't experienced any issues with both splitscreen and online. You also have the incenerator, i use this thing all the time and is the only real thing you can use to destroy things. Bloody footstep OH dont get me started on those mixed with the blood buckets, they are frustration that is hard to avoid.Pros:Great gameplay Physics and graphics are amazing Multiplayer is polished and fun Many hours of gametime and re-playability with the speedrun mode Soundtrack is amazing for getting the job doneThe ammount of optimization was astonishing!Cons:No server browserLaggy at some parts (Always get rid of your empty/bloody buckets!)Lots of server lag: even with a server browser you need very good internet to have decent connection to others.Overall score: (9/10) Straight up. This game in my opinion is an amazing game to play with friends and to just kill time. and since its coming out of Early access today i hope we get some new online features like server browsing.			"

---------------------------------------------------Original 2014 Review...OCD may also be a 'system' requirement...I just spent more time cleaning up a massacre today than the mess in my house. Something about cleaning has an instant gratification built into it - you can see your progress.I recorded my first romp in the game....

			I go crazy for cleaning in the new ""Viscera Cleanup Detail"". (Alpha v0.25) This was my first time really trying the game out. This was meant to be an objective play through without comments.		

Very playable and bug-free for an early release, great graphics, nice physics, FUN, and believe it or not there is a strategy to cleaning up a mess. No tutorial really needed - you know how to clean up a mess right? The mechanics work how you would expect them too.This game and Surgeon Sim take great stabs at de-sensitizing you to blood and gore while keeping the humor high. But seriously, someone has to clean up the messes, right?I'm really looking forward to seeing this game get built out more.			"

								This game is the first of its kind, and should be considered a FPJ type game. (First Person Janitor).I wish I could tell you why this game is worth playing, why it's worth buying, but I myself still cannot comprehend why I enjoy this game.While playing it, there are moments of self observation in which I laugh at myself ""I can't believe I'm playing a Janitor simulator, lol."" but then I keep playing. There is something peaceful and calming about the game, cleaning up every bit of blood and gore is satisfying for some reason. I still cannot understand why.There is merit in the fact that this game had my sister in law, a person who rarely plays video games, hooked on the game for 6 hours straight. How does a Janitor simulator DO THAT? What magic is this?!The game is still in early access mode and as such, there are glitches. Don't expect everything to work perfectly. In order to enjoy this game, you MUST have the ability to laugh at yourself, and not take things too seriously. You will knock over buckets of blood, your waste bins will glitch out with dismembered, break dancing feet and throw all that trash you picked up everywhere. (this only happened to me once though!)I do appreciate it as a game though, there is a challenge and it is the challenge of patience and dexterity. This game is not full of inventory menus, you don't go up to an incinerator, click it and select which items go on like in Minecraft. This game operates on physics yo, and since that's case, you have to pick things up, orient them, carry and place them carefully wherever you need them. It takes strategy, skill and patience to beat this. It takes patience, humility and a good sense of humor to enjoy it. 11/10 would watch dismembered, break dancing feet again.			"

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can clean you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my space mop.

Its even more difficult when given various body parts to incinerate, tnt to handle safely(or not), and a whole ton of other crap.Somehow I've managed to spend more time playing this game and cleaning up a virtual mess for a longer period of time than I've actually spent cleaning IRL.

								This game's multiplayer is Friendship Ending/10. Comes with its own gamemode, the traitor janitor.This game will put everything you've ever known about cleaning to the test... and then demolish it. Why? Because apparently the janitors are so strong that they can heft an 80 lbs box into the air while their janitor friend stands on it. You can have great fun pretending to be the voice of the man that was cleaved in half, or make his legs dance on their way to the incinerator. All of this is great fun! But never more so than liting up a stick of dynamite, standing in the doorway to the incinerator and saying, ""Cowabung--KABOOOOOM!!!!!!""Be warned, though. Your friends will hate you for that, they might even stop playing BECAUSE of it.			"

Hours played when writing review : 78Viscera is a really awesome game to relax. You can't clean your own messes, but you'll be glad to be paid to clean someone else's mess! You can find aliens, dead bodies, and more all while finding out secrets, mechanics, and who these people are and what really happened to them.Pros :+ Awesome controls and pretty optimized.+ You can over-fill bins and chuck them into outer space.+ You're now an artist as you paint walls with blood & alien guts!+ Putting bins inside of each other isn't easy, but you can accomplish ANYTHING in this game.+ Lots of secrets and fun things for you to find.Cons :- Overgrowth map is really laggy (to almost unplayable) for some players.- I once got stuck inside the incinerator. Without burning to death.- Sometimes finding or hosting a multiplayer server is buggy. [Can't even find server, etc]Overall :9/10 stars.This game is incredibly fun, either by yourself or with a group of friends. [It's also a GREAT game for couples!] It will take you at LEAST 50 hours to fully complete the game (all maps and steam achievements) which is awesome because who only wants to spend 2 hours on a game???For Christmas, it's cool to gift people.Need new steam friends?Feel free to add me!* Please comment on my profile you found me from my review.

Well, this game is a janitor simulator except instead of cleaning floors and human excrement off of toilet seats, you're cleaning up body parts and blood.  Take away the sci-fi element and the game simply becomes a labor simulator.			"

												There just something about this game that makes me come back to it over and over again. It is legit fun and I cannot fully explain why other than, it just is. However, playing this game alone can be a real drag. Not that you have to do all the massive work alone and it's just more work for you. But because it's just, dull. This game shines best in multiplayer. As buggy and messed up the multiplayer STILL is (Though they are working on it slowly), it's uber fun and great.The hidden surprises this game offers are pretty cool. And the workshop is filled with many new and awesome maps (Can't say it's easy to create your own but it's whatever)There are some problems and it's not perfect. Items glitching through walls indering your performence rating. Sometimes the game won't flat out lanuch or strange lag spikes. Physics system can be more annoying than it's worth and there is zero tutorials what so ever.Another issue isn't really with the game, but most players seem to host private / password protected games which seems to hurt it's already required and messy multiplayer mode even more.If users own the house of horror DLC, other users who don't own this DLC cannot join it for the most part. It still needs work, clean up the multiplayer a bit, a tutorial and maybe even some type of Janitor customize and for $13. Viscera Clean-up Detail is one of those Fun Co-Op games that all players should play. At least once.C'mon, add me up and let's get to work!			"

								This title intrigued me so I figured I'd grab a copy and have at it. I played a single level and cleaned everything I could. There was a part that was too high to jumpo and you had to create a staircase out of crates. This alone took over 30 minutes as the mechanics to pickup and drop with any precision is quite poor. Yes you can drop something easy enough put if it tilts because you brushed passed something then it lands out of alignment.I was hoping for a small semblance of story but this is just a sandbox with nothing to do but clean. It might get better with multiplayer but I think it may only last a game or two before the group wants to move onto something else.It does look fairly good graphically and the squishy noises are fun but I was underwhelmed and can't see me wanting to go back to this.The only thing that could draw me back is for a story mode to be added that is silly and funny, perhaps just catching glimpses of the ""hero"" that is making all this mess. Perhaps you can even get paid a bonus for good cleaning so you can purchase improved cleaning products, or a discarded weapon the hero dropped like a flamethrower to help remove those pesky bodies. Jump jets to reach high places. Water cannons to get to the gore on the roof. With these additions I would be swayed to return.Thanks for reading.			"

								This is such a weird, silly concept for a game. When I first heard of it, I was like, ""Wha?"" No interest in cleaning within a video game. Who would be interested in that? It's boring, monotonous, and... just a waste of time. Then I got the Shadow Warrior level included with that game. Went, ""Ehhh,"" and gave it a shot. Played through it twice in a row, eight hours over the course of two days. Holy crap, it was good. SO good that I HAD to buy the full game.Why is it so good, you ask? It's the most unique game I've ever played. Almost hypnotic when it comes to starting the game, grabbing a bin and bucket, and just turning off your brain for a while. Listen to some music, maybe a fun or informative podcast, and hours disappear in a flash. And that sense of satisfaction you get when you clean an area perfectly? Earn an Employee of the Month award plaque? It's oddly amazing for something as tedious and downright repetitive as cleaning. But it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.And I didn't even get into its morbid sense humor. The way you find body parts everywhere, little notes from people who used to work in these facilities you're cleaning, and countless other tiny (and not so tiny) details lends itself to some of the most memorable humor I've seen in quite some time. To roam around and find the results of something gone horribly awry is strangely fascinating. And now it's up to you to clean it all up. Get to work already, ya slacker! *shaking fist*Play this lovely, lovely game. Just play it. It is WAY too enjoyable to play in the most bizarre way possible, hence why I've already dumped 76 hours into it (with many, MANY more in the future, I promise). You may love it, or you find it pointless, but either way, I can almost guarantee that you'll never forget it. Two thumbs up. And then, most likely, on the floor somewhere amid a pile of bullet casings and alien goop. Yuck...			"

								For the lazy people: Viscera Cleanup Detail is a fantastic game and I greatly recommend it to allNow that we have that out of the way, let's get into detail...(s- see what I did there? I'm so funny)Viscera Cleanup Detail is a simulator-esque game in which you are put in the position of a ""hygien technician"" (or Janitor for you simple folk). You are given the task of cleaning up several rooms of a sci-fi scene where there has been a tragic and gory disaster. You must wipe the floors, walls and even ceilings which are coated in blood and dirt with body parts scattered amongst the mess.My expierence of this game is minor but impacted. Although I might not have had this game for long, I seem to have grown quite fond to it. Although, while I was mopping up giblets, I thought ""Why is a game about being a janitor of all things so intriguing?"" and you may be asking that yourself, reader. I find that this game is great and fun to play because it something different aswell as being relaxing. (apart from the odd moments when you spill a dirty bucket or break a light, then♥♥♥♥♥♥gets frustrating)We as gamers are used to running around gunning aliens and opponents to death, leaving a trail of destruction and gore in our path but with Viscera Cleanup Detail, we see how the person who has to clean up after us feels. We are put on the other side of the fence with VCD. Also, as I've stated, it's very relaxing compared to the fast-paced, time-limited shooters most of us play on a regular basis. Not to mention that VCD is very self-rewarding when you get to your office and see that you've left the previous area perfectly spick and span.In summary: I thoroughly recommend this game because of it's calming vibe, difference and it's ability to transform something so mundane into something appealing and fun to play.

												So chances are you are looking at this game and thinking ""what's the deal with this? Why would I want to be a space janitor?"" And first of all, that's Space Sanitation Professional to you. Second, this game is a ton of fun. More fun than it has any right to be. Especially if you play with friends.In this Space Custodian simulator you play as part of the lowly sanitation crew for an evil corporation in the far future, and you're tasked with cleaning up the messes left behind by horrible plant experiments, alien attacks, mutations gone wrong, etc. You know, normal custodial things. You are the guy who cleans up the mess after the hero of a sci-fi FPS has killed all the bad guys and left. Many of the levels are homages to sci-fi movies (like The Thing or Event Horizon), books (like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea), and games (like Half-Life). The game is very tongue and cheek, and that's not just because body parts keep coming out of the bucket dispenser. Easter eggs (some literal) and macabre humor abound.How does the gameplay work? You are tasked with paying proper respect to the deceased (throwing their bodies in the incinerator), picking up garbage, bullet shells, organs, etc, mopping up blood, getting rid of bullet holes, and more. You have several machines that dispense tools, like water buckets and boxes for trash, all of which eventually end up in the incinterator, and a laser gun for getting rid of bullet holes and burning up uncooperative flora and fauna. There are no enemies in the game, but that doesn't mean your teamates won't find ways to get you killed. Everything from explosives to pushing your teammates into environmental traps, to setting up the turret that doesn't like people when no one was looking... Even walking into someone with too much garbage in your crate can get someone killed - the physics engine, like in most simulator games, is pretty wonky, but it isn't a bug, it's definitely a feature.This game is a ton of fun to play with friends, and it is both simple enough to pick up quickly, and involved enough to keep you coming back. I find that game both relaxing to play when you get into a cleaning groove, and hilarious when you and your friends are finding new ways to sabatoge each others efforts. Even in the best of situations you end up creating an even bigger mess than when you started, but it is very satisfying to gradually whittle away at it until you are finished. There is also a ton of content. I'm twenty hours in, and even though I've replayed a few levels I'm still not all the way through the main game, and there seems to be a ton of fan created content. A great co-op game, I would totally clean up the horrible experiment gone wrong and hide all the evidence before the space police arrive for my evil corporate overlords again.			"

												Of all the games I expected to be able to put a lot of time into, a silly game about being the guy to clean up after a Dead Space style sci-fi slaughterfest wasn't one of them. I expected it to catch my attention for a couple hours at most before it got old, but I found that it's less about the novelty and more about the experience.Have you ever needed to occupy yourself with something that could help you wind down and relax? This game is perfect for just that, even when you end up spilling blood and guts all over the cargo bay. There's a certain charm in putting in the time to accomplish such menial tasks while also feeling like you're working toward something - nothing compares to the feeling when you look back on a corridor and it's sparkling clean when an hour ago it was covered in blood.I normally don't find the idea of cleaning entertaining, but I do find it relaxing, and Viscera Cleanup Detail manages to bring both entertainment and relaxation together in a way that really helps me forget about things for a while.

								This game is really only fun with other people, in my opinion. It's very tedious (which some folks may enjoy) and some of the maps take HOURS to complete alone, but with friends it can be great and takes less time.PROS1) Microsoft Sam text-to-speech for in-game chat is HILARIOUS. Seriously makes the game 100x better. Try it. Nothing better than being a grown adult and saying inappropriate things in chat just to hear that monotonous robotic voice say it out loud. Had myself and my friends laughing so hard we were almost throwing up. It also says things kind of sarcastically.2) The broken game physics, which is a cause of most of the cons listed below, can actually be funny sometimes. Like mops randomly killing people and bins glitching across the floor.3) Funny things like giblets coming out of machines they shouldn't come out of, and really nice atmopshere and setups with interesting backstories.CONS1) No music in-game. Why does the main menu have neat ambient music but the game doesn't? For such a long, sometimes boring and tedious game where you have to obsessively focus on every detail for hours, why can't we have something to listen to?2) The bins. Seriously. The biohazard bins are a total mess. I can barely use them. The point is to put giblets, trash, bullet shells and other small items in them to make it easier to collect and carry them to the furnace. But the bins are so broken the items inside usually clip into the bin and make the bin rocket around randomly, or the bin decides to just start glitching like mad and bang around, or teleport randomly, etc. Either way it usually spills some, or all, of the contents, forcing you to pick EVERYTHING back up again. Very annoying. For a game where those bins are provided to us to use, why can't we use them properly ?? I know it's in early access but please for the love of god fix the bins.3) A seriously annoying an game-breaking bug I keep encountering is the inability to grab things. Sometimes just randomly will not allow me to pick things up anymore. Or, the game won't show the item in my hands- it still shows the item on the floor- but the game still considers me to be holding them. So when I drop the item, it teleports onto the ground wherever I ""dropped"" it, causing glitching. Sometimes on my friends' screen they can see me holding an item but on my own screen it appears that I'm NOT holding it. Makes carrying anything nearly impossible. Only way to fix is to quit the game/server and restart/rejoin. Happens several times per game.4) Things that are almost, or entirely, unreachable. Some giblets or trash are in places almost impossible to reach, under tables (in a game where there is no crouch mechanism) or splashes of blood on the CEILING where there is no way to reach it by jumping or stacking boxes, especially since boxes and bins are so glitchy they fling themselves around insanely when standing on them. Maybe putting blood on the ceiling in an unreachable location could be fixed, eh?5) Sometimes mops randomly kill my friends. It's actually kind of funny. And also sometimes those stupid bins, or other items glitching so hard they rocket into my friends and kill them. Funny but perhaps could be fixed lol.			"

												One may think that this game's postive reviews are a joint effort by the community to give us all a giggle when we see that a 'Cleaning Simulator' is one of the best games on the market. Somehow, that is not the case. I was expecting a Cory in the House DS level of deviation from the reviews, what I recieved was a humourous, polished, highly editable, multiplayer masterpiece that taps into my crippling OCD and unleashes my inner Janitor. If you think this game is just for a select few neat-freaks with too much time on their hands, you will likely be surprised. I showed this game to my friend who is a devout COD fanboy, ( eugh ) and he got into it just as much as me. One of the most unique and satisfying games I have ever played.			"

								In all honesty, when I was first gifted this game I was like what the f*** is this. This game is one of the best simulation games I have ever played. Something about cleaning up a bloody mess and placing it in a bin and then burning it is satisfying. Plus, the speedrun, which keeps track of you score and grades you gives you a sense of accomplishment. There are tons of easter eggs and little notes you can find around the maps which give most of them a background story. The multiplayer is phenomenal.  You can either work together to clean the map, or you can derp around messing everthing up.420/69P.S One thing i think they should add in the game that would really change it is an achievement for cleaning each map decent enoughP.P.S The devs are very kind and are always listening. Thank you for imputing my idea into the game.			"

												Whoever would've guessed, before this game ever came out, that a janitoral simulation could be so damn fun? Certainly not me.This game gives me a whole new appreciation for real life janitors. They are the unsung heroes, folks. Seriously. If you see one in real life, be glad that they are willing to do a job (for crappy pay I might add) that the majority of us wouldn't want to do, and treat them kindly.Anyway, you can't go wrong with this game. Single-player is fine, but it's more fun with other people. If you have OCD, then you will worship this game! In fact, you will probably cry every time you leave your house because you will miss this game when you're out! If that does happen, then you should not buy it because I don't want you to cry. :(			"

								So far I've played this game or 5 hours, no bullets were shot, no one died or anything, but it was still one of the best 5 hours I've spent gaming. This game is also really great for times when you want to play a game, but every game you have requires energy and fast movement and stuff and all you want to do is do something calm.			"

Viscera Cleanup Detail  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 Viscera doesn't try to be anything special, and that's just fine. The environments are well put together, with plenty of well...viscera.   Gameplay 7 Can be a blast, but you need to be in the right mood. Viscera seriously caters to the OCD in you. A clever and amusing reversal of roles, you find yourself cleaning up the mess left behind after terrible experiments gone wrong, alien attacks, etc. Put down the gun, and pick up the mop. The controls lend themselves to making silly mistakes and more of a mess, and while intentional it can get a little frustrating sometimes as you're trying to clean the place. Keep an eye out for hints in levels to open some doors.   Story N/A You're part of the cleanup crew, sent to mop up after whatever event led to the grisly state these facilities are in. No real story here.   Multiplayer 8 A surprisingly refreshing, and completely amusing multiplayer experience. Group up with your friends to clean this mess up! Laugh as you make ridiculous mistakes together, knocking over buckets of blood accidentally, dragging bodies across walls and splattering their remnants everywhere.   Replayability 6 As amusing as it is to take up the role of janitor, you can only do it so many times. The saving grace here is the free levels they occasionally release (so far, Shadow Warrior, and Santa's Rampage)   Overall 7/10 While an amusing, unique, polished game, Viscera isn't something you'll boot up a whole lot to enjoy. But you will certainly get your money's worth out of it in laughs with your friends. I recommend picking this one up (especially when on sale), even if only for how unique the concept is. You've seen a lot of things in gaming, but you've never seen something like this.

Posted: April 9, 2016
												First, to get it out of the way, I'm a bit more familiar with the game than my small-ish number of hours with it might have you believe.  I first played this elsewhere.  I hate having to point that out in reviews, but you know how it is...Anyway, Viscera Cleanup Detail... you know, this kinda reminds me of back when Harvest Moon came out on the SNES, a million years ago.  I saw that game, wondered ""This is a game about farming... how could this be any fun?"", but tried it myself anyway, and, well... suffice it to say, THAT series has been around for a long, long time now.  It's kinda like that; a game that seems like a fantastically stupid idea on paper, but it just works anyway.Or is it a stupid idea?  Games like this have been popular lately; things like Euro Truck Simulator, or Farming Simulator, or various other things of that nature, those games pop up and end up being pretty popular.  This game is a bit along those lines, except that it's taking a realistic job (janitor) and putting it in a not-so-realistic location (bloody sci-fi environments filled with exploded space nerds).  The basic idea is simple:  You know all those violent 3D FPS games where you're exploding a bazillion monsters, robots, or evil jerks, with blood and bullets going all over the place?  Well, in this game, THAT stuff already happened.  It's over.  And YOU are the one called in to then clean up the mess.  And boy, what a mess it is!  There is a TON of blood and gore and other mysterious fluids.  It's all over the place.  Not to mention all of the spent bullet casings, random broken things, smashed up equipment, randomly strewn junk, garbage... the amount of things that need to be dealt with in each level will seem extremely daunting when you first enter a given level.  You really have your work cut out for you!In order to avoid getting fired, you have to be very meticulous.  You want to try to clean PERFECTLY, if you can... not missing a single spot with your Space Mop (TM) or variety of other tools (including a laser welder gun, which has various entertaining uses).  You have to use the tools you always have with you, combined with objects that need to be carried around, such as buckets, bins, lights, and other things, and also special machines stationed around the map.  Machines such as bucket/bin dispensers (sometimes also known as ""severed limb 3D printers that occaisionally malfunction and give you a bucket or bin instead""), special vending machines, a big metal lift thing, and of course the all-important incinerator, the final destination for... basically everything.  And a big purple boom-box with a ton of selectable music which vibrates out of control if set to full volume and can set off nearby explosives and such (....what?).  You'll see what I mean if you mess with that thing too much, it appears in every level.  Just dont say I didnt warn you.But that's not all!  For bonus points, there's other things you can do too.  Feel like playing a bit of a CSI role?  Well you can!  Try to piece together what happened in each area, and more importantly, exactly how each person died.  Is a particular corpse leaning against a bloody wall, with a bunch of bullet holes nearby?  Well then, he was probably shot to death.  That's a very simple example, some others are... a bit more confusing. There's some where you'll look at some guy (or what's left of him) and go ""...what in the funky hell happened to this guy?"". But it's fun to try to figure them out, and each dead guy has a name associated with them, and you can stick their USB things (each corpse has one) into the machine to fill out an optional report detailing just what happened to the poor guy.  Get it right (or mostly right, you're expected to give your ""best estimate"" and ARENT required to be absolutely 100% perfect when writing up your report, but you want to try to be as accurate as you can) and you'll get a bit of a bonus.   There are a variety of ways to get such bonuses, which can be used to make up for small messes that you might miss.That all of course is if you're playing the game properly... you also, of course, have the option of just flinging stuff around and making a bigger mess, or doing things like that.  Detailed physics and all.  And that's part of what makes the game what it is, is some of the wacky things that might happen at any given moment.  Even when you're really playing properly and trying to do your best, well... sometimes, that's when some of the funniest things might happen (it's always most hilarious if it's spontaneous and unexpected, after all).  Maybe you're transporting a huge bunch of biohazard bins filed with gory bits down an elevator, and the elevator gives a bit of a nasty jolt when it reaches the bottom, and suddenly... it's raining gibs!  Or you might knock over a light and suddenly things are on fire, or stuff just goes flying all over the place, or... well, you'll have to see for yourself some of the things that can happen.  One thing about the game though, to me, is that it's relaxing.  I think this might be one of the most attractive things about the ""simulator"" type games; it's nice to have something that's very different from the usual violent action games for once, something that's actually calm (yet still often hilarious).  And this game does that very well (and if something frustrating DOES happen, you are definitely able to grab and fling random things around in great frustration, as seen in one of the game's trailers).  And actually managing to 100% every level takes quite alot of work and is actually pretty hard.  And there's an overall story that's out there to find concerning a certain janitor that came before you, and.... well, I dont want to spoil that too much.  A hint though, start out by exploring your office a bit first before jumping into the main levels.  Some of the things you can find in there are.... interesting.  If you can figure out how to get through the doors, that is.Lastly, the levels themselves are VERY well made, with incredible detail and a bazillion things to interact with.  LOTS to do in each, and hidden stuff to find.  Oh, and the graphics are utterly fantastic.  I dont normally bother talking about graphics... as I'm the sort that'll happily sit there with an ancient Atari 2600 for hours... but sometimes they are worth talking about, and in this game, the spectacular visuals are a great added bonus.  The game is gorgeous. But you'll want a pretty beefy machine if you're going to max it out.Oh, and it comes with a level editor, and Steam Workshop compatibility.Overall, sure, the game isnt going to be for everyone.  This sort of game never is. If you've always thought that the ""simulator"" sorts of games were nothing but stupid jokes, this isnt the game for you.  But for those that like this sort of thing... this is easily one of the best (and again, alot of potential hilarity here).   You'll get your money's worth out of this one.  Just be prepared for that.... that irritating moment when you THINK you've gotten 100% or better in a level, only to find out... you got 99%... stuff just might get flung around the office at that point.Oh, and before I forget:  This game does indeed have co-op.  My experience with the game is all solo... I'm not a big fan of co-op gaming... but from what I hear, the hilarity increases tenfold when you're playing it with friends.			"

								I can already hear people say: ""WHAT? SHE DID MAP GUIDES AND SHE DIDN'T REVIEW THE GAME?"".What do you want me to tell, mopping these maps are just so fun that I've been saying it on Playblink, Steamgifts and any friend that is wondering if the game is worthy.You're a janitor in a space station - sometimes sent to some planets - always cleaning the mess around, caused by genetically modified creatures, aliens, special military division sent to dispose of these and the scientists, which means mopping blood, incinerating body parts or body bags or entire bodies, trash (cans, noodle boxes), bullet cases, toxic goo, repairing holes caused by the guns, etc. etc.And while you're at it, since a newer version, you can bring back unique items to your office like a Face Hugger, Gordon Freeman's assests, Duke Nukem's, Isaac Clarke's helmet, and any other easter eggs (litteraly). Besides, with the datalogs and pages let by workers, you'll learn more about what happened, the causes and the orders given to the soldiers. And why not, keep traces of codes to enter some areas, needing your cleaning but closed.To do so, you'll find an incinerator to burn what you need to burn (or an airlock in one case), a water bucket dispenser, a disposal bin dispenser, a vending device when you need medikits back to their places or light, a laser welder that can repair and burn (but with stains in that case) holes, brooms, J-Harm, sort of mini-lift and maybe other items that I'm bound to forget.Each level can be small to huge, on several floors, with dispensers not always near of each other. Unearthly Excavation can take hours to complete alone for example.You can guess that the main ambiance of the game isn't a scary one but more a comedy one. Finding Bob is fun as he's a psychopath (or not) and you're one step behind him, even if you'll never rattle him out. And getting an Employee of the Month award is also a great filling.Anyway, you've understood, I play alone. But you can also bring friends with you, kill them to get them replaced, annoy them by messing around or simply play the game normally.And don't worry for the music! You have a radio on each level that play great tracks.Viscera Cleanup Detail is maybe in Early Access since some time. But the developers are working hard. They added more and more features making me forced to complete my maps and cursing them for that pain (but what a pleasure in the end). And they're nearing the 1.0, the final release.Thanks to the devs listening and answering the community and thanks to the community, Viscera Cleanup Detail will be one of these games that you will never regret supporting in Early Access.For 10 bucks, you're not ripped off. BUY IT! Because while my cleaning skills are still a mess IRL and in the game, it is really relaxing to do so. And because you want to find Bob.			"

												There's times when I am on Skype with a friend, or on a phone call with family. During these times, I need to focus on what they are saying and respond to it, even though what they are saying is boring me to tears. During those moments I like to play a game where I can just muck around, without having to worry about focusing on things like voice acting, or plot. Just mindless fun! Viscera Cleanup Detail accomplishes that for me!			"

												Work. Work never changes.Since the dawn of human kind, when our ancestors first discovered the cleaning power of water and sponges, blood has been washed off in the name of everything: from promotion to simple, pure satisfaction.In the year 2184, after the outbreak of war with aliens, the messy nature of man could sustain itself no longer: the world was plunged into an abyss of filth, junk, viscera and dismembered bloody corpses.But it was not, as some had predicted, the end of janitor's work. Instead, the invasion was simply the prologue to another painstaking chapter of human history. For we succeeded in defeating the aliens - but work, work never changes.In the early days, thousands of workers were spared the horrors of cleaning by dying in different ways, known as stupid. And when the janitors entered, they died in even more stupid ways - all except you. For on that fateful day, when you took your trusted mop and a bucket of water, the small wooden door of The Office closed - and never reopened. It was here when you started. It is here you will be fired.Because, on the Spaceship: no trash ever enters, and no trash ever leaves.			"

												BF bought me this game.Really enjoyed cleaning up a room for two hours. Surprising, I know, but also relaxing once I knew how to do most of it, without knocking my buckets over.I would've liked a simple check list of some kind for the first level and an explaination of the Sniffer tool, though. It was frustrating to find out I was supposed to take care of this or that barrel, post-cleanup.Fun nonetheless! 8/10			"

								Strangly, It's a very addictive game. Picked it up thinking it'd be nothing special, but if you have a friend or two it can be even more of a laugh. Since it is an early access game there are a few querks and bugs. From what i've found in my hours playing is that it's generally physic bugs, body parts flying through bins occasionally and some being stuck in the world.In general it's a good game if you are particularly OCD ( like myself ) and just want some horrific mess to clean up, and you even get newspaper clippings at the end of the round to see if anyone managed to kill themselves on the blood you missed cleaning up!Overall I've had way too much fun playing this game on the 7 or so levels it has on offer. Wondering what happened to cause such destruction, etc..Buying now seems to grant you access to the 2 other spin offs which are a slightly older build to the main installment, still fun none the less!

												I LOVE the idea of this game...Sadly the gameplay is too repetitive. I loved it when I saw the laser gun and realized I could turn corpses into cauterized pieces that didn't bleed, or turn materials into piles of molten metal and plastic.I though I would soon find more creative tools like that, or new tipes of mess to clean or something...But nope. That's all.You clean muck, blood and a black substance than can be created by burning things with the laser or... Be there.That's it... All the time... And you can't keep the gun. You have to drop it to get anything else.Also, movement is strange and dificult. It´s like if you had a massive body but you couldn't see it. So you'll spill buckets a lot or get stuck in places that don't appear to be tight.I like that there seems to be something like a weight system. If you load a disposable bin too much you have to look up to lift it. Problem is the that when you carry it and look up... You can't see anything.This game is fun... For an hour or two. Can't see myself playing it more than that.			"

								Imagine eating nothing, but ""White Castle"" for a solid week. You♥♥♥♥♥♥in nothing but cheap garbage bags with your newly connected diarrhea powers. At the end of the week you collect all the bags, and walk down the corridors and slam them as hard as you can like a chopping axe into the walls, ceiling, floors, and machinery. But you need to add another 15 men to the ""White Castle"" part of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ also to join in.You are now the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who needs to clean it all up, and if so lucky some sad friends too if you got some. Silly it seems, but is fun getting frustrated when a dirty mop, and your mucked up feet from walking through what you just cleaned causes you to need clean up a entire corridor again. Fun, and infuriating like a real job. A must buy for the clean freak of your home. Is a fun title in all if you're into the oddball games.			"

												As this game exits Early Access, I feel it fitting to make my final review on this game.Basically; VCD is a janitor simulator where you clean up blood and human bits and stuff, and not much else. What may not occur to you, is this is actually a real job what you're doing. Its really hard, and most that do it do not survive for very long.I've been with this game from the very beginning and it goes without saying that I've been utterly pleased with it. Even its offshoots are great. Its not a fad game. It never 'took off'. It never had its moment and hopefully never will; this is a game that deserves to be discovered with wild eyes and a wet mop. This game deserves to be found as the calming zen-like, ocd-destroyer of a game that it is. There is no danger so as long as you're smart. No ammo to keep track of, and nothing is actually trying to kill you. You're just Joe, trying to clean stuff up. Its got problems though; and nearly all of them have to do with its physics engine. While its certainly a good one, its really hard to actually get rid of bullet casings. And intestines. And hands will still sometimes clip through the floor. This action makes it basically impossible to get a hold of, and its detectable. So you're screwed.  They added a broom to make casings and trash easier to pick up but personally; I'd prefer a vaccum. They threw in references to various games here and there in the form of workers logs usually. They do indeed feel thrown in. But it gets a knowing smile from me if not much else. This game is not exciting. Its not action packed. It is not for everyone, and its not that detailed.Red blob #3 (its a joke kinda) still looks like a red blob to me, so I always assume its a heart. There. Is. No. Tutorial. I repeat.There. Is. No. Tutorial.So when you see a gun that fires lasers and you have no idea what its for, nobody else did either. They learned the hard way unless you check out the wiki.This game will throw you in all kinds of different areas.From med labs where all kinds of things went wrong, to an oil refinery, to a greenhouse; where you'll also have to remove weeds and tumors, and even in space itself, where you're free to turn gravity on and off.Is it fun? I say it is. Theres a reason why its foil badge has been my featured badge for as long as it has been.Runestorm did a great job with this game in Early Access as it was, and is one of the woefully few success stories from it.Give it a shot if you think you like what I've described.8/10.--edit--Nominated this game with the ""I liked it before it won an award""Cuz its true and it deserves it.

												I've only played like 5 hours as of writing this and all of them have been with a friend, to sum up those hours. He spends a minute looking around the map whilst I spend a minute throwing any and everything that will make a bigger mess at nearby walls and the ceiling. He comes back and sees what i've been doing and shouts at me, we then spend the next hour or so cleaning up the mess.I regret nothing, Ben.It's a surprisingly fun game when you want something calm that you can take at your own pace and just spend some time on. Only thing that annoys me is the footprints, it's like they're following me...			"

												You might be thinking - ''A game where you are supposed to clean up the mess after someone who had quite a bit of fun? Uh.. what is that supposed to be?'' However, after you give it a try you won't be able to stop until it's done.A coop multiplayer with your friends is the core of the gameplay. One does not simply start cleaning a virtual mess on his own. You could be cleaning dead bodies and viscera from your own basement that way. But what's the fun in that...Another great part is the number of easter eggs you will find during your cleanups.The game itself is very well made. Runs smooth but you have to count with ocasional bugs (dancing corpses, possesed buckets and accidently killing friends with a hurled barrel, etc..).Pros:+ multiplayer+ throwing mates to a giant devourer pits+ you might start enjoying cleaning your own home+ satisfaction after finishing the task+ BigBanger Cons:- takes up to 3 hours to clean up the messOverall: The game fulfiled it's role as cleaning simulator very well. If you are the type of person who just can't leave mess in your Breezehome in Whiterun and spends hours to fit the place up, this is the game for YOU.10/10 "

This games looks hilarious, and can be pretty fun if you're easily amused. While playing by myself I've gotten bored and frustrated pretty quickly with this game. It would be so much better with any other sort of interactions, whether it be with viewers of your stream or cooperative play with a buddy, you really need someone to interact with. I recommend this game, it's still a lot better than other games that steam has to offer.			"

												I went blindly into this game. Well, not so blindly, I had seen some personalities online play it ever so slightly. But all in all I thought that this will be an experience like Goat Simulator. Fun for the first few times, but something that soon turns stale (if you pardon my opinion of Goat Sim).I was delightfully wrong. I do not know what it is that keeps me returning to this game in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes (especially in multiplayer, for that is truly where the salt of this game lies), but I like it. Perhaps it is the idea that you get to see what it is like to be on the receiving end of the rampages of action heroes and videogame protagonists, except instead of getting a bullet to the face, you get to mop up the remains of those who here higher on the corporate ladder than you ever will be. There is just. Something so satisfactory about playing that kind of a scenario in your head where you plop the hand of a uptight know-it-all Doctor of genetics into an incinerator and toss around his dismembered head like it was a basketball.How you like me now Dr. Von Snifferpooppen.

								The game's great, honestly. Y'know how in a lot of FPS games you go around and kill everything, disregarding the aftermath?This is the aftermath: Hours of cleaning up blood, body parts, and even the bullet casings. It's still getting updates, so that's a plus. Only complaint I have, as of writing, is that sometimes the physics are wonky when you stuff a crate with bits and pieces of corpses.			"

												This game is not for everyone. I for myself really enjoy to play around with the physics in this bloody environment and like to observe the detail of each levels. This games offers what I have mentioned above and turned cleaning into a very unique yet fun horror game. This game also offers splitscreen mode, multiplayer and lan mode. I don't recommend to play this game with the controller though because it lacks the accuracy to clean stuff fast and efficiently.What I like:No hand-holding. You can play around with physics and create your own cleaning technique.Levels are very detailed. Lot's of content for that price.Almost everything is moveable, rotateable.Special interactions on certain levels.What I don't like:Rarely physics model will glitch out of the level.Replaying a whole level to get certain achievements.Replaying the seperated standalone addons to get the achievements for the main game.

								This is, probably, one of my favorite games ever. I'm a huge fan of games that question what it is to be a game- all the weird stuff on Kongregate, The Stanley Parable, anything that's every been called a ""notgame""- and this fits the bill perfectly, but in a slightly less existential way. It's a perfect experience for someone who wants something new and inventive, but not particularly thought-provoking- and also absolutely hysterical.My only complaint would be the occasionally bugged physics (my buckets have a habit of sinking into the floor and require quite a bit of mop violence to excavate) but this is a work in progress and I'm sure that'll be part of an update.So, for an in-progress game pioneering in the realm of janitorial simulators (mixed with Dead Space, of course, because no game is complete without alien viscera), this... Whatever it is is /golden/. 10/10 would mop everything again.			"

								The game's charm wore off pretty quickly once I started freaking out over another spilled blood bucket. Before then, I was enjoying the game as if it were some kind of elaborate puzzle game. Yet when I started getting angry over people stepping through the blood puddle I was cleaning I realized quickly that I had been duped.I was doing virtual chores.Maybe it will get better, but I don't really see how the developers can expect the players to stay interested.

								I bought this game and in two days I had over 12 hours of gameplay. This is not a common thing for me anymore.I don't know what it is, if it's the thrill of looking at a room and being disgusted and lazy of how much you'll have to work, or walking around the same room when it's all squeaky clean and feeling accomplished. Something about this game appeals to me.Of course that this is not a game for everybody, as sometimes I also need some time to recharge my will of play, but it really is fun, and I bet that with friends it should be a lot better, too. Good luck trying to convince them, though.For the few complaints I have so far:- Buckets: Sometimes, when cleaning the mop, you hit the water perfectly but it still doesn't count, so you have to try again. And they flip WAY too easily as well (might be a game mechanic or simply bad coding, either way, it sucks in my opinion).- Dispensers: The fact that sometimes it will drop body parts instead of buckets or disposal bins is NOT fun at all, to me. Yes, I understand, it's a game mechanic, so it will probably stay the way it is, but I just don't like it. It makes me more annoyed than surprised.- Laser gun/Welder: It should be in your inventory after you pick it up for the first time. Having to drop it when you want to change your tools and backtracking for it every time is annoying.- Physics: Iffy. When you put stuff in the disposal bins, they sometimes ""drop"" through its bottom. Also, the ragdoll physics are not very good. What happens to date is that when you pick an object, the center of the object is where you will grab it, and right clicking flips the object to be ""straight"" up. The pivot point of the grabbed object should be where the cursor was, and then after right clicking, rotate the object and center the point to the center of the object (as is right now).That's about everything that I can remember for now.A small suggestion or idea I had that could be added:- Magnet: Used to pick up shotgun shells and bullets, maybe other small metallic objects. Because of now, the only way is to picking them up individually, which is somewhat tiresome. But then again, it IS a janitor simulator after all, so I think it's fair not having such thing.Overall, I recommend this game, but not for everybody. Look at the screenshots, watch gameplay of it, try to get some friends to play with you if you feel like you don't want to play alone.EDIT:After having played online with a friend, I decided to add some more body to this review. Nothing above the EDIT line has been changed.I will (briefly) describe a few changes I myself and my friend would like to see done in this game.As they follow: for one, the multiplayer. It's bad. Like, SERIOUSLY bad. It needs a LOT of improvement. Even though our ping remains under 50, we have to take turns hosting a game, because it is horrible for client(s) to play (hosts are always fine). Some problems the clients face are that sometimes you cannot see other players or you are completely unsynced with one-another; disposal bins don't work properly, as in ""everything inside of it will collide with each other and will burst leaving nasty stuff everywhere"". Seriously annoying.Another thing, the object rotation must be reworked, in other words, it must actually exist. As of now, you can't rotate objects at will, you can only flip them up, and that's it. You should be able to rotate them like you do in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, for example, where you hold the left button and move the mouse in the direction you want to rotate the object.Third and final factor, perhaps the sniffer should also be reworked. I honestly can't suggest much, I just think it's pretty... useless. While it does tell you there's something dirty in the vicinity, sometimes it will still beep when there's nothing there. Maybe changing the sniffer's organic mode to an UV light, in which you point it at a surface and if there's blood or other fluids it will glow, and the non-organic mode perhaps could be changed to a portable metal detector. I don't know for sure, I just think it should be reworked as well.I will try to suggest these things on the game's forum as well.Thank you for your time.			"

								This game is for those who want to procrastinate and clean up a virtual world rather than their rooms or for those who have OCD problems lol. JK. Anyway, this game is surprisingly fun to play. It's sort of kind of relaxing for me. It's not just about cleaning, it's also about strategy. If you have a good strategy then you can finish cleaning faster. I just hope that the multiplayer option would work for me. I can't host a game cause i can't forward my ports (oh well). Would be nice to clean with friends and strangers just as long as they wont make the mess worst, i'd prolly be so frustrated if they do that XD.			"

												Fun for a while, but gets annoying quickly. Get it on sale. Not worth the full price.You'd think after 9 iterations they'd have the collision right, but it's seriously broken, in many cases you will find yourself being propelled by other physics enabled objecs, resulting in knocking down things that you might want not to.There is no tutorial, figure it out yourself, or more importantly use the wiki. Things that don't appear to be trash turn out to be trash. Like toxic waste barrels being undeterminate, at least I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to burn them or not.You may also find yourself spending a good deal of time and thinking that it's all clean, only to see that you've got only 92%  completion of the room. For example I spent 2 hours in the sewers making the place spotless, while letting the envornment to play pinball with me. Punching out got me demoted, and apparently 92% is the bare minimum. There is no way to go back, you gotta do it all over again if you want to get those last nooks and crannies.Either way, the novelty of the idea wears off quickly, as you have too few tools at your disposal. A lack of convenience is just strange really, what, they don't have hoses in the future? Water is pretty hard to get for a game based on cleaning. You have to run around to get a bucket, bring it to your designated cleaning spot, only to find out  that 5 swipes is all it takes for the bucket to be useless. Now go and burn it (yeah cuz it's so intuitive to dispose of dirty water in the fkin incinerator), get a new one, and rinse and repeat. Stacking more than a few of these also doesn't seem to be very productive, since everything launches you left and right, it's highly likely that you will spill your dirty water and just have to clean everything again.The lack of tools becomes very obvious when you start looking for bullet casings. Prepare to have to pick them up one by one. Don't expect a vacuum cleaner or anything, a janitor may have a garbage scanner (that simply beeps, what it is that you have to throw out is anyones guess, since I've had it beep in an empty corridor), but a vacuum cleaner would be asking for too much. In fact, I'd rather clean my own room, since you can use the comforts of life.Music is good and the sounds are nice and visceral. The gore is satisfying, though I mostly found myself desiring to play as the guy who did all the carnage.Other than that, I can't say more. I see an effort, there is mod supports and custom maps, but as far as I'm concerned this is an average game. It looks good, but it plays average. My recommendation is to get it on sale.			"

								Viscera Cleanup detail is a fun, relatively mindless sci-fi/simulation game in which you play as a janitor, mopping up in various futuristic facilities after some kind of cataclysmic event that invariably ends in lots and lots of shed blood. There's not much to the actual gameplay and you'll get the hang of the mechanics quickly, but the game looks very striking for an indie production and the story told through various notes and diary entries you can find through the numerous maps lends life to a game that's otherwise full of extremely dead things. The end-of-level scoring system is also remarkably novel - instead of a bunch of arbitrary numbers, you find yourself in your modest janitorial office at the end of each shift, with inspection reports and newspaper articles detailing your specific failures (or lack thereof) with plenty of humour.The physics engine is still fairly rough, as might be expected with games made in the Unreal engine, but even that provides a masochistic kind of fun as you find yourself sliding into and knocking over a bucket full of human juice... again. This game really captures the hypothetical essence of begrudgingly working at the bottom rung of an unscrupulous corporation, but in space!It might not be the best experience if you want your adrenaline to get pumping, but if you've got a couple of hours to spare and some podcasts to catch up on, it's really a great way to pass the afternoon.

												Cleaning up after a brutal squadron of Space Marines repels an alien invasion? On paper it sounds as fun as a homework simulator but somehow it's super entertaining. You use your mop, broom and hands to clean up body parts, shell casings, broken glass and various bodily fluid spills.Most of the levels have homages to sci-fi and horror classics. You can clean up a gravity drive that's suspiciously like the one from Event Horizon. Or you can restock health pick-ups in a tight cornered sewer level. A mad scientist's lab needs some clean up after some experiments went sideways and who could forget when Santa went on a bender and slaughtered all of the elves in his workshop?Each level takes anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple hours to clean from stem to stern. You have a janitor's box where you can stash souvenirs to decorate your office.This game is one of those things like Harvest Moon, doesn't sound like a good time on paper but when you play it you get sucked in fast.

   Viscera Cleanup Detail Review.   Developer:  RuneStorm. Publisher:  RuneStorm.Genre:  Simulator, Physics, Gore, Indie.Price:  $12.99Played on: GTX 650, Core i3, 1920x1080 Res.  ""That hero left a mess, and it's up to you to deal with the aftermath.""  VCD is a game where you take the role of a janitor working under unusual conditions. You must travel between various space stations cleaning the sci-fi messes heroes left behind making the place spotless again. The game’s only goal is for you to do your job properly, make it appear as if nothing happened in that station, clock out and done!With the game’s peacefully relaxing atmosphere you can enjoy cleaning a station at your own pace taking your time to wipe every small blood splatter or you can use the Speedrun gamemode for a faster experience. There are many different types of things you need to clean up and or fix. You can go from wiping the gory blood to using the laser gun to close up bullet holes to picking up dead bodies and throwing them into the furnace. To completely clean up a station takes time and a pair of sharp eyes since the game’s lighting sometimes makes things like bullet holes hard to see, good thing you got your “Sniffer”, a tool that helps you “sniff out” elusive waste objects and blood splatters. As much as the Sniffer is a good tool you usually only need 2 tools, your mop and your own 2 hands. You can use your hands to get things like buckets of water or the waste disposal bins from their machines. Using the hands you can also obviously pick up things like corpses trash and intestines and throw them into the furnace to melt away.The main tool however is the mop used to clean up almost everything, from blood to burn marks on any surface whether it’s the ceiling, floor or walls. Cleaning up the floors is usually the most important bit since stepping in alien goo or blood creates footprints which you later have to mop up as well.The achievements in the game are tedious to get as some of them require long multi-step almost mission like things that you have to do just to get a few of the achievements so getting all of them is a very tedious progress and I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re keen on that sort of thing.  Now, why does this game work? It almost seems like a chore but it’s actually fun, madness! The whole reason this game exist is for people who like to listen to podcast and or music albums and doing something alongside that that doesn’t require a lot of thinking. This game is almost like those “Turn off your brain and enjoy” comedy movies which if you think about it too hard you won’t enjoy it. Despite the game being rather great there are a few issues with it. The physics can be a bit glitchy and when you’re talking about a game that is built on physics based items it makes it a bit frustrating at times when your dirty bucket of waters tips and you get a huge mess to clean up even though you didn’t knock it over or when a piece of intestine gets stuck in the wall and you have no way to remove it.Another thing that’s problematic is the multiplayer, if you’re the host of the game then everything’s fine the game plays normally but, if you’re not the host the game is almost impossible the enjoy, it’s terribly laggy and glitchy and just straight up atrocious. I feel like the game could’ve used maybe just a few more months in early access before releasing to fix the multiplayer issues along with several bugs.Worth mentioning that the game runs smoothly on pretty much any hardware you own which is rather nice. There maybe some lag spikes on weaker machines but they're far between so it shouldn't be much of a problem. TL;DR VCD is a brilliantly simple game where you clean up the aftermath of a gory battle. It’s quite fun if you don’t think about it too hard and put on a podcast music album or whatever else you fancy. Stay away from the multiplayer though as it is terribly broken.  8/10.

												Viscera Cleanup DetailPublisher: Runestone GamesViscera Cleanup Detail is a very different game than the ones we are used to. It does not fall into the category of the genres we are so familiar to. It is a game where you are a janitor. That does sound like one of the most boring jobs to do in a game but if Viscera is anything to go by, it does not feel that way. Viscera Cleanup Detail puts you into the boots of a janitor who is tasked with cleaning different Sci fi horror events where the actual hero has already done his work and left the place in a mess. Now, it is your job to clean it up in the old fashioned way. Viscera Cleanup Detail Equips you with a mop and a bucket full of water. You clean up the blood stains by using the mop which gets dirty after a few bloody strokes. You either have to dip it into the bucket or any other source of water which makes it close to new in an instant. Then you find heat furnaces which are used to burn down pieces of bodies found around the place. You can pick up various objects and throw them around to have some fun with the somewhat wonky physics engine. It is a game where the humour is solid even where there are no jokes spoken. That’s what makes Viscera special.Gameplay-wise viscera is pretty limited in scope. You don’t do a anything except the cleaning and a little messing around with the physics engine. It doesn’t help that you are the only character in the whole place as it completely removes any interaction. Though sometimes it gives out certain creepy vibes in the form of dead bodies and the complete silence.  Viscera Cleanup Detail’s environments are certainly very impressive. Large rooms complete with easter eggs to find and the various bodies which gives you a sense of what happened here. It gives you a feel what happens after hero rages through the building in order to complete his objective and never turns back to see what transpired while he was there. The visuals of Viscera Cleanup Detail are stunning to say the least. After you clean up a room, there is a sense of achievement which is not present in many games. It is a game where you can relax, a game where you lay down and clean down a few rooms. During my playthrough, I encountered a few bugs but nothing game breaking by any means. No review can justify how Viscera Cleanup Detail  feels. You know after the first few minutes if you’re going to enjoy this game or not. To some it may feel like a boring romp through various rooms, but if you’re like me and enjoy a bit of relaxation in games, Viscera Cleanup detail provides all of that with a solid dose of humour and rooms choke full of easter eggs.

												(Disclaimer: Despite only having two hours in the game at the time of writing this review, two hours is more than enough to grasp all that this game has to offer.)Viscera Cleanup Detail is a game where you're the janitor who has to clean up the mess left behind by a Dead Space or Aliens type of sci-fi scenario. The goal of the game is to mop up blood, clean up and burn body parts, shell casing, and other bits of evidence, and leave the place spotless and shiny like there never was the horrible slaughter of a dozen space marines by unknown extraterrestrial monstrosities. Let's start with the bad of this game, and of that there are two major problems: the physics system and the content (or lack there of). The physics system is your standard, sterotypical buggy and awful physics system. Often times objects will bounce unrealistically, get stuck in walls, phase through walls of the bucket, and send you jumping in the air like it was spring loaded. It is also impossible to right a box if it gets knocked over, you have to get a new one. Given how much of the game revolves around the physics system (mainly by placing little bits of bodies in boxes to bring back to the furnace) this is a major problem. The physics system has caused me a lot of frustration and hinders its enjoyability. The second and more serious problem is the lack of content in this game. Yes, there are a couple dozen maps with different things to clean up (usually varying in the alien bodies). But after 30 minutes of playing the game you've done all that the game has to offer, the rest is just more of that. This might not have been too bad if the game didn't feel like such a chore. Granted, I assume feeling like a chore was intended, you are a janitor after all, but that doesn't make it any less tedious. The physics system is also a large part of this chore, and when half of your gameplay that is very repetitive is poorly done you have a major problem with enjoyability. The good in this game is that the mopping up part of the game does work rather well. Mopping up blood and washing your mop in buckets is well implemented (if a bit repetitive as stated prior). The fact that splashing body parts against the wall makes blood stains and that walking in blood will leave bloody footprints is a nice attention to detail. It is also very satisfying to complete a level and look back over all the work you've done, similar to the satisfaction of writing a long essay or doing the dishes. The problem is that the game is very shallow and what it does offer isn't that enjoyable. The only saving grace for this game is that it is a great podcast game. That is, it's perfect for something to do idly in the background while listening to a podcast or a TV show or the like. However on its own the game falls flat. My final verdict would be this: The game is very shallow and repetitive and simple, so I would recommend not buying it. However, this game can be useful as something to do idly while listening to a podcast, but even then I would recommend other podcast games with a bit more to offer, such as Elite Dangerous, over this.

								You know.... I should have wrote a review for this 10000000000000000000000000000000 years ago.Here it goes.Your a janitor who works on space stations,remote locations, and other futuristic places. Your there to cleanup all that♥♥♥♥♥♥from everyone dieing in terrible events. Alien infestation, a evil artifact, mutants, and a bunch of evil events BEFORE you even got there. So you walk in after the horrible battle/murderfest and clean it up. You burn the bodies, remove the scorch marks, burn the bullet casings, stack the boxes that fell over, file reports on everything you saw, work togheter in multiplayer, and more shiz.There is a functional lift now to get blood on the ceilings, dynamite,shovels,brooms,mops, some crazy disintegration gun that burns everything, and your trusty sniffer tool to find blood/junk.Would not recomend if your not a badass who can handle being a janitor of this scale.....Seriously..... this game is great!

								First time when I've seen this game I'm not think much interesting. But my friend forced me to buy this game. There was 25% discount so, I bought this game. And I was surprised when I had played to this game more fun what I expected. I recommend this game those who interesting the cooperative games. Good thing: -Easy achievements. -Very simple control. -If you have good friends who have this game, play with those for more more fun. :DBad thing: -Early access (currently) so, there are more bugs/glitches. -With alone not too fun.

								There's a popular school of thought that says almost all video games, when you get right down to it, are about tidying up. From clearing the skies in Space Invaders to eating every last dot in Pac-Man, to the blissful calm of an empty Tetris screen, and on through the games that have descended from similar bloodlines, there's a powerful human compulsion to sweep things clean. Most of the time, that impulse is subtext or metaphor. In Viscera Cleanup Detail, it's in your face. And all over your shoes.This is a tidy-'em-up, a game where your goal is literally to clean up a bloody big mess. It's a first-person janitor simulator in which you play as the hapless, blue-collar schlub who must venture into secret labs and space stations in the aftermath of unseen gory FPS battles and restore them to their pristine state.To aid you in this task, you're armed with a mop, your rubber-gloved hands and a handheld ""sniffer"" which tells you when you've missed a bit. At first, you think it's going to be easy. You choose one of the game's seven scenarios and proceed down blood-spattered corridors, ready to mop away the body fluids. And, for a few sweeps, that works fine. Then your mop gets soaked in gore and suddenly you're making the problem worse, sploshing the mess even wider with every stroke.Luckily, every map has a Slosh-O-Matic, a machine that can produce endless buckets of clean water with which to clean your mop. So you set off to find the Slosh-O-Matic and then return to the bit you were cleaning. Only now you realise, having waded through guts and body parts to get the bucket, you've left bloody footprints all over the floor you cleaned. You press on, only to discover that now your bucket of water is so dirty that you're once again splashing even more mess onto the floor rather than cleaning it up. Back to the Slosh-O-Matic you go, this time being more careful about where you tread.10/10			"

												Living in the day and age where brutal gore filled shoot-em-up games are common. From large scale battles, to mass homicides leaving mutilated corpses behind. In those games, the bodies just stay there and we progress on with the game, never really stopped to think.... whos gunna clean this♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Well thats where Viscera Cleanup Detail shines! Spend hours cleaning up after the horrific murders, accidents, mutations and mutilations. Each level walking into another scene of just dismembered humans and other monsters, thrown about with their insides skewn everywhere. Burn all the bodies, stack all the crates, mop up the floors! Even make a bucket pyramid. Viscera cleanup detail is even better with a friend! You and your friends can listen to the royalty free weird retro punk music provided via the radio. Dont like the music? Burn the radio too! Everything in viscera is just pure fun and amazing....   Until you knock over the bucket. ♥♥♥♥ you for knocking over my buckets.			"

								More fun than the shooter game that went on before you showed up.EDIT (for more detail):This game is simply a janitorial simulator in which you clean up outrageous messes that consist of chinese food cartons, paper cups, old notes, beer cans, balls of paper, and generic bags of chips. Also blood, guts, body parts, and shell casings, but those aren't as offensive to a sanitation worker.			"

												This game was a gift. A friend of ine found the premise absurd and it was on sale, so he bought several and gave them to me and a few others.The first night me and my friends played this we were like, seriously, what the actual F---. Then we started giggling. The giggling wuickly turned to enrage shouting after it became apparent that one of us COULDN'T STOP KICKING MOP BUCKETS AND RUINING OUR WORK. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. We haven't touched it much since mainly because we don't know how to process the fact that we enjoyed it so much. Like it's weird that we're willing to enjoy a game so much that is as unconventional as it can get. Real terror, man.One of the weirdest, most unexpectedly relaxing games to date. Still crack it open every once in a while to do some cleanup on one of the levels. There's something so unbelieveably satisfying about cleaning up stuff like this.			"

								Thought I wrote a review for this, but I guess not.Ok, so for many people, their first impressions of this, are that ""Wow, I pick up crap, throw it away, mop the deck, and thats it? Lame"", and that my friend, is where people like that, miss out on something more.At the heart of it, the game is about working together with others as a team (or alone if you want to blow off an hour or so per each map) in doing a common goal, all while making sure to not make mistakes like dropping stuff on the ground, thus making creating a mess again, or knocking over a dirty bucket of water.   People with OCD, will either really enjoy this game because of that feeling of accomplishment when they clean up the entire area, or it will be a nearly endless nightmare with everything being messed up, out of order, dirty, etc.Now to the bare brass.Gameplay:  It is a first-person game in which you use your default tools, mop, sniffer (used to sniff for organic and non-organic spots/items), and your hands (to pick up stuff).   In certain maps, there are other tools to use such as a shovel to fill in pits, a laser gun to fix bullet holes or to incinerate large items.   Some maps, even have interactive objects to do various things, such as gaining access to other rooms, or gas chambers to gas anything inside of it.    Aside from that, are there buckets of water to use in conjunction with your mop to clean the floors and ceiling, and a waste basket to toss in junk that will then be tossed into the furnace.   In the most recent update, a new mechanic of Planting, was added.   Also, map trials are in the game, so if you want to see who is the fastest cleaner in the business, then do a trial run and find out.  IMO, duo games, or games with three or four, would be interesting to see, and to see what time it takes for a team to complete a site.Sounds:  Unique sounds for various items in the game.  Background ambience was amazingly good.   Aside from that, nothing too special.Visuals:  Ok, so we all know how visuals can be a big deal for people.  Well, the graphics here, are actually pretty nice, wether theyare maxxed out, or set to low.  The maps used to be trippy with lag spikes, but a few optimizations later, and the maps run very smooth.  Their newest map with the man-eating plants, are a bit laggy, but overall, they do a nice job at keeping the game smooth in performance.Early Game:   Yes, this is one of those EA games where they are not done, and some people grab their pitchfork and start shouting with others about burning the witch, errr I mean Banning the EAs, but the devs have been able to keep up with fairly steady updates that usually have a brand new, not just a reskin, map that is unique and enjoyable.   Heck, their last 4 maps were simply amazing and unique in location/settings.   The devs have gotten to a stage where they are going to focus on another project of theirs, and then come back and add a few more things, and eventually have a full release which will hopefully include the ability for players to create their own maps.Overall:   Some people will like this, others, won't, for  those who don't, I say to them, give it a chance.  It just might grow on to you.  Besides, when it comes to modern games, a lot of them are about shoot this, shoot that, where as this, is about coordinating what to do, how to do it, and seeing if you can do it even faster (especially if playing with friends)UPDATE:   I will post some updates here.  Recent update added another map (good size, nice simple design) and a lot more unique sound effects for various items in the game.   Few more bugs were fixed, performance improved, easier to connect o other players too.   Another map was added as well with even more unique features.  One feature that is neat is name cards.  Find them all and punch them into the machine to do a role call on all people in the map.			"

Pros:-Every map is vibrant and surprisingly immersive.-For myself and my friends, multiplayer was easy to set up, just be careful; it may destroy your friendship when your friends knock over dirty buckets, track footprints from said dirty bucket's water and paint the walls with soot using the laser gun.-Gibblets. Everywhere.-Many of the issues I encountered when I first posted this review have now been fixed. Great job, devs!Cons:-In multiplayer, we get messages about ""net actor saturation"", which affects our ability to see each other, various items and buckets/bins.-Objects semi-often fall through the world or glitch into the floor, preventing us from getting a perfect score.-When I host a game, if I choose to put on a password, my friends can't join at all, even if they have the password. -My friends cannot join my games from the VCD menu (on the side where it lists friend's games), they have to use the joining options on the Steam friends list.-Having to restart the game 2 or 3 times when you download/install a map from the Workshop is a pain.Wrap up: When you are with your friends, this game is fun, challenging and can get pretty crazy. In single player, the game is relaxing and great for perfectionists, completionists and anyone who just likes to get the job done. I'm confident the Cons I've mentioned will be addressed as development continues. All the same, I highly recommend the game as-is.			"

								This is probably one of the most clever ideas for a game out there right now.Be the guy who cleans up after the hero! Learn about the heroic happenings after the fact by reading notes and assignment logs while you mop up dismembered scientists, mutants, and aliens! Knock over your nasty mop bucket and curse the heavens as you scramble to meet your deadlines! Earn employee of the month! Murder your co-workers merely by running near them!Really though, this game is fun for what it is- a work simulator. If you don't like those, don't buy this expecting it to change your mind. If you like repetitive menial tasks or games that heavily rely on in-game physics, this may be for you!The multiplayer option is horrific in regards to latency and compensation issues, which is mostly an annoyance but can sometimes add humor to a co-op game. Some levels (Hydroponic Hell especially) do not handle multiplayer well enough to be playable, leading to invisible teammates and props/crashing/lag. There are collision issues galore, with bodyparts often getting stuck in floors/walls. Murdering your teammates is as easy as brushing against them as you run past or accidentally pushing them into an incinerator.Co-op issues aside, this game is a good time waster. It is especially nice for those who want to keep their hands or mind occupied, or those who have an eye for detail.10/10			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is an OCD persons dream.The goal of the game is to clean up bodies and parts, blood, monster pieces and all evidence from a variety of maps, which are homages to old movies like Predator and The Thing.I wouldn't have thought it would be so much fun to clean up after monster/zombie/alien attacks,  but it IS.There are lots of little easter eggs to the old monster movies as well, in the form of noises, body placement in the environment, and notes detailing what happened.I would recommend this game to anyone wanting to try it ON sale.

Congratulations, dear reader, that hero is you!Equiped with a broom, blood/mess sniffer and your bloody hands (literaly and figuratively), your job is to clean this place from the top to bottom! That includes blood, bodies, ""we are doomed"" written with blood on the wall, bullet shells and bullet holes! Especially bullet holes! We don't want the scientists hiding drugs in there!Now that you know you job, let's talk specifics! You get a box from the box machine, throw the garbage in the box, carry the box back to the incinerator, repeat untill no more garbage! Well, no more bodies BUT HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ DICKWAD! There's bloody footprints everywhere and blood is still on the wall! Don't stare there like a dumb idiot, get a bucket of water from the water bucket machine and clean this up! The water is bloody now, now burn the bloody water bucket and don't... HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU'VE SPILLED BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE! THIS GAME HAS PHYSICS, SO BE CAREFULL! Get another one from the water bucket machine! Well, look at that, the bucket machine gave you a bloody hand! Well, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ press the button again and hope you get a bucket and throw this hand in the incinerator! By now you've probably cleaned everything, time to sign out and end you shift! Well ♥♥♥♥, you forgot a bullet shell to burn and a scientist tripped, fell and died of brain concusion! GOOD JOB, YOU'RE FIRED! TOO BAD, SO SAD! And that's the whole game! How they made a minimum wage job and cleaning fun is beyond me!Now, you think this game is ugly! IT'S NOT, DICKWAD! It runs on ♥♥♥♥ing Unreal 3 engine! For a game that's about cleaning, that's ♥♥♥♥ing amazingly suprising! By the time I'm writing this, the game is still in early alpha! Now, some of you are starting to look for another game AND WHO SAID YOU CAN DO THAT?! KEEP READING! The devs are updating the game reguraly, from bug fixes to new maps! Overall, the game is reguraly updated, the gameplay is fun (for some reason), it looks great and it's great if you don't want to think a lot when you play or just want to unleash your inner janitor!

 Viscera Cleanup Detail  Early Access   FULL RELEASE  Review  Last Updated: January 5th, 2016  Update: YES! Finally this game has been released fully! No longer do people have to ""Wait until it leaves Early Access"" to consider this game! Now, I apologize for not updating my review that much during the Early Access period, and sorry for waiting so long to give a full release update.  Anyway there isn't really any difference in this review, considering that the core game is the same, but I did edit a couple things, enjoy.  What can I say about this game?  It was probably one of the greatest Early Access games I have come across.  It seems the Early Access model is abused and is filled with games that make little progress.  This game on the other hand has made plenty of progress, adding in new mechanics and maps constantly.  Even after leaving Early Access, they seem to still update the game, revisiting the awfully updated Santa's Rampage expansion and having it be a part of free DLC instead of Standalone, a benefit of this being that you can now play it in the modern version of the engine, instead of the buggy mess that is the older engine.  Gameplay  This game is about cleaning, which is very odd, I mean how can they make a game about cleaning fun?  Well, it is simple, they make sure that it is interesting.  You take on the roll of a space janitor, cleaning for various companies.  What do you clean up exactly?  Viscera!  You clean up various dead bodies, organs, blood spots, radioactive materials, aliens, and even the normal trash that would consist of soda cans and potato chip bags.  When you are cleaning you are using various tools to get the job done, such as your mop, the newly added broom (Which sadly seems to not be very useful...), the welder, and many more.  In order to have a job well done, you must weld all the bullet holes, mop up any messes you see, and incinerate any trash or even bodies you find.  The concept sounds simple and dumb, but trust me when I say that you will be spending hours enjoying yourself while you clean, especially if you have a friend to bring with you.   Story  Each map has it's own story.  It is told by the various notes scattered around the map and the various hints as to what really happened before you were tasked of cleaning.  I find it really interesting how they try to tell the story of each facility through the eyes of the janitor, the person who is tasked of cleaning the aftermath of the action.  There is even some story found inside your own office, which I will not spoil, but let's just say there is a small surprise found behind every door.   Content  Let's just say there is a ton of content in this game.  There are plenty of official maps that are already added, especially as of now.  Each map can take you a good amount of time, and thanks to the new save feature, you can pick up and return to each map if you wish.  With each map there is also easter eggs and other things to look out for in each map too, so there is even some side content.  Also included with the purchase of the base game is the Shadow Warrior and Christmas standalone maps, which are sadly a bit outdated when it comes to the engine.  Speaking of crossovers though I REALLY wish this game had more crossover maps, in the form of either standalone or just maps in general, it would be cool to clean up Black Mesa from Half-Life or possibly Aperture Science from Portal.   Performance/Optimization  So far optimization in this game is really good.  The game doesn't lag too much from what I played.  I have a decent PC, not the best but good enough for gaming.  There is one problem however, and that is multiplayer.  Playing multiplayer is possible and is actually 100% playable with some precautions.  If you tread too much and make more of a mess than what you started with, you will start to lag, and if you are hosting then the other person playing will start to see some interesting glitches.  Even if you play and have the place near clean you still see glitches as someone who is not hosting, such as the mysterious kamikaze blue bin.   Overall  This game is great, it is a blast with friends, and despite it being a cleaning simulator, it is still a boatload of fun!  Plenty of content for the money, even if it is 3$ more than it was during Early Access.			"

								This game reminds me of the time when I ran over a turtle with a lawn mower.  The game is the most realistic experience I have ever had as a gamer.  This game is an amazing adaption of the life of a Janitor in games like halo, dead space, and other sci-fi games.  Fantastic graphics and does not hold back on the gore.  10/10 would clean up after master chief again.			"

												Lets begin,Visecera Cleanup Detail is a game that was made for ODC Fanatics!Graphics - The Graphics are well made, Polished and high quality, executing ""Realistic Yet Cartoony"" look very well. Gameplay -The game has realistic movement yet all the rest of the physics are Arcadey like, which is nice but not when you pile up buckets and they begin to go bats crazy!Engine and Opimization - VSD runs on Unreal Engine 3, and is well opimized! Only downside is that if the host does not have a super duper fast internet and a good PC then the game will give you a notification that there are too many blood and objects, so you'll have to clear them out for a better experience!Replayability - Alone the game is subtle and relaxing, adding your friends in uncontrolled will become a funny mayhem and turn into friendship breaker! Control your friends and don't let them go crazy with the lazer:""Hanz what u doing?!?!  Get the buckit not de flammenwerfer""Summery - If you want a good game to lay back and relax on, this is your game! You punch in your work tag and begin to clean, in the end you punch out and get a score of your work! There is no time rush but there are a lot of small details to do if you want to get 100% on your checkout!Reccomendation - Grab this game on sale, get the 4 pack and play with your friends, this game has an easy learning curve and is a blast! (great game for drunk nights fellas)Score - 9/10			"

												In a nutshell, Viscera Cleanup Detail poses the question, ‘What happens after you finish an FPS?’, then answers it with ‘Someone has to come along and clean up all the blood, gore, bullet casings and destroyed stuff, and get the place ready for work again the next day.’ That “someone” is, of course, you.Its central shtick – that you’re working in environments familiar from the shooters we all know and love, as well as various icons of genre cinema – is ideally served by its Unreal Engine 3 housing. The colour palette tends to err on the side of ‘fun’, and fits well with the game’s overall sense of humour. The levels are solid and chunky, beautifully textured and full of hidden detail. In fact, the amount of thought and care that has gone into each level is very clear. They look and feel like they’ve been meticulously planned and carefully crafted by people who are as happy and comfortable working in their game engine as I am sitting in my pyjamas writing about it. Plus, you get a choice of 32- or 64-bit executables to launch, which is always a delicious cherry on any gaming cake.It’s an interesting concept, and an excellent setting in which to explore it. But what’s it like to play? Well, entering a level for the first time and looking around is a bit like waking up in the morning with a heavy head and seeing the epic mess left after last night’s fun times. Except with added ludicrous, Sam Raimi-like amounts of blood on the floors, walls and ceilings. There’s also general rubbish and litter, assorted body parts (including quite small, fiddly bits of entrails), and furniture, items and decorations that have been smashed or knocked askew. Sometimes there are broken or empty sentry gun turrets that need replicating, replacing and re-arming (making them come online again — a dangerous part of the puzzle), as well as every gamer’s godsend – first aid kits, which also need re-filling. Then, there are the barrels and crates. Each of the five levels I’ve played so far has had special zones painted on the floor, one for barrels and one for crates. Your success in each level is measured by various statistics that represent your thoroughness in cleaning and tidying, and ideally you’ll replace all these scattered containers in their proper zones to help get the best rating. So, there’s stuff to clean, stuff to repair, stuff to refill or replace, stuff to pile up in its proper place, and stuff to just shovel up and throw away. Dead stuff is part of that latter category, and its bloody messy (janitor humour again). Deceased people, plants, monsters, robots and Weird Things all leak some kind of nasty fluids, and every time you move something, trip over or drop it, more of these delightful fluids plop out. On top of that, walking through puddles of it creates footprints. And despite your best efforts, there will always be (more) blood.The very first time I fired up Viscera Cleanup Detail I lasted about five minutes before giving up and leaving it again. I’d been hankering after the game for a while, and had finally got it at a really good price from Bundlestars, so it preyed on my mind somewhat that I should go back and give it a fair shake. Finally, as I mooched about at 2 am in my kitchen dealing with the aftermath of the inaugural Summer 2016 barbecue at my place, I wondered whether clearing up broken sentry guns, blood stains and eviscerated monsters was as easy as dealing with dirty paper plates, millions of beer cans and acres of greasy, burned tin foil. Well, I can tell you that it’s not. But it sure is a lot more fun!			"

								This game is a perfect example of enabling the player to experience something you could never possibly do in real lif...Oh wait....Well, technically that's still true. This game has a lot of nearly impossible (at least highly improbable) scenarios.Cleaning a space station in zero gravity? Check.Spending hours cleaning up blood stains, knocking over your bucket, and creating another huge mess? Check.Picking up body parts and tossing them into a giant furnace? Check.Missing the giant furnace and creating another mess when you try to toss body parts from twenty feet away? Check.Trying to see how many barrels you can jam into the giant furnace? Check.Honestly, This game is an absolute blast - I highly recommend it, although I still struggle with the idea that being a janitor could be so much fun. If you're still unsure, just pick up the cheaper Shadow Warrior or Santa's Workshop versions to give it a try. The graphics are phenomenal, bugs and glitches are minimal (unless there's a stubborn invisible blood/dirt stain), and there are hours upon hours of gameplay (although it can get a tiny bit repetitive after a little while).

												Exactly what it says on the tin. You'll be on a detail to cleanup viscera. It's not simple but it's not deep either, and it makes for a fun co-op game to do something while chatting with friends. Wouldn't recommend for single player, and do be wary it can be buggy when it comes to MP connectivity.			"

								This game is fun because it allows your mind to wander and think, use your imagination and relax, instead of killing and stress out.What happened here? How did that guy die? Why did his head come off? Why do i have to clean this blood and goo? Why am i playing a cleaning guy simulator and enjoying it? And so on.There are some things that could be improved - there should be a magnet for collecting shells, in-game music, more types of cleaning supplies and things to clean in general, but even as it is this game is good enough to grant you at least several hours of relaxing fun.

Developers can't be blamed of lacking sence of humor, here we are workig on aftermath of diffrent space station acidents (and alien atacks).Blood, body parts, bullet casings... Just another day on a job. There are a lot of easter eggs from Aliens to Dead Space. Ye weapon are trusty mop and sniffer (also there is a laser gun for turning big chunks and bodies to a small ones), ye enemies are junk. Are you proffeshionl enough to do your job right? test yeself with this amazing game.Oh, and by the way, have some friends! Everything is better with friends, and this game is made for playing cooprtvley.			"

								I almost feel bad writing this... I knew exactly the type of game I was getting, and the machanics actually worked well. Well, they worked acceptably. The carry mechanics in Unreal (Which make up the most of the game) aren't great, but I can see those getting better in a future beta. It's a beta, and it feels like it, but there are the underpinnings of a really polished game.However, it's not a game I think I could ever ENJOY, not beyond maybe a level and a half. It is almost exactly like cleaning in real life. Mopping up blood is pretty rewarding, although the bucket mechanic is infuriating. Picking up trash and bodies never felt fun to me in the same way, and after a while the mopping part got pretty old as well.Besides mopping and trash collection, there's a couple distractions. The logs scattered around each level are pretty interesting, in a Bioshock-y or Dead Space-y way (There's an overt reference to Dead Space in one of them; I'm sure there are many more references to find... If you keep playing after 1 level). There's also a little minigame where you organize crates or barrels, and a sort-of-hidden gun that fixes bullet holes (unless you use it recklessly, when it just stains everything and makes more holes). None of these are bad, but they aren't really enough to break the monotony of trash/mop/rinse/repeat.The best quality of the game, honestly, is the deadpan sarcasm coating its entire existence. It's fun to tell people about it (It's a cleaning simulator! No, yeah, just that! I swear it's fun!), and its funny to play, at least for a bit. I like the stark contrast between the boring day-to-day janitorial tone and the bloodstained sci fi scenery that you clean insestines off of. But: I can't get past the fact that the actual game, where you actually spend hours just picking up giblets and scrubbing blood, is just as fun as cleaning is. And cleaning isn't fun—to me, at least.			"

												Let me set the scene for you...A young, magenta-haired woman walks into the lobby of a corporate HQ building at the strike of noon. She's dressed in white and has a katana slung over her back, a pistol resting at each side, and a loosely-fitting belt adorned with multiple spherical devices. Her eyes narrow and shift from side to side as she surveys her surroundings; a large, gleaming chamber, almost clinical in the sterile cleanliness of its features, pillars rising up to meet the skylight covering the whole expanse of the ceiling to give a view of the rest of the OmniCorp building as it fades up into the clouds, the straight line between the front doors and the elevators being broken only by a large, glass, ringed desk in the middle of the room with a pristinely presented receptionist stoically waiting with a smug, controlling look on her face. The whiteness of the room helping to make the presence of the black-suited men all the more apparent as they stand uniformly with white shirts, black ties, black shades and earpieces, each guard being virtually indistinct from the other.The girl casually strolls up to the desk, holding the gaze of the receptionist the entire time, and confidently purrs ""I'd like to speak with the boss"". Taken aback by this tooled-up figure - the smug look now wiped from her face - the receptionist hesitantly asks ""Do you... do you have an appointment?"". Zoomed in on the side of our heroine's jaw, we see a faint smile begin to emerge in the corner of her mouth. In the blink of an eye she pulls out her katana and cleaves through the monitor, keyboard and straight through the glass desk in one clean cut. The receptionist shrieks and falls backwards to the floor, the guards now steadily approaching as she makes her hysterical retreat. The girl is now encircled by a swarm of guards, all with weapons drawn and pointed at her. She slowly places her katana back in its rest and holds her hands in the air. She bows her head for a moment, looking almost as if resigned to defeat, then the smile begins to creep back again as she swiftly reaches for her guns, aims them skywards and unloads into the skylight overhead. Shards rain down and pierce the flesh of unsuspecting guards as she charges past them and slides across the floor taking cover behind the nearest pillar. Some of the guards lay skewered on the ground, many others are wounded. The ones that remain take aim at the pillar and unleash their rage upon it as they let lead fly. Oh yeah, now it's on...She takes a sharp breath then runs towards the wall and scales across it as her own guns blaze, and time seems to slow down as a hail of bullet holes trail behind her and riddle the OmniCorp logo in her wake. She's taken out two opponents as they slump to the floor right before she takes refuge behind the next pillar. More bullets spray at the concrete beside her and turn it to dust, then out from the cloud leaps a blur of white as it lunges toward a guard, grabs hold of his head, swings around from it, snapping it as she uses it to launch herself onto the shoulders of the next oppressor, then, legs wrapped around him, backflips to the ground making short work of his neck, too. As more suits begin to fire on her, she scurries beneath the corpse and shields herself as it erupts in an explosion of gunfire and heavy red mist. Hearing the clicks of their now spent weapons, she sprints to the nearest black thing with her katana drawn and plunges it straight through his chest. Seeing the rest of his friends running toward her, she slams a button at the bottom of the blade's handle and extends it to twice its length. With a primal yell, she pushes forward and starts collecting corpses, one after another... Three, four, five twitching bodies, all with a blade through their hearts as they uncontrollably stumble backwards and ram into a wall. She hammers the button again and the handle retracts into the wall, effortlessly punching a hole through all their chests and sticking into the white marble as the bodies all fall down. She yanks it out, extends it once more, shakes off the blood with a single, jolting swipe, then slots it back into its sheath and makes her way to the elevator.Right as she sets foot inside, a whole swath of black suits come piling in through the lobby doors and rush in her direction. She pulls off a sphere from her belt, rolls it to the centre of the floor and blows them all a kiss with a playful wink. Just as the elevator doors ding closed, a blinding flash of light blasts out from the orb and eviscerates all around it. In slow motion we see waves of rippling blood gush through the air and spraying against the ivory walls. Black, steaming skeletons lay partially submerged in a swamp of red goo, and all that remains is the silence of death... Then, shortly after, a small door opens at the side, and a diminutive figure in overalls and rubber gloves steps out. This is where you come into the story - with a mop, a bin and a bucket. Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to Viscera Cleanup Detail!*roll title sequence with awesome rock music and shredding guitar*In this game you'll enter the scene after all the action has already happened, and your job is to clean everything up and have the place looking good as new. Pick up body parts and shell casings, mop up pools of blood, and just generally remove any evidence of any badness having ever happened. It's pretty much the antithesis of every first-person shooter ever. And it's f*cking incredible.It's amazing just how cathartic it is collecting meat chunks, assembling them into large hazardous waste bins then chucking them into an incinerator for a couple of hours. There's plenty of variety of stages as well, from sewer tunnels to space stations to twisted research labs to security robot showrooms. And just when you think you've seen everything, they'll give you something new to either see or do, all wrapped up in a gloriously twisted, dark sense of humour. There's even something of a story hidden away among the notes and odd trinkets scattered throughout the levels that can turn the game into something of a mythical treasure hunt, for anyone interested in following up on it. And best of all, you can even mop up with friends as multiple people can band together online and all chip in for a relaxing session of viscera spring cleaning.[Once again, for some reason this won't post properly to include a certain paragraph and I've had to post it in the Comments instead, so read it there... G*ddammit, Steam! Ditto with your stupid censoring that requires asterisks]It's not all perfect, as there can be some issues with objects clipping into one another (though that's mostly to comedic effect) or the final phase of stages can be a chore as you stack dozens of crates and barrels in designated areas, and don't get me started on the glass. But these are minor grievances to an otherwise clever, unique, joyous experience. I really can't recommend it enough. Buy it right now! Or you may have a certain magenta-haired girl to answer to.

								Ever wondered what it's like to be the poor schmuck who has to clean up after Doomguy? Now you can find out!This game is really relaxing and very satisfying when hours of cleaning eventually result in a space that is completely immaculate. I wonder why I don't get the same kind of satisfaction cleaning up in real life...This game is early access, so they regularly release updates for it, and it's always fun trying out new content. It also has workshop support, so when you get tired of the stock maps, there are player creations out there for you, though I can't vouch for their number. Sometimes, I have a difficult time finding the last little meat chunk or soda can or blood spat hidden in a dark high corner of the ceiling. That hardly ruins it, but maybe RS will make this easier in the future.As for the multiplayer, you don't have to deal with port forwarding like you do in santa's rampage. MP is handled through steam, so you can easily join your friends, or complete strangers. Let me tell you, you don't know your friends until they trek bloody footprints right across the floor you JUST finished mopping. Repeatedly._________Let me tell you a little story about a multiplayer session I hosted with a friend of mine. We were playing the map Unearthly Excavation.  My friend sees a ""sarlacc pit"" in the ground and jumps in it without a second thought. He died.He also found some explosives. Apparently, he couldn't light them, but not to be defeated he put it in the incinerator. Unfortunately, he forgot that he was supposed to run away. He exploded into little bits.While this is going on, I'm trying to clean up a mess that only gets messier with each water bucket carelessly spilled. That's when my friend found some explosives near me. Since I was away from the incinerator, he couldn't light them, but then I found and lit a flare. I told him I had an idea and dropped the flare next to the explosives, lighting them. I ran away, he didn't. I blew him up and got an achievement for it. My victory was short lived as I didn't realize there were more explosives that the blast had triggered. I didn't survive that one.When I came back and tried to clean up the mess we made, my friend asked me how to light the flares, and I told him he had to bang them against the wall (which is the truth). A part of me was wondering why he had asked, until he came running over with something that was lit. I almost immediately knew to run the hell away, but my desire to live gave way to caution, as instead of running, I looked behind me to make sure the water bucket was not there. Ultimately, we both exploded, and my desire to not make a bigger mess ended up doing just that.We could not stop laughing.9.9/10			"

												The life of a Space Janitor is grueling, time consuming, yet strangely rewarding.  Mop your way through level after gory level, taking ample time out of your real day to clean an imaginary location.  This game uses what I like to call ""Octopus Physics."" (In Honor of OctoDad)  Not an actual, scientific term, Octopus Physics are where everything essentially has no weight-- only volume.  It's when you can forcibly knock over a bin filled with body parts by tossing an empty soda can into it.  Octopus physics cause delightful chaos and one often ends up making a much much bigger mess of things before all is said and done.In addition to your janitorial duties, one also has to file paperwork!  Don't forget to fill out your IR-8 Incident Reports, detailing the situation as well as WTF-12 forms on each of the deceased.  This game, although simple in premise, will have you taking notes!What I liked:+Good level detail+Paperwork filing makes you more Space Detective than Space Janitor+Octopus Physics+Instant gratification of viscera removal (KABOOM! AND THE STAIN IS GONE!)+Achievements for chaos! (track 20,000 footprints, incinerate the jukebox, knock over X buckets, etc)+SquishSquishSquish!+Workshop content with a Map Editor in-game.What I didn't like:-Multiplayer takes sneaky tricks and workarounds to function (Which means it doesn't work for us dumb people)-No instructions whatsoever!  No tutorial, no helpful UI, nothing!  Sure, there are some great guides out there and a keybind chart, but that's no excuse for a lack of tutorial level(s) or instructions.Who I recommend this to:I recommend this to detail oriented individuals, and anyone who feels (or yearns for) a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.  Procrastinators might also enjoy being able to shirk their own chores in favor of this game.  Perfectionists would love this and all players need a pretty strong stomach.

								This is what an Early Access game should be! It has enough stuff that they could probably finish it now, and still be a really good game. But they're still adding new levels, new things to do, and all sorts of awesome stuff.This is also an amazingly relaxing game, and even though I don't normally like cleaning, this is a lot of fun. When I'm stressed out from work or other things, just doing the simple act of cleaning up alien bits and mop up the bloody last words of some random person is really good for unwinding.Each level has it's own 'story' of what happened, and the types of gore, bullet holes, and everything else build a great telling of a story without words.

								When I first heard of Viscera Cleanup Detail (VCD), My first thought was thus:""A cleaning game?  There is no way it can be fun.  If I wanted to clean I would get off my lazy butt and go clean my real house and get crap done.""I was, thankfully mistaken.  VCD is fun if you have OCD, more or less.  It isn't the fact you are cleaning, it is /what/ you are cleaning.Imagine back to days of old, where you are the awesome Doom Marine, ploughing through legions of space zombie demon things, all the satisfying shotgun cracks and blood and body parts flying thruogh the air.  Good times.  Now imagine the poor sod that comes in after to make the place functional again.  The one who drags each and every severed limb and dismembered body into an industrial grade furnace, mops up the blood, picks up every shell casing and makes it look good again.  Thats what VCD is, you are cleaning up after someone elses game.In all honesty I was whole heartedly ready to write off VCD before even playing it.  However another game that I had bought and quite adored (Shadow Warrior) came with a free, stand alone, DLC for paying customers, VCD: Shadow Warrior.  I had heard of VCD by this time, and had disregaurded it entirely, but with a free copy I decided to give it a shot, I could always stop playing, and it was free.  This bit of marketing was totally ingenius of the developers, because I adored it.  A game I blew off, believed I would hate, I found I loved.  I further bought the other Stand alone Santa's Rampage game upon release.Now that the real version is here, I got to say I am really not disapointed.  It is as fun as ever, and I got to admit I have honestly found such few things than fully cleaning  a level and getting 'employee of the month' in game.  It is affordable and in all honesty if you are on the fence about buying it, I recomend Santa's Rampage, or if you have Shadow Warrior give the DLC a try.  If you bought Santa's Rampage or have the Shadow Warrior one you get a perma discount on VCD, if not this game comes with both of them upon buying, so, three games in one.  It is totally worth your time and money!There are a few things that could be fixed:- A tutorial would be nice to tell people what to do and how to play (I had to look up a guide to find out how to Buff out bullet decals.)- The Punchout machine should let you know if the place is spotless or not before you clock out, much like in Santa's Rampage.- Arc Weilder should be a perminate carry like the mop.

												Trying to describe this game sounds terrible.  You're basically a space janitor, tasked to clean up after some terribly bloody incidents.  Aliens, robots, guns, things went down.  But you're just the clean up crew.  Your job is to mop up after the mess.  But this game can be remarkably satisfying.  How to best tackle the big jobs.  You could make an even bigger mess, or you could actually try to clean up and piece together what happened.  Throw everything into a corner and light it all up with a laser welder.  Meticulously pick up every piece and toss them in an incinerator.  Co-op means you can play with a group of friends and see how each other handles the tasks.This game really is more fun than it has any right to be.			"

								I would have to say that this is a rather weird game and can be taken very seriously as you mop EVERYTHING in Outer Space. Although after playing 30 minutes of the game, you start to get a little dizzy and sick, but don't let that take away from the awesome experience that's ahead of you, completing enormous missions, burning things, and getting creeped out by the misterious sounds that come from the Vents. I feel that School Janitors play this on their free time, or even as a training simulator in the Janitorial Arts School, to better prepare the Janitors of what's to come. If you hate hearing your mom complain about the dirtyness that lies in your household, come play this game, and you'll really know how she feels as your friends leave bloody footprints everywhere when you constantly tell them to stop walking in blood. So really, this game is meant for you to be closer with your mother, so you can get a better understanding on her point of view when she starts yelling. 7/10 Would get more Headaches again!			"

												---The world's first OCD simulator--- 10/10 for triggering my OCD when it comes to cleaning. It's a unique and innovative concept which has never been done before in gaming. It creates a new paradigm in cleaning simulators that can only be countered by cleaning in real life.This is possibly the world's first OCD simulator. I have never found myself wanting to go back constantly and clean EVERYTHING. Think of this game (I don't know if I can call it a game but more of a ""trigger"") as taking part after say DOOM or whatever Space Marine simulator you prefer.Now, imagine it's about a few days after the incident and the company wants to use the base again. Well, someone has to clean up the mess and that's you. You are assigned the fun task of picking up the pieces of people, cleaning up the blood splatter, the shell casings, dumping the toxic waste barrels into the furnace, picking up the pieces of trash (like the empty takeout food boxes), and having to both mop up and sweep up. It's as fun as it sounds, trust me.Now, you are alone, in the base in silence. All you have is your map, broom, your hands (wearing cleaning gloves of course, have to be safe), and some random ghost busters looking thing which I have no idea what it actually does since the game doesn't tell you. So, off you go on your task to start the cleanup. Fun OCD adventues will soon ensue.You start out next to a dispenser and if you push the button (most of the time) a bucket of clean water will be dispensed. You pick this up and take it over to the first area you want to clean. So, you use your trusty mop, dunk it in the bucket (which is a project in itself since you can easily splash the bucket - that becomes a problem as the water gets dirty) or what usually happens is you spill it. This leaves the floor wet. No problem you think, I'll just get another bucket. So you walk over, get another bucket and think ok, no problem. You pick up the task where you left off. Then you happen to look down to refresh your mop - well shi!!!!! the water you spilled caused you to leave footprints as you walked back to the bucket station.Now, not only do you have to clean up the inital mess but you have to clean up your footprints. More fun ensues, as your bucket water gets pretty nasty fast (I mean you are cleaning up blood, toxic waste, dead children and the sorts). So, you go bust out your trusty mop and start trying to clean that up. Well, once again, the water gets dirty. So, soon you start collecting buckets. The game doesn't tell you what to do with any of the trash, including the buckets, so maybe you figure out that the big metal thing behind you is a furnace. So, you go pick up the bucket full of dirty water, but because you moved too fast, it spills. The bucket makes it into the furnace but now as you walk back to get another bucket you leave footprints all over the place since the water was dirty.This time, because Zeus loves you, you click the button for a new bucket, and behold, a bloody body part is dispensed, you pick it up and accidentially touch the machine - blood everywhere. So, you go and burn the body part. Another body part will be dispensed and this time you don't touch the machine, but you still have to dispose of it. You carry it over and do your thing. Go back and BAM! you get a bucket of clean water. However, since you dirtied the machine, you have to clean the machine now. By the time you get back to the original mess your bucket water is already half dirty and pretty much only good for a dunk or two.So, you burn up the bucket. If you are lucky you didn't spill it this time. You go back and repeat the cycle, but then you walk in the area which is still wet. Well it's your lucky day because now you have to mop up the area where you just tracked up with footprints.Oh and don't forget your trusty broom which as you push objects around starts smearing blood and poop across the floor. So, you have to clean that up too. There is also some laser/fire thing but I don't think that was very helpful as all it did was blow the bodies into chunks.This game is the greatest OCD simulator ever developed for the PC. I cannot recommend it enough if you have issues with cleanliness and want to experience the joy of cleaning up a virtual world with the problems of real world cleaning. I don't know if you can ever really ""win"" as after about 15 minutes of cleaning up the same spot and then dirtying it up again, I realized that it would never meet my godly standards for cleanliness.I give this game a 10/10 for being the first OCD simulator. I have never ""played"" anything like it and it triggered the OCD in me. If you have OCD, and want to virtually clean in circles, this is the game for you. If I were on a hardcore strteet drug like evil crystal I might have spent hours playing this game. However, since I am not into evil crystal nor do I want to have my OCD triggered by a ""Game"" this isn't for me. However, if you are speeding along on evil crystal, this is quite possibly the greatest outlet ever for that infinite energy that you supposedly get. You can channel it in the virtual world instead of cleaning on single spot in your house for 5 hours, you can do it in a post-space marine warzone. It would be an excellent place to channel all that energy. Otherwise, if you are like me, you will want to punch a hole in the wall after seeing that you left footprints because you walked in your dirty water, or spilled the bucket, or tried to sweep up the trash only to smear blood and green goo everywhere. You'll truly live the experience of cleaning in this game. It wil complete your life in ways only cleaning in real  life would! As for me, I am going to go pick up the trash in my room now. Thanks Viscera all your inspiration!			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail is a first-person janitorial simulation game that takes the player into the bloody, horrific environments ""...in the aftermath of a sci-fi horror event"".Accordingly, the player's job is simply to clean up the mess (by disposing of human and alien body parts, and mopping away blood and other substances that may have resulted from the onslaught).This game has been released on Steam's Early Access program to very positive user-reviews. Although it has been in Early Access for a little over a year. It is updated regularly and they're always adding new maps. The game gives a completely new take on sci-fi and horror games, as the player must experience the horrors of picking up after the hero, rather than being the hero themselves.The game also comes in two other, less updated versions, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage and Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior.For $9.99 you really can't beat getting three amazing games. Well, what are you waiting for? Get out there and clean! We've all got work to do.Final Verdict;10/10			"

Cleaned more in this then real life simulatorYou are the unsung hero, Going through level after level to clean up the mess left behind that no one else dare touch. You don't complain because you know, your role is important and you’re the man for the job. You’re at the top of your field, you're your own boss. You’re Mop in hand, bucket ready you can overcome any challenge thrown at you.But then, Just as you finish mopping up the last spot of blood & picked up the last empty can of limited edition red mountain dew.... Player 2 enters the level... and for a moment you feel completely at piece.....Before you rinse your mop, put in a fresh pair of gloves & start all over again.6.7/10- Rinse, Clean, Pickup, Repeat & Repeat & Repeat & Repeat....

								game looks boring, but it's actually pretty addicting. physics can get buggy when you pair bullet casings with trash and body parts but if you avoid that its 10/10. body parts coming out of the water bucket and waste bucket machines can get super annoying, along with the elevator machine jamming every other lift. definitely worth $10, better time waster than any other game. much more fun with friends, so if you're going to buy it get a few of your friends to buy along with you. variety of levels, it's like portal 2 co-op maps, you will never run out as long as there is a workshop. one thing about this game though is their scoring is strange, once you complete a job you are returned to your office. instead of giving you a score screen you go to a monitor in the main room and it will show you a percentage of how well you did. definitely worth the price right now($10), there are definitely some bugs but they are easy to avoid.

								Funnier and more entertaining than it should be because of how much of a buggy abomination it currently is. Only played it multiplayer. We've experienced something we're now calling ""The Silence of the Buckets"".Do you still hear them spilling?Organs purposefully come out of biohazard bin and water bucket dispensers, buckets spill out of nowhere for no reason, organs churn, dance and act as if alive when in bins and furnace, buckets whip around corners (possessed by machine gods, perhaps), players disappear and reappear, blood and items disappear and reappear, parts of faces show up sometimes, viscera in strange places, omgsomuchblood, players randomly fall over and die, sometimes because buckets. 9/10 because some levels are so buggy we can't suffer an eternal nightmare trying to clean them, defects and all. Slightly too buggy? I suppose. If future updates cause organs to stop flailing in bins at all times, I don't think I'll be as interested.			"

												There are several stages you go through in this game...Starting the first map...Oh.. you have to remove the body parts and clean the blood and other stuff, I get it easy peasy.Soon after your friends/some other people join...I'll just put my bucket here, what bad can happen?One hour later...Ah, so this is how the sniffer thingy works, wait... bullet holes...?Two or three hours later...Just a second, what are these zones, d-do I actually need to stack the crates and barrels there?Quite some time later...I-I can fill out a report? - O-Okay, I just write some stuff I guess...After writing way too much stuff and scrolling further down...Guys.. how many things have you burned again? - What do you mean you didn't count?!After reading through the whole Article 402: Sanitation ManualHey, did anybody check if body #22 was eviscerated and decapitated or just eviscerated?And then you learn about Bobs notes...

								Have you ever played a game where there are many objects you are able to pick up, yet they serve no purpose. Well this game actually gives those objects a purpose, and the goal is to clean that♥♥♥♥♥♥up. The entire point of the game is to clean up bloody messes using your trusty mop and hands. At first I figured this would be quite the easy task; however, it can take a lot of time to clean everything up based on how ocd you can be. There are no clear instructions on how to clean♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and you learn by simply playing for a while. There are huge incinerators placed around the map where you can throw the body parts into, and Splosh-O-matics which dispenses buckets of water.https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5576/14561463657_e5b6f1d72f_b.jpg (splosh-O-matic & incinerators)Thankfully the devs didn't limit how much buckets of water you can get out of the Splosh machine because you are constantly going to need to refill up on them. Like real life you can't just keep using the same bucket of water to clean beacuse after a while the water is just to become filthy. I had about 20 buckets placed in a corner at one time in order to just clean one small area. If you don't remember to dip your mop in water it will only lead to more blood/goo being spread about the place. Another little neat thing in the game is that you also leave behind bloody footprints each time you step into a blood pile. The jump feature is actually useful for avoiding those blood stains, so you don't end up tracking those footprints about the place. It definitely is quite the task to clean everything up in a room, but it is a clean up simulator after all.The biggest gripe I have about the game so far is that the ragdoll physcis could certainly be a lot better. Also being able to throw the body parts would help instead of having to get as close as possible to the incinerators just to dump an arm in them. This game has a lot of potential to be great, and I've really enjoyed my time playing it. I certainly recommend this game to those who like to clean♥♥♥♥♥♥up.+ you get to clean♥♥♥♥♥♥up+ Takes a lot of time to clean (plus for me although may be a minus for others)+ great atmosphere- physics could be better- no in-game music (what janitor doesn't listen to music!)

												  Never before have I felt so culturally enriched. Truly one's existence focused solely on janitorial tasks is the key to fulfillment. It's a game about cleaning up bloody messes, with janitorial equipment. These men are the unsung heroes of our FPS action adventures. Always there to clean up the messes we leave in our shell casing spewing wake. 10/10 Mops			"

								Funnier and more entertaining than it should be because of how much of a buggy abomination it currently is. Only played it multiplayer. We've experienced something we're now calling ""The Silence of the Buckets"".Do you still hear them spilling?Organs purposefully come out of biohazard bin and water bucket dispensers, buckets spill out of nowhere for no reason, organs churn, dance and act as if alive when in bins and furnace, buckets whip around corners (possessed by machine gods, perhaps), players disappear and reappear, blood and items disappear and reappear, parts of faces show up sometimes, viscera in strange places, omgsomuchblood, players randomly fall over and die, sometimes because buckets. 9/10 because some levels are so buggy we can't suffer an eternal nightmare trying to clean them, defects and all. Slightly too buggy? I suppose. If future updates cause organs to stop flailing in bins at all times, I don't think I'll be as interested.			"

												It's bizarre how fun this game is. If I told you ""Take this spacemop and clean this entire hallway of dead bodies, alien corpses, individual bullet casings, soda cans, entrails, scorchmarks, etc and then write a report on what happened after you're done"", you'd probably cringe.Not in this game; I spent an hour cleaning every single thing I found, throwing the bodies into the incinerator, picking up gubbins and shoving them into a biohazard bin and then throwing the said bin into the incinerator, grabbing a laser-gun-what-do-you-call-it and sealing dozens and dozens of bullet holes and finally writing a report for extra points because why not. It was so satisfying to get 110% and the ""Employee of the Month"" award.Which I promptly tore off the wall and placed on a shelf in the basement after cleaning it from all the bits of gore the last guy left and made it my impromptu trophy room.If you have a lot of time in your hands, try it; You probably won't be disappointed.

												I really wanted to like this game. I enjoy cleaning, and thought that the mindless, menial in-game cleaning would be fun. It's not. I found the controls to be janky, and for the love of gravy, they need some sort of a ""dustpan"" for things like bullets. Picking them, and crisp packets, and tiny bits of people by hand wasn't fun, it wasn't cathartic, it was annoying! There was a small bit of satisfaction when leaving a room ""clean"", but all that kept going through my head was: I should be cleaning my own house. Also: in my own house, I have slightly more control over my body movements so that I'm not constantly knocking over my big ol' bio-bin full of assorted nasties. Not that I have a bio-bin full of assorted nasties, mind you.			"

								After you've played a round of Duke Nukem, Quake, Doom, Serious Sam, Halo or Call of Duty, did you ever pity the poor prick who would have to clean up the mess of blood and limbs you left behind? Well in this game, you play that poor prick. You're a space janitor and your job is simple: clean♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Viscera Cleanup Detail is a terrific game for any gamer who is frankly a little bored of the formulaic crud that has saturated video games in recent years. The game is early access but the developer seems to never sleep and is constantly updating it at no extra charge, which is awesome. It's physics engine is pretty damn impressive, especially when you consider that it's able to put stuff in bins without the elements spazzing out and flying around the room, as they often do in games. The details are top-notch and gameplay is fluid and easy to use. It's morbid sense of humour is great and the sound design is excellent. I never grow tired of hearing body parts squish as I drop them in the bin. VCD also has a hosting system so you can play with friends.This game is fun and engaging and can be an excellent time-sink if you find yourself bored and have nothing to do. I personally like to put on a podcast and have a game while I listen.For some, the game's novelty may wear thin, and in some cases it can get boring after a little while. But the game has its charm and is actually rather challenging considering that EVERYTHING is coated in blood. It really is a terrific experience and a nice break from the usual old, gimmicky clap-trap that video games seem to peddle to the masses these days. If you only like games where you run around shooting people or grinding about in MMOs, this game will probably bore you to tears. But if you're like me, and wanna try something new and different that's challenging and doesn't take itself entirely serious, give Viscera Cleanup Detail a play.			"

Posted: December 3, 2016
												Let's be frank about it: Viscera Cleanup Detail is a gimmick game and thus not one intended for long-term gameplay. After all, in essence it is a janitorial simulation, where you get to clean up the messes made by other people. But what made this game so enjoyable was the contrast between this mundane job and the exotic locations to which that job brought me.The game was surprisingly good looking for a throw-away title like this, and the game felt as much a love-letter to FPS games as it was an attempt to make money for the developers. The gameplay was surprisingly enjoyable too, albeit only for short periods. The wonky physics made my clean-up attempts all that more amusing (whoops, just bumped the bucket and spilled dirty water all over... again!) and finding that last bit of gore or shell-casing in an attempt to get the vaunted ""employee of the month"" poster was surprisingly challenging. I have to admit I was more than a little bit impressed by how well the physics engine handled placing items in and carrying around containers, too.Still, this is definitely a game you don't want to spend much money on; I became tired of it before an hour was done and never did bother to explore all the levels. After all, even with the exciting locals and fun physics in the end it still is cleaning up, and I can't imagine anyone really finds that fun. Mildly amusing, strangely charming and different sure, but not worth a major investment in funds or time. Recommended if you can get it at a steep discount because it is just quirky enough to be fun, but if you pay full price you definitely will not be getting value for your dollar; there just isn't enough of a game there.

												This game is exceedingly boring, but thats the point. I think this game has opened up some sort of serial killer side of me because normal people ive seen let's play this are always shocked, meanwhile im just shoving people into the wood chipper and cataloging all the bullets, knives, and trash. I once walked into a room with blood and intestines covering a king sized bed and the ceiling and I just shruged and thought ""whelp, this is pretty standard work for a demonic summoning, does a knife glove count as five knives, a glove, or one knife?""

								When you're blasting away aliens and demons as a tough space marine, do you ever wonder who's going to clean all the xeno guts off of the floor tiles? Viscera Cleanup Detail puts you in the shoes of the janitor cleaning up after the protagonist. The game has some noticable dark humor, turning what would be a grim setting into a comedy trying to dislodge some poor sod's guts from the ceiling. If you think this is some gimmick game you'll play a little and set down after 5 minutes after the novelty wears off, think again. At least if you play the way I play, you'll find a solid hour of gameplay on a single map. If you've purchased Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage and enjoyed it, you'll find that you'll get 25% off the price of VCD as of 4/11/14. My only complaint is that it may get tedious after a while searching around for that last bloodstain or the last piece of meat left lying around. There are some bugs, but it is still in alpha, and you should expect this going into an Early Access game. There is multiplayer if you want to do some janitor cleanup with your friends, but be advised it has the old 'host/join' system and you'll have to type stuff on your keyboard instead of clicking on a server.'The Citizen Kane of simulators' - Derrick the homeless guy on the street			"

								Going to try to keep this from being another joke review like all of the other ""most helpful'd"" ones up there.What you expect from this game is exactly what you get, which is sometimes good and sometimes bad. For me, its good, I rather like it! But there's no minigames, no easter eggs or hidden fun times. You are a janitor, and you clean. The co-op is something I like even more, having a second person makes it not only faster, but fun and more social. It's still pretty buggy even as far as early access goes, but its not game-breaking, midly annoying at most. As far as gameplay.. pretty polished actually. Movement is fluid (if youre not holding a crate, which can often bump around due to hitboxes of its contents.), and some tactics are actually needed if you dont want to mess areas you've already cleaned. Mechanics are pretty cool and getting progressively more in-depth, for instance if you walk through some blood you'll get it on your boots and track it for a certain period of time. All in all I personally like it but it's not for everyone who maybe has a shorter span of attention and won't want to wait around to see the job done.EDIT: Almost forgot price. I would value it at probably around it's current price of 7 USD, but me being frugal wouldn't buy it until it was 5 USD or lower.			"

								Viscera cleanup detail is a simulator in which you live as a janitor hired to clean up a space station after a horrific event caused by some sort of alien invasion made a mess of the station. Blood and body parts (also called viscera) litter every part of the station, be it human or alien. Your main objective in this game is, of course, to clean the designated area of blood, gore, and casings. In your arsenal, you have a uber-absorbant mop, your hands, and a sniffer tool which helps find any mess you missed. You are also given a bucket dispenser and bin dispenser, which both can spew out mess at random times, causing you to rage. Also at your disposal is an incinerator where all your bins and dirty buckets are disposed of. Not only do you have to clean up the violence, you must tidy up, which includes not leaving trash, buckets, or bins, not leaving overturned barrels (people apparently die quite easily from these), and filling any wall-mounted medkits with new supplies. There are also bullet holes on the walls apart from everything else. To get rid of these, and prevent someone freaking out from them and breaking their neck, you need a plasma gun, which is located somewhere on the map. Watch out though, as overheating it causes it to create more mess. There is also very simple yet effective multiplayer, where you team up to take down the mess that plagues the station. I will admit this game has more than a few bugs, but this game is in early access, and updates bring many new additions and many needed bug fixes. This game, if u got the money, is definitely worth it, and besides, who wouldn't want to clean blood and gore in the middle of space?infinite X infinite/10			"

												This is one of those curious, experimental indie titles that should have come out a long time ago.  You'll either love it or hate it, but since may people seem to like it, it's quite pleasing to say that Runescape's gamble has paid off.  It's exactly what it says on the tin, with no gimmicks or annoying, forced puzzles.  After fleet glasses the planet, janitors mop up!7/10 - I've played a ton of it so far and I love it, but it's not for everyone.I recommend buying the stand-alone Santa's Rampage game first, as it's still one of the best and funniest levels in the series, and it's got lots of explosives to keep things interesting.Pros:- Terrific craftsmanship and worth every penny.- This is a NICE looking and sounding game with tons of polish.- The gore is... especially so.  The plant pods are actually the scariest.- The physics are actually pretty decent once you learn the quirks.- Multiplayer is hilarious and the best way to play.- There is a sub-plot and lots of hidden secrets and Easter eggs.- Speed runs are where it's at (though you can't collect trophies in this mode).- Use of the Unreal console isn't gimped.  Cause some chaos!Cons:- Some levels are rusty corridor after rusty corridor, making it hard to tell between clean and dirty.- Green alien blood on green floors with green lighting.  'Nuff said.- Suffers from many technical issues, including studdering.- Documentation and backstory is lacking.- Some levels are way too dark, even though lanterns are available.- Needs more dangers, explosives, and amusing physics.  In solo mode, you are completely alone.- Could use more bizarre, exotic locations, a la Santa's Rampage.  Industrial locations suck.- Needs more tools besides the mop and sniffer.  The brush and PDA are useless.- The laser welder was a bad addition.  Finding bullet holes to weld is VERY frustrating.- The office is a map with its own save file.  If you get fired, you cannot fix it by loading a save game.Tips:- If you're an achievement collector, for heaven's sake, get the ""You're Fired"" achievement first!  If you get fired later in the game, you'll lose all the trophies in the office, which is a massive design flaw and a huge slap in the face.  No, you can't reload your game save and fix it.- You only need to clean a level 70% to return trophies to the office.  This can save a lot of time on replays.- You only get fired if you clock out.  If you can't clean the level properly, just choose the ""Leave"" option and you'll be fine.- Return every note from ""Bob"" to the office.  It sucks to burn them early in the game, only to find out LATER you were supposed to keep them, and you have to replay all the early levels again.- Run the game via Steam and choose 64-bit.  If run as 32-bit, the game is more likely to have problems.- Mop up blood first, then collect body parts.  Blood multiplies, not spreads, as you walk over it.- The office is much bigger than you think, so put in the effort to hack all the door locks.			"

												This game isn't fun, exactly—it's an occasionally creepy, unique NPC simulator whose sandbox-ish mashup of meta-storytelling, stark horror imagery, and mundane drudgery somehow manages to be both darkly funny and perversely satisfying. I like it a lot, for the obvious reason—conceptually, it's a particularly funny♥♥♥♥♥♥take on the tropes of horror FPSs. After the big lantern-jawed super soldier stomps through and paints the walls with alien squick, you're called upon to pick up the expended shell casings and severed limbs, mop up the blood, and replenish all the health kits. Somebody's got to, right?VCD is in early access, and it feels like it. They've clearly done a hell of a job with the physics in this game to get it this far, but even still after the first few times a bin full of severed body parts encounters a physics glitch and spews everything upward with the force of a shotgun, covering the walls and ceiling with more blood to mop up, you'll find yourself eyeing inanimate objects with deep suspicion. Okay, so it's out of early access now and the physics are significantly improved while still just janky enough to make you feel like the gameworld's got it in for you. Objects still occasionally interact wonkily with each other, but after the first instance or two this kind of thing becomes predictable. You'll still have the occasional bit of gore clip through the bottom of a trash box and leave a long smear of blood, but you have to really pack stuff in there to get it to happen.Which, somehow, is part of the charm. It all reminds me a bit of Papers, Please in that Kafkaesque desensitization sort of way. As a wage-slave trapped in a thankless job working for an amoral employer, it somehow seems right that the physics engine sometimes punishes you for no reason whatsoever, or that the supplies dispensers occasionally dispense bloody mangled meat instead of buckets of water. You quickly stop seeing the bloody gobbets of former co-workers as anything other than one more damn mess to clean up. Or, depending on your particular bent, toys to play with or souvenirs to tuck away. What to make of it all is, of course, up to you.But I also really enjoy VCD because it is one of the few games that has altered how I think about *other* games. What The Stanley Parable had to say about the arbitrary nature of narrative and objectives in gaming, VCD says something very similar about contrivance—for most any modern game to be playable, the gameworld must necessarily be designed around if not specifically for the player's avatar. And the rules of how that avatar interacts with that world, even down to basic physics, are by necessity completely different from the ones NPCs follow. You, by becoming the NPC in someone else's story, get to experience a gameworld built for someone who is not you. And that someone is kind of an a-hole. I'll never look at Half Life in quite the same way again.That's the beauty of VCD—nerds like me can wax philosophical about it, but if that doesn't suit your taste you also have the option to pop into multiplayer and throw intestines at your friends all night. Well worth the money and quite playable in either case.			"

												Let's get things straight: this game is statisfying for certain poeple so don't hate on it right away.Viscera Cleanup Detail (or VCD for short) is a game about cleaning murder scenes. You probally think that that is disgusting, but it's actually quite interessting. I personally discovered this game by a video of Nerd³. Since then I played this game for 28 hours already and I love it. It has funny bits and pieces and also some story in every map. For people who are new to this game should definitly ask someone to get them started (like me). The game does not have a tutorial and that's one of the things that makes this game a bit less likeable, but as always someone made a tutorial level on the steam workshop to get you started.The maps on this game go from 45 mnutes of playtime to 3 HOURS of playtime and the sizes go from small to huge. Most maps have around 1-2 hours of playtime wich is long you may think but once you play the game you won't even notice (I've done 5 hours straight without noticing.).A far as mechanics go there is not too much special. Only some tools and machines that appear in every level. Some tools are level specific. There are also secondary objectives that won't influence your score. The controls are quite easy, just WASD and mouse buttons (or xbox 360 controls). As far as multiplayer goes there are  few options:splitscreen co-op for wich you need to be on the pc and need two xbox 360 controllers. Then you have multiplayer server for up to 28 people (not recommended though). The servers are not paid or don't require any difficult set-up things to do but are a bit slow sometimes. For the multiplayer servers you can make them public or friends only wich comes in handy when you're trying to do a speedrun or so.For VCD I would give a 9/10. I hope you found this helpful and thanks for reading. Regards, Spider.			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail has been a surprising amount of fun to play... Set in the kind of world where the antics of the various action heroes aren't just glossed over you're the one who has to clean it up... all of it. The alien goo, the dead scientists and co workers. But even though you load into what has to be some of the most gruesome situations, there's something very satisfying about puttering around the crime scene just cleaning up the mess. From figuring out how to best move the body parts to deciding what section of the floor needs moping first, its the most fun I've had from a first person perspective for a long time. XD "

												If you have time to kill, want to blow off stress, and/or loving the concept of cleanliness but hate the effort then this game is for youViscera Clean-up Detail is a first person janitorial game where you, the player, are assigned to the deep reaches of space and even as far north as Santa's own workshop to clean up the mess left behind after a number of circumstances (Included but not limited to: Alien Genocide, Homocidal santa, loose experiments, etc)What's great about this game is that there's a very deep sense of calm as you mop up puddles of blood and burn biohazard bins full of every chunk of meat and viscera that should never leave the human body. Playing with friends is even more fun because now you can clean up quickly, hang out with your friends, and screw them over by dumping out all of their trash and kicking over the buckets of dirty blood and water to make even more messes.If you ever need a way to kick back, relax, and feel accomplished at something then just play Viscera Clean up Detail, most maps will be done in 2 hours on average and they can always be replayed so the cleaning fun is limitless			"

								A very time consuming game. You spend hours into cleaning a room but get pentalties if you throw things away that need to be stacked in a corner that is marked. Though it can bore you if you play this on your own, co-op seems more fun. Would like to see more changes in this game, stacking boxes gets annoying after a little while.			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail is a lovely game that lets you kick your feet back, and not rage at noobs on the other team for killing you with a grenade launcher. It is a game which incorporates the ability to clean spaceships after a war has breached. I would recommend this game to anybody who wants a game that is laid-back and doesn't cause massive amounts of stress.			"

You will recover notes and letters that could possibly belong to the corpse that you just threw into the fire. You cannot help him, he is lost, so you take his head and shove it into your blue box, maybe he will be remembered by sitting alongside all the other identical heads on your desk at the office, sitting right next to the head of the alien he slaughtered.Never has a game made me do the most boring thing in the world without any sort of reward.

												Before I purchased Viscera Cleanup Detail I had seen it multiple times on Steam thinking it was just another indie title set to fail. I was wrong. It's strangely relaxing to walk around inside of a massive evil complex and clean up the guts and gore. Who knew?The multiplayer is excellent even though it's got its bugs & quirks. Items sometimes go haywire due to some weird clipping issues but it doesnt make the game any worse. It makes it more unpredictable and fun since it creates another mess that you and your friends need to clean up.

There's nothing like collecting bodyparts and incinerating buckets of blood with your friends. Apart from the cleaning up there's a lot of secrets, references and puzzles within the maps that make it more interesting. One map slowly makes you realize that you are within the robot factory where the terminator was made and that some of those robots malfunctioned and started slaughtering everybody.If you are looking for a relaxing game to play then this is a good choice.

								Viscera Cleanup Detail has been a surprising amount of fun to play... Set in the kind of world where the antics of the various action heroes aren't just glossed over you're the one who has to clean it up... all of it. The alien goo, the dead scientists and co workers. But even though you load into what has to be some of the most gruesome situations, there's something very satisfying about puttering around the crime scene just cleaning up the mess. From figuring out how to best move the body parts to deciding what section of the floor needs moping first, its the most fun I've had from a first person perspective for a long time. XD "

												If you have time to kill, want to blow off stress, and/or loving the concept of cleanliness but hate the effort then this game is for youViscera Clean-up Detail is a first person janitorial game where you, the player, are assigned to the deep reaches of space and even as far north as Santa's own workshop to clean up the mess left behind after a number of circumstances (Included but not limited to: Alien Genocide, Homocidal santa, loose experiments, etc)What's great about this game is that there's a very deep sense of calm as you mop up puddles of blood and burn biohazard bins full of every chunk of meat and viscera that should never leave the human body. Playing with friends is even more fun because now you can clean up quickly, hang out with your friends, and screw them over by dumping out all of their trash and kicking over the buckets of dirty blood and water to make even more messes.If you ever need a way to kick back, relax, and feel accomplished at something then just play Viscera Clean up Detail, most maps will be done in 2 hours on average and they can always be replayed so the cleaning fun is limitless			"

												Let's get things straight: this game is statisfying for certain poeple so don't hate on it right away.Viscera Cleanup Detail (or VCD for short) is a game about cleaning murder scenes. You probally think that that is disgusting, but it's actually quite interessting. I personally discovered this game by a video of Nerd³. Since then I played this game for 28 hours already and I love it. It has funny bits and pieces and also some story in every map. For people who are new to this game should definitly ask someone to get them started (like me). The game does not have a tutorial and that's one of the things that makes this game a bit less likeable, but as always someone made a tutorial level on the steam workshop to get you started.The maps on this game go from 45 mnutes of playtime to 3 HOURS of playtime and the sizes go from small to huge. Most maps have around 1-2 hours of playtime wich is long you may think but once you play the game you won't even notice (I've done 5 hours straight without noticing.).A far as mechanics go there is not too much special. Only some tools and machines that appear in every level. Some tools are level specific. There are also secondary objectives that won't influence your score. The controls are quite easy, just WASD and mouse buttons (or xbox 360 controls). As far as multiplayer goes there are  few options:splitscreen co-op for wich you need to be on the pc and need two xbox 360 controllers. Then you have multiplayer server for up to 28 people (not recommended though). The servers are not paid or don't require any difficult set-up things to do but are a bit slow sometimes. For the multiplayer servers you can make them public or friends only wich comes in handy when you're trying to do a speedrun or so.For VCD I would give a 9/10. I hope you found this helpful and thanks for reading. Regards, Spider.			"

 A MUST GET! Love the game. You just gotta love it. Most first person games usually end up having lots of guns and such, but this game takes on a creative idea. Being a janitor may seem lame, especially the fact the entire game is just like being a janitor, but it's quite addicting. It's because if you actually try to finish a mission, it becomes frustrating as hell. There's buckets to trip over that causes a mess I usually end up raging and quitting whenever I stack the buckets up and later on accidentally knocking them all over. Bloody mess, I'll tell you., footprints to wash that you keep making, ashes to scrub off that you cause over and over If you know one of the tools that looks like a lazer gun, you'll know what I mean..., everything is frustrating yet so addictive. I'd recommend this to Youtubers and people who love ironic challenges.			"

								This game is actually pretty relaxing. What might seem tedious, like pikcing up 50 machine gun shell casing and putting them into a rubbish bin, has a nice ambience. The quite to the game, it reminds me of the ambient element of The Stanley Parable, perhaps sans the overt element of mystery. There's something peaceful about methodically sorting away the aftermath of a chaotic incident.A lot more could be done with this game, and I hope early access sees it through to actual storylines or begining to end progression and more dynamic gameplay elements. I mean, stuff like the furnace and tesla gun are great, but I'd like more props. It would be great if there were more to the game as a whole, and also if it took itself seriously enough to build more atmosphere and make a story. So far, the humar is remenisenct to Cago Captain, which was fine for that game. But this doesn't go well with that level of camp.All in all, I haven't played much of it, but its a cool idea.			"

												It's an enjoyable game from a janitors perspective whos job is to clean up the places and be perfectionist. Graphics look nice and physics are well done, though sometimes a bit derpy. It's a game for those who have OCD, because game punishes you for doing ""barely minimum"" job if you haven't clean upped more than 95% of the place. Keep that in mind when playing and also you should look for extra stuff, because there are easter eggs and some collectibles in levels.A bit different, but interesting game. Also note that when you purchase the game, you get two DLC maps for free, that would've been otherwise purchased separately. (Remember to launch them through the main game, so you take items from those games to your office). If you want more, you can download and play workshop maps.8/10			"

												This game is absolutely great! I have decided to devote my life to beating this game. I've enjoyed counting the what seems to be endless amounts of dead bodies and various trash. What really puts this game together is the unique mechanics. The fact that I can keep walking with a piece of paper while moving my partner wherever I so please really enlightens the overall concept of this game. I believe that if we have more games like this we'll be able to proceed in a better life and have a nicer community. What seems to bug me most about this game is the intensity of the graphics if the graphics could be a little less intense I think this game would be a even better. Overall, despite the negatives that are in this game I believe that the positives out way and you should get this game asap! If not you're missing out!TL;DR This game is absolute trash and is the worst game in the world, you'll lose brain cells playing it (JK, LOL)!			"

												I love this game! It's great for just sitting down and relaxing. I've already played through the whole game once before (prior to achievements being added), and I can't wait to play it again.Clean in-game and avoid cleaning in real life! Who would have thought cleaning was so stress-relieving?Pros:Game gives you some background info for each levelCleaning is relaxing and even fun, especially on multiplayer/co-opI get my own office where I can store crap!Creepy previous janitor whom you can learn more aboutLOTS of levels which take a long time to complete (an hour or two for a thorough cleaning done by 2 people) mean you get your money's worthFlavor text in the form of notes in your office if you forget to do something, get employee of the month, or do a good jobLots of achievements to go for. They're kind of my thing.As much as I love this game, there are a coupleCons:Game can be glitchy, especially on multiplayer, ex.: items in bins teleporting across the room, trash/bodies jumping out of bins, body parts causing bins to ""stutter"" in placeIssues with joining. I once spent a solid 5 minutes restarting the game trying to join a friend on co-op because it wouldn't connect.Having to switch to Windows to play (I'm Linux master race)I can totally overlook the cons though. They are very minor issues and can be worked around.			"

												This game is a reminder of who the real heroes are in the event of an epic disaster: the cleanup crew. Not even the most fearless of action heroes is ever seen taking the time to clean up after themselves, especially after their work is done and they've recieved their commemorations and free hookers. It is the critical job of the cleanup crew to do what the action hero does not. This game takes no time in reminding you just how miserable and thankless that job truly is.There's no tutorial, so you figure out everything on your own at your own pace.Once you understand your job and equipment, you learn to prioritize what needs to be done to keep the area clean.You develop a system for eficiently removing the large array of blood, body parts, bullet casings, and other assorted trash from an area, all while maintaining cleanliness in previously cleaned areas.You WILL make mistakes and your equipment WILL malfunction, causing more of a mess, but you will learn to accept it and move on because its all part of the job.You will clean the area to the best of your ability and allow the previously bloodied, body-strewn, trash-filled area to once again shine with its original beauty.You will clock out and return to your office, confident that you did your best.What will this get you? A level up? An unlocked item? A large exciting trophy? Untold riches? Hookers and ice cream? At the very least, a celebratory beer round with your coworkers?No.You will return to your empty office and it will look just the same as any other day. Maybe if you did a good enough job you will be Employee of the Month, with a small picture framed on the wall. Maybe some newspaper clippings will commemorate (or condemn) the hard work that you did...but nothing more. No celebration. No beer round. No sexy ladies. Just you and your office.Your lonely, lonely office.10/10 most fun I've ever had being miserable			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail really tests your patience, so unless you want to clean a handful of bullets thrown all of over the floor by yourself, then you better have some friends. (Conveniently, there's a four-pack!) There's also mod support coming soon, so who knows what kind of fun that'll bring. (Water guns for mops anyone?) The game is also really calming as long as you don't spill the bucket full of watery blood..			"

								This game is actually pretty relaxing. What might seem tedious, like pikcing up 50 machine gun shell casing and putting them into a rubbish bin, has a nice ambience. The quite to the game, it reminds me of the ambient element of The Stanley Parable, perhaps sans the overt element of mystery. There's something peaceful about methodically sorting away the aftermath of a chaotic incident.A lot more could be done with this game, and I hope early access sees it through to actual storylines or begining to end progression and more dynamic gameplay elements. I mean, stuff like the furnace and tesla gun are great, but I'd like more props. It would be great if there were more to the game as a whole, and also if it took itself seriously enough to build more atmosphere and make a story. So far, the humar is remenisenct to Cago Captain, which was fine for that game. But this doesn't go well with that level of camp.All in all, I haven't played much of it, but its a cool idea.			"

								This game is really fun with friends. If you expect a game where you can go and have a large way of cleaning and doing this and that, then this game isn't for you. This game is literally about where you have a mop, and you clean blood up from the floor. You have a ray gun, where you deflect gun bullets. you pick trash up and put it in the ""fire-oven"". The game is REALLY fun to play with friend if you like to go around and try different ""glitches"". 9/10, really fun.			"

								We have been killing people and monsters and zombies and aliens and everything we had in our eyesight for the last 20 years.In space, under the sea, or wherever.Cut them in pieces or shoot them rounds and rounds of a shotgun or a pistol.And, finally, when the last alien or monster or zombie or human was dead, we saved the space station, or the world, or the galaxy, or even the universe.But we never thought in what happens after that. And that's Viscera Cleanup Detail.You're a Cleaner. You must clean the mess the hero left in his quest in the space station. Alone, or with friends, or with other people.Clean the blood, take the shells of the bullets and the body parts you will find everywhere. Finally, clean everything and burn all the needless things, to make the lab useful again.Lots of people ask everyday: ""Is this game fun? Really?""Yes, it is. Why? Well, for the ones who played to make the mess, of course this is fun. I've played lots of games like this, so this is a simple (but not easy) game about that. It's another view about that type of games.You must have lots of patience, though. Because every time you trip in some thing, you will make a mess. A mess you must clean.Completely recomended.			"

												just an enjoyable, interesting, amusing game. your task is to clean a map from a lot of mess and bring an order into the chaos. after all its more or less a physics game where you move and place objects. its done in a very fine way with, in my eyes, beautiful unreal engine graphics. in the levels there are many quotes from well known movies and games, like predator, event horizon, doom etc. there is a bit of story which can be detected via text notes and pads in the single levels but thats not very prominent. you can play it with friends or all alone. i enjoyed it very much and am hoping for a second part. well done rune storm.

												Some people enjoy white noise. They lay on the beach listening to the waves, they rest their eyes while sitting beside a window being pelted with rain, or even run humming electronics like fans just for the sound. Viscera Cleanup Detail is the videogame version of white noise. A calming oasis in the midst of noisy bother. There is something decidedly zen about cleansing a space station of all evidence of violence. You mop the blood, sweep the shells, burn the body parts, bin the trash, and restock the medkits. It scratches the OCD itch - you can have a place for everything and everything in its place. Besides that there's progression with your persistent janitor's office (as long as you don't get fired), hidden secret items and references to many games and films, a speed run mode, widely praised chaotic multiplayer, nice graphics and a small backstory about a mad custodian murderer. This game gives us a peek behind the curtain of the violent video game; the aftermath of encounters with aliens, robots, mutants (and surprisingly no zombies) has to be dealt with by someone, after all. There's a certain absurdist practicality to it all - because OF COURSE the evil corporation funding evil science would have an evil sanitation company with downtrodden working stiffs using hilariously dangerous and deadly equipment.Honestly, every violent game coming out ought to get a unique level just as Shadow Warrior did, perhaps with unique cleaning necessary. Clean up ripped and torn demonic guts in DOOM, incinerate dead Pyros in Team Fortress, that sort of thing. If this all sounds good to you, you should play Viscera Cleanup Detail!  Because if it bleeds you can kill it, and if it dies you can clean it. "

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is nothing more than a cleaning simulator. Somehow though, it's fun and entertaining without getting boring. It brilliantly tackles the idea that there's someone out there in these fictional horror movies who eventually has to clean everything up. While it gives an uneasy horror vibe through its sounds and cold, gory sights, the contradiction of the mundane cleaning task at hand keeps the absurdity in the forefront. Although you won't have to worry about dying to monsters yourself (maybe) that doesn't mean you won't have to endure your own personal horror story. The first time you spill a dirty bucket of water in an area you've thoroughly cleaned, you'll experience a similar feeling of dread that the horror genre is known for. It'll make you keep saying ""What the hell am I even doing?"" weather it's your first day on the job or your 665th.			"

Some areas have hidden gems which you might never notice like bodies hanging skinned in the trees, invisible bullet holes and loads of gore everywhere. It's a fun game when you actually let the endless puns about body parts and have good friends to play it with.Slosh-o-matic: Give me a hand or two... maybe a leg... or a random body part lol.			"

												Warning: The following revivew contains brutal honesty. Please be advisedViscera Cleanup Detail is a game where you play as a Janitor after a aftermath has happened in different facility's.The main objective of this game is to simply clean. No fighting, no killing, no story, just clean. The game can get very boring and you can often get burnt out if you don't take often breaks. Here are the Pro's and Con's of this game.                                       Pros+Pro: The graphics are pretty neat even on the Unreal Engine+Pro: It a Includes level editor which means you can download workshop maps+Pro: Funny physics+Pro: A good game to waste time on if you're bored and rack up some hours+Pro: Good optimization+Pro: It has Trading Cards!                              Neutral= The boringness kicks in pretty fast= It can get tedious= The Physics can be annoying                                Con's- Could be a little bit more fun, and what I mean is that if you're not a cleaning person or a work person, you wont enjoy this- When you pick things up it blocks your field of view. This can be bad when you're trying to put things in buckets- Sometimes there are really big physic glitches- The tiny bits cause unnessacary blood- Co-op and Local Co-op are practically impossibleOverall: 6/10			"

What kind of friends do you have? TL;DR Viscera Cleanup Detail is a game that has 2 sides. One side being a very relaxing experience full of peace no real threats, Then on the other had it’s a disastrous mess that will make you lose friends faster than monopoly. The maps have many secrets to find and collect which gives a little more incentive for exploring and will keep you playing a bit longer.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  extremely detailed mapsSecrets galoreGreat lighting system.Filled with entertaining events Cons Lack of storyextremely detailed mapsNothing to keep you committed---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayThis game will drive you crazy if you give it your full attention, you’ll start to notice how detailed the maps are and all the hidden places full of blood and cadavers. It’s a very relaxing game because of the lack of threats and a timer, just take your time and make these spaceships sparkle. Having friends playing with you can be hilarious to some and a bane to others as it is so easy to create a mess. Characters This game has a lack of any story and few characters there is a secret and very interesting character in the game that leaves notes throughout the maps. There are also leftover notes and logs about the incidents that happened to make the levels such a mess which adds a feeling of a living world.  Art/Graphics Its not the most beautiful game , it uses simple designs and colors, bit the level of detail in the level to clean is so good and the lighting system is great making you use many sources of light to find everythingBonus NotesThis Is what Id describe as the perfect podcast game and its so satisfying to get a perfect score The games DLCs are just things that max the game more silly and would agree getting them if they are in a bundle. Just cause 2 is one of the best open world games and will give hours of entertainment.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

Early Access Review
								Vicera Cleanup detail is easily one of the most mind numbingly repettative games ive ever plays, but it is also one of the most enjoyable, great looking, and different games I have ever played. To start off like all reviews I want to remind everyone this is still considered to be an early access game, so there is still more to be added as well as more to be changed, so anything I say about the game is subject to change.Viscera cleanup is not exactly what most people likely would consider playing at first glance, however if you start to look deeper and actually give it a try, you will find yourself obsesevly cleaning every drop of blood off every map for hours at a time just because it feels that rewarding after doing so much work and getting praised for it. The game gets even better when you play with friends and fool around on the maps, finding all the sercret areas, and cleaning them up as well, or even making a mess of the place after one of your friends is done cleaning it up just to be annoying :P.Not only is the gameplay surprisingly addictive and fun, but the visuals are fantastic, not to say it has the most amazing effects out there, were not talking about explosions and lazers or anything, but just the sheer ammount of junk, and blood and bullet holes around the map make it really feel like there was a huge fight there not to long ago. I will say they tend to repaste textures pretty often which can make some walls and other features pretty dull to look at, but in the end it tends to help when looking for that one stray bullet hole you just cant seem to find.Now like all games there are still flaws, and despite it being in beta I still feel it necessary to point them out. Only just recently was there a server browser added, and on top of this due to the long time without it, it is unfortunalty grossly under used. There are alot of features still missing in the game from what I have been reading, and still alot of bugs to work through like a spot of blood being cleaned up but it not being counted as clean. stray bullets clipping through walls, and of course physics engine issues with various objects and the players interactions with them.Those small issues tend to go overlooked however with just how much fun there is to have in the game, in fact a body part falling from the bottom of trash can tends to end up being funny and enjoyable more often then annoying and tedious.So if you like the tediousness of cleaning up after someone else, and want to just have a fun time killer to hop on once and a wile, I highly recommend Viscera Cleanup, you may not be running around with guns, but a mop is so much more rewarding and immersive.

								Viscera Cleanup Detail is a first game that makes you clean the area instead of making it dirty. Despite the welcoming's screen message about venomous bugs, i haven't seen much. Playing this game requires some time - average time spent on completing map is always above 1 hour. Player becomes janitor, working on space space stations after alien accident. This event lest the area in terrible condition, and your duty is to clean it up. No matter how boring it sounds to be - well, life simulator seemed to be boring, too, but the sims sell pretty well. It's simple - burn bodies and other junk, sweep blood from floor and walls, stack barrels and crates in stacking areas, remove bullet holes... pretty simple, but I find it a great way to fight stress. Plus, achievements are relatively easy.			"

								If you are someone that likes cleaning big messes in real life, this game is for you.  It's extremely cathartic and oddly-fulfilling, mopping up both human and alien bits.  I'm kind of hoping this game gets more maps where we can explore other games and their bloodbath arenas.  Who doesn't want to clean up cp_dustbowl after a 10 minute siege on their last point, or clear out the crackhouse map from CS Source?  Anyway, back to cleaning up♥♥♥♥♥♥Love,Arthalamew, Chief Executive Director of Janitorial Processes and Professional ""Crime Scene"" Cleaner "

												Ever wondered who cleaning up the mess in games like Serious Sam, Shadow Warrior or DOOM after you eliminated every living organism on the map? This game is the answer!Positive pointsGraphics- Pretty sweet and the graphic style fit perfectly to this game.- Sometimes the lights are a bit too extremeGameplay- Simple mechanics but pretty much fun. I dont really know why I enjoy cleaning a virtual room while I hate cleaning in real life o_o- The ""Cleaning machines can spit out limbs and♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; mechanic is something I really hate... just no!Maps- I like the variation of the maps. Different themes with many easter eggs and around 20 maps on count is not bad.Neutral pointsMultiplayer- Well multiplayer seems to be pretty dead. Playing with random people is a rare phenomenon. If I imagine how MP would be played by the players I can just think about a LOT of trolls ♥♥♥♥ing things up all the time so..- This game can be pretty much fun on LAN parties or if you play with friends especially if you are drunk =DNegative pointsBugs- Over the time there were many bug fixes but still there is a problem with objects glitching around. Objects can glitch under the map so you can complete the map, objects glitches through your boxes or the incinerator. Can be very frustrating cause all your work was useless in this case.- Cleaning machine sometimes just stop working so you can restart the map.Miscellaneous- On some maps there is dirt/blood on the blanket of the map so you have to build a tower with your boxes which is a very, VERY frustrating task.- My progress and my settings was reseted so many times..ConclusionFunny game which you can play from time to time. Fun factor increasing when you play it with friends. One of the few games which started as Early Access game on steam and made it to a complete game. The game is time intensive and can frustrated you sometimes but overall it is much more fun than cleaning your home in real life!			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail puts you in the shoes of a janitor cleaning up after what seems like a B-Grade thriller or horror movie. There are body pieces to take care of, blood to mop up, and miscellaneous items to incinerate. The game makes wonderful atmosphere with it's large environments and while there are no threats that can kill you, while cleaning alone, I find myself still paranoid as hell that something is going to pop up, scream at me and then gleefully cackle as they run off map. Cleaning is no easy chore, however. There are countless hidden blood spots and body pieces hidden in corners and that are much too easily missed when glancing over. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't exactly make a server that isn't hosted locally by whomever the local host ends up being. Hopefully, it'll be added in at a later date but until then, playing with friends from far places definitely makes things difficult. It's a wonderful game. It kills time, probably replayable if you haven't gotten every map spotless and spit shined to perfection.

								This game is incredibly addicting if you have like cleaning or organizing at all. My room's a mess, yet I've sunk hours into mopping up virtual bloodstains and picking up various severed limbs.If you've got finals coming up, don't buy this game. Save it for the summer.			"

								This game is probably the most fun you will have as a janitor! Even in Early Access this game is stable and really fun! It seems kind of odd to say but after having played multiple space battle games where I've left similar messes. It's actually kind of fun to clean up after one of those epic battles.			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail puts you in the shoes of a janitor cleaning up after what seems like a B-Grade thriller or horror movie. There are body pieces to take care of, blood to mop up, and miscellaneous items to incinerate. The game makes wonderful atmosphere with it's large environments and while there are no threats that can kill you, while cleaning alone, I find myself still paranoid as hell that something is going to pop up, scream at me and then gleefully cackle as they run off map. Cleaning is no easy chore, however. There are countless hidden blood spots and body pieces hidden in corners and that are much too easily missed when glancing over. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't exactly make a server that isn't hosted locally by whomever the local host ends up being. Hopefully, it'll be added in at a later date but until then, playing with friends from far places definitely makes things difficult. It's a wonderful game. It kills time, probably replayable if you haven't gotten every map spotless and spit shined to perfection.

								BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME EVER CREATED! Why would anyone EVER want to play a game about freaking cleaning up after other people? It makes no sense in any way why anyone would want to play this ""game"". That is what you would say before you have played this game. This game is strangely addicting and a good way to pass time. Even when you play it it makes no sense why it is fun. There is no action, platforming, puzzles, or shooting among other things. But you just cant stop. Great game and well made even for early access, I would recommend this to anyone I know. "

								I'd say it's more of a satisfying game then what I's classify as ""Fun."" At least via single player.Are you one of those people who twinge when people bite into a kit-kat like a candy bar, is there something satisfying in seeing things in order or color coded for you? Do little things that are off set bug you? If so, then like myself, you'll find this game so satisfying. I sat and played for nearly 2 hours just because the satisfying feeling the game gave me. I've found more game satisfaction and completion in this game than other console games I've completed.9/10 Will clean again			"

								This game is fun in the same sense that staring into the end of a laser pointer is fun.In all seriousness though, if you enjoyed titles like Surgeon Simulator or Kerbal Space Program, you may find yourself cleaning every nook and cranny questioning yourself the whole time for doing it. Is it cutting edge gameplay the likes of which has never been seen before? Not really a fair question to ask here, but it is original.After spending tedious hours (days? weeks? time is irrelevant in this game) cleaning my first section of a space station littered with human corpses and alien remains, I found myself compelled to finish. It's something to hold your attention and draw your mind away from conventional gaming, and it does this quite well.I'm definitely excited to see where future development takes this game.			"

								An absolutely hilariously fun and simple gaming adventure built on the simple engine movements and meshed objects that many gamers would be nostalgically familiar with. Heavily encouraging on the use of or enhancing on the aquired skills of patience and contemplating strategy.... these gaming maps with awe evoking, wonderfully textured and alive room scapes transport you into the aftermath of the carnage!! Yielding a trusty mop and two machines dropped off by the Vicera Clean-Up Company and amusing intstructions of what awaits you and what secrets you may have to keep... they provide you with cleaning accessories that assist you embarking on carefully clean movement through-out your happily daunting but hilariously! entertaning funny task of setting right the wrongs. Little award tasks have been added for  a little extra entertaining fun!...I LOVE!! Santa's Work Shop!! This is a wonderfully constructed piece of fluff and has some awesome potential to become an even more exciting quest of maps full of surprises! I simply cannot wait to be able to gift it to my friends so that they too can join me in cleaning up the carnage!			"

												This game is stupidly good. Being a janitor has no right to be this fun, yet there is a real sense of satisfaction in turning an absolute mess into a shining, flawless space station/lab/mine/whatever. Text-to-speak (which doesn't work in the 64-bit exe, mind you) is just the icing on the cake for multiplayer. Unless someone decides to spam the laser welder everywhere and detonate every explosive barrel so you get -229% and get fired, of course. Great graphics, great gameplay - though I will say, online play is a little laggy, with 40 ping making you teleport a fair bit and 80 being practically unplayable. Still, it's stupidly fun.			"

Crack jokes over voice chat like throwing an arm at your friend and saying ""Need a hand?"" or dropping the scissor lift on your friend and saying ""I'm sorry, I thought you needed a lift."" Handing your friend a leg and saying ""It's a foot long!"" Splatter your friend with bloody mops are start a fire on the job with a laser meant to sauter bullet holes. Just have fun with it!

To make the House Seasoning, mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months. 2. In a medium size bowl, beat the eggs with the water. Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange. 3. In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper. 4. Season the chicken with the House Seasoning. 5. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour mixture.6. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot and fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp.This pairs greatly with sparkling wine.			"

								This is early access, so I can't yet make any ""official"" comment about it, but I can tell you that this is actually a really fun game. At least to me, it can be addicting. Most people may not think so because all you do here is clean. And for that, you might as well clean in real life and get paid for it. While they have good points on this, remember that people thought the same thing about The Sims, a game where you simulate real life. And that franchise has become really popular. So maybe this game will have the same effect.If nothing else, it is a way to pass the time. And cleaning doesn't have to be the only thing you can do. Invite your friends over and make a big mess. Play viscera golf with your mop. Create art. Play viscera pong with buckets. And for $8, is not that bad.The game may not stay $8 after it's full release. As the developers stated. So if you're really interested, download this while it's still on sale. And as a bonus, you will also get Santa's Rampage and Shadow Warrior maps for free! So decide now while these offers still last.			"

								Tedious and deeply massocistic, Viscera Cleanup detail is not a game for everyone. As a reminder to those who believe in a brighter future for all, this game is a solem reminder that even in the 22nd century, we're still going to need janitors. After all, who's left to clean up the messes left behind by the steroid addled space soldiers but the poor janitor? Your tools for the job are deeply inadequate, given that you've got a mop, a barely function grime scanner, and your own two hands. Assisting you are a few pieces of recklessly malfunctioning equipment that will ocassionally dispense bits of of your fellow humans rather than the useful buckets and biohazard bins required to cart their remains. Add to the that the problem of your own footprints tracking blood and bile, and the game becomes an exercise in playing catch up as your previously sparkling rooms once again become horror shows.Viscera Cleanup Detail is the sort of game that gives you that sort of smug, self punshing joy that you get from completing a task that is both meaningless, yet somehow compelling. Much like Tetris, your errors pile up and your acomplishments disappear. In addition to recieving absolutely no reward for a job well done, any stray casing, bullet hole, or partially dismembered corpse leaves you with a snarky note in your office about how how badly you've failed. All that said, you may better spend your time doing something else. In the two plus hours it takes you to complete the first level, you could clean your entire house and get the satisfaction of a job well done, as well as the fact that you won't be deeply embarrased by unexpected guests. But if you are a masochist, and you enjoy tedious, unrewarding gameplay for the sake of completion, than this is the game for you.			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail is very much a ""niche"" game. It's something most people won't like or understand, but for those who do like it, it's an interesting take on blood and gore in video games. There's something very Zen-like about listening to music/TV/podcasts while mopping up blood and carting away limbs to the furnace.The visuals and lighting effects are well-used, even if it is difficult to spot blood at certain times. It definitely *looks* like a game in Early Access, but for a game in Early Access, I've certainly seen worse. Levels are small and easy to navigate, and the tools at your disposal are simple and easy-to-master. The physics are screwy as hell, though. Sometimes limbs like to melt through the bins and make your floor dirty again. Sometimes you'll bump into something and it'll freak out.If there's anything about this game I can hate, considering its status as Early Access, it hast to be the nonexistent depth perception. This is a problem in all games, but with a game like Viscera Cleanup Detail, where you have to be more careful with your movements, placing items into a bin or trying to grab an object from a certain distance away are difficult at best. This could be solved with better dynamic shadows, but it would come at the expense of graphical performance, and frankly, Unreal Engine 3 isn't as powerful as you might think.Regardless, I'm excited for this game, and despite its status as a work in progress, it already shows some healthy meat on its bones.

								In this game, you are a janitor in a sci-fy horror map, and your job is to clean the carnage. Game-play you have to pick up body parts, weld bullet holes, and clean  blood off of the walls with your mop, having to rinse it off every so often. It's a very relaxing game, with alot of maps with different incidents for you to figure out what happend. The better you clean, the higher score you'll get on levels.

												This is the best (and I'll assume only) space-mop-cleaning-janitor game on the planet! clean up Human and Alien guts, sweep away spent shell casings, and one you get the rifle-that-shoots-lasers gun, just burn everything and then mop away the soot. there's just one detail that has raised a personal question; since your character obviously uses the force, when will there be a Star Wars themed DLC? This is the perfect game to put you in the place of a First Order janitor that has to clean up after one of Kylo Ren's hissy-fits. This is a great game, and I highly suggest it to everyone, especially if you would rather clean an interstellar space station than your own home.			"

								An absolutely hilariously fun and simple gaming adventure built on the simple engine movements and meshed objects that many gamers would be nostalgically familiar with. Heavily encouraging on the use of or enhancing on the aquired skills of patience and contemplating strategy.... these gaming maps with awe evoking, wonderfully textured and alive room scapes transport you into the aftermath of the carnage!! Yielding a trusty mop and two machines dropped off by the Vicera Clean-Up Company and amusing intstructions of what awaits you and what secrets you may have to keep... they provide you with cleaning accessories that assist you embarking on carefully clean movement through-out your happily daunting but hilariously! entertaning funny task of setting right the wrongs. Little award tasks have been added for  a little extra entertaining fun!...I LOVE!! Santa's Work Shop!! This is a wonderfully constructed piece of fluff and has some awesome potential to become an even more exciting quest of maps full of surprises! I simply cannot wait to be able to gift it to my friends so that they too can join me in cleaning up the carnage!			"

								I don't know where to start, with this.  A friend got this as a joke, streamed it, we had a good laugh, then he sent me a copy.  It's turned into something similar to Train Simulator for us, but I still managed to get almost 5 hours in this.  You're a space janitor in a space location cleaning up gibs, both human and alien, with it being implied that the ""Heroes"" have already been through and killed everything that needed killing, as evidenced by the spent shells and casings everywhere.  The physics are wonky, and every time you knock over your bucket full of blood, a piece of your soul will shrivel up and die.  Still, it's strangely entertaining, especially for those of us with a compulsive need to complete things.  I think everyone should buy this when it's on sale and try to complete just one level.  It's pretty cute.			"

								The Station is infested with all kinds of vermin. There is no hope for all who are on the station. What terrible fate awaits? Grab your tools, gear and get ready. Because the hero just fixed the problem and guess who is on clean-up duty?Anyways, you (and possible your friends) are janitors tasked to clean up the mess, and a mess there is. Parts from people and speciments litter every corner, blood cover floor wall and celling, hazardous materials, crates and whatever food the hero ate and discarded, along with bullet casings are here. Get a Disposable bin fill it with materials, get a bucket and mop the floor and burn EVERYTHING that isnt nailed down.The game is surprisingly fun and sometimes a little difficult, with the nasty placement of things and the insane amount of footprints you make. Teamwork can be used to maximize efficincy, to hunt down what you miss and to reach difficult spot. The only problem is the lack of content and a scoring system to judge how well you did, but since it's early access these thing s will most likely be fixed. Difinitely recommended!			"

								Tedious and deeply massocistic, Viscera Cleanup detail is not a game for everyone. As a reminder to those who believe in a brighter future for all, this game is a solem reminder that even in the 22nd century, we're still going to need janitors. After all, who's left to clean up the messes left behind by the steroid addled space soldiers but the poor janitor? Your tools for the job are deeply inadequate, given that you've got a mop, a barely function grime scanner, and your own two hands. Assisting you are a few pieces of recklessly malfunctioning equipment that will ocassionally dispense bits of of your fellow humans rather than the useful buckets and biohazard bins required to cart their remains. Add to the that the problem of your own footprints tracking blood and bile, and the game becomes an exercise in playing catch up as your previously sparkling rooms once again become horror shows.Viscera Cleanup Detail is the sort of game that gives you that sort of smug, self punshing joy that you get from completing a task that is both meaningless, yet somehow compelling. Much like Tetris, your errors pile up and your acomplishments disappear. In addition to recieving absolutely no reward for a job well done, any stray casing, bullet hole, or partially dismembered corpse leaves you with a snarky note in your office about how how badly you've failed. All that said, you may better spend your time doing something else. In the two plus hours it takes you to complete the first level, you could clean your entire house and get the satisfaction of a job well done, as well as the fact that you won't be deeply embarrased by unexpected guests. But if you are a masochist, and you enjoy tedious, unrewarding gameplay for the sake of completion, than this is the game for you.			"

								Viscera Cleanup Detail is very much a ""niche"" game. It's something most people won't like or understand, but for those who do like it, it's an interesting take on blood and gore in video games. There's something very Zen-like about listening to music/TV/podcasts while mopping up blood and carting away limbs to the furnace.The visuals and lighting effects are well-used, even if it is difficult to spot blood at certain times. It definitely *looks* like a game in Early Access, but for a game in Early Access, I've certainly seen worse. Levels are small and easy to navigate, and the tools at your disposal are simple and easy-to-master. The physics are screwy as hell, though. Sometimes limbs like to melt through the bins and make your floor dirty again. Sometimes you'll bump into something and it'll freak out.If there's anything about this game I can hate, considering its status as Early Access, it hast to be the nonexistent depth perception. This is a problem in all games, but with a game like Viscera Cleanup Detail, where you have to be more careful with your movements, placing items into a bin or trying to grab an object from a certain distance away are difficult at best. This could be solved with better dynamic shadows, but it would come at the expense of graphical performance, and frankly, Unreal Engine 3 isn't as powerful as you might think.Regardless, I'm excited for this game, and despite its status as a work in progress, it already shows some healthy meat on its bones.

								Imagine if after every sci-fi shooter out there, a janitor had to come in and clean up after the action hero's mess. Well, someone made that game, and that game is Viscera Cleanup Detail.No weapons. No Enemies. Just you, a mop, a ""sniffer"", buckets, waste-bins, a furnace, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of blood and guts to clean up.Keep in mind that this isn't as easy as it may sound, there's  a suprising amount of challenge in this game. If janitor simulators were striving for realism, then this game would be the Arma 2 of the genre. You have to get buckets to clean your mop, then replace buckets, you can knock buckets over which means more♥♥♥♥♥♥for you to clean up; you get the idea. This game is mostly a test of your patience, and just your overall common sense.In all honesty, though, this game is actually pretty fun. Especially if you have some friends to play it with. (Yes, there's a co-op feature, and if your friends are strict Call of Duty or Left 4 Dead types, chances are they're not going to want to play this...weirdoes.)It's only 8 bucks as I write this review, so why not get it?

Posted: July 1, 2016
Note: I initially reviewed this game in September of 2015 as an early access review, however, the review wasn't on par with my recent work, so decided to rewrite it.Remember all those games such as Dead Space where you're on a ship killing aliens?  VCD is the aftermath of that.  To someone who has never seen this game before, space janitor sounds so unappealing.  I mean, really, space janitor?  Janitorial game?  How can this be fun?  Somehow, VCD makes being a janitor the funnest thing in the world!  You're not just cleaning paper, dirty shoe prints, garbage, etc.  You're cleaning blood, decapitated bodies, bullet holes, the whole 9 yards when it comes to the aftermath of a space battle.  One of my favorite things about VCD is that it's gruesome.  You will find decapitated limbs, intestines, and organs that were, at one point, safely inside their owner.   Now, I'm sure you're thinking, 'there's a catch, right? It can't be purely a janitor simulator.' No catch, it's 100% janitor simulator. There are no bad guys, no shooting, nothing - just cleaning.  There are eery amibent noises meant to make you weary, but there's really no danger.If you're someone who is OCD, or someone who HAS to finish what they started, you will be spending hours in VCD.  Between walking in blood and then leaving a trail, to accidentally knocking over your blood-filled water bucket, to even flinging body parts around and getting blood everywhere - there is a lot to clean up.  It also depends on the map.  Some maps are smaller, thus, quicker and easier.  However, some of the other vanilla maps are larger, meaning you'll be spending a little bit more time on it.  One of the best things about this game is that there is Steam workshop.  There are quite a few community made maps, and most of them are just of amazing quality.  Workshop can always greatly help a game out, and it certainly has in this case.   I'm still waiting and hoping for the day of a Star Destroyer cleanup. :POne really nice thing is that there's multiplayer!  If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful game that lets you just talk with your friends, this is it.  I really have to commend the developers on VCD.  No one would've ever thought a janitor game would be fun, but they have proved that wrong.  Sure, depending on the person, a janitor simulator will be boring no matter what, but the guys at VCD really did their best to make a janiorial game entertaining, and they succeeded.  One tiny complaint I have is the music.  The developers were nice enough to include music via some type of tool (I have no clue what it is), but that music is just...bleh.  I kinda wish there was better music we could clean to.  I guess that's why we have things like Spotify.Positives: Quiet, peaceful game Shows you the aftermath of what we usually cause. Gruesome/Gorey No threats. Workshop Trading cards Multiplayer Controller support AchievementsNegatives: Could just be me, but I've noticed the frames aren't the best in this game. Music isn't the best.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations. "

												Considering my life is a plethora of stress - this game, despite the premesis, is extremely relaxing. The colors are vibrant, the core is meaty and though simplistic in mechanics, opt you to think about the order of operations when you're cleaning. I absolutely love the many many many maaaany nods to old horror movies and scenes, considering I'm a horror fanatic. Honestly, if it wasn't on sale when I bought it - I would have bought it full price anyway. It's definately worth it, and you'll get your hours of playtime out of it. It's especially good to play after a stressful day at work. My only complaint really, are there could be a lot more DLC. But I expect that'll come in time - I'm just impatient and enjoy the hell out of this game! "

												I LOVE THIS GAME. I had seen Hat Films play it, and seeing them do it horribly, made me want it so bad to do it better, and my friend randomly surprised me with it out of no where! I've enjoyed it so much. I have also raged at not finding those little tiny smudges that make the detector go off. I was actually surprised at how many maps are given to you. I had only ever seen two maps which was Santa's Rampage, and Unrefiniery, so I was very estatic to see all of the maps I could play on. Playing with friends online is also a bonus especially when you troll them which isn't hard to do in this game. If you like games that have mundane tasks that have funny little snippets of story then this is a great game for you.			"

								I can’t help but feel that a large portion of the gaming society don’t understand the true meaning of repetition. And what I mean by that is they don’t understand repetition. And what I mean by that is… well, you get the joke already. For those of you, dear egocentric viewers, who include yourself in this bewildered ratio the best place to learn is at your computer looking up the definition online. Or you could play Viscera Cleanup Detail which bases itself around the mundane and repetitive. And yet is somewhat intriguing in its attempt  to be the most boring game ever. You are a cleaner and your job is to clean until the level is clean and you can say that your cleaning has left the space you are asked to clean is clean, if you know what I clean. Bad puns aside, cleaning is the literal object of the game. It’s in the title if you were smart enough to put 2 and clean together. Alright, I’ll stop saying clean.The enjoyment in this piece of technological culture is to relax, put on a podcast and zone out while your brain cells rot and your inner neat freak is unleashed, which describes exactly what I did. To say this is a completionist game is an understatement when you consider that you’re given a tool that detects even the slightest smudge of blood and your life is threatened should you not do a good enough job. A prospect I know Groundskeeper Willie would be dying to attain. At the time of this review the game is still in alpha, but it already presents to you the realization of what effect your sci-fi shoot-em-up adventures really have on the lower class. I told you that you were egocentric. And I hope you’ve all noticed that I made this entire paragraph without using the word clean. Oh wait, damn it.			"

												This game may look bad at first. It's a cleaning simulator, seems like a one-off joke like Goat Simulator and some of these reviews seem like jokes.But trust me, this game is legitimately surprisingly fun, with co-operative, unique maps with secrets to find and stories to tell. It's extremely satisfying to finish a job, and even once you've finished every level there's still workshop mods waiting for you to try out.Keep in mind however, that this game is extremely more fun with friends so you're not going to have a nicer experiance going solo.Overall I rate this game an 8/10, check it out.

												10/10 definitely would recommend.This game managed to carve out a niche into the FPS market. By making the player cleaning after the typical shootout, it creates a new genre. Just like Minecraft did, a few years ago. However, this game did not have the hype Mincraft enjoyed, and therefore hasn't spanwed any copycats... yet.Trust me, just like after a stressful day you may enjoy killing 2000 enemies in an FPS like Doom, on a boring, chilly and cloudy sunday, you'll enjoy playing some tunes while you remove viscera and litter and mop the blood off floor and walls. Even better, you can play it multiplayer and have a laugh with friends. The characters move in quite a cartoonish way, which adds up to the comic effect. Grab some dynamite and ignite it near a fellow co-worker: enjoy watching him blow up.The achievements require a few hours of work but are easily obtainable.The levels are magnificent. Each one has a unique atmosphere.The sounds are few due to the nature of the game, but are more than adequate. Maybe the sound of all the stuff cluttered into a disposal bin is a bit ridiculous, but that is nothing serious.The graphics are amazing. If you have a good computer, it'll look astonishing.The price is more than fair. The glitches are few, minor. Devs are constantly working on fixing as much as they can. Don't believe me? Check their facebook page.The only thing I'd criticise is the lack of explanation on how to use your tools and stacking areas. But the wiki is very detailed. And I'm sure this lack of info will be addressed soon enough.Overall 10/10. One of the very few games I definitely recommend.			"

												So when I first played this game I was having fun then had a issue in game with the storage boxes and had to delete my save files completely to reset them. After doing so and working out what not to do I have to take back a lot of the negativity I may of pushed across at first impression but to be honest this really is a good game that will keep you entertained for hours.The game plays on your own OCD, some have it worse than others but none the less the game will get you thinking in that mind set of getting things perfect spick and span mickey mouse.I dig games like this because they are original, no other games like it. I have not actually gotten around to trying it out but I have heard that the multiplayer for this game is no good as well, has a terrible server or something and people constantly get dropped from the server before they can complete a level which is dissappointing because this game would be hilarious to play multiplayer, running into each other and the likes so it is ashame if what I am hearing is correct.

												This game is VERY enjoyable, however I only find it enjoyable when you play it with friends. I could see solo being good for some people, but for me I don't really like it and it just gets boring. The game is also very good for someone who likes the JOY of cleaning a HUGE mess up and making the place sparkly clean!At the games current state, I would recommend it to anyone who loves to play with their friends and to anyone who just genuinely likes to clean, and get that satisfaction feeling! I rate it a 7/10. 👍			"

The only thing I wish the game improved on would be giving the player more tools. Vacuums for bullets, a spray gun, and other equipment would be fun to unlock. The game has a special charm to it and I would definitely recommend it.			"

												This game is fantastic for multiplayer. It was so fun figuring out how to clean, trying to work together without tripping over each other, and mopping up the guts and grime -- with teamwork! The physics are a bit crazy: dismembered limbs with minds of their own, full boxes of guts randomly exploding, and parts popping out of boxes as they're carried. But that just adds to the entertainment. If you've ever wondered what happens after you clear a level in your favorite FPS, it's probably something like this. The complaints and praise after each job add to the realism (and hilarity), and the various clues about what happened in each level help the immersion and allow you to imagine what exciting things happened recently in the room you're tasked with cleaning.

												I kind of like this game but not as much as this Southern Fried Chicken recipe.First you will need the following:1 cup of salt1/4 cup black pepper1/4 cup garlic powder4 eggs1/3 cup water1 cup hot red pepper sauce2 cup self-rising flour1 teaspoon pepper2 1/2 pound chicken cut into piecesOil - for frying1. To make the House Seasoning, mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months. 2. In a medium size bowl, beat the eggs with the water. Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange. 3. In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper. 4. Season the chicken with the House Seasoning. 5. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour mixture.6. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot and fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp.This pairs greatly with sparkling wine.			"

								This is early access, so I can't yet make any ""official"" comment about it, but I can tell you that this is actually a really fun game. At least to me, it can be addicting. Most people may not think so because all you do here is clean. And for that, you might as well clean in real life and get paid for it. While they have good points on this, remember that people thought the same thing about The Sims, a game where you simulate real life. And that franchise has become really popular. So maybe this game will have the same effect.If nothing else, it is a way to pass the time. And cleaning doesn't have to be the only thing you can do. Invite your friends over and make a big mess. Play viscera golf with your mop. Create art. Play viscera pong with buckets. And for $8, is not that bad.The game may not stay $8 after it's full release. As the developers stated. So if you're really interested, download this while it's still on sale. And as a bonus, you will also get Santa's Rampage and Shadow Warrior maps for free! So decide now while these offers still last.			"

								For a game that I originally thought was rather pointless when looking at the trailer, the game ceases to amaze me. Have you wondered what happens AFTER and FPS and who has to clean up the mess? This game lets you be that person, and it couldn't be more fun. With wonky physics, and a logical head, you can clear your way through entire stages, your dangley mop in hand. Overall, a unique experience that I would highly reccomend.P.S.

								This game isn't for everyone.I'm starting that way simply because I feel as though not many people would be into this kind of game.  I've personally always enjoyed games that are slow-paced, but the longer you go on you can look back and say ""Yeah, I did that."" There's nothing more satisfying than walking into a room that makes you say ""Jesus!"" out loud, but then later making that room spotless.  It's a lot of effort, but I think it's worth the payoff.  If you like slow-paced satisfying games, this is for you.			"

								I can no longer play other games like Borderlands or Payday2  without wanting to clean up the blood, bullet holes, and scorch marks off the walls. I've been ruined.Game features a save mode so you can clean a bit then come back later. Great for something to do on breaks and extra fun with friends.  Time trial mode pushes your janitorial skills to the max for efficient cleaning under pressure. The physics are a blessing and a curse. If you have completist tendencies this game is easy to obsess over.			"

												Words can't really describe the satisfying zen and sometimes sheer insanity this game provides.  You can absolutely lose your mind over a spilled bucket, be filled with fear as gibs escape your trash bin and touch everything you just cleaned or eat your hat as the trash machine spits out severed arms.  All in all, its very fun, gets updates often and has great DLC			"

								It's so incredibly stupid how much fun this game is. I never thought I'd have fun cleaning anything. Or on the other hand, throwing your hands up and running around making messes like a toddler on pixi stix full of take-this-job-and-shove-it moxie. It is still early access so there are some bugs, the dev team has done a great job fixing the sometimes hilarious physics issues but there are still some occasional bugs or glitches. Even so it's really polished for early access and is still fun.This game will give you advanced OCD. One bullet hole can make you want to flip every table in your home.			"

												>accidently drops a molotov by janitors chest filled of tnt to the ceiling in santas rampage>north pole gone in a mushroom cloudBut seriously this game is perfect. You can either work or make a bigger mess if you like. The community isn't toxic at all either which is brilliant. You get a office where you can store objects you find from maps that you work in and dont get fired in that you can bring to other maps. This game is filled with referenced objects like the crowbar and gordons glasses from HL, the facehugger from Alien, and the shotgun from Doom, that you can also keep as a collection in your office. There's not that many levels but still fun to play over a couple of times. Extremely fun to play with friends when they dont ♥♥♥♥ everything up, something like making a bigger mess when your cleaning or, lobbing some tntnades at you also making a bigger mess. I really love this game and would love to give more.			"

												Is this a game for everyone? No not really. But is it a good game? Indeed it is ^^/I haven't tried the multiplayer part, so I can't review that part of the game, sorry!/I will come with a statement that most games is in some kind of way and in a different degree quite repetitive, nontheless it can still be fun especially this one. Yes this is a simulator game, yes being a janitor is only about cleaning(and making a mess by accident or on purpose! XD), but why can this game still be fun? Well from my point of view being one who likes bloody shooting games and such, then this game is one big ironic joke. I have never had one single thought in my life what a mess I did in fact make when I was playing those bloody shooting games killing monsters or aliens, so this game is indeed karma XD in a good way.Do I think that this game is perfect? No, because the negative reviews are right, this game becomes repetitive which is why I would recommend this game for anyone who does not need to complete a game as quick as possible. Because this game for me is a way of relaxing(yeah I know, Ironic maybe even psychopatic XD) and cleaning a map here and there when you feel like it and not in one run.

												10/10 definitely would recommend.This game managed to carve out a niche into the FPS market. By making the player cleaning after the typical shootout, it creates a new genre. Just like Minecraft did, a few years ago. However, this game did not have the hype Mincraft enjoyed, and therefore hasn't spanwed any copycats... yet.Trust me, just like after a stressful day you may enjoy killing 2000 enemies in an FPS like Doom, on a boring, chilly and cloudy sunday, you'll enjoy playing some tunes while you remove viscera and litter and mop the blood off floor and walls. Even better, you can play it multiplayer and have a laugh with friends. The characters move in quite a cartoonish way, which adds up to the comic effect. Grab some dynamite and ignite it near a fellow co-worker: enjoy watching him blow up.The achievements require a few hours of work but are easily obtainable.The levels are magnificent. Each one has a unique atmosphere.The sounds are few due to the nature of the game, but are more than adequate. Maybe the sound of all the stuff cluttered into a disposal bin is a bit ridiculous, but that is nothing serious.The graphics are amazing. If you have a good computer, it'll look astonishing.The price is more than fair. The glitches are few, minor. Devs are constantly working on fixing as much as they can. Don't believe me? Check their facebook page.The only thing I'd criticise is the lack of explanation on how to use your tools and stacking areas. But the wiki is very detailed. And I'm sure this lack of info will be addressed soon enough.Overall 10/10. One of the very few games I definitely recommend.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is a first person ""simulator"" game about being space janitor. In space. Sure think it's a joke simulator, but gameplay itself is not broken on purpose unlike other such games. It was developed by RuneStorm and finally released out of Steam's Early Access in 2015 after entering it in 2014. And yep, coop multiplayer is primary focus. But can solo.It actually had two stand-alone spinoff before release, which included only a single level: Shadow Warrior tie-in and Santa's Rampage. And they are going to include them both into base VCD game for free. Actually, they already did it with Santa's Rampage, Shadow Warrior one is coming soon. Which also means that this review will become outdated soon, uh oh.It also still gets a support post-launch. It's probably not going to stay forever, not every game is Minecraft. But hey, new map!Technically, it does have a bunch of physics bugs. Most often you are going to be frustrated that ""crisp"" chips packets clipped at the bottom of the bin once again. Physics items also sometimes get stuck in geometry. The best way to handle it is to grab them, then hold the grab button (it will let you to rotate it) and swing your mouse around like crazy until it glitches out. Game may also not always be fair, hiding barely visible stain behind no-collision geometry, for example.Multiplayer community is kinda dead but not really. It's just that people usually prefer playing with people they know, since in this game you can mess up progress a lot. Can ask or find coop request in the forums. But if you just want to play with strangers and public, then the only thing you can expect to see in server browser is a bunch of empty password locked servers. Oh well.Your job in this game is to clean up the level from all the trash, guts and blood which happens to be there after some disaster of alien origin. It often references famous horror movies so it's fun if you get the reference. You spawn in the level and it's your job to burn all gibs and wash up all blood and burn up bullet holes and just make it look clean for your own amusement. The core gameplay can get repetetive, but it has this relaxive feel to it, especially if you don't turn on radio. It's also fun for those who love to do stuff fully and watch the progress of level getting cleaner. That, and things can sometimes go wrong, especially if you are playing with good friends. Somebody may knock the bucket of bloody water, for example. In multiplayer the fun comes from party aspect. Maybe more fun than doing it all solo.Oh, and you also have to spend time to use radar device to find out what you missed, which may also happen to be nastily hidden if you aim for 100%. Actually, the maximum completionists also can do paperworks, in which you have to report on what you think happened. Then bring USB sticks of dead people and choose what you think happened to them. And fill in boring stuff like number of shells found. It's pretty great idea, to combine being detective and janitor, but sadly it's more mundane and I just don't want to count all the shells.But it could use more variation between levels. Well, there is some, but it's not enough. This game just doesn't fit to play fully in solo.Which is why I like how the game is structured. It pretty much says you that you aren't supposed to beat it fully or play it all in solo. There is no linear campaign at all and there is no real requirements or real progress. You just pick mode, pick the map. Well, you do get achievement for beating them. But eh. You can even clock out from the level anytime, there is no real concequence to doing awful job. Well, I still would have liked story mode, but only if gameplay was less repetetive. At least this way it doesn't push me ""beat whole game to be the men"".And to be honest, I didn't. I only have done half of levels in solo, only big levels are left. And I want to tackle them only with friends now.It also has the office into which the game sends you after clocking out. It's a very small level, your little basement-like space. The point is that only at this point do you get a feedback on your job. You have screen which shows completion state, it puts paper around the room of hiralious accidents if you forgot to clean up something. It also is just your little home filled with useless stuff and you can bring up anything you want from the levels.And there isn't much else to it. It's a nice jokeish simulator. It's a relaxish experience to play solo and it has a great party effect when playing with friends.			"

												I play this game when I listen to podcasts and it's great for that. The mechanics are easy to understand and getting into a rhythm is awesome. The only thing I wish the game improved on would be giving the player more tools. Vacuums for bullets, a spray gun, and other equipment would be fun to unlock. The game has a special charm to it and I would definitely recommend it.			"

								This game; the words to describe it are pretty sparing.  You clean up the dead things after the big battle.  It sounds boring and silly, but it's weirdly fun.  Definitely weirdly fun.  I've only played  2 maps thus far, but they have both been really well done and enjoyable.  The atmosphere is really solid and I really feel like I've been cleaning up after monsters.While I'll be the first to say it's not for everyone and that there seems to be some bugs still, this game is ridiculously enjoyable compared to what you might initially think.

								Viscera is hard to describe! It's lots of fun to just go around cleaning everything. I highly recommend it for people who don't like shooters and don't mind gore. The dark humor is clever and well thought out, referencing a ton of tropes from the horror and sci-fi genres (Gears of War, Terminator etc).Love it! Can't wait for more DLCs or even a sequel!			"

												It's a game about cleaning things up, like blood and viscera (hence the name). I like this game because as I clean a room, it kind of satisfies me. Like washing your car or something; you get to see the car become more clean as you go. But, the 'satisfying' effect wears off when I have been looking for the last blood stain or bullet casing for the past 20 minutes. In this dark map, I missed several blood stains on the ceiling and one casing. Viscera Cleanup Detail is not for everyone- some people may find this game half-baked. Your job is to mop the floor, throw stuff into a furnace, remove bullet holes with a laser thingy, and I think there are some enemies here or there on some levels. The game might become boring after a handful of hours because the gameplay can be repetitive. Despite this, VCD manages to keep my attention for a good while. Very fun simulator.			"

								The power in this game is just wasting hours away. If you love cleaning or just futsing around a WHILE, this is great. It's also perfect to play while listening to a podcast.Be warned! The physics and such can get on your nerves if you take it seriously, and a few levels are... well a bit silly. A few other things are quite nasty too, but let it go and you'll be fine. Still, the game's pretty robust and this method of story telling is neat. There's plenty to discovery, so if you really like a great, mindless time waster, this is a great option, since most levels take over an hour to perfect on your first go!			"

												This is the game to buy for your kids if they don't want to do their studies. Make them play for 5+ hours and tell them that this is their LIFE if they don't hit the books DAMN RIGHT NOW!But in all seriousness, yes, that's what you play here. A janitor. Have you ever wondered what happens after you blasted through a level in your favorite shooter and you're not in Germany, i.e. the corpses, gore, blood, guts  and other bodyparts don't simply vanish before they hit the floor? Well, this is it. The game for after the game. The alien invasion is over, our hero won and now it's time to clean up the mess.This is where you come in.Your job is to clean up the mess. To collect all those body parts and mop up the blood and gore. And as odd as it sounds, yes, that's actually fun. OCD of course helps, but even if you're not obsessed with total cleanliness, there is something ultimately satisfying to start out with a bloody mess and end up with a sparkling clean place.It is a very Zen game, though. There is nothing that would put pressure on you except your goal of cleaning it faster this time around (which usually only leads to you spilling that bloody bucket or strewing the body parts all over the place because you wanted to run with a heavy bucket), and you will spend quite a bit of time hunting down that last body part hiding behind a panel or that last speck of alien blood that you mistook for the pattern of the wall paint. Picking up bullet casings also is very ... Zen.It's also not a good idea to play this game alone in a dark room. It's quite haunting. Even though there are no living creatures but you (and your potential partners in a cleanup crew), but you are, after all, cleaning up an area where you collect bodies. Or parts thereof.Lots of fun to me, but, well, as I said: OCD might make me biased.			"

												There's something oddly satisfying about this game.  There's no enemies to run from and/or kill, there's no time limit (unless you set one for yourself), hell there's not even any music.  The game just revolves around you as a janitor, simply cleaning up some horrible accidents.  Mopping up blood and other stuff, disposing of body parts and organs inside of an incinerator, and putting down the customary ""Caution!  Wet Floor!"" signs.  It may sound boring, but once you start you almost find yourself in a Zen-like trance.  You want to keep playing to make sure everything is just right before you say you've finished the job.  The only real major problem I have with the game is the pyshics.  Knocking over your bucket or biohazard bin with just the slightest touch (even happens with a single bullet shell casing) is beyond frustrating.  It's not enough to make the game unplayable, but will get even the most patient of players to drop an F bomb.  A solid 7 out of 10.			"

												Definitely a game focused around youtubers and ppl with OCD. Others may still enjoy the game, but they're unlikely to spend a lot of hours into it.I've gotten employee of the month 5 times in a row so far with my best score so far being 111% and lowest being 101% (my first one). I'm still learning though, so I'm sure I'll keep getting higher scores with each new / bigger level I complete.A few flaws worth noting:- Physics and object clipping is quite glitchy, objects will freak out if not placed just right. Levels seem to be purposely set up to test your patience and / or perception. And some thin objects like PDAs or paper notes will clip through ground, walls, pretty much everything at least a little bit.- The dev really seems to enjoy crowding the level with too many crates and barrels, making it really difficult and annoying to stack in the given small zones.- The biggest challenge this game has to offer is just maintaining patience and getting every bit of the level perfectly clean and organized. Although figuring out the causes of deaths can often be really difficult.- Logging everything like bullet casings, bullet holes, amount of dead aliens, and worst of all, the amount of objects thrown in the incinerator is probably the worst aspect of the game as it takes so long, and for whatever reason, some of it doesn't even work anyways. Just last night, I wrote in the report that I found 52 bullet holes, and when I finished the work day, back at the office, I see that it wrote down 0 bullet holes. Annoying as it affects my overall score.- I don't know if it's the game's fault or just my new router, but even after port forwarding, ppl cannot connect to my game at all. They can see me, but can't connect to me. I'm still experimenting with router settings to see if I can make it work, but looking in the Steam Discussions area, it looks to be a very common issue with this game.- This game really desperately needs a tutorial / training session. Everyone I've played with so far has had no idea what to do aside from the obvious cleaning up the bodies and blood. Completely understandably, no one knew they had to log everything and write it down in the report. No one knew they had to organize stuff, figure out the causes of deaths, count bullets and items thrown in the incinerator, etc... I myself only discovered this after retrying to finish the same level over and over and reading countless forum posts and wiki pages. Not many players would be willing to go through that much bother, as evidence by how many players got any of the achievements completed. I completed the first level, got the achievement, looked at the percentage of players who also completed it and laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off. I mean seriously, consider adding a tutorial or something, cuz that's embarrassing. Also, the ""End Day"" feedback is pathetic. When you get demoted for just doing the minimum, it gives no reason as to why you got demoted... ""What did I do wrong?"". I don't want the game to constantly hold my hand, but when you spend 4+ hours cleaning a single level, I would definitely appreciate some feedback as to what I missed and what I could have done better.But overall, I like the game cuz it's unique and interesting and fits nicely with my OCD.

								There's something strangely satisfying about getting a place clean... And infuriating when you accidentally leave a trail of bloody footprints!Anyway, there's a surprising amount of content and quality in this. It's not just another simulator game made to be bad (don't get me wrong, some of those are great too).It already has a decent amount of nicely designed maps, some fun little pieces of story that might change depending how well you do your job, and it all works well and looks nice at the same time.The only negative thing I could say about it is that it sometimes seems a little unclear about what you're supposed to do about what (unless I'm just missing something). I didn't know that a laser gun would fix bullet holes, until I left the level and found a written complaint in my office, then I had to look it up.So if you've ever wanted to be a janitor without earning money for it, this is the game for you!

								This game does what other huge titles such as Call of Duty and Battlefield have all failed to do; accurately simulates military life. as a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, i can honestly say this gamebrings me back to my glory days like no other. the games ""physics engine"" reallyjust simulates the drunken stupor we constantly maintain when cleaning♥♥♥♥♥♥its just like the real thing. mop with your friends and laugh as they are blown up,incinerated, dismembered and sustain other horrific injuries. if you want a taste of military life that is accurate, gritty, and unfiltered dont bother with other titles. evenArma 3 and Americas Army cant bring you the realistic settings you will get with thisgame.  and for veterans, its a must have! re live your golden daze like it was yesterday with stunning accuracy and visuals. 10/10			"

								Start playing this game with a friend.Have no clue what to do. Spill some buckets and mess everywhere with dirty mops and limbs.Start hitting each other with mops.Laugh our asses off.Eventually clean up the place.Pros:+ Cleaning has never been this much fun...+ The clumsiness of the players is hilarious!+ Variety of the maps are nice. Plus workshop is pretty cool as well.+ Best to play with a friend or two, in my opinion. Works with SP as well!Cons:-... and frustrating. GOD DAMN CARTRIDGES,- Feels like the mass of the objects are the same, hitting a soda can with a mop is the same as hitting a barrel. They both fly almost the same.+/- Physics. It's funny if you're trying to fit a full garbage bin into a furnace and it ends up exploding all over the place. With blood, alien blood and fire. Octuples the mess. But it's sometimes really frustrating. Especially if it's the last garbage bin you need to burn to finish the level.8/10. Totally worth the money.			"

								This game is actually pretty darn fun. It's more challenging than a glance would first suspect, but not in the ridiculous way that Surgeon Simulator is. You gotta take your time and really think strategically about how you move things around, or else you'll knock over that bloody water and have another mess on your hands. Although it seems like it can sufer from repetition, I can still see myself losing hours into this. I'm hoping multiplayer will take on some sort of server/lobby system soon, as of now it's only direct connect and I don't have friends that have/will play at the moment. Great job on an outside the box game!			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is a first person ""simulator"" game about being space janitor. In space. Sure think it's a joke simulator, but gameplay itself is not broken on purpose unlike other such games. It was developed by RuneStorm and finally released out of Steam's Early Access in 2015 after entering it in 2014. And yep, coop multiplayer is primary focus. But can solo.It actually had two stand-alone spinoff before release, which included only a single level: Shadow Warrior tie-in and Santa's Rampage. And they are going to include them both into base VCD game for free. Actually, they already did it with Santa's Rampage, Shadow Warrior one is coming soon. Which also means that this review will become outdated soon, uh oh.It also still gets a support post-launch. It's probably not going to stay forever, not every game is Minecraft. But hey, new map!Technically, it does have a bunch of physics bugs. Most often you are going to be frustrated that ""crisp"" chips packets clipped at the bottom of the bin once again. Physics items also sometimes get stuck in geometry. The best way to handle it is to grab them, then hold the grab button (it will let you to rotate it) and swing your mouse around like crazy until it glitches out. Game may also not always be fair, hiding barely visible stain behind no-collision geometry, for example.Multiplayer community is kinda dead but not really. It's just that people usually prefer playing with people they know, since in this game you can mess up progress a lot. Can ask or find coop request in the forums. But if you just want to play with strangers and public, then the only thing you can expect to see in server browser is a bunch of empty password locked servers. Oh well.Your job in this game is to clean up the level from all the trash, guts and blood which happens to be there after some disaster of alien origin. It often references famous horror movies so it's fun if you get the reference. You spawn in the level and it's your job to burn all gibs and wash up all blood and burn up bullet holes and just make it look clean for your own amusement. The core gameplay can get repetetive, but it has this relaxive feel to it, especially if you don't turn on radio. It's also fun for those who love to do stuff fully and watch the progress of level getting cleaner. That, and things can sometimes go wrong, especially if you are playing with good friends. Somebody may knock the bucket of bloody water, for example. In multiplayer the fun comes from party aspect. Maybe more fun than doing it all solo.Oh, and you also have to spend time to use radar device to find out what you missed, which may also happen to be nastily hidden if you aim for 100%. Actually, the maximum completionists also can do paperworks, in which you have to report on what you think happened. Then bring USB sticks of dead people and choose what you think happened to them. And fill in boring stuff like number of shells found. It's pretty great idea, to combine being detective and janitor, but sadly it's more mundane and I just don't want to count all the shells.But it could use more variation between levels. Well, there is some, but it's not enough. This game just doesn't fit to play fully in solo.Which is why I like how the game is structured. It pretty much says you that you aren't supposed to beat it fully or play it all in solo. There is no linear campaign at all and there is no real requirements or real progress. You just pick mode, pick the map. Well, you do get achievement for beating them. But eh. You can even clock out from the level anytime, there is no real concequence to doing awful job. Well, I still would have liked story mode, but only if gameplay was less repetetive. At least this way it doesn't push me ""beat whole game to be the men"".And to be honest, I didn't. I only have done half of levels in solo, only big levels are left. And I want to tackle them only with friends now.It also has the office into which the game sends you after clocking out. It's a very small level, your little basement-like space. The point is that only at this point do you get a feedback on your job. You have screen which shows completion state, it puts paper around the room of hiralious accidents if you forgot to clean up something. It also is just your little home filled with useless stuff and you can bring up anything you want from the levels.And there isn't much else to it. It's a nice jokeish simulator. It's a relaxish experience to play solo and it has a great party effect when playing with friends.			"

												It would be fair to say I am absolutely in love with this game.  Who knows why.. I have my own house to clean and vent about on a daily basis... the game is a bit buggy (not sure if this is my computer or not.. I hate you, Win8!).. and those darn bloody footprints!But I do.. I really, really love this game.  There is a weird satisfaction in looking at the levels when you have completed them, and seeing how great of a job you've done (wish I could say the same about my real life laundry pile!).  It's the perfect game to play when I know my family will interrupt me 40,000 times because it is calm, almost soothing in a weird way.. nothing will jump out and kill me if I turn my eyes from the screen for a moment, and I don't forget which achievement I'm working on while I'm discussing finances with the husband, random genetics facts with my daughter, or my son's friends and their teenage angst.  I can play the game with a cat (or two) in my lap, and can play when I'm half asleep drinking my coffee before the day starts... and unlike fb, it never tries to draw me into political debate or accuses me of being the 'r' word.  Just a great game.. great concept, great execution.			"

In short you gotta clean the mess of other beings.I don't really know why, but cleaning bloody mess is so satisfying.This game is simply original, never seen a game like this.Alot of levels to clean and achievements!Just seeying how you can make a dirty bloody♥♥♥♥♥place into a cleaning shining room is just unbelievable satisfying.This game is not for everyone, of course..Said the word ""clean"" so many times, but damn, this game is all bout cleaning so..

												Definitely a game focused around youtubers and ppl with OCD. Others may still enjoy the game, but they're unlikely to spend a lot of hours into it.I've gotten employee of the month 5 times in a row so far with my best score so far being 111% and lowest being 101% (my first one). I'm still learning though, so I'm sure I'll keep getting higher scores with each new / bigger level I complete.A few flaws worth noting:- Physics and object clipping is quite glitchy, objects will freak out if not placed just right. Levels seem to be purposely set up to test your patience and / or perception. And some thin objects like PDAs or paper notes will clip through ground, walls, pretty much everything at least a little bit.- The dev really seems to enjoy crowding the level with too many crates and barrels, making it really difficult and annoying to stack in the given small zones.- The biggest challenge this game has to offer is just maintaining patience and getting every bit of the level perfectly clean and organized. Although figuring out the causes of deaths can often be really difficult.- Logging everything like bullet casings, bullet holes, amount of dead aliens, and worst of all, the amount of objects thrown in the incinerator is probably the worst aspect of the game as it takes so long, and for whatever reason, some of it doesn't even work anyways. Just last night, I wrote in the report that I found 52 bullet holes, and when I finished the work day, back at the office, I see that it wrote down 0 bullet holes. Annoying as it affects my overall score.- I don't know if it's the game's fault or just my new router, but even after port forwarding, ppl cannot connect to my game at all. They can see me, but can't connect to me. I'm still experimenting with router settings to see if I can make it work, but looking in the Steam Discussions area, it looks to be a very common issue with this game.- This game really desperately needs a tutorial / training session. Everyone I've played with so far has had no idea what to do aside from the obvious cleaning up the bodies and blood. Completely understandably, no one knew they had to log everything and write it down in the report. No one knew they had to organize stuff, figure out the causes of deaths, count bullets and items thrown in the incinerator, etc... I myself only discovered this after retrying to finish the same level over and over and reading countless forum posts and wiki pages. Not many players would be willing to go through that much bother, as evidence by how many players got any of the achievements completed. I completed the first level, got the achievement, looked at the percentage of players who also completed it and laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off. I mean seriously, consider adding a tutorial or something, cuz that's embarrassing. Also, the ""End Day"" feedback is pathetic. When you get demoted for just doing the minimum, it gives no reason as to why you got demoted... ""What did I do wrong?"". I don't want the game to constantly hold my hand, but when you spend 4+ hours cleaning a single level, I would definitely appreciate some feedback as to what I missed and what I could have done better.But overall, I like the game cuz it's unique and interesting and fits nicely with my OCD.

My only problem is i get constant framerate drops, I'll be getting 60 frames or so then it will plummet down to 15 or around that, then it will go back up.

Protocol for Keeping Facility Clean* Guns are useless. They only make bullet holes and make giant messes of casings everywhere.* Keep your blood and organs inside of you if they're leaking out of your body* Die in a place I can find you* Throw your damn trash away* You don't need to write on paper or holographic script things, just talk like any normal person would. I don't care about any of the backstory you have to share.* Personal Identification Devices are also useless. We don't care if you died, and if we did we'd run tests to find out who you are.* Go to the hospital and get surgery to remove as many organs as possible from your body. You don't need most of them anyways.* Don't try to push our society further into higher knowledge of the world. It always breaks out in a bunch of idiots dying and some sort of new species being discovered.* Keep your hands off my Big Banger			"

												In my mind this game is fantastic for two scenarios:1) Zoning out while you do something else, because it's almost entirely mindless2) Making new friends and strengthing old bondsI've played this game for many hours by myself while listening to audio books, because it keeps my hands busy but my mind free.  I've also had multiple relationship partners play this game with me and we always had a lot of fun.  It's certainly not a conventional game but it fills those two roles perfectly.			"

												There's something oddly satisfying about this game.  There's no enemies to run from and/or kill, there's no time limit (unless you set one for yourself), hell there's not even any music.  The game just revolves around you as a janitor, simply cleaning up some horrible accidents.  Mopping up blood and other stuff, disposing of body parts and organs inside of an incinerator, and putting down the customary ""Caution!  Wet Floor!"" signs.  It may sound boring, but once you start you almost find yourself in a Zen-like trance.  You want to keep playing to make sure everything is just right before you say you've finished the job.  The only real major problem I have with the game is the pyshics.  Knocking over your bucket or biohazard bin with just the slightest touch (even happens with a single bullet shell casing) is beyond frustrating.  It's not enough to make the game unplayable, but will get even the most patient of players to drop an F bomb.  A solid 7 out of 10.			"

								This game is actually pretty darn fun. It's more challenging than a glance would first suspect, but not in the ridiculous way that Surgeon Simulator is. You gotta take your time and really think strategically about how you move things around, or else you'll knock over that bloody water and have another mess on your hands. Although it seems like it can sufer from repetition, I can still see myself losing hours into this. I'm hoping multiplayer will take on some sort of server/lobby system soon, as of now it's only direct connect and I don't have friends that have/will play at the moment. Great job on an outside the box game!			"

It's a cleaning simulator, seems like a one-off joke like Goat Simulator and some of these reviews seem like jokes.But trust me, this game is legitimately surprisingly fun, with co-operative, unique maps with secrets to find and stories to tell. It's extremely satisfying to finish a job, and even once you've finished every level there's still workshop mods waiting for you to try out.Keep in mind however, that this game is extremely more fun with friends so you're not going to have a nicer experiance going solo.Overall I rate this game an 8/10, check it out.

My work there started rather nicely, the coworkers were really kind and my boss was pretty cool too, little did i know that this wasn't going to last for long.You see, the officers were having a summer break while i was there, which meant that the school was closed and all the living quarters were completely empty. This of course meant that there was not going to be any dirt to clean since the whole place was completely abandoned for the rest of my month long stay.Nothing, and i do mean NOTHING, is worse than having to clean up a place that you've already cleaned crystal clean the last day. And you cant even slack off since it's an army base and there are people monitoring your doings over the security cameras!How does this have anything to do with Viscera Cleanup Detail? You might ask.Let me tell you, the month i spent in that reserve hellhole was probably the most dull i've ever had. The one and only thing i really wished for (Excluding the fact that i basically knew nobody in the town, so i had little to no social contacts.) was to have something to actually clean.Then one day i found this game, and it's just what i wished for. You have so much to clean that you'll be spending hours upon hours just trying to make every single last spot so clean that you can see your own image in it.I dont know if the devs are really all that invested in the game as a ""Real Product"" or just treating it something people find silly and make YouTube videos about, but i personally enjoy it very much since i can live my childhood dream of actually doing something worthwhile for my money.Giblets, tasty giblets... ~			"

												This game is fantastic for multiplayer. It was so fun figuring out how to clean, trying to work together without tripping over each other, and mopping up the guts and grime -- with teamwork! The physics are a bit crazy: dismembered limbs with minds of their own, full boxes of guts randomly exploding, and parts popping out of boxes as they're carried. But that just adds to the entertainment. If you've ever wondered what happens after you clear a level in your favorite FPS, it's probably something like this. The complaints and praise after each job add to the realism (and hilarity), and the various clues about what happened in each level help the immersion and allow you to imagine what exciting things happened recently in the room you're tasked with cleaning.

								i had some doubts about getting this game. I thought it may be something like goat simulator or turbo dismount, that merges on making the player laugh for 5 minutes and then dismiss the game forever. But, it isn't. surprisingly, it isn't.In the game, you go arround mopping blood pools and grabbing all kinds of waste, burning them and then going back to get more. That's not all, but is the main gameplay. and, it is surprisingly rewarding to see how a room slowly starts looking cleaner and beautiful.the only things i could address againist the game are the lack of crouching mode (which isn't really necesary in most cases, but once i found myself desesperately swinging arround my mop trying to take a gib off from under a table, because i can't grab it like normal) and few minor issues with the physics. But, the game is in early access, and these issues will likely be fixed in some time. The game is completly worthed the price right now, though... and also they warn you, the price will raise as the game gets closer to it's final version, so you better get it now!			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail is an indie developed ""Space-Janitor cleaning simulator"". In it you take the role of a Janitor who has to clean-up the aftermath of numerous horrible events. The goal of Viscera Cleanup Detail is to clean the level to the best of your ability. This game features many levels and you have the option of cleaning them either alone or with other people. The gameplay primarily consists of navigating the level while doing things like mopping up blood of the walls and taking dead bodies and other trash to the incinirator. Sometimes you face challenges in the levels that can't be overcome simply with a mop and a water bucket alone so, you have other tools at your disposal like a welder wich can fix bullet holes and a portable elevator with wich you can reach new unreachable heights.This game in my opinion is the most entertaining when you play it with someone else co-operatively. There's just something incredibly satisfying about cleaning a level in one long sitting with a friend.			"

Every bucket I tip over spilling bodily fluids and every room I accidently set on fire I constantly want to kill myself by stepping out the airlock and floating in the silent, still void of space. And I mean that in the best way possible. For some reason I keep going back. Keep clocking it. Perhaps not all are called for this duty. Perhaps there are only a select few. Live by the mop. Die by the mop. We are the clean up detail. Whether your stain be green red, black or brown, we'll be there to mop it down. Hoorah.			"

								I don't know why playing a game about cleaning is so enjoyable...but it is!  It might have something to do with the fun of seeing a foot or hand flop around as if they are waving at you as you carry them to either the incinerator (where you burn everything!) or  the hazardous waste bin. Or maybe it’s how you can burn anything that will fit in the incinerator, including buckets full of water.  Or how you can go jump in a puddle of blood and then run around leaving footprints everywhere…which you can then choose to clean or ignore. Or it might have to do with the fact that it answers that often asked question – what happens  after the battle/experiment/accident?The controls (once you figure them out) are pretty good, and the detail is great. You also have the option of cleaning to perfection, or making a bigger mess (just think of bloody footprints, mops and dirty water spilled everywhere). You can choose to end the level right away, if you just don’t care, or going out there and doing as great a job as possible before clocking out. "

												It's definitely possible to make a menial chore an enjoyable experience in the realm of video games - Viscera Cleanup Detail does that fairly well. While I hate cleaning in real life, the Viscera games scratches that occasionally itch I have to clean everything or clean a certain area. It somewhat compelling to complete a mess, even if you don't get a real reward. The game is also ""Trollish"", both intentionally and unintentionally thanks to its physics, blood being tracked from footsteps, items getting glitched in geometry, or body parts coming out of work stations - making it impossible or nearly impossible to completely clean a level. There's a good amount of content for the price, as well as support for potentially unlimited custom maps thanks to the Workshop, though, if you're looking for a storytelling experience or something you can complete in a certain amount of time, VCD is not your game. Viscera Cleanup Detail is either best played with friends, as something to play while listening to other audio, or as a relaxation experience, if the gore doesn't gross you out.I was predisposed to this game because I enjoyed the Shadow Warrior and Santa's Rampage edition of this game. They were, free, concise experiences of cleaning up the mess of some savagery. However, VCD was in early access for a long time and I waited well after it came out to finally purchase it. While the game is good at what it does, I find no reason to stick with it. It has plenty of content, but seemingly no reason to do so outside of an evaluation and acheivements. It becomes tough to recommend this game for that reason, because while the game has its purpose, and executes its intentions pretty well, it doesn't give you any reason to stick with it unless you love the gameplay. It goes from being a funny game about doing chores to basically doing chores. The novelty of cleaning up the mess after ""Player 1 just massacred a bunch of people"" wears of pretty quick, and the game gets pretty close to being ""Youtuber bait"".If you find the idea of spending 2-4 hours cleaning a map (less, with more players, but online games are practically dead) amusing for more than 2-4 hours, you have a game that will deliver alot of content. For everybody else, I recommend playing the Santa's Rampage or Shadow Warrior editions if you have a marginal interest in what this game offers.			"

For singleplayer, the game is decent when it comes to glitches, though, you can get possessed bucketsOverall this game is really fun and if your cleaning by yourself I reccomend using the radio and just chill or use your own music and play this amazing game.Would not hesitate to buy 8.5/10			"

There isn't much room for your skill to develop either. You just go back and forth mopping the floor, get rid of the dirty bucket, get another clean bucket, rinse and repeat. Seriously, just go clean your own room. At least that way you can play games in a clean environment.			"

 Viscera cleanup detailDeveloper:RunestormPublisher:RunestormGenre: Cleaning Cleaning up made fun! VCD is a game about cleaning up space stations.To do so you have various tools, You have a mop which you use to clean up blood smoke etc, but the more you clean the dirtier it gets so you need to clean it with some water, If you knock over a dirty bucket you'll drop a bloodstain.You can get water  and boxes for giblets you get them by going to the machine which dispenses them, but sometimes the game will troll you by instead of giving you said bucket or boxes.when your water is dirty or your box is full with giblets you need to burn it in the furnace.Next to cleaning up blood and body parts which give of blood as well if they fall on the ground, you have to clean up bullets random trash and also get rid of bulletholes.But sometimes i couldn't really see the bulletholes though i know they are there because of the detector they were kinda glitchy to me.The detector has two modes organic( Blood Giblets etc ) and non organic (Trash Bullet holes etc) it will beep if there's something left to clean and it will show on the screen also.When you're finished clock off ( i recommend doing the questions as well for bonus points)When youre done youll go to your office which has 3 puzzles in it and which you also need to clean if you care for achievements.When you read that you were maybe thinking “But that sounds boring, why would i clean in a game if i can clean irl also?”.There's just something satisfying about seeing a whole area being cleaned.Yes it's definitely a slow burn but for some reason also really fun.And it's also one of those games where you can just turn off your brain and put on a podcast.and well the game just works really well ( unless you gotta cleanup alien body parts which are quite big )Theres one thing which bugs me a bit if you do get trophies but then the next level at least 70% it gets rid of your trophies and items you've collected.As for story each map has papers laying around or datapads i didn't really pay attention to them.Theres one bigger storyline; Bob he was a janitor as well you'll find notes of him in various levels which you can collect so you can get a achievement but it can get a bit tedious.As for the soundtrack didn't pay attention to it.And the game looks good the gore is good and it runs quite good.There are also 2 extra maps which are pretty fun especially the christmas one.The multiplayer however can be laggy and glitchy which is bad because you'll knock over buckets drop boxes with giblets which stuff dirty again etc etc.Overall VCD is a fun but a slow burn cleaning sim with simple mechanics but with flawed MP and some achievements which are tedious to get.But if you just want something to play while listening a podcast or something among those lines i think you'll enjoy it alot.No drama, Just Reviews.

												I have only played this game for 2.4 hours and I already love it! I plan to add much more time to it when I can. In this game you are a janitor on different alien planets and space stations. The tools that I have encountered are:•The MopLet's you clean up blood.•The HandsLet's you pick up viscera and trash.•The SnifferLet's you seek out blood, viscera, and trash.•The BroomA worse version of the mop.•The Plasma WelderLet's you weld bullet holes and tracks.I have played three levels before, my favorite is one where you are at a space station and some robots were haywire so they sent in a team to destroy the robots. They make good use of the plasma welder to weld tracks left from the big robots and to weld bullet holes.As you explore the station you find papers that say different things, I found a paper about a man who did, explicit things, with a robot. I then found him in a bathroom with his head gone and his hand in a toilet. The way I knew was the P.I.D. (Personal Identification Device).This game is amazing, I got it while a sale was running and I define try recommend the same. If this game is on sale, buy it!8/10 This game is amazing!			"

								This is a game that will (kinda) fall under the catagory simulator. ill just explain one of the levels for you so you get a picture to understand this. Imagine two chinese gangs that gets on bad terms huge fight guns, swods and throwing stars. blood and gore all over the place. this is where you come in. you are a janitor and you are supposed to clean up the place this will take you 10 minutes to 3 hours where you will get rid of etc. gunshots, swords, statues and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bodyparts. but again this is just the start. now that you got rid of anything that makes a mess then you gotta clean the floor you will be able to clean the floor alittle if we try to count how much blood there is? from 100-100000 milk catons filled with blood. if you still are reading god dammit you have good time then you may think ""this is work this is♥♥♥♥♥♥this is boring"" and i think you are right and the game is not fun in it self it is the moments where you and a friend plays this and have a good time, where you see how much faster you can do it with your friends how good a friend you got who were ready to toss in money for a game about cleaning up because you were bored that one day i will give this my official rating from 1 to 10 stars this game is 6,5 stars out of 10 because it is just that good a dumb idea turned out good and that is how a good game should be			"

								This is a game that will (kinda) fall under the catagory simulator. ill just explain one of the levels for you so you get a picture to understand this. Imagine two chinese gangs that gets on bad terms huge fight guns, swods and throwing stars. blood and gore all over the place. this is where you come in. you are a janitor and you are supposed to clean up the place this will take you 10 minutes to 3 hours where you will get rid of etc. gunshots, swords, statues and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bodyparts. but again this is just the start. now that you got rid of anything that makes a mess then you gotta clean the floor you will be able to clean the floor alittle if we try to count how much blood there is? from 100-100000 milk catons filled with blood. if you still are reading god dammit you have good time then you may think ""this is work this is♥♥♥♥♥♥this is boring"" and i think you are right and the game is not fun in it self it is the moments where you and a friend plays this and have a good time, where you see how much faster you can do it with your friends how good a friend you got who were ready to toss in money for a game about cleaning up because you were bored that one day i will give this my official rating from 1 to 10 stars this game is 6,5 stars out of 10 because it is just that good a dumb idea turned out good and that is how a good game should be			"

(He looks like a punch drunk football player with amphetamine gurns anyway, so what do you expect?)The hail of bullets and the onslaught of undead alien pigmen hordes could never compare to the horror you feel when you accidentally knock over a bucket of bloodied water just as you finished mopping a typical crate strewn space station corridor to a spotless shine.See how the other half lives.

												I started playing this game back during the free Alpha then got it on Steam during Early Access. I still play this game and have loved every moment of it. This game is loaded with fun and unique maps. Each one has it's own theme and level of mess to clean up. With the workshop maps that are being made and the Devs working on new maps you will find lots of places to explore and clean up. Multiplayer makes the game even better. You can have fun trolling some friends by making a bigger mess, or work together and try to get a map spotless. Sure the games has it's share of a few bugs but then again no game is ever bug free. With that said some of the random bugs are more amusing then annoying. Some of the bugs many have considered them as features more then anything else. If you want to see some of the random yet funny things that has happened in this game even back during the old beta days just look at the screenshots and artwork sections on Steam, I'm sure something will make you smile.With all of that said I highly recommend this game, because cleaning has never been this fun.

								The FPS genre is now officially over.  This is the final level to every survival horror space marine shoot'em up since Doom.I could never continue to care about the plight of Isaac Clarke when all I can think is ""That's gonna leave a stain"", or that the character you play in Doom 3 is an inconsiderate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for leaving all that mess for some poor shmoe to clean up.  (He looks like a punch drunk football player with amphetamine gurns anyway, so what do you expect?)The hail of bullets and the onslaught of undead alien pigmen hordes could never compare to the horror you feel when you accidentally knock over a bucket of bloodied water just as you finished mopping a typical crate strewn space station corridor to a spotless shine.See how the other half lives.

												While I am a janitor in real life, this game has allowed me to be a janitor, IN SPACE! So what's not to love about that? You and/or your friend's play the role of  dime a dozen janitors working for a faceless megacorperation in the future. When the space Marines have blasted holes in all the aliens or a science experiment has gone horribly wrong, you'll be there, to mop up the mess. No ticker tape parades for you and your coworkers, just the satisfaction of a job well done and maybe a slight promotion.			"

								Cannot stop playing, I mean, cleaning.  This game is a massive time-sink.  Once you start, you can't stop.The developers actually managed to make being a janitor fun and challenging.  (Yes, I wrote that with a straight face)  What makes this game so much fun?  Trying to figure out the best way to clean up after these horrific events.  Do you start with the body parts?  The entrails?  Do you clean from the top down?  Do you start from the incinerator and work your way out or the other way around?  What about the shell casings?  Choose the wrong strategy and you end up leaving bloody footprints all over your newly cleaned floor.Your cleaning tools are a mop, unlimited supply of buckets of water, and a biohazard detector.  That's it.  Another part of the challenge is the size of each level.  Just cleaning up one of these rooms would take a good 30mins.  There are several rooms and hallways on the first level alone.You have to be careful handling buckets and containers.  They can and do tip over easily.  Imagine a bucket filled with bloody water tipping over your newly cleaned floor.  FRUSTRATING.  Mopping around shell casings will send the casings rolling away.  Accidently run your mop over an entrail you didn't see?  Instant blood spatter.I'm only one level into this game but found it so much fun I had to write a review.  Hope this helps.			"

												Supposedly you play as a janitor in this game.  But in truth you're a painter, with the only color option for your large brush being a deep red.  A game best played with friends, whether you're trying to actually clean up a level and put everything where it belongs, or just trying to make the biggest mess possible, laughs and good times are to be had all around.As well, the more OCD you are, the easier it'll be for you to find yourself playing for hours at a time, and the more a non OCD friend will drive you up the wall with their messy antics as they goof off and throw dead bloody limbs around for you to clean up.  Physics are wonky, seeming intentionally so.  The laggy network physics for anyone not the host, probably not as intentional.  And just as in real life, your mop gets soiled often and easily, so expect to need a whole lot of buckets to stay fresh and scrubbing.			"

								(Thinking:) ""How interesting could cleaning up to be?!"" ""Who wants to clean up his own room and have fun within?!"" (:End)I do it only, because there are other Persons, who wants to be in the house, too. This Game has other perspectives than I have, while I'm cleaning my house. (Beside: My house doesn't look like this in any ways.)This game is well commented, easy to learn, how to use it. (If someone doesn't know, where to put all the mad stuff, the oven is always a good choice. :))This game is for those, who dose want to have some fun, and for the others, who are angry about something. You can clean up normally, or you can make more damage, than there was before.The machines, which gives you the cleaning material don't make difference between cleaning up and blowing up. So take care by getting your cleaning material.Nearly 10,- € isn't too much for this game.RuneStorm get on working with this game. It's kinda cool.			"

												I've invested more time into this game than TF2.I legitimately don't know how. I'll try to justify why by debunking misconceptions you might have about this game from glancing at it.(Full disclosure: I've spent a lot of time on the forums, including with the developers)Q. Why would you play a game about cleaning stuff up?A. Well, obviously the setting provides a lot of leeway. The game's cleaning environments/notes heavily and deliberately reference movies like The Thing, Alien, Event Horizon, Robocop, Demolition Man... If you're a fan of 80's horror/sci-fi or just someone who likes somewhat older, cult classic movies in general you'll see numerous references that'll make you smile, though the game doesn't shove them in your face. Secondly, cleaning stuff up minus the physical strain is actually somewhat satisfying. This game is perfect for playing whilst listening to podcasts, audiobooks and similar stuff.Q. Isn't this some kind of memes-trash game like Goat Simulator?A. Oh lord no. Glitches are uncommon (There are a few the devs have deliberately kept in due to humorous value, but they are far from game-disruptive), the controls are nowhere near deliberately awkward, and almost all jokes are told via either the environment or via notes you find. The game's far more concerned with telling semi-parodical stories of old movies via its environment than mindlessly going ""OH LOL THE GAME'S GLITCHING ISN'T THAT FUNNY BECAUSE THE GLITCHES ARE INTENTIONAL THEREFORE ALL COMEDY THAT MIGHT COME WITH GLITCHES IS INHERENTLY LOST LOL"". I can see why people might get the conception that's the game's purpose, but it's wrong in every way. The game will screw you over with ridiculousness, but it's not a ""Memes-trash"" game.Q. Does this game have enough content?A. Even if you play every level only once, assuming you actually bother to clean the level and don't immediately exit (Yes, you can do that, and yes, you get heavily punished), you'll still get your money's worth. Each level varies vastly in length, but a full completion will take you several hours, guarenteed.

								(Thinking:) ""How interesting could cleaning up to be?!"" ""Who wants to clean up his own room and have fun within?!"" (:End)I do it only, because there are other Persons, who wants to be in the house, too. This Game has other perspectives than I have, while I'm cleaning my house. (Beside: My house doesn't look like this in any ways.)This game is well commented, easy to learn, how to use it. (If someone doesn't know, where to put all the mad stuff, the oven is always a good choice. :))This game is for those, who dose want to have some fun, and for the others, who are angry about something. You can clean up normally, or you can make more damage, than there was before.The machines, which gives you the cleaning material don't make difference between cleaning up and blowing up. So take care by getting your cleaning material.Nearly 10,- € isn't too much for this game.RuneStorm get on working with this game. It's kinda cool.			"

There are no guidelines as to when your done, though your ""sniffer"" lets you look for hidden item (""How did that arm end up there...?""), no introduction or tutorial (Here's a mob, use the wet end...) but loads of fun :)Have fun, explore, gore, make a mess and enjoy :)			"

												The premise is lovely: you're the janitor at some remote space facility (space station, research base, etc.) the day after the unseen, but spectacularly gory, alien infestation. It's up to you to pick up the debris (human and otherwise), restack the scattered crates and barrels, patch the bullet holes, and oh yeah: mop up the blood. There's a LOT of blood. And slime. Which you're inevitably going to track around behind you as you make your way through the facility, meticulously cleaning as you go...The more you play, the more you realize you're trapped in a giant interactive physics puzzle that will trigger every anal retentive perfectionist trait you struggle to suppress in real life. This is one of those games that manages to be hilarious, in a Charles Addams kind of way, without telling a single joke or having a single line of dialog. And it supports 4-player co-op.Highly recommended. "

												I've invested more time into this game than TF2.I legitimately don't know how. I'll try to justify why by debunking misconceptions you might have about this game from glancing at it.(Full disclosure: I've spent a lot of time on the forums, including with the developers)Q. Why would you play a game about cleaning stuff up?A. Well, obviously the setting provides a lot of leeway. The game's cleaning environments/notes heavily and deliberately reference movies like The Thing, Alien, Event Horizon, Robocop, Demolition Man... If you're a fan of 80's horror/sci-fi or just someone who likes somewhat older, cult classic movies in general you'll see numerous references that'll make you smile, though the game doesn't shove them in your face. Secondly, cleaning stuff up minus the physical strain is actually somewhat satisfying. This game is perfect for playing whilst listening to podcasts, audiobooks and similar stuff.Q. Isn't this some kind of memes-trash game like Goat Simulator?A. Oh lord no. Glitches are uncommon (There are a few the devs have deliberately kept in due to humorous value, but they are far from game-disruptive), the controls are nowhere near deliberately awkward, and almost all jokes are told via either the environment or via notes you find. The game's far more concerned with telling semi-parodical stories of old movies via its environment than mindlessly going ""OH LOL THE GAME'S GLITCHING ISN'T THAT FUNNY BECAUSE THE GLITCHES ARE INTENTIONAL THEREFORE ALL COMEDY THAT MIGHT COME WITH GLITCHES IS INHERENTLY LOST LOL"". I can see why people might get the conception that's the game's purpose, but it's wrong in every way. The game will screw you over with ridiculousness, but it's not a ""Memes-trash"" game.Q. Does this game have enough content?A. Even if you play every level only once, assuming you actually bother to clean the level and don't immediately exit (Yes, you can do that, and yes, you get heavily punished), you'll still get your money's worth. Each level varies vastly in length, but a full completion will take you several hours, guarenteed. Add full Steam Workshop compatability to the mix, and you've got a game that can last you eons.Of course, no game is free of flaws, so I think it'd be best if I warned of them:-There's no tutorial, so you'll have to rely on outside sources to learn how to play.-Multiplayer is very fun (And unlike singleplayer, very chaotic), but rather difficult to set up in comparison to a lot of other multiplayer games. If you're unfamiliar with setting up servers of your own via Hamachi and similar measures then you'll have issues with playing with your pals.-As I mentioned earlier, each level will most likely take you more than an hour. Of course, you can save and return later, but if you don't really have much time to play videogames generally the time investment will probably be too taxing for you.-As you should be able to tell from simply looking at it, this game ain't for everyone ;)			"

								As purely a monotonous time waster, I highly recommend this game. And I'll admit, sometimes it's fun to just clean but then I realize I should be doing it in my real life and it promptly kills the fun. I feel that the game would be more fun if not for the obnoxious things that draw out the job. It's also incredibly difficult to determine what is and isn't clean, meaning that when you finish you have likely missed a spot and you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure otu where. Having to 'debug' to figure out where some stain is is a very huge flaw and using the detector is equally frustrating.			"

												I thought this game would be at least entertaining if not downright fun. The videos and reviews I had seen painted a fairly enjoyably picture. Sadly, I did NOT enjoy it. Being a janitor, no matter how ""cool"" the messes are, gets WAY old in a BIG hurry (imagine that? being a janitor..boring? wooow (sarcasm)) A variety of different maps and messes and catastrophes is neat and all, but when you break it down you're just playing a game about running back and forth between your cleaning stations and your messes... over...and over... and over again. To top it off, the UI is not very good, the interaction with objects in the world varies from comically bad to downright glitchy/broken, your mop bucket carries next to no water (granted, the messes ARE pretty bad), and the ""story""/""narrative"" is so poorly written and explained that I wish they had just left it out entirely and left us to our ridiculous work.Overall? I'm disappointed. I feel like a bit more over the top zany-ness and a bit less busy-work/running back and forth repeatedly, and this would be fun and worthwhile. Sadly, that's not the case.			"

								I was really excited to give this game a try. There is only one problem, the game gives me a massive headache. I don't know if its the fact that you're constantly running back and forth between the diffrent stations or the jerky way that the game moves. It could posibly be the wonky physics but after about 15 minutes of this game, I had to lay down. I know that I'm not the only one experiencing this. I bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and he had the same reaction. I would recommend avoiding this title if you suffer from any form of motion sickness or chronic migrains.			"

								I can definately see this being a pretty fun game with some more work. Currently you have a list of places you can go play space janitor in, jump in, no tutorial, no tracking, you walk around not knowing what to do. Hell, i might have even tried finishing each level if they had achievements. Absolutely 0 sense of progression, and when you clock out (end level) the only way you know what you missed is by sticky notes posted around your office. Its somewhat interesting to walk through the levels to see what kind of mess the hero made, but i honestly wouldnt reccommend it right now. Buy it for 2.50-5 bucks.			"

												This game doesn't  have a lot to offer, after a short while like hour or so it gets very very repetitive, there are different maps but in very similar style and in every map you have to do almost exactly the same tedious work. It is fun concept but not something that can keep player interested for little longer unless you like keep everything in absolute order in your life and do the same in virtual world but let's be honest not lots of us have time and will to do that :)Another thing - physic system is far from being good, sometimes items get, stuck, jump in air or behave very strange and unnatural.Not game for everyone and gets boring quite fast.

But it's not as good as it could be, it should have some sort of currency where you can buy new mops, or new buckets, you get more money based on how good you do on the jobs. It would make it a lot more enjoyable for me to know that I am actually accomplishing something. I'm marking it negative so maybe the devs will see this.			"

												This is a very cool idea for a future game.  This version plays like a demo.  I kept expecting to clear a level, and upgrade my character, equipment or something.  Anything.  But no, the gameplay in the first level is the total gameplay.   You never level up, or get any new or better equpment.    I say ""never"".  After only 14 hours of gameplay I can't really say ""never"".  But that's all I could handle.  If this was an Early Access game with a dedicated and involved team of developers and a vibrant community, it would be different.  Then there's the bugs and glitches and lag.  You will quicly learn that many actions in the game cause your previous work to be destroyed.  When learning the game, and the proper order to do things, you will then discover the bugs that crash the game.   Do not depend on the autosaves.   Save your game each and every time you make some progress in an area.  Specifically, the mechanism that allows you to carry a container with stuff in in it- that is an incredibly complex mechanic for the game engine to achieve.   I totally understand that there could be errors and glitches there.  But again, this is a ""completed"" title.    I have over 4000 hours  supporting an EA game, so I definately understand the development process.  I do not see any dedication here to improving the gameplay in this supposedly completed title.   In the Steam forums, there are many unanswered bug reports.  My report went unanswered as well.  $12.99 USD is way overpriced.  I think $4.99 USD would be a more appropriate price for this demo.Edit:  Remember, the Steam refund policy is for games played less than 2 hours!			"

												It's exactly what you'd expect: a bunch of messy levels to clean up. No more, no less. There is some lore and secrets to be explored that make it a little more interesting than that. However that's not what bothers me about this game. The main crucial drawback is the broken multiplayer and the total absense of public servers. If you want to play this game, make sure you have some friends ready to play with you and possibly a few hours to set up the damn thing to work. It supports splitscreen, which is always a plus, but it really gets fun when you're more than 2 players.			"

								This is my unbiased review of Viscera Cleanup Detail. The story wouldn't matter in a game like this so I am not counting that into my review. Let's start with the gameplay. Singleplayer can be hectic and fun at times, but can lead to becoming boring and humdrum, because of all the walking and picking up you have to accomplish. The mechanics (mop, and other items) work correctly and good for the most part. If you really want to have fun in this game, I greatly insinuate you play this with a friend, or at least anybody for that matter. The multiplayer part of this game is very enjoyable and you won't achieve such boredom as in Singleplayer. To end this review, I recommend Viscera Cleanup Detail. ^-^			"

								My time with Viscera Cleanup Detail has been very enjoyable. Like a lot of others have commented, you would not thing cleaning up blood, trash, body parts, shell casings and much more would be so enjoyable...but it is! There is something very enjoyable about encountering each level as a puzzle. It can take you as long as you want it to but there are methods to tackling each mess quickly. The graphics are very pleasant. Blood, corpses and body parts are laid out in such a way as to tell a story. Each level is littered with notepads describing what happened which really adds to the atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are spot on. Squishy sounds under your boots indicate you are tracking fluids as you walk. Dismembered bodies make a satisfying thump or splat when dropped. There is even a boom box in each level to add some music to work with. The amount of levels currently in the game will leave you with hours upon hours of cleaning goodness. I do have a request though. There needs to be some system of progression. Being able to upgrade your mop to clean more without using a bucket so much would be great. Perhaps some sort of deployable furnace to reduce long treks back and forth to incinerate trash. Just some incentive to actually make you want check every nook and cranny to make sure everything is perfect. The satisfaction of a job well done only goes so far. All in all, the game has been great and I look forward to way more time with it. Anyone on the fence about purchasing the game needs to remember, if it doesnt look like something you would enjoy, don't buy it. There are enough negative reviews from people that have no complaint save for it just isnt for them.			"

								I'm surprised. This game is fun! Why? It's actually ... a game! I'll admit this is a hate it or get sucked into it title. Like in my case for example I found myself taking a quick look at the mess and just getting the kneejerk reflex of starting to clean up right away. If you get into it enough you'll find yourself having fun especially with the ridiculous nature of what you're cleaning and how you go about it. Soon enough I personally found myself watching out not to trail bloody foosteps behind me, obsessively washing every corner one at a time, strategizing with the buckets, etc. It is what it is... and it's a game; if it sucks you in, you'll be having fun!Not counted here is the time spent in the Santa's Rampage version which is where I really started actually trying to get the damn place clean. Prior to this I did some time in the space stations and before that, a quick first impressions video in which I quickly leaned all the difficult aspects of this game: http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=HFPPPydWs0I (Link to a YouTube Flash player, required for watching my video format)My only complaint? If this is to go for a story type flow, it should begin with much smaller areas to clean up. Levels around the order of 1-2hrs, then bring up the bar. Having the messes progressively revealed to us would be even more shocikng and having shorter areas to start with would give more feeling of progress.Suggestons I'd like to make are this: A bag or dust pan item that could allow us to pick up multiple small objects in one swoop instead of going one by one. Next a highlight on the item that will be picked up if the player clicks. Last but not least this game could actually benefit of a basic investigative aspect. You can't help but wonder what the hell happened in these stations and start speculating. A backstory with elements to progressively reveal it... as simple as possible... would be cool.			"

								If you love games like Doom, Deead Space, or any other kind of horror gore game. Then you're gonna hate this.This is litterally the aftermath of those said games, and it's your ♥♥♥♥ing job to clean EVERYTHING up.. and somehow.I ♥♥♥♥ing did it. I cleaned everything up like it was my real ♥♥♥♥ing job. I took precautions, I formatted a plan on where the buckets of soapy water go, and I mummbled random words like: ""These damn kids"" or ""I don't get paid enough to do this""I highly recommend this game.

								Literally one of the most immersive and rewarding simulators to date, forget Flight Simulator, the satisfaction you feel from cleaning room after room in a space station is amazing. Multiplayer makes it even more intense as your team works hand in hand in cleaning, allowing you to finish the cleanup faster.This is honestly a laugh, it is best played with friends.			"

								You would think that a game about cleaning up a huge mess would be lame but in reality the developers got so creative with the mess thats you can put in a lot of time on this game. As a huge fan of Dead Space I find the similarity in some of the levels to be hilarious.I actually told my friend that I was cleaning up the USG Ishimura (the ship was cleaned between the first and second game) and he believed me.

								In a world, full of alien dangers, careless soldiers, and clumsy workers, there is you. With your trusty space mop in hand you take on a wide variety of missions, cleaning the world is your goal. Using the tools that are provided for you, the annoying waste bin, the flimsy water bucket, the overly powerful laster welder, and the almighty furnace! Find something pergnant to discovering what happened at the loaction while on the job? Put it in your blue fun box and call it your own, whatever is in your fun box is yours forever. Work alone or with a friend to clean each and evey ""incident"" location without asking questions. Your work will be examined by an overseer, they will determine either the progression or termination of your employment, the choice is up to you. (10/10 Would clean over and over again!!)			"

								One of a kind game that lets you actually clean up the mess that happens after the battle is over by putting you in the role of a interplanetary janitor. ---------------------------------Based on Alpha build so expect some of these points to be removed or new ones added as updates continue.---------------------------------Good Points-Graphics are nice, as you would expect from the Unreal Engine with dynamic lighting and high resolution textures present in every level.-Physics are wobbly but not so wobbly that you can't do your job just don't do a speed run while you're in a bad mood, the physics will detract rather than add to your mood.-Sound effects and lack of BGM really adds to the atmosphere of the game, both giving the impression of a derelict ship in the aftermath of a huge battle and adding more realism to your actions.-Controls are quick and responsive just as you need them to be as you move from task to task,---------------------------------------Bad Points-Lack of achievements or progress checking, you're pretty much cleaning up for the sole purpose of cleaning up at the moment of this game's build as your end of level performance is not saved anywhere.-On that note, it took me a little while to realise I had to manually exit the staff office through the menu. Perhaps change it so interacting with the door would give you this option?-""Zero-G Therapy"" level imcomplete with a door that opens and closes with no immediate effect-The sniffer device is useful for detecting messes and objects that need disposing/cleaning but a separate switch should be implemented for sniffing out dirty buckets and disposable bins to avoid frustration and confusion as i had to get rid of those buckets and bins nearby when I wanted to find a particular mess/object when those aforementioned tools could still be used.-Most of the levels require the use of the welder gun so I found it unintuitive that it had to be thrown aside everytime you wanted to switch to your hands or mop rather than being on person at all times like the aforementioned tools.-In it's current build, there can be some texture tears in some levels such as above door ways in ""Evil Science"" but these are the exceptions rather than the norm.-When the bin is overloaded with objects, the physics can cause the objects to smash and bounce around each other impractically which can result in some objects actually popping outside the bin.--------------------------------------- Further Possible Improvements-Use of both hands when picking up small items, I can't tell you how tedious it gets when you're picking up the 15th bullet case in a level, one at a time, when you KNOW you have another hand free that can pick up another but instead it's just dangling in front of your face uselessly.The vendors that give you your buckets and bins has an in game script that drops giblets semi-randomly when you use them. Funny for the first few times. Not so after that, especially when you're trying to do your job quickly. If the script would just end after the first few times or have the option to turn off/on, would help eliminate this point of frustration.*Edit*Although frustrating and non-sensical, this is a feature to add more difficulty to the game apparently so probably won't be changed in future.-The sniffer works just fine as it is at the moment but if another icon could be added to show you the current position of the object its detecting in regards to your altitude that would really help out especially in hard to reach places so you don't end up spending significant time looking in the wrong place which can add to player frustration.I've come close to quitting a level because the sniffer was picking up a object/mess that i just could not find despite spending 10-20 minutes looking in the approximate area. Alternatively, have the sniffer react to where the camera cursor is pointing at so it bleeps faster as the player's cursor is getting closer to the object it's detecting. - Implementing another mode to the sniffer so dirty buckets and bins are seperate things to be detected-I like how they added the function of having to replace supplies in certain levels, this could be extended even further by maybe having to replace light sources as well? -Make the toilets flushable in ""Evil Science"" level! -Achievements-Add interactivity to the office door so it offers option to choose another level or exit to main menu.-----------------------------------------------------Reviewing this game was difficult since some of the points I raised, someone else may argue is what adds to the gameplay however as these are points that were reached only after extensive play throughs, I do feel they warrant some consideration.Overall though, I really like this game, there's a certain therapeutic feeling to cleaning all the muck and gunk that a level comes loaded with and you get a certain satisfaction when you feel you cleaned up a area nicely. Truly one of a kind game. Plays very well in its current build and with a few additions would make for a great game.Would currently highly recommend for those looking for something different.06.03.14 (MM/DD/YY)*Edit* 07.03.141. Changed point about the sniffer modes as the pinned thread explains the first two functions which i reprimanded2. After reading the pinned thread, seems the vendor special feature is an intentional feature not to be changed, previous point about vendor's changed to reflect that.			"

												An absolutly incredible simulation of cleaning chunks of man meat of off every surface in a map. But seriously, this game is very well made and has months worth of content. Be warned that if you like to sort and clean that you will spend lots of time in this game grabing every last box and stacking it neatly in the designated area before moving on. Only real downside ive ever encountered is spotty net code when playing with friends (IE: a bin full of body parts spazing out on the client side) For the price, this is one of the better co op games on steat that is ALSO just as much fun alone.85/100			"

								I have very mixed feelings about the viscera cleanup serise. I do love them, love the idea and the whacky gameplay, but there are a number of things that I would love to see added that would make this game top notch in my oppinion. First off, MATCHMAKING!!!!! please make that a thing! Also, a score system of some kind would be fantastic to give you some perspective on progression.			"

												THIS WAS ORIGINALLY a 'don't recommend' review. I am changing now the verdict (original review still below).Despite some small bugs, an horrible way to make a match (it is very difficult and many times you won't even understand why friends can't join you) and a bit of un-optimization in terms of graphics (too heavy for what it offers), I fell in love with the game.It is one of the best coop games out there, it can be REALLY funny....all the gags that happen while you clean or just your colleagues making jokes, and the feeling of teamwork....yes, you 'only' have to clean, but damn if there are good cleaners and bad cleaners....when the job is done right it's pure satisfaction. This is a try and love/hate game, you better give it a go if you can survive with some glitches. The game is very cheap anyway.One idea that I just got is that maybe the maps should be randomly changed: the corspes and blood stains are always in the same places, in would be cool to randomize that, that would give more replayability to the game, it is still fun to clean the same room multiple times though, with different partners.OLD REVIEW BELOW (it was a negative review). They didn't fix anything really of what I said, I just got around it or got used to it, and it was worth it anyway.-------------------------BEWARE!!!!I haven't tried this game while it was in early access. I bought it now that it has finally been released.To be honest the game is far from finished. The matchmaking is very complicated, even making a friend join your game is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There are no dedicated servers, that means someone around you has to have started a game as a host, and you 'should' be able to see him in the server list. Sometimes there are, many many times there isn't anyone hosting.I hosted a game a couple times and nobody ever joined.This is a network detail.....the game is super fun and with friends is a killer. It runs also quite well although it is not perfectly optimized (getting framerate drops for no reason) and there are still some glitches (limbs inserted in trash bins will clip inside each other and flying all over the room when they glitch out, walking stutters when playing online).That means: beware, I don't think the game is really finished yet, I tried to play it online and have fun with it for the past 3 days but nope, there was always some problem. Playing alone is absolutely no problem, but that destroys the purpose of this game.I will absolutely change this review as soon as they fix what is to be fixed and make the matchmaking a bit better....the game would be really fun if it were possible to just connect to someone and play without problems.

												I like to play this game when I want to unwind and relax. Play some music in the background and get to cleaning. The neat thing about this game is that you get all the good feelings that you get after cleaning without all the exhaustion and worrying that someone is just going to get it messy again. This game isn't for everyone but if you need a break from the stress that life or even other video games give you, I definitely recommend this game. "

												This game was one of those games I bought with spare money. I've gotta say, I'm glad I did. In Viscera Cleanup Detail, it is the janitors job (and therefore your job) to clean up after a horrific sci-fi massacre. The game has several mechanics that can be hard to grasp for beginners, beause there is no real tutorial level. (There is however, a downloadable tutorial level on the worksohp) When you are playing alone, it can be a bit dreary, but not exactly hard. The real fun in this game is working with others, with accidents to be had, and new strategies to cleanup levels with increasing size/ decreasing gravity.   (it is a space game afteral). Even if your friends don't own the game it is still just a good game to converse over. With that being said, I reccomend this game			"

								This game is magnificent! It truly covers a new design of fun, and patience. This game gets constant updates and features, so many that I always check it each month just to see the new levels, animations, or items they have added. I have a few recommendations for it though as it seems they have still a few problems. They should add a crouch button, and make it so buckets stack better. Because it seems like they keep adding updates which is nice but! There is still quite a few small bugs that make the game unable to get the full experience for. So I think they should fix the bugs before they add new and improved levels. Also this game definitely needs a workshop or a place to download mods. Other than some of the problems I'd say this game is pretty nice and gives people a calm feeling. I give it 8/10 - Extremely nice simple game, very good.			"

								I picked this one up while smiling at its wildly grotesque propositon, and low price tag. I thought I would just try it for 30 mins and then toss it aside as another indie novelty. Well, not so fast!There's something inexplicably entertaining... almost therapeutic... about restoring order to the gruesome chaos in each scenario. You will feel ridiculous as you play it, yet it's hard to let go once you get going.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it is to mentally try to reconstruct what the heck happened at each room, while wondering if the situation is *really* over. The game will play with you and keep things tense from that perspective.The game also seems to draw inspiration from games like Portal 2 in terms of how it provides hints to who the main character is, and other characters like (Head)Bob.I haven't tried multiplayer, but it should be fun, with people stumbling at each others buckets and making a big mess, etc.If you like games like ""Papers, Please"", you should try this one.

								This is what I mean by retro gaming. Great graphics (because as far as I remember all 25 years back, every game was squeezing every frame from every computer since ever), decent sound and sh*tload of originality and fun. The game might be repetitive, until you trip over bucket full of blood and spill it on already cleaned floor. Then it immediatelly turns into a rage. Atmosphere is great. Whenever I play, this game makes me think about what the hell has happened here.The downside: I figured out that my whole life I was working towards wrong career. Where's the spaceship to clean? My mop is wet.Take this, 'Call of Whatever': 10/10			"

By the time I finally pried myself away from the game to actually pursue my education career, we had all gathered a small audience of people, standing around, watching us pretend to be space janitors.This game was worth every penny, and I'm excited to see the final product.  If you have even the slightest interest in it, buy it now!			"

								This is what I mean by retro gaming. Great graphics (because as far as I remember all 25 years back, every game was squeezing every frame from every computer since ever), decent sound and sh*tload of originality and fun. The game might be repetitive, until you trip over bucket full of blood and spill it on already cleaned floor. Then it immediatelly turns into a rage. Atmosphere is great. Whenever I play, this game makes me think about what the hell has happened here.The downside: I figured out that my whole life I was working towards wrong career. Where's the spaceship to clean? My mop is wet.Take this, 'Call of Whatever': 10/10			"

								As a child i would dream of being a space janitor and with the unveil of Viscera Cleanup Deatail now I can and you can too!!!!This game is a hell of alot of fun and im suprised to the average eye it looks boring and stupid but NOOOO dear reader it's not and i'll tell  you why.-Interesting maps and content and soon to be more-For an early access game i've reached few bugs in gameplay sure a few here and there but nothing bad -Constant challenges and obsticales to face and overcome giving the game a neverending feeling -YOU DONT HAVE TO CLEAN!!!! If you want you can just trash the place even more its up to you -No real story and no guidelines giving youtota freedom I sincerely hope you buy this game its alot of fun i promiseHappy Cleaning :)			"

								Filled a box with bullet cases, forgot about the box, knocked over the box with said bullet cases rolling through huge piles of blood and spines. Picked up all the bullet cases, treading bloody footsteps everywhere. This was when i realised that i was making more of a mess, and Viscera Cleanup Detail is a very strategic cleaning simulator. When I see this job advertised in my local newspaper, i won't hesitate to apply. 10/10... but don't bring your friends or you'll never get the job done.			"

								Relaxing fun! This game is so original its crazy. tons of levels with different themes, and 2 free DLC's! and multiplayer is a big plus. The game runs and looks great. if your tired of the same old games, buy this! Dont think you can spend 10 minutes and have a room 100% clean, this game requires hours to clean rooms, but thats they way it should be. It's fun deciding how your going to clean a room.  This game is the exact opposite of action packed games, and I think more and more people are getting sick of those action packed games, this really does offer a good change. Pick it up and have some fun. don't knock over bloody mop buckets. 9.5/10 game.UPDATE: They added a server browser! makes the multiplayer even better!			"

Clean workplace is a happy workplace.On the other, it's going to take you HOURS to do this alone. And if you finish it, but miss like one thing, you will kill yourself.But hey, this game is fantastic.

								This game is super fun. Its essentially cleaning up after the hero of some space survival thriller who was on easy and destroyed everything and left a bunch of explosions and fires and dead monster bodies and lab technitian parts.  You get unlimited water buckets, lights, wet floor signs, trash cans and one large awkward to carry trunk for big parts.It takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours to clean some of these maps. The game has a lot of focus on comedic blunderings of lab technitians and the sort who foolishly wander alone in the domain of mighty creatures. You will find their journals of their foolishness..4.7/5     only thing it's missing is the ability to chop up massive parts of body parts. I have seen videos of a Pizza Cutter to cut up big parts but now its not in the game? not sure...TLDR: Mop up blood that master chief left behind 4.7/5			"

												This game was one of those games I bought with spare money. I've gotta say, I'm glad I did. In Viscera Cleanup Detail, it is the janitors job (and therefore your job) to clean up after a horrific sci-fi massacre. The game has several mechanics that can be hard to grasp for beginners, beause there is no real tutorial level. (There is however, a downloadable tutorial level on the worksohp) When you are playing alone, it can be a bit dreary, but not exactly hard. The real fun in this game is working with others, with accidents to be had, and new strategies to cleanup levels with increasing size/ decreasing gravity.   (it is a space game afteral). Even if your friends don't own the game it is still just a good game to converse over. With that being said, I reccomend this game			"

The neat thing about this game is that you get all the good feelings that you get after cleaning without all the exhaustion and worrying that someone is just going to get it messy again. This game isn't for everyone but if you need a break from the stress that life or even other video games give you, I definitely recommend this game. "

												In this game you play as Roger WIlco, janitor sub-extrodinair. Wait thats from a different game? oh your right, well scratch what i just said.Well in this game the main objective is to clean, clean everything, and not leave a single place spotless or someone manages to die in the news or sometimes smuggle crack in a bullet hole. When you do actually make the place ""spotless"" and your , i mean nose-radar does not pick anything up. There almost always is still something you missed, yet this game is surprisingly entertaining, for  a game when the main objective is cleaning.Something quite intresting about this game is that almost every map has a hidden back story. You can pick up notes and tablets that talk about what happened to the facility, that is always quite cool, and it is something that maps each map unique.Overall i do recommend this game, and i recommend it even more if you have friends. This game in my opinion is a 8/10 [some how im entertained by this, buy idk].			"

								Somebody has to clean after Isaac, Shepard and those pesky mutated plants. As a space janitor you clean up after the action has all passed. It's hard work, but sometimes the hero leaves behind a gun or a datapad for you to... ""salvage"".I don't have many hours in. I've completed one (1) job completely. After you've mopped all the floors you glance up and discover yet another body you need to haul down... and mop the floor again. Funny how funny this game really is. Can't wait for a ""career"" mode and persistent saves. 10/10 would mop again. :)			"

								Never before in a game have I been so satisfied to clean up a mess, rather than make one. The physics aspect of the game can betray you more often than you'd like. For example, if you knock over a used mop bucket, it pours whatever you were cleaning up all over the floor.  However, overall the concept of Viscera Cleanup Detail is a very unique take on the physics sandbox genre.  One that I think I'll enjoy for some time.A review wouldn't be a review without at least one negative point, and from the time that I've played thus far (Admittedly that isn't long, though I do plan to sink some more time into this today and in days to come) I do have a few.The bloom lighting, while beautiful, looks a bit off at times, and can be excessively used in certain areas of some of the game.There's a real lack of ambient audio, and given that you're the only (living) person on the station, it'd be nice to have something to listen to while you're toiling away.Okay, so only two negative things that I can think of off the top of my head.  All in all, VCD is a greatly underrated game in my opinion, and at the time of writing this review, it is currently on sale for less than 5 dollars, every penny of which I feel it is worth.I hope you've found my review to be helpful. I don't often feel compelled enough to write one, but I think that this game gets a lot more negative comments than it deserves.			"

								This game is super fun. Its essentially cleaning up after the hero of some space survival thriller who was on easy and destroyed everything and left a bunch of explosions and fires and dead monster bodies and lab technitian parts.  You get unlimited water buckets, lights, wet floor signs, trash cans and one large awkward to carry trunk for big parts.It takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours to clean some of these maps. The game has a lot of focus on comedic blunderings of lab technitians and the sort who foolishly wander alone in the domain of mighty creatures. You will find their journals of their foolishness..4.7/5     only thing it's missing is the ability to chop up massive parts of body parts. I have seen videos of a Pizza Cutter to cut up big parts but now its not in the game? not sure...TLDR: Mop up blood that master chief left behind 4.7/5			"

								For being a job simulator of what a janitor would have to do after the events of Doom, Quake, and similar games, it's surprisingly fun! A bit tricky to figure out at first (Similiar to Minecraft), once you get the hang of it it becomes an interesting challenge to see how good of a job you can do cleaning up all the entrails and splatters that mar the environment. You do get penalized for failing to do certain things, like get all the bullet holes cleaned up, forgetting to closer the incinerator, and failing to stack barrels upright properly, as evidenced in the office and the various reports you discover tacked around on the walls after you clock out, so you need to learn lessons from those to avoid tripping somone with a barrel in the future. There is a decent amount of different anvironments/maps to choose from, even though it's still in development, and you do have to think a bit about how to get to certain messes and clean them up properly. Considering logistical planning for how to distribute buckets and biohazard bins is a mildly important element to make cleanup more complete and efficient. While played alone it's quite boring, playing with friends make it much more interesting. Cooperating with them, keeping in good communication about what you're all planning to do (who's mopping floors, who's refilling medkits, bringing fresh buckets etc) is an important element.

								This game is not where you just clean! This is where you put your blood (and others) into your work. You are put to the ultimate test of eye smashing skill! You don't just clean! You DISPOSE! You MOP! You LOOFA! This is a game for kids. But, only if your kids are STRONG ENOUGH to endure the hardships of manual labor. The story is heartwarming and beautiful. Crysis graphics and a brilliant love story written by George R. R. Martin! Friends, Family, COMRADES! GRAB YOUR MOPS! COME FIGHT THIS EVIL TERROR OF DUST AND GRIME! ONLY THE CLEAN WILL SURVIVE! GET THIS GAME!			"

												Don't let the concept fool you. This game is a messy clean up game in which all you do is clean up a horrific scenario with very many tools. I better make sure that there is something amazingly satisfying about completing such a simple task over a long period of time. Each map can take up to 1-6 hours and personally I tend to enjoy listening to music and videos whilst playing.Recommended. Friends are good to annoy on this. Also its great to listen to you favourite media while playing.			"

								What can be said about this game?You put the body bits, in the body bins (Bodies sold seperately).You take the body bladders and if your bucket is soaked full of blood, drop it in a body bucket.

												Clearly I'm not the only one who, whilst killing space marines in an off-earth mining facility as an insectoid alien, wondered who was going to clean up the mess. With this game, it's you. Move over, space marines, and let the space janitor through.It's a strange game, for sure. The gameplay and atmosphere remind me a bit of Portal, and vaguely of Surgeon Simulator. The game is exactly what it says on the tin- you run around with a mop and bucket, cleaning up after various sci-fi disasters. The goal is to take the warzone and make it good as new by mopping up and incinerating all evidence, and tidying up what's left. It can be somewhat repetitive and sometimes frustrating, but it's more about the big picture than instant gratification, and various levels do come with their own unique challenges. Overall, it's great zen game for obsessive compulsives like me who get a huge sense of satisfaction from setting things right. I'm very much enjoying myself.Unfortunately, it does make me motion sick, so if you're prone to motion sickness like I am, maybe just be aware of that. It does give you the option of changing the FOV, though, which goes a long way to improving the experience!			"

								I have to admit, I was a little hesitant before picking up this game.  That said, I'm glad I did.  Believe it or not this game will bring you hours and hours of joy (and a little frustration).  You've been there obliterating aliens in games like Doom 3, Unreal, and Half-Life but you never did think about the aftermath, did you?  Do you think people just abandoned those facilities forever?  Heck no!  They went back and cleaned up the mess, and that's what Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about.  Your weap... Errr... Tools?  Well, you have a space-aged mop, a sniffer (to check cleanliness), and your own bare hands.  You also get a bucket (+ refill machine), biohazard container (+ refill machine), and an incinerator to toss all your junk into.  Think it's easy?  Pfft!  Half the mess you clean up is made by knocking over your cleaning supplies.  *facepalm*  Trust me, this game is hours of fun, and the multiplayer (depending on your friends) reaches levels of absolute hilarity!  I definately recommend this game!			"

Clean workplace is a happy workplace.On the other, it's going to take you HOURS to do this alone. And if you finish it, but miss like one thing, you will kill yourself.But hey, this game is fantastic.

												The entire incredibly boring game consists of 20 steps:1. Go to a machine for a bin2. Carry bin to a place with junk and body parts3. Painstakingly pick up each piece of crap and place it in the bin one by one4. Carefully carry the bin to the incinerator, stopping to pick up crap that rattled out along the way5. Place in incinerator6. Repeat steps 1 through 5 about 20 times until you've picked up everything7. Go to a machine for a bucket of water8. Place bucket near blood and grime9. Equip your mop10. Stab the water in the bucket, being careful not to knock it over11. Stab the stains on the wall and floor 5 times until your mop is dirty12. Repeat steps 10 and 11 about 6 times until the water is too dirty13. Carry the bucket to the incinerator14. Repeat steps 7 through 13 about 50 times - more if you knocked any buckets over15. Realise that you just spent an hour cleaning and your house is exactly the same as before you started16. Exit the game17. Uninstall the game18. Go to the kitchen19. Grab a bucket and fill it with water20. Clean your actual damn houseI played half a mission, got bored and quit. I'm completely uninterested in seeing what it's like to finish a mission. I have my own house to clean and when I do that, I actually get to live in it.			"

								A nice as it seems, Viscera Cleanup Detail is a game that generates a fresh idea, but falls short early in play. The idea of cleaning in a game to me sounded pretty boring, but since the game was on sale, I decided to buy it and in the first 30 minutes of play, I enjoyed the game very much, but in the final 30 minutes of play, the novelty wore off and everything I was doing just felt boring and I didn't feel any enjoyment from playing. Viscera Cleanup Detail is a nice idea, but the developers need to think of new ways to keep the player interested. If you want to buy Viscera Cleanup Detail, I would wait till the price decreases in a sale, that way you won't feel as much regret from buying it.4/10 - Overall, good concept, but the game needs a lot more work to keep the player interested in playing.

								I assumed the janitor part was a lead in to the game, but after a bit of exploration...no you are there to clean up....and its boring really fast. Theres just no real gameplay here in my opinion (which is the only opinion that matters for this review as its my review)There isnt even a scoring system to see how well you cleaned, its like someone looked at the job of a cleaner and made a ""game"" of it.Thank god it was on sale (and i still feel i wasted my money)No idea why it got so many positive reviews			"

												I thought this game would be interesting, despite my general avoidance of simulators. Why the hell I thought a CLEANING simulator would be any better is beyond my own comprehension. There is no progression, nothing to get, the most you can do is put stuff in a trunk and take it back to your office. It's funny to read a few notes after some jobs (so you got cut in half tripping over a barrel that was turned over when I got there?), but this game is so stale after a while. There is nothing to reward you for doing stuff. Your better off cleaning in real life, because at least THAT has a reward. Maybe if they addded some incentives to the game, it might last a few hours longer, but not in it's current state.			"

												A game which is literally just about cleaning areas that are filled with blood, body parts and trash. While it may not sound fun, it is incredibly satisfying to see a dirty room become sparkling clean again. After a few hours of cleaning everything and fighting the physics, you're finally ready to clock out and see what kind of rating you got. The only problem? After spending two hours with a friend cleaning up a one hour map, checking and rechecking everything, what's the rating you get? 68 % cleaned. Oh yeah, and you're fired. This kind of slap in the face completely kills any satisfaction you might have received from the cleaning itself. It's not relaxing. It's not satisfying. You only get frustrated because no matter what you do, there will always be something that you missed, even though you can't even see it. It is impossible to get a perfect rating. If you don't care about being scolded for performing poorly after being very proud of doing a good job, don't hesitate to buy this game. But if you do care about that, then I would not recommend this game.			"

												I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews. This is a work simulator. It's tedious and boring, with no reward apart from possibly feeling ""satisfied"" with making something clean which was dirty. I bought through Humble website, so I can't get a refund.Some people talk about ""Zen-like"" experience... Possibly. For some people, depending on their circumstances, it could have a Zen-like quality to it. Don't be fooled. You make stuff clean which was dirty. With a mop. And a bucket. That is all.tl;dr SWIM would say ONLY if you're stoned with a stoned friend, would this be actual FUN. Much the same as being stoned with friends is fun anyway, regardless of what you're up to. Don't do drugs.			"

								The idea is good - the execution with the code is not.This game feels and looks as though it was programmed back when Quake 1 was released, so in that respect this game does a good job of going back to the era. Unfortuntely, I've come to expect more from code since then, and so this game is humorous and a fun trip down memory lane for about 15 minutes before going back to the games of today's era.			"

The ragdoll physics and hilariously over-emphasized sound effects. And later on with the spin-off release of VCD: Santa's Rampage, we were introduced to co-op! That is where this game shines best. Alone, admittedly it can get a bit boring. But with others, hilarity WILL ensue. It's just a very chill game.

								Probably the best way to discribe this game is to call it a parody, or even better irony in its purest form. Actually I wanted to spend this Saturday to clean up around here and now I find myself playing this clean-up-simulator next to empty bottles, a dirty plate and dust. A lot of dust. That is what I call irony.Anyway, about this game:You are a janitor which job it is to clean up a mess in a space-station caused by one of various reasons. Wheter a virus turns half the crew into zombies, the ship is invaded by aliens or some other reason you can think of, if you watched a lot of spacemarine-ish movies.Basically, it is really simple you can either do your job as you are supposed to do or you just screw around with the equippement you have. Either collect all the body parts or play basketball with them. Scrub away all the blood or splash it against the wall to make some bloody good art.There is no real goal in this game, not even a rating in the classic way. You can end your work at any given time when you activate a control panel at the station. This teleports you back in your janitor-room and some pieces of paper scattered around in that room will tell you if you did a good job or not. The biggest complaint I have about this game is pretty much that it throws you in, without telling you anything you are able to do. I mean, I know it is a game which only rule is, that it has no rules, but i would really like to know what my character is able to do. You really have to find out everything yourself from scratch, some people might like that but a bit assitance in that case would be welcome.For example, your mainweapon the scrubber tool. It turns bloody red after a few swipes over the dirty floor and in that state, instead of cleaning you just smear the blood around. Alright, you will think. The scrubber needs a cleaning itself. But how? Bashing it around with the secondary move does nothing but make the mess even bigger. Eventually you will find a waterbowl-dispenser and get the idea. Dip it in and *bling* as good as new. Now the real cleaning can begin. You carry that bowl with you, put it down, dip the scrubber in clean up, rinse and repeat.Now you will notice other things like body parts will never stop producing blood when coming in contact with anything so you need to find a way to dispose them. Or the water in your bowl starts turning red, and it won't clean your scrubber after dipping it in. Or what in the name of Odin is this device on your 3rd slot that keeps on beeping whatever you are doing?Things like these made this game a bit more frustrating than it had to be. I really like to see a creative tutorial for this game, just like in Surgeon Simulator 2013 which has shown you how to actually beat the next operation by putting a floppy-disc in the computer.All in all:It is a game to waste your time. If you have nothing better to do, you can play this. It can be really atmospheric from time to time, when you look around at the mangled corpses, blood on the wall that reads ""HELP"" or ""DOOMED"". It is still in alpha so I look forward to updates. The price was a bit too much.I give this game a total of 6 out of 10 Karmapoints, marking it as ""Check it out when you have over 40 bucks on your Steam-account left anyway"" "

												Apparently I don't ""get it"".  This thing has huge numbers of upvotes and I just don't understand why.  Watch the video.  That really is the entire game right there.  You pick stuff up, you throw it away, you mop.  Rinse, repeat.  For hours.  I played through the entire ""Waste Disposal"" level just to see if I was missing something.  I got to 94% clean, and got a crap report saying I did horribly.  Reloaded a save, got the remaining 6%, and got an ""employee of the month"" placard.  That was it.  Absolutely did NOT enjoy the game.  I suppose if you're an ocd completionist that can find enjoyment in this kind of thing, more poer to ya.  Give this game a shot.  But I just don't see how this game has the huge ratings it has now.  It's just *boring*.			"

Early Access Review
								I figured a game about cleaning up after heroes would be kind of relaxing. You know, you get to see what happened after they saved the world and play your own small part in humanity's salvation. Unfortunately, that's not what this game is. What this game is, is incredibly stressful. I admit, I didn't play it very long. I didn't give it a very fair chance. But that's because, in the first however many minutes I played, I had to replace my mop bucket ten times. Every third mop bucket I got from the mop bucket machine, three more new pieces of gore were pumped out, splashing blood all over the place I just cleaned and giving me more stuff to dump into the incinerator. ... Why? What is the point of that? Furthermore, the controls are non-intuitive and over-sensitive. Good luck getting that torso into the incinerator without splashing gore all over the place. This is less of a game and more of a chore. If I want to get stressed over cleaning up, I might as well, you know, actually clean up. I will be seeking a refund.			"

								My wife and I got this to play with each other.  At first it seemed like it might be as much silly fun as it looked... but then we realized just how buggy the multiplayer was, and how unbelievable jittery the controls were.  We tried for about an hour to get the hang of it anyway, but it started to make us both feel nauseous.  The combination of free-floating camera and extreme focus on your own movement just somehow triggers it.  So, I guess it's not the game for us, and we refunded it.			"

												A game which is literally just about cleaning areas that are filled with blood, body parts and trash. While it may not sound fun, it is incredibly satisfying to see a dirty room become sparkling clean again. After a few hours of cleaning everything and fighting the physics, you're finally ready to clock out and see what kind of rating you got. The only problem? After spending two hours with a friend cleaning up a one hour map, checking and rechecking everything, what's the rating you get? 68 % cleaned. Oh yeah, and you're fired. This kind of slap in the face completely kills any satisfaction you might have received from the cleaning itself. It's not relaxing. It's not satisfying. You only get frustrated because no matter what you do, there will always be something that you missed, even though you can't even see it. It is impossible to get a perfect rating. If you don't care about being scolded for performing poorly after being very proud of doing a good job, don't hesitate to buy this game. But if you do care about that, then I would not recommend this game.			"

								This game is a unique experience like nothing you have played before. The enticing graphics and the goofy physics will bring you hours of hilarity, add a fun/humor multiplier by having your buddies help outThe team work as well as the moments you burn something you shouldn't or spilling each others blood buckets really is a riot.I would not reccomend this for single player, you could have fun exploring but the sheer amount to do to finish the level does indeed turn it into work.I hope this game keeps the silly physics and comical atmosphere and expands upon it. I've had numerous laughing fits so far and look forward to morei'm going to give this an 8/10, 9/10 later if they continuously add more maps/new features			"

								I like this genre of really impressive games that are fun for a couple hours (like Goat Simulator).  This game is tedious and not for everyone, but therein lies the hilarity.  You'll want to play the Shadow Warrior version in here, because your character actually talks!Be warned that it really, really is just a cleaning game.  You might think ""I found a laser!  Maybe I'll have to defend myself against aliens!""  Nope.  ""This station is infected, but apparently there's a cure somewhere?""  Yeah, that's what the guy who made the mess found.  It really is just cleaning (and making a horrible mess and screwing with physics and admiring all the REALLY detailed maps).			"

								Before you automatically think "" oh wow a cleaning game - what fun!"", keep in mind many games are fun that you wouldnt think would be. This game is surprisingly fun as you get a sense of achievement at cleaning each small section on the 7 maps that are surprisingly well detailed and quite large. There are a few  things you need to be careful doing such as when filling a box up of cartridge shells then doing a Fallout like thing and knocking it everywhere by walking into it but it is a genuinely fun game and for those who like films such as Aliens you will be thinking ""damn what happened here and...wait a minute....how did that guy get up there!?!""8/10			"

Early Access Review
								This game has been out for over a year and there are still way too many bugs.-Objects move on their own--sometimes they fly. -You'll get stuck in objects and sometimes the only way to get out is to restart the game. -The game will get so laggy that it'll crash your computer.-You can tip over something without even being near it.-Sometimes it takes countless times to pick something up. -You'll literally get stuck in nothing. -When you first start the game, you'll have to do a lot of changing in the settings. The turn speed will be way too fast/slow, the sensitivity was way too high, the mouse speed will have to change, and there'll have to be a few changes to adjust the graphics to your liking. I literally spent 15 minutes changing the settings. Fortunately for the game's creators, the game does have some pros:-The game IS fun when you ignore the bugs. You can spend a couple hours on just one map--more if you like fooling around.-Each map has its own story to tell and many fun things to interact with.-You can play with body parts. ( That sounded less creepy in my head. )And that's all the pros i can really think of. If the pros outweighed the cons, I'd recommend this game. Unfortunately, not many gamers will pay $10.00 for a game that makes you spend more time screaming in frustration at the bugs than the game. Hope this review helped.			"

								I got the Shadow Warrior version of this for free and had no idea what it was at first. I played it and absolutely loved it. Then I immediately bought the Santas Rampage version and knocked out all of the achievements for that one and enjoyed that as well. THEN I saw this on early access and was like F%$K YEAH DUDE!!!! This is only early access but there are like 6 levels and Im guessing each could take possibly a couple hours to finish. I will try not to play them until achievements are added just to keep it fresh but from loading up the first level and checking it out I know for sure I am going to enjoy this one MORE then the other two. Do yourself a favor and just buy this game, you wont be dissapointed. 10/10TLDR: Buy this game, its good clean fun (hurr hurr hurr)			"

								I'm a huge fan of silly games. I also have a deep love for mindless, repetitive actions which are time-consuming and entertaining at the same. This is the game that happens to fit those requirements just right.During my first play I found the game rather clever and definitely amusing, but once you clean the first entire level and get that oh-so-sweet sense of 'I did it how the heck did I manage all that' you look at the other levels and frankly think 'oh god no thank you'. But then I went to bed and didn't stop thinking about it until I started dreaming about cleaning. It's addictive. Really, really, addictive. There's something magical about collecting tens of buckets of bloody water and boxes of body parts before gleefully incinerating them all as the facility creaks and groans ominously around you. My bedroom is a bombsite and cleaning makes me wince, but this game does nothing but make me smile and rage as yet another box of arms capsizes and leaves blood everywhere.			"

								I really enjoyed this game, not only because it's an interesting concept, but because it's genuinely entertaining, it's kind of quaint really, something most people wouldn't consider to be interesting. If there is anything bad I can say, it's that the game needs a progression system, and more tools, at the moment it's like a crappy retail store where MOP CLEANS EVERYTHING! To give you a little on the premise, it's basically that Quake 1-4 rolled through a space station, graphic'd up, and then you have to come in and clean up.Dead Space+Quake+Blue Collar Work= Viscera Cleanup Detail.

								Its a no-brainer game, but if your not paying attention you can make a bigger mess than what your cleaning up (ie knocking over your mop bucket full of blood and slime. Or worse, tipping over a crate of body parts and have them roll all over the room leaving a huge bloody mess). Ive seen some youtube videos of people linking up and playing together, sadly theres no servers, just direct IP linking to your friend. Streamlined multiplayer would make this extremely entertaining. None the less, still a fun game, in my opinion, worth the 8$ price.			"

								I'll start this off by saying, I've had this game pre-ordered for months, long before the spin-off games were produced. I was still messing around with some of the earliest alpha phases of this game. I've been a long-time fan since then and can't wait to see how it progresses.This game is deceptively hard. At first you think it's more or less easy to clean things up, but no. No, there is always a spot you've missed or can't quite reach (due to glitches generally given the development stage). Pick up the trash. Pick up the gore. Wipe up blood. Throw stuff in the incinerator. Patch bullet holes, etc. (The bullet holes are the worst because then you have to wipe down the ♥♥♥♥ing ashes which takes forever and the laser goes all over the place if you aren't careful.) If you drop the gore bits, then they'll splash blood everywhere and if you step in blood, you'll track it for ages until you manage to get it off your shoes. Very thorough. The dispensers for water buckets and waste containers used to have a chance to spit random gore at you, but I don't know if that's removed. It was one of the most frustrating parts of cleaning and I kind of wanted to know how on earth it got IN THE MACHINE in the first place.Despite all of this and how it seems like an enormous chore, I keep playing. For some reason, it's fun and relaxing to mindlessly clean a gore-splattered space station. It was more frustrating before they added the save feature, which was nice. Now I don't have to worry about sitting down for two hours to attempt to meticulously clean one blasted room. Somehow, it's self-rewarding to slowly clean up the maps. No need for achievements or anything, just a nice clean space with a feeling of accomplishment.There are also periodically hints of what happened in the space station story-wise, but that's not terribly fleshed out, not yet anyway.It's such an odd concept to be a janitor that cleans up after who knows what, but I love it.This review isn't entirely fair as it's more of a progress monitoring at this stage. When the game is properly release-ready, then this will update to a more formal review.			"

								Best janitor simulator of 2014. 8/10 quality game.(In all seriousness it's pretty fun. Frustrating that the machines randomly spit out giblets every so often, and the game lacks some variety but other than that it's still a fun little game. There's something fascinating about taking a horrible slaughterhouse and restoring it back to a laboratory by hand.)			"

								I got the Shadow Warrior version of this for free and had no idea what it was at first. I played it and absolutely loved it. Then I immediately bought the Santas Rampage version and knocked out all of the achievements for that one and enjoyed that as well. THEN I saw this on early access and was like F%$K YEAH DUDE!!!! This is only early access but there are like 6 levels and Im guessing each could take possibly a couple hours to finish. I will try not to play them until achievements are added just to keep it fresh but from loading up the first level and checking it out I know for sure I am going to enjoy this one MORE then the other two. Do yourself a favor and just buy this game, you wont be dissapointed. 10/10TLDR: Buy this game, its good clean fun (hurr hurr hurr)			"

								I'm a huge fan of silly games. I also have a deep love for mindless, repetitive actions which are time-consuming and entertaining at the same. This is the game that happens to fit those requirements just right.During my first play I found the game rather clever and definitely amusing, but once you clean the first entire level and get that oh-so-sweet sense of 'I did it how the heck did I manage all that' you look at the other levels and frankly think 'oh god no thank you'. But then I went to bed and didn't stop thinking about it until I started dreaming about cleaning. It's addictive. Really, really, addictive. There's something magical about collecting tens of buckets of bloody water and boxes of body parts before gleefully incinerating them all as the facility creaks and groans ominously around you. My bedroom is a bombsite and cleaning makes me wince, but this game does nothing but make me smile and rage as yet another box of arms capsizes and leaves blood everywhere.			"

								I really enjoyed this game, not only because it's an interesting concept, but because it's genuinely entertaining, it's kind of quaint really, something most people wouldn't consider to be interesting. If there is anything bad I can say, it's that the game needs a progression system, and more tools, at the moment it's like a crappy retail store where MOP CLEANS EVERYTHING! To give you a little on the premise, it's basically that Quake 1-4 rolled through a space station, graphic'd up, and then you have to come in and clean up.Dead Space+Quake+Blue Collar Work= Viscera Cleanup Detail.

								Its a no-brainer game, but if your not paying attention you can make a bigger mess than what your cleaning up (ie knocking over your mop bucket full of blood and slime. Or worse, tipping over a crate of body parts and have them roll all over the room leaving a huge bloody mess). Ive seen some youtube videos of people linking up and playing together, sadly theres no servers, just direct IP linking to your friend. Streamlined multiplayer would make this extremely entertaining. None the less, still a fun game, in my opinion, worth the 8$ price.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail doesn't connect to anyone, and no servers appear, even when one is right there. I can't connect to a game directly through Steam which if pretty dumb, but the friends on my list don't even show up on the servers to join ""Like they should"" Reading a bit online this has been an issue for well over two years. I disabled all my firewalls and shields and anti-maleware and anti-virus systems to try and connect to a single computer anywhere in the world. Nothing. The only thing I haven't tried was one suggestion saying I should redirect ports and crap directly through Steam and screw that. If other games like Battleblock theater or Borderlands connect me to my friends with ease then this should be the same. The fact that this multiplayer game won't let me connect means there's literally no playing value for me.			"

												This game is incredibly addictive for some reason! All you do is mop floors and toss out the garbage then burn it buts its incredibly satisfying. Havent completed one level yet since they take so long but gameplay is very smooth theres little to no glitches, game freezes or other bugs. I think its another one thats geared toward online play but I wont be touching that option since multiplayer servers are full of trolls who make their own rule ""n00bs"" must live by in other words school yard type bullying, but at least this game has a single player option you could never get bored with.

								This game has been out for over a year and there are still way too many bugs.-Objects move on their own--sometimes they fly. -You'll get stuck in objects and sometimes the only way to get out is to restart the game. -The game will get so laggy that it'll crash your computer.-You can tip over something without even being near it.-Sometimes it takes countless times to pick something up. -You'll literally get stuck in nothing. -When you first start the game, you'll have to do a lot of changing in the settings. The turn speed will be way too fast/slow, the sensitivity was way too high, the mouse speed will have to change, and there'll have to be a few changes to adjust the graphics to your liking. I literally spent 15 minutes changing the settings. Fortunately for the game's creators, the game does have some pros:-The game IS fun when you ignore the bugs. You can spend a couple hours on just one map--more if you like fooling around.-Each map has its own story to tell and many fun things to interact with.-You can play with body parts. ( That sounded less creepy in my head. )And that's all the pros i can really think of. If the pros outweighed the cons, I'd recommend this game. Unfortunately, not many gamers will pay $10.00 for a game that makes you spend more time screaming in frustration at the bugs than the game. Hope this review helped.			"

Let's just get into pros and cons.Pros:-The game is creative and unique-There's a lot of customizability, different modes and levels.Cons:- The physics are janky as hell. It took me like almost 5 minutes to turn off the music player when I couldn't hear the beeping from the tracker.- The game likes to punish you when you accidentally spill a bucket (and trust me, you will) by occasionally plopping out viscera instead of a bucket when you go to get another from the machine. You also make footprints every time you step in something, there's a gun you can equip in the first level that if you accidentally fire, makes even more of a mess with charring all over the walls.-The game doesn't have a tutorial, so I ended up knocking all over♥♥♥♥♥♥(including empty buckets) trying to pick up a bucket. When you go to clean the mop, there's a command mapped to the right mouse button that jabs with the bucket (often resulting in a dropped bucket that leaves blood all over the place) Like, how was I supposed to know once a bucket is full I'm supposed to put it in the incenerator?-Speaking of the incenerator, sometimes the viscera and dead bodies don't despawn in it and I spent a whole hour neglecting it until towards the end.-There's an elevator thingy that occasionally jams, sends you in the air, or falls over and sends you in some random direction and other such nonsense-Occasionally when I try to get a bucket out of the machine, it gets stuck in the collision and flings out spilling on the floor. To add insult, the afforementioned viscera-instead-of-bucket♥♥♥♥♥♥can happen right after.-I spent two hours playing the game and at the end I got demoted for not knowing what I was doing because the game never told me how to play the game or gave me any indication when I'd be done.- You accidentally grab other things instead of the thing you want because everything is so poorly modeled-Did I mention the game looks like Postal 2 and was released LATE 2015?! I know that graphics aren't everything, but it looks so drab and uninteresting. It wouldn't be a flaw at all if it didn't come with plagues of gameplay problems.-My mouse once got stuck on the menu and I was forced to use my keyboard and gamepad to get out. If I hadn't had a controller plugged in, I would have had to ctrl+tab to get out.- The game took a bajillion years to get installed with it's 2 gb and million loading screens before the first initial playthrough-The command prompt for the game is by default mapped next to the mop buttontl;dr While a fun idea and neat concept, it has a terrible execution with frustrating gameplay, horrible optimization and bugs and glitches galore. Don't even bother getting the game on sale. It's not even worth that.			"

								Ever play a sci-fi horror game and think to yourself ""Glad I'm not the one who has to clean up this mess""?Well guess what buddy, now it's your turn.    I'm well aware this game is still a work in progress (at the time of this review) But I am already impressed by the quality of this game. Rich, Detailed enviroments just make this game all the better and is proof that everything is better in space.			"

												I feel like there was a bit of a missed opportunity here to implement a more substantial overall progression, like getting upgrades for your mop or finding temporary supercleaning powerups or something to break up the monotony. At the same time though, I can see how that might go against the design philosophy. It really is a game built to revel in the mundanity, at which it absolutely succeeds. It's just kind of a sad reminder of the times that even ""space janitor"" is somehow a gripping escapism for some.There will still be occasional instances of gibs or spatters ending up out of bounds or stuck inside an impossible piece of geometry, but otherwise 8/10 would play to escape existential crises again. It's not a game for everyone though and if it sounds absolutely uninteresting to you, it probably will be.			"

								An interesting game but its novelty wears off quickly, all of about 10 minutes, perhaps more with afew friends.The physics makes large objects unwieldy and knocking over a mop bucket or being unable to get something into a disposal bin only to flip it on its side gets old really really fast.And the bullet casings, dear god the bullet casings.This game needs more tools and improvements to its physics before it can be considered a fun experience.Add a space vacum for bullet casings and small vicera that has them stick to the end until you toggle it off.Make the buckets stay upright or add something akin to a firehose/packpack that you refill to get rid of the blood spatter faster/easier but make the blood locations more creative/plentiful to compensate.Don't buy unless its on special or until it improves			"

												So, I see this game is on sale and I've been planning on getting it for a while. Something about the guilt from all the maps I've destroyed over the years appealed to me. So, I fire it up, put my hazmat suit on and dig in. Three or four hours later I finish my first room. I sit back and check out my C rating.Then something dawns on me.I just spent three hours cleaning a virtual room. I have played some tedius games, but what really broke me mentally, is that I did all that, and there isn't even a progression.No better tools, or soaps, nothing.You will be working the same in the 1st, 10th, and 100th area.As I said before, this game broke something inside of me and I couldn't even load steam up for a few weeks.I got better I suppose....

												Not sure what I expected, but you literally just tidy up. Some annoyances while playing like bluckets flying off somewhere dirty so you have more cleaning to do aren't fun. Yeah there's many ""levels"" but these are more ""scenarios"" where you still just clean.Multiple tools to help with the cleaning don't add enjoyment, it's literally a chore to play. Probably worth £3-4.			"

								There is plenty of promise in this game, but the level of tedium currently outweights the pleasure.  The mechanics of the game fails in a couple of places:A) You've cleaned the level, but the punch-out console reveals the job is not done: you pull out your sniffer tool to complete the finishing touches to only find it is entirely unhelpful.  You're left with the dilema of wandering about, what appear to be pristine halls, with a tool that doesn't do the job - of letting you finish.  Fix it, or allow the sniffer to ""zap"" clean small areas with a long timer when a large percentage of the map is clear.B) The mopping mechanic is great, tediously picking up each shell casing and each tiny gib of viscera is not.  A dustbin and broom solves the problem and works with the best mechanic.  Or use a metal and and organic magnet tool that pulls small objects to it, by way of spraying gore and machine oil everywhere as the solid chunks get attached to it.C) Let the good times roll:  the bloody gibs should be, for purposes of mopping up more fun, dripping and oozing - encourage people to either deploy bins and store the gibs, with small drips - or be ""punished"" by having to mop up the gore trails to the incinerators.

								While this game may seem like a simple and relaxing mopping simulator, it's more than that. It's actually a training exercise created by the dominant to trick the submissives like me into doing chores. Which isn't all that bad since when I ever get in that type of relationship, I can easily be the submissive in the relationship. In other words, I'm prepared to be the slave that my boyfriend would want for me to be, weather it be in bed or in the kitchen.I'm safe to say this game taught me all I needed to know to be in the kitchen, except cooking, which I've learned from playing Cooking Mama.

												I mean, there's nothing *wrong* with this game, but it's simply not fun. Granted, it is incredibly satisfying when you finally get one corner clean, but it takes an incredibly long time to complete that. Also, the mental drain is greater than anything I've ever experienced. It's like it's slowly taking your soul.			"

												It would be a grat game to drown out and lsten to podcasts to, or if you feel like doing something mindless, if it didn't casue my computer to crash every couple of hours. Not just the game, the entire computer. Had to refund becasue I'm not playing a game that crashes every 20 minuites or so. That's a pretty big game breaking bug, hopefully it will be fixed and I will be able to play the game, becasue the gameplay was quite mindless and strangly absorbing.			"

								Buy this game. No, shut up. I know it's a janitor simulator. Buy this game.I kept saying to myself ""I'll just wash this one wall"" or ""I'll just clean up this one pile of body parts before I go to bed"" and then BOOM, 4 hours have passed, and I'm still not done cleaning my first space station.This is frustratingly hilarious, and a game that must be in everyone's library. Buy it. Now!			"

												The game is fun for about an hour then it goes downhill (unless your playing local then it stays fun longer) but I would only pay $2.99 for such a game and the fact that I must BUY more DLC to add more basic content is very inconvienient.			"

								Great concept but totally boring after 10 minutes. You can extend it to 30 minutes if you have friends or just finished playing Dead Space. Buy it when it's on sale so you don't regret the purchase.			"

								Despite the entertaining premise—cleaning up after the messes left behind by traditional FPS protagonists—the gameplay mechanics in this series prevents me from recommending it. Maybe the soul-sucking tedium of this kind of work is too accurately simulated.			"

								Honestly, at this point i would not reccomend this game. It is simply not finished. Multiplayer is♥♥♥♥♥♥on big map because things dont load for everyone. Single Player works a lot better, but is boring without friends. Also they need to add some kind of scoring system better than just the news papers in the office, so you know how well you actually did, feel like you did something.			"

								SS13, a 2D game that's nearly ten years old and free, has a much more engaging janitor simulation. Don't waste your money on the game, it's buggy and barely works, and the concept of it is really just ""Oh look if you get covered in blood it'll apply a multitexture to the ground that you can clean up or spread around, and look at these great UDK physics that are totally accurate!"" The game is garbage, and likely always will be.			"

I put sock in box and sock stay there! They didn´t had epileptic moves, not shaking like on punk festival. Only stayed in a box.  Oh! How satisfy... "
