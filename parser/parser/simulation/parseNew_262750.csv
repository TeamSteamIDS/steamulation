												After I first played this game during it's second kick starter run, I have been waiting for this release with great anticipation. GoD (Graphite or Diamond) Factory is definitely the space shooter I have been looking for. It has a tremendous amount of different playstyles available, with not only a staggering number of parts for customization (this is the first game I have played in a long time in which I was happy to have a part unlock system) but also 4 different races to choose from. Also, while each races has it's own list of parts for every possible ship part, these pieces can still also be put on the ships of other races, opening up even more possible customization options. Additionally as a nice stylistic feature, almost every part of the ships you build have some effect on it's appearance, even internal ones like the power core. There is also a very nice focus on team play, plus features which actually facilitate team cooperation and communication. While the game is set to have other modes in the future, I still love the carrier assault mode that has the center of all available versions of the game so far. Finally, while I would definitely advise that you do the tutorials before playing any matches, GoD Factory is in my opinion very easy to pick up as a new player and be an effective part of your team. This is partially due to the fact that ships in this game do not die quickly. It normally takes quite a lot of effort in order to take down an enemy ship. However I should mention that there is a very good reason for this, in this game once you lose a ship it is replaced for the rest of the match by a weaker species specific drone. The drone can respawn, but every time it does so it gets a longer respawn timer. GoD Factory is a game which rewards cautious gameplay styles, or at the very least play styles that don't try to act like a one man army.			"

												This game is essentially the space battles in Star Wars Battlefront II without the small on-foot interior sections. Fly at the enemy's ship and blow up their components with bombers, or attack other enemy ships with fighters in 4v4 fights.Customization is good, the individual parts don't make a huge overall difference, but it's easy to spec out what type of ship you're aiming to make. The overall ship style is pretty neat as well, with additional colors being unlocked by accomplishing steam achivements in game. The graphics are great, the environments and ships are amazingly detailed.But, here's why I can't honestly reccomend the game.First and foremost, if you crash one of your ships, it's gone for the rest of the round, replaced with a very mediocre drone. I had to check the tutorials again to reconfirm this, but this is a huge pain considering rounds typically last 10-20 minutes. Now, I know it's rather easy to evade other players with a combination of boosting, manuvers, and special abilities, but being unable to use the ship you've designed for the rest of the round is a mental nightmare, and extremely discouraging. Essentially, you've been crippled for the rest of the game, and it's difficult to stage a comeback because of it.Next up is the controls. This is strictly a controller/joystick game. Mouse and keyboard controls are inherently flawed from the getgo because of both the default bindings, and the difficulting in turning. I believe initial bindings have the ship roating with mouse side movements, and turning binded to the A and D keys. I ended up flipping these bindings and found it far more usable. However, in dogfights that require you to constantly be turning, you are phsyically incapable of turning fast enough due to you having you keep dragging the mouse in one direction, and you will run out of desk space. Plug a controller in, save yourself the hassle.Once you understand the previous two complaints and try to work around them, you have the rest of the game open to you. The issue is, the rest of the game appears to be exactly like your first game, with different players, and different parts, and holy hell does it get old fast. I understand the idea that it's esentially trying to be a MOBA, where everyone plays one gametype and attempts to win via various strategies, but the difference between ships in this game is limited to stats, weapons, and abilities. Some abilities are a get out of jail free card (short range teleport through walls, decoy ship), while some are minor boosts, and some just feel like they're negated entirely if the other player boosts away. Mechanically, besides for the fact that some ships make better bombers, and some ships make better fighters, you're going to be playing the same thing over and over. The game's part experience and currency system will pretty much enforce this.Overall it feels this game could be better as a F2P based on it's grindy systems, selling cosmetics for income. A $20 pricepoint for one game mode and map is a very steep barrier of entry that in my opinion does not pay off for the content provided.			"

												This game is pretty damn cool.Space combat sim, fast-paced, bright, clear, strategy and resource management necessary - it's fun as hell. There's one gaping problem:No one is playing. Logged in, ran the tutorial, bought a little missile group for my ship, hit quick match and!!.....no players online. Nothing.So, I start a pure bots match. Worst idea ever. No-one to communicate with, no one to learn from, no one to play with. Bots seem to have the perfect reflexes, can pull off all these neat little manuver combos that leave you dead and them from in front of you to behind, left, up, and stabbing you with a stick while you feel like you're picking your nose.I'd reccomend this game if it only had a player base. As it stands?I wish I could get my money back.			"

Hardcore Space ActionIt goes without saying that GoD is truly a hardcore title, the mechanics and depth of the game make it really hard game to play and you have to invest lot of hours to learn best kit combinations and learn, which races are best along with best ships. Some could argue its not a MOBA, but its objective based gameplay make its very similar, also there is the factor that it uses respawn system and base that has turrets.One thing that really shined through for me was the soundtrack, it is one of these OST that end up in your playlists in Youtube since they are that good. Heck i could even buy the album, since i love the sounds so much. I think its comparable to Deus EX soundtracks by its style, but it really stand on its own though.The Overall verdict is that the game requires either gamepad and joystick, if your not going to sink tens of hours to the game, i doubt you will understand the game fully, while its not EVE Online i still think its quite depth for the type of a game God Factory Wingmen is. I Suggest buying Pre-Order since you get another copy of the game which you can give it to your friend for example or as a giveaway.			"

												GoD Factory is a space shooter akin to the ones I grew up with, it has the balls to punish you for doing stupid stuff and for having a lone wolf mentality (your gunship is replaced with a drone after it has been destroyed and it remains destroyed for the rest of the match) and there's a high skillcap which turns a lot of off on the idea of playing it because they don't like the idea of having their ego smashed.Take a good long look at what some of the negative reviews are saying, it's basically all related to the person who wrote the review being unable to ""get gud"" or get over their own false sense of supremacy; this is a team game. It is designed as a team game and if you beleive for an instant that you're not part of a team but rather some special little snowflake meant to take on the entire enemy team by yourself... you will get smashed into the ground- errr... nearest asteroid.Buy it. It's a great callback to the kind of high-skillcap, highly punishing games, of the glorious old days of PC gaming.PS. There's not much grinding in the game, if you win a game you get quite a bit of credits to spend on parts.			"

												Been following this game since the Kickstarter and have been looking forward to it the entire time.  I really enjoyed my time in the beta and am looking forward to the full release.  Even more so that I have an Oculus Rift to play it on now!Onto the game itself.  It doesn't have a vast amount of content, but what content it has is very good.  The space battles are engaging and take quite a bit of skill(and teamwork!) to do well in.  My only concern at the moment is this game not getting enough support to keep online thriving.  Ship customization is decent, but feels a bit restrictive at times.  As with most competitive games I really feel like there is one best loadout to have.  I didn't figure it out, but I am sure others were able to piece together 2 ships that were better than the rest.  If you liked Battlefront II space battles and you want to play a more fleshed out version, get this game.  It is well worth your time.			"

												Based on alpha/beta experiances and from what I have seen during Nine Dot's Twitch streams (http://www.twitch.tv/ninedotsstudio). The game is amazing. If you enjoy masses of customisation options, team play orientated play and space sims in general, GoD Factory: Wingmen is a must buy.Graphically the game is great and the audio is equally as good, and that was even before the new BGM has been put in (and if Dual Dragon's previous work is anything to go by, this will pretty sweet too).The gameplay requires good team coordination in order to take down the very durable carrier components which will in turn put a variety of debuffs on the pilots and carrier itself. Games themselves are relatively short, never exceeding 25 minutes, which is great for getting back to spending your hard earned credits on the customisations.The community around the game has been great up to now and it will be great to see that grow with a full release. The devs are all very open, helpful and fun to spend time with and it was great to fly along-side of (or against) during the past few months.In my opinion, it is definately worth checking out, and is really good value for money at the £15 price tag.

												I recently acquired GoD Factory: Wingmen through the humble multiplayer bundle. The reason why I bought the bundle was not this game; in fact, I had never even heard of it before and it just seemed like a nice added bonus.Boy, was I wrong!Here's a quick run-down of the pros and cons:Pros:+Get in the mood! Starting in the the main screen and throughout the entire game, the music is excellent!+Eye-candy all the way! Space combat has rarely looked so good!+Riveting gameplay! Blow away your opponents while just barely avoiding the giant debris floating around!+Work as a team! Throw out tons of damage with synergies and combos!+Coordinate! Succeed together with the easy-to-use communication system!+Play your way! 4 playable races and a huge amount of ship customization options!+Become stronger! With the progression system, there is always something new to reach for and discover!Cons:-Steep learning curve. Some people might find it hard to get into, but the tutorial is great and really helps with that. Plus, experienced players are very helpful and are happy to give you some pointers!-Small player base. We need more people to play with! Fortunately, literally everyone I've met in-game so far has been nice, helpful, and fun to be around!After having played GoDF for a while, I can say with absolute sincerity that I am in love with it. Nowadays, I rarely find new games with so much attention to detail, where you can really feel the passion poured into it by the developers. I consider every aspect of it to be well-executed and highly enjoyable. Plus, you can really feel the impact of all your choices, whether in the hangar, building completely different ships or in combat out in the field, fighting alongside your allies!If you're looking for a breath of fresh gaming air and friendly people to play with, GoD Factory: Wingmen is definitely for you!So what are you waiting for? Start building your gunships and join us out in the field!			"

												GoD Factory is a whole new look at squad based combat. Dogfighting is a genre that really fell by the wayside, and for someone nostalgic for games like Wing Commander and Freelancer (for the combat), this game really scratches the itch. If you pick it up, you're going to have a mostly good time, with two notable problems:1. This game does not excel at accesibility. Learning how to play requires about an hour of interactive tutorials, and I can't stress this enough: They are totally necessary. Imagine playing League of Legends without knowing that Flash is a thing. Without two of the tutorials, you won't know how to perform this game's version of flash. As long as you can tolerate the tutorials, though, and spend some time researching all the different ship parts, this game REALLY opens up after your first couple of matches.2. The community is still pretty small. Finding a match with eight human players takes a long time, and due to the difficulty curve I mentioned, bots start at unforgivingly hard for your first couple matches to face rollingly easy. Try to have a group who enjoys playing together if you want to get the most out of this game.The ship customization is deep and very satisfying, the combat is intense and engaging, and the objectives are strategic and original. Every point you score gives the enemy team some kind of debuff, making target priority an interesting strategic decision.If you want competitive dogfighting (especially if you have friends who do too) and don't mind a difficulty curve (SERIOUSLY, DO THE TUTORIALS) then you're going to love this game.

												EDIT: Sadly, while this remains a great game, the lack of players online raises a big red flag for a PvP game such as this, even though it is possible to play with and against Bots. If you pick this game up, be wary that you may not find people online to play it with. This is very sad, it's so good.This is a great title, which is saying something coming from me - I am not traditionally a huge fan of PvP games, but this does tick the boxes: solid gameplay; interesting mechanics; rewarding intelligent and strategic teamplay.Despite playing through the tutorial, it did take me some time to get used to the carrier parts and the controls, especially as I am using keyboard and mouse, but using a controller will also give a good experience. Though it is a punishing game with a high skill cap, I find myself enjoying it, despite my lack of skill. Something to work on, I suppose.The idea about the game itself is pretty simple. It's not a deathmatch; matches are up to 4 v 4 (including bots should you wish to do so), and the two teams try to destroy the enemy carrier (base) by destroying components (in the vein of Star Wars Battlefront II). If the two carriers are destroyed at the same time, then the team which has destroyed the most enemy gunships (your fighters) is considered the winner. The race-specific abilities and the purchasable add-ons also make the game quite interesting and refreshing, forcing people to think carefully about their resources and how to use them - the cooldowns can be crippling if something is used at the wrong time.The game looks great, with 4 very different races available to choose from. The ship and component designs are all vividly different from one another with clear distinctions and very interesting designs. The weapons are a particular highlight, with a huge variety all looking very nice. The great look is complemented by the maps - as of Galaxy Update 1.1 (15/11/2014) - there are now 4... the two carriers and the surrounding area, including the cover you can find from man-made factories in the area or the immense statue nearby all look great. The 3 new maps all include new unique and interesting mechanics in addition to more stunning visuals. One offers damage dealing locations, one offers healing, and one has teleporters spaced around the map. This is complemented by the game's audio. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, I could listen to it for hours on end. The sound design for the space combat is quite good too, disregarding the impossibility of sounds being heard in space... but who cares? Music makes it more awesome.One of the things I like most about this game is the customisation available for your ships. You start with two basic ships from two races, but are quickly able to buy more. While you do need to ""grind"" to unlock better parts - keep an eye out on the ""tech tree"" in the shop to see what you want to unlock and work towards those parts - the grind is not excessive like in some other games. The range of options available is incredible, and offers a huge range of options forcing you to make some hard decisions: do you upgrade a lower tier part to it's max level or do you skip it and use a weaker higher tier part until you can level that up? This is supported by something I quite personally like - the fact that achievements unlock further cosmetic options. This makes it interesting and fun to collect achievements if you can, while not rewarding these achievements with OP ship parts. Thus, a failure to be skilled or lucky enough to acquire an achievement will not punish you further by ensuring you will be left with comparatively substandard parts.Finally, I am pretty happy with the game developers, who are maintaining a strong presence in the community, always on top of launch issues and always happy to talk with the players and keep them up-to-date. Very, very happy with my decision to buy this game.			"

Posted: August 29, 2014
												TL;DR - Game is awesome, has minor faults but 9/10 from me.So I was pretty hyped for this game, and I can say that it's exceeded my expectations for a release game. When you look at other developers like Square-Enix and Psyonix (Nosgoth) who simply don't even interact with their community much; even with a larger team, it's easy to see that this game has a special ""flare"" to it.The gameplay reminds me of the old Gamecube games for Star wars (Rogue squadron) and it has all of that and so much more. The game is 90% bug-free (small bugs every now and then) but I can host games on my low-end machine and it runs great.The controls can be a little hard to grasp at first, the first few games me and a few friends died a few times against the bots while working out what we had to do and how to do it, but after the 4th attempt we managed to win fast and not die at all.So i'll say this, anyone who is having trouble with a mouse + keyboard - Keep at it. It gets easier.The only downside at the moment is the slightly confusing shop/modification menu. The tutorial covers a lot of basic flight information but nothing in the menu and It looks a little scattered. But this could just be my slightly older, logical brain talking.-That being said, it can be slightly hard in-game to stabilise yourself, I have been using the woman in the background to work that out.Overall, having not been a part of the beta I wouldn't know how the devs are in terms of time/patch releases, but this game looks completely polished. I can't really judge it after 3 hours of gameplay, but if I was forced to i'd give it a 9/10.The one point missing is the small gripes, but they are really small.I look forward to spending a lot of time on this in between studying.

Posted: September 10, 2014
												[Edit 2/12/15]Having come back to take another look at Wingmen, I see that the developers did address several of my original complaints by adding new maps and gametypes and capping rewards for playing with bots. Then I checked the game's recent statistics and found this:Current players: 4 (@7pm EST)30-day Avg: 2.330-day gain: -1.9 Couple those dismal numbers with a potentially final update mentioning a new project and Wingmen's lack of profitability, and the game really starts looking like a ghost ship. It's a shame, even a short single-player campaign alone might have added enough draw and mitigated the learning curve enough to sustain an online player base. Ultimately, Wingmen shows that a few missteps early on can sink a promising multiplayer title.[Original Review]I love this game, and have played it almost every day since release. That said, I can't recommend it, at least not at the current price of $20.Let's start out with what's good. The game has an excellent engine, runs very smoothly, and has no notable lag issues. Initial match load times can be slow but after that it's generally smooth sailing to the finish. The graphics are good, not exceptional but nothing to complain about either. Ships are varied, and the customization options are deep and satisfying. Taking 2 ships into each battle allows each player to prepare multiple tactics and adjust on the fly. Ships can be shared with comrades in battle. The dogfighting is solid and the carriers offer a variety of targets and strategies. A good match is a hell of a lot of fun.So why not buy it?GFW is an online battle arena with no single player campaign of any kind. That in itself is not a problem, except that there's currently only one multiplayer gametype, with only one map. I think the deficiency here is pretty self-explanatory. I have been assured more are coming by a developer, but until then is now, it's an issue. I believe this game should be properly classified with the ""Early Access"" titles at this point.Getting a game started, especially at non-peak times, involves a lot of waiting. As of this review, the community averages 30-40 players at midday, and 80-100 peak. A full session is 8 players, and less is not nearly as much fun. The game allows you to substitute bots of varying configuration and difficulty, which would be good except that the bots currently provide better rewards than real opponents, so the lobby list is full of rooms with 1-2 people and 6-7 bots. The developer also assures me that bot rewards will be reduced soon. It can't come soon enough, in my opinion.Compounding the frustration of the small community are a variety of social features the game is lacking. It does not populate Steam's ""recent players"" list, so you have to manually search for anyone you want to friend, and then sort through the many results. It does not offer in-game voice chat of any kind. It does not offer basic options such as blocking chat from a disruptive player. There is no solution to an idle host, aside from leaving and starting a new lobby. There is no persistent squad chat, as squads are immediately disbanded after each match. Communication mid-game is bolstered by a nice team command broadcast menu, but this can't be assigned to a gamepad like everything else can.Some final notes: Gamepad support is a plus, but the recommended mappings beg to be reassigned immediately. The music is great at first, but the one extended track rapidly becomes repetitive. The tutorial is helpful and gives you a credit boost to start, but is frustratingly segmented. Notice how everything is ""good, but....""Bottom line: Unless you are a space combat fanatic, wait for more features and a lower price. You can get a hell of a lot more for $20 out of the Steam catalogue.			"

												We recommend this game to hardcore players who are not afraid of digging deeper into a game and find how all the mechanics are intertwined. There's a lot of customization in here and we've dedicated a lot of attention to game balance. While we aren't going the pure simulationist route we're far from dumbing it down either. Controlling your ships takes practice and I'm persuaded that you will still be learning new tricks even after well over 100 hours of playtime.Back when we started, there wasn't much happening in the space game genre and wanted to make something on our own. Since then, plenty of games worthy of attention were announced, such as Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous, but I think what we made still stands out with a very unique offer: ships that you assemble part by part and a deep, competitive multiplayer game with a focus on cooperation and creativity.Sources of influence: Ace Combat, Star Fox, Final Fantasy XI, Star Wars Battlefront, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter, Freelancer and many more.We hope that you'll enjoy our game as much as we do!

												This game is amazing. I've been playing it since the kickstarter alpha and have loved every minute of it. The gameplay is both fast-paced and has a lot of strategic depth: hunting down people and outmaneuvering them feels extremely rewarding. Teamwork is a huge part of the game: working with allies is extremely rewarding, both in-game and when setting up strategies and designing ships.Ship building and design is a wonder of its own: you can build glass cannons, resilient bombers, tanky defenders, support ships that apply debuffs to enemy gunships, and more; Guantri ships can even fill two of these roles at the same time.I can't wait for this game to launch and will be playing it every chance I get. If you're just getting into it, add me on steam and I'll show you the ropes!			"

												GoD Factory: Wingmen is a fun game. With only one game mode and a single map that has randomly placed parts between you and the ship. You'd think you would get bored fast. But you honestly don't. There is always something to unlock even hitting the max level. The ships and weapon customization make it the game.For $10, an instant buy in my book. $20...eeeeeeeh, if you're a hardcore space sim type of person, buy it.I'm currently using mouse and keyboard and have no issue dominating. Sometimes moving the mouse is a bit much but I don't find it a problem. With that said, I have  a Joystick on order for Star Citizen. I will update this review with a joystick once I try it out.Edit: JoysticksI got my HOTAS setup and the mapping wizard in game is great. However, I feel a little slower with the joystick than I do with a mouse. That might have a lot to do with the fact I'm still new to a HOTAS setup. As of right now, the support is there and works. I am just not use to it yet. I'll have to give it some time to get better at this.			"

												Simply put this is a great game with superb dogfighting, tons of meaningful customization and much strategic depth! However if you are looking for causal fun where you can just hop in and shoot at some starfighters that's probably not the game for you.It's not very clear from the description but essentially this is a MOBA. And that's not a bad thing at all because the MOBA format fits the dogfighting just perfect!So to describe you the mechanics: every match there are two carriers shooting the hell of eachother and here you come with your two fighters trying to destroy the enemy carrier first. In order to be successful you and your teammates should concentrate on one of it's 9 parts at a time (2 of which are inside the hull itself!). What's great is that by destroying a part you not only are helping to bring the enemy carrier down but depending of the party you've destroyed that puts the enemy team in a specific disadvantage (for example if you destroy the Ammo Warehouse the enemy team won't be able to fill the ammo of their fighters to the full set). As I mentioned earlier you bring two of your fighter to the match. You can switch between them by docking to the carrier. When docked your fighters get their ammo refilled and their shield gradually recovering. As for the fighters themselves they are fully customisable. Each fighter consist of 12/13 parts (depending on the number of weapons) which you can combine as you see fit. When using the parts in a match that later unlocks upgrades for them and gives you acces to new ones. All this gives the matches great strategic dept and variety.This may be MOBA but there are no microtransactions. You just pay the price for the game and unlock all your parts by playing.The game mechanics are great but there is something else you should know before considering a purchase.There are not many people playing it. My guess is because the game is somehow demanding of you. You need quite some time to figure things like the combo system, carries layout, the fighter's builds that best fits your playstyle and so on. So if you hop into a game at a random time the chance are you will just meet 1 - 2 players playing against bots. However the people playing it are very friendly and are often willing to get out of their way to show you the ropes and make you feel welcome. And because they are so few they organize events where so they can log on on the same time and have full scale matches. So it is not that there are not people to play the game with but rather you will be able to paly with them on a specific time.So if the game mechanics seems fun to you and you don't mind making some new friends I can wholeheartedly recommend the game for you.

												I demo'd this game at PAX East and was part of the beta. My experience with this game was really positive; it's a polished title that is a unique experience, especially among the space sim revival we're currently experiencing. I'll break particular aspects of the game down below:Controls:I'll get this out of the way right now; this game currently does not have my joystick supported (x52) but I've been reassured by the devs that the kinks for this particular model will be worked out by launch. Despite my personal joystick not working too well, the joysticks at PAX East functioned brilliantly; the input felt responsive and smooth. A lot of the gameplay of GoD Factory doesn't rely super heavily on twitch aiming, so it's possible the finer aiming problems weren't evident. The game also allows for some really cool manuevers while still maintaining a high level of accessibility (the ideal easy to learn, difficult to master, which I think is an overarching design decision for this game as a whole). A sort of temporary newtonian mode (almost like drifting) allows for some slick, intense dogfights. Core Gameplay:The standard gamemode for this is heavily strategic. It allows for teams to asses their strengths, the enemy's weakness, then assault the enemy in a manner that they deem will cripple them the most. Perhaps the enemy has a lot of lock-on missiles; destroying the radar tower would make it more difficult for target acquisition. Things like that. There's a lot of replayability in the core gameplay (carrier v. carrier) alone. In the future however, to maybe avoid things getting a bit stale, consider different carrier ships or even game modes. I don't forsee the core game getting stale for a long time though.Mechanics:This is where this game really shines for me. Finally, the ability to modularly construct your ship without a straight upgrade path. Heavier weapons? Well now your ship is slower. Let's put a bigger engine one...now you need more energy. Slap a bigger power core on; now you're generating more heat. There's a really smart system behind this that really allows for no single 'best build' ship.  I'm very excited to see what kind of weird builds the community comes up with. I was able to swap between mine laying ships to support/snaring ships, to sort of rocket bombers. All within the first tier of gameplay. It's honestly very head spinning, even beyond just the simple weapons. Once you delve into power cores, ship bodies/wings, computers, etc. it can almost become a game in of itself. Particular weapons don't just become more powerful either; the model that the devs have constructed allows for really slim, minimalistic ships to potentially be viable. Combining this crazy individual customization with a 4 man team is a recipe for infinite replayability. Think Dota 2 meets X-wing. I almost forgot combos: Weapons have damage types that can potentially be combined with other damage types that allow for combos to form. I can't imagine how difficult/awesome it's going to be to pull off some of the higher level tier combos with my friends.Graphics/Audio:Personally, graphics aren't a major factor for me. Especially with a game like this that has such strategic depth. I will say that the art style is definitely unique, and I'm very happy to report that your customized modular ships actually change appearance with every part. That, to me, means that the graphics definitely do their job. It also allows the game to be a lot more accessible hardware wise, which is great for the potential esport future of this game.Overall:To summarize my beta/PAX experience, this game looks really solid and I'm furious I can't play it right now. The game is accessible for gamers who aren't 'pilots' but allows for seasoned aces to pull off some awesome stuff. It has an interesting gameplay mode with an incredibly in-depth ship building mechanism that is dizzying in depth. All at a very reasonable price.			"

												I really enjoy playing this one a lot! The art design and gameplay are superb and it's really fun blasting around the galaxy having dogfights and attacking the carriers. The 4 vs 4 format works really well and the ship customization is very deep.I would describe this game as Starfox meets Zone of The Enders; even envoking classic space shooters like Wing Commander. The gameplay is very fast and it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of flying. I would advise turning the sensitivity up as it's set very low initially and feels a bit difficult to turn. Otherwise a mouse and keyboard work great for this game (I imagine it would play equally well on a gamepad or joystick). There are also tons of different weapon combinations and every ship you encounter will be fairly unique. The music is also well executed and provides a nice atmosphere.The only drawback is that there is no storyline and one map. I really like the map however as it's very detailed with many structures and a huge area to fly in. There is enough variety in it that it really feels different each time. Plus it's beautiful to look at so it doesn't feel repetitive. The devs are super cool and are online playing frequently. They seem very receptive to player feedback and genuiley interested in making a great game. Nine Dots Studio is planning on adding more content in the future, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are more maps and story missions on the way. You guys did a great job! Now... back to blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up!			"

												Dear Nine Dots,please make it so players can join matches in progress. Other than that this game is VERY well done.To everyone else. If you like space/ flight combat sims...get this one. It is awesome.True customization is somthing that has been lacking in the current generation of videogames, but Nine Dots nailed it.Most online teamwork games can have one person carry a whole team if they have skill and a fast computer; Nine Dots made it so players actually have to work together better than their opponants over the course of the WHOLE match to win.An early death can hurt your chances of winning, but dont underestemate the drones either they are way more handy than they sound.

												This game deserves your attention.I loved playing Star Fox 64 split screen back in elementary school. At the time, graphics were awesome, gameplay was great, and the music got my jimmys rustled. WELL I must be 12 again because I have the exact same words to describe GoD Factory. PROS:Graphics are pretty to say the least. And the effects make your guns look powerfull.Gameplay is fast and frantic with you constantly shifting between attack and defense.Music... I listen to the music while playing OTHER games. Wish all games had music as good as this.CONS:Tutorial could be a little better but if you don't get it play a few matches with bots till you get it.Low population. This game has had almost zero publicity and as such most people don't know it even exists.This game needs a push like youtubers gave to Guns of Icarus.In summary, great game that no one knows about. GO PLAY IT!!!			"

												GFW is an amazing space flight death match simulator.In a time where a major software company can put out Dark Souls 2 (another game that I love for different reasons) and can't even manage to keep track of two players with a limited moveset, GFW manages to keep track of 8 ships, 2 carriers, collisions, and ballistics for the weapons without any lag.  It's pretty damned impressive.Couple that with ship customization that actually means something, a leveling system for parts skillsets that gives you a reason to fly new ships, and ability to customize your matches to suit your own difficulty and you have something that keeps players entertained for hours.  Really impressed by how much fun this is.			"

												A fantastic game, the only downside is that the game is slowly dying due to lack of players. If you like combat flight simulators to an extent or have played ""Freelancer"" ""War Thunder"" or ""World of Warplanes"" combat is very similar to those listed except with more goals than just destroy other ships. If you can find a group to play with the game becomes 10x as fun as thrash bots only. The game is beautiful with its surroundings and the maps have more psace to fly than you can shake a stick at.

												Great Spaceship Arena fighting game. Probablly one of the best and most complex games so far. Sadly, there is one thing that this game lacks: players. Usually you won't have anybody to play with (apart from the Bots).However, a pretty active but small community is organising events to fill up the game servers. It's huge fun joining them.PS:I've heard that the game has VR Support. So if you own any kind of VR Device, this may be the experience you've been looking for.			"

												I love the hell out of this game. Its a nice balance of arcady dog fighting action and pseudo simulation space combat.You want to feel like Luke Skywalker fighting off the Deathstar? Fly in to the enemy ship take out their shield generator, then hit their core and by the time you finish that off the enemy carrier is about to go up in smoke.It has a really interesting hit and run mechanic. It takes time to repair your ship, which can mostly only be done in the docking bay of your own carrier. Also burning through ammo happens pretty frequent. So it really encourages you to go back to the dock and swap out your ships to repair/reload your old one.The ship customizing is a lot of fun. There are a lot of variables to take in to account to customize your fighter. Slow ships seem like they'll be better at defending your own carrier. Fast ships with light payloads seem better for hit and run tactics on the enemy carrier. But if you're to slow at hit and running the enemy carrier parts may heal up your damage. So, maybe its better to take more ammo or higher damaging weapons, but then it'll slow you down and make it harder to run away in a dog fight. So many things to consider, and so much fun to be had.Its also nice that fighter parts aren't 100% better upgrades. You can level up parts to make them stronger, but they come at the cost of requiring more energy, heat, or weight. So sometimes it is better to go with a lower level part just so you don't weigh yourself down and can boost for longer and faster. This also means that low level ships when you first start do have some small advantages over higher level ships. While you don't be able to stand toe to toe with the highest level guys, you still won't be completely screwed either.Also, unlocking and leveling up parts is at a very steady progression. When you first start the game you'll have more credits then you know what to do with. But after that you won't have enough credits to get what you really want, but it only takes about 2 games to get enough credits to unlock what you want. So it never feels too grindy.The current game community is really small. But I personally have been having a lot of fun still just playing against Bots. I've been in one game with 4v4 and the game completely changes. Suddenly those hit and run tactics aren't so effective against players (because bots are stupid).  But I assume its still viable, just need to rethink it a bit.I feel this game is the perfect level of space sim and arcade dog fighting action. For example, it's really satisfying to fly past an enemy fighter, do a quick 180 degree maneuver, cut out the engines for a sec to continue to drift forwards and blow your enemy to ribbons as they attempt to do the same thing. Some real epic space combat there.I highly recommend this game. Its awesome. Buy it so I have more people to play with.			"

												Well, i try to make it short:Requirements:- need to be a sci-fi fan and like to fly ships in 3rd person view or cockpit viewBad points:- small playerbase / havent seen any price discounts on this game, should be done once in a time to get more players in my opinion- KI having some issues flying into carrier/obstacles- no story mode- may become frustrating for beginners, since your two ships that you take into a match have each one life per match and be replaced by drones once they are shot down- may become dull if you only fight bots once you got the hang of the gameGood points:- very friendly community / no seperation between pros and beginners- teamplay is written in big letters here- high varity of weapons with 6 different afinitys: Decay, Overload, perforation, detonation, ignition and distortion- many different parts, that also change the looks of you ship, each part has four different grades from mark1 to mark4 / a ship is built of body, cockpit, wings, thrusters, power core, shields, main computer, weapon control unit, devices, add ons, main weapons, 1st wing weapons, 2nd wing weapons / having 4 races where some parts can be used for multiple races- combo system: combos can be triggered with your team mates to inflict special negativ effects on enemys....many combos possible, because of the 6 different afinitys- cool colors to use for your ship- sharing system: allows to fly ships of your team mates in a match- once game is bought, you dont need to pay for extra stuff ingame, all parts are access able by using the ingame cash you earn by finishing matches against players or bots- steam archievments give you ingame cash and new colors for your ship- quick help by pushing F1, F2 and F3 informing you about combos, carrier parts and effects that may be inflicted on allies or enemys- very stable engine and smoothly runningSo, here i hope for more players to join the game. If you dont see any other players online, just contact some who made a review here and ask for a match, co-op, or pvp, all will be fine^^			"

												If you are in desperate need of Armored Core-ish multiplayer experience on Steam, GoD Factory: Wingmen is just the thing for you. There is a whole lot of parts to pick for your favorite gunship. Flak guns, cannons, homing missles, mine dispensers, shockwave blasts, chain lightning shots, rockets, machine guns, satellite doomlasers just to name a few! And thats just the weaponry, constructing the actual gunships body features a ton more equipment to use, including: cockpit, wings, generator, forcefields and targetting devices. GoD Factory: Wingmen encourages players to experiment and have a lot of fun while at it. Each unlocked achievment gets you reward of credits to buy/upgrade parts and various color schemes to make your gunship beautiful in addition to deadly. Game features remarkable visuals and soundtrack, additionaly it is frequently maintained by developers and in my experience has a pretty welcoming and helpful community. In conclusion: if you are into Mecha themed stuff and/or marvelous dogfights in space, this game is a must have for you.			"

												The only way to game competitively without playing Smite, LoL, Dota or FPS games is GOD.There is a huge customization and the gameplay is absolutely stunning; BUT you do need at least one friend to play with, otherwise it won't be easy to start enjoying the game soon.  Once you've learned the basics you can indeed do stuff by yourself, but the game is all about teamwork; you can use so many different strategies that your mind will blow.Personally I have been playing alone until somebody picked me up, but I still managed to have tons of fun because the customization (as I said) is so great it will take one week just to learn all the parts, then you can make all kind of gunships according to your needs, and they work!Also, the developers are so nice and they always hang out in the chat, and they want their game to be perfect: they are willing to balance every single thing so that you will be able to make as many kinds of gunships as possible!To all potential GOD players: Starting may not be too easy, but the game is so rewarding and it's a great chance to meet a lot of new interesting people!

												I've been following this game since I first played it at PAX east 2014. I played in the closed beta they add in the eary summer/ late spring and it's a really fun game with a surprising amount of depth and fills a nitch in this under explored genre. The game has a surpring depth of ship (i.e., class customization) as well as a few varied races to choose from. The mode in the beta was very fun ... a sort of base defense mode where you were tasked with destroying key parts of the enemys ship (aka base) before they can destroy yours. If you are looking for a fun arcade style flight game with depth in customization and or just want to support a really cool dev (nine dots studios) look no further.			"

 A great concept ruined by poor planningLet me start by saying that the game looks beautiful, and runs smooth, and at moments in time very much gives the feel of the epic space battle its simulating. However all of this simply makes the game somewhat more bittersweet in its failures. As is so often the case with these sorts of beautiful battle arena type games, Two factors in particular have led to the writing of this review. Either by itself would probably not be an issue, but combined they have made the game an exercise in frustration.Firstly is the slow matchmaking. Matches take a full 8 players every time, and will not start with less. One person sitting Afk in a lobby can completely stall up an entire match and force you to go looking for another one. The host can kick them, but as half the time the host is the one AFK, this does not help much. Half the time quickmatch will que you back with the same said afk person for several minutes before finding you a new lobby. Admittedly however, dev's do seem to be working on this.Secondly is imbalance. Matches will quite often throw you as a rank amateur against teams of entirely seasoned vets/aces. This might not be an issue if the game autobalanced to give lowbies a better chance, but sadly it does not. And where as you would hope most of the community would want a fair fight, it is more often than not that you will enter a lobby only to find a team of max rank individuals fighting a team of complete rank 1/2 newbies. With very few people willing to give up said obvious highground it is often about as fruitless as being with the afk people because no lowbie dares want to hit ready and start up that obvious loss. Like with the AFK hosts, you will often find yourself thrown back up against the same team of all max ranks 3-4 times till hopefully another match pops up, or like I did, you stop playing. Once again, according to a response by devteam, this is an issue they are working on, but at the moment it is still an issue on nonetheless. Hopefully as the game progreses these things will become nonissues, and we can all enjoy some dogfighting. Edited~ A swift response from Dev's informed me I was incorrect about slates not being wiped before official launch and I have redacted my complaint on the matter.			"

												So, what is ""GoD Factory: Wingmen""? well, it's a very unique throw on the MOBA genre. In this game you get to play as a completely customized ship built to your liking, in a purely skill based action game. You don't have to worry about people outleveling you, as there are no levels in this game. Items are ship parts that do different attacks, for example, one cannon could be a lock on type, and another could be a skillshot that deals three times more damage than the one previously mentioned. This allows you to play any which way you like, instead of having to find one hero or champion out of many. you never feel like losing was someone else's fault, and that's a nice jump from the toxic blaming of normal MOBAS, and for a guy with over 1k hours in DotA 2, I can say for a fact that this game has an amazing community compared to the average MOBA. The ""ancient"" or ""base"" is very unique, as there are multiple parts on the enemy base that when destroyed, give you a bonus and the enemy a handicap they have to play the rest of the game with. This game is very refreshing, and the only reason i have not played much of this game is well, the problem with this game is how small the community is.the problem with this game is that the community is a little bit to small, and it can be hard to find a match. this is probably because as a skill based game, the people that stick with the game will obliterate you untill you have about 3-4 hours of practice, and even then you can barely keep up with them. i pre-purchased this game, and i stopped playing it because of how small the community is, and i would not say that it is worth a 20 dollar price point. but when this game goes on sale, pick it up. it is worth your time.So, here's a quick summary for you if you were to lazy to read that.POSITIVE:-Very good graphics for a MOBA-Unique, and refreshing -Great community, Dedicated for the most part-You can unlock everything in the game, and tweak your ship to your own playstyle-The Devs are very dedicated to this game CONS-the only con in this game is how small the community really is. Would i get this for 20? no. but when it comes on sale, pick it up. you will love this game if you are into thrilling, fast paced games and MOBAS. And if not, this game still probably has something for you. "

												God Factory: Wingmen is a rather unique game, combining space fighters, dogfighting, Moba style objectives and a great deal of customization. I'm certainly not the first and definitely not the last person to say this, but this is the first game in quite a while that has given me a legitimate reason to want to buy a joystick.Firstly if money is a factor that makes you hesitate then at the time I'm writing this I would hold off for a bit, as the game is majorly PvP centric and getting a good match going can be difficult at the moment due mainly to a low population. You can play against bots but players are always the better choice, and the bots don't exactly go easy on new players even at low ranks. There is a major update incoming as well as a free weekend so if this interests you keep and eye and give it a shot while its free.The game itself has a lot of depth, which is both good and bad. I personally really enjoy the detail that goes into building your own personal ship as well as the great deal of options in game of both tactics and maneuvers, however there is a LOT to learn, which can certainly get in the way of getting comfortable playing the game. It can be rather daunting starting out but I found that it gets better and better the more you learn. One mistake thats easy to make is getting too hung up on ship setups and equipment. Most weapons and such handle similarly enough (there are of course exceptions) that a player whos got good control skills will do well and one without will almost always do poorly, so I would focus more on getting the gameplay control down before worrying too much about trying to make a super flying deathmachine.Most of the regular players are quite friendly and can give some pretty good advice.Ship Customization:There are tiers of ship parts, for the core frame parts (wings, body, cockpit) the higher tiers are generally higher stats but higher requirements as well, so higher end is generally stronger if you can fit it in.Some special parts such as abilities and special equipment often have radically different effects with a same basic idea behind them per tier, so while higher may cost more it will not always be better performance wise depending on what you want to use it for.weapons work similarly to the core parts but with the damage types and constraint limits with many high end parts, as well as the flexibility of having two wing weapons, maximum tier versions of the weapon are not always the best choice.Ship constraints are determined by parts such as the body, and generator and such, however the constraints themselves are not hard capped, you can exceed the constraints and take a penalty based on what category you're exceeding, which scale based on how much you exceed by. It is quite possible to make and exceptional ship that goes over its constraint limits but is generally something you'll want to avoid.overall - lots and lots of details, this can be very overwhelming but a solid basic setup will still perform well and doesn't need to be overanalyzed when starting out. I personally love the level of detail that can go into ship building but this can be a negative as well for some playersControls: Personally I found the default mouse and keyboard controls to be a bit awkward at first, after getting used to them a bit it worked very well, but I did end up changing them so I would conflict too much with other games I play as switching back and forth between control schemes with some similarities was more trouble then it was worth to me, but with a few minor adjustments it works great. Also there's word that the new version (incoming fairly soon) will have altered default controls to match up more closely with more commong Mouse+keyboard schemes players may be familiar with. And although I don't have access to a setup regularly the game is a blast with a good joystick.There are a wide variety of built in maneuvers available to the player and they're flexible enough to be used in a very wide variety of ways to create some pretty crazy maneuvers.overall - Has a significant learning curve but I feel the controls are solid, and offer enough options and flexibility to create a good non-restrictive experienceGameplay:The game itself currently consists of two teams fighting to destroy eachothers carriers, it has Moba style objectives where killing the oposing team players does offer and advantage but if not capitalized on doesn't garuntee anything.Currently there is one map with several new ones reportedly coming in the next update, however I'd also like to add that the map is varied and balanced enough that with the way the game plays I would say that this is not a problem.Dogfighting is important but as above with kills is not anywhere near the end all of how to win or even play. Ultimately the carrier is what matters and your ability to either stop the enemies attack force or simply outdo their offense with your own will determine the match. Additionally carriers have a main cannon that will periodically fire at eachother creating a limit to how long a match can last, with a draw being determined by either most gunship kills (a players main ship) or additionally the teams overall score if kills were even as well.The carrier has several destroyable parts such as a radar, repair station, shield generator, which when destroyed inflicts a different penalty on the opposing team as well as suffering damage to their overall carrier integrity. This allows for many different approaches on how to take out the carrier, from going for surprise attacks on undefended parts, crippling the enemies ability to resupply and radar range, or even going for maximum carrier damage by stripping its defenses.It's also important to note that players themselves can be harder to destroy than might be expected, often requiring at least two players to garuntee a kill before an experienced player can escape to relative safety, however losing a ship can be a major loss to a team or individual, as a lost gunship is permanently out for the rest of the match. A player is allowed to bring two seperate gunships into a match and they may not have any overlapping parts (with 4 different races to pick from even building two ships for similar roles and performance is quite doable), and a lost ship is replaced with a standard drong ship for that race, which are generally weak stat wise but cannot be ignored as they can still turn the tide of a battle as well as not costing the team any points towars a tiebreaker if the drone is destroyed as it will respawn. Also players are allowed to request to share ships with another of their teammates giving both players free access to eachothers ships for the rest of the match, altho the rules for losing ships remain even if another player is piloting one of your ships.overall - a unique game with a focus more on team objectives than a straight forwards deathmatch. There is as much place on a team for a player who wants only to shoot down enemy fighters as well as a player who wants to focus solely on bombing the carrier. Survival is also quite important as you may lose an edge with too many gunships lost, but kills alone don't decide the match and a team can lose many more ships than the opponent and still come out significantly on top.Final notes, again at the time of writing this there is an update incoming and reportedly shortly after this game will be available for a free weekend so if this interests you at all, keep an eye out.

So BUY THIS GAME and play it, right NOW.Oh right, I almost forgot to actually describe the game. Well get this: you fly around in space and shoot people, but you don't just fly, you can pull out all these badass maneuvers like instaflip yourself 180 degrees backwards or boost at full speed, turn 90 degrees and fire rockets while still drifting forward like a funking space Max Payne.

And the music is completely bloody mindblowing, analogue synths and overdrive up the♥♥♥♥♥♥and it goes mwua-mwua-mwua-mwua and then DUTZ-tun-dutz-tun-mwua-mwua, it's amazing.

It can be tiresome clicking back and forth to compare parts. Also, I wish it would indicate clearly when a ship part was being used on multiple ships to make building more user friendly.2) There is almost no incentive to dogfight, destroy the enemies carrier to win. While that's the objective you'd think there would be more focus on ship to ship combat - maybe kill streaks/buffs?3) Simplify the combo and damage system, having several damage types is confusing.

												Lots of Fun.... Needs More.... People.This is quite a Stratigic game. To win you have to destroy your enemy's carrier (The Big ship). To lose... just let them destroy your carrier (the Big ship you spawn on). Simple right? Wrong!The Ship is made up of various parts such as: Forcefield generator; Radar; Ammo Depot; ETC.Destroying any of these will inflict varied pain on the enemy team. on top of that some maps have special points such as healing stations that can be captured so that you do not have to retreat all the way back to your ship to heal.As far as gameplay related to other space fight games I can't tell you much as the only other game like this one that i have played is Star Fox: Assault (Yes I know thats a Bad Comparision but its my only one)Flight is slightly complex with you controling  4 dimesions of basic manuevering and a few special manuevers (180 flips, drifting, ETC.)from what i have noticed the matches will be quicker as you upgrade your gunship (or exosuit) because you can easily do more damage to the enemy's Carrier.One thing Ilove about this game is the customisation you can do to your ships. Tweaking this or that to make it just what you desire.THE ONLY CON SO FARplayer base appears to be under 10 peopleBUT>>>> this con can be fixed. How? you ask? BY BUYING THIS GAME'nough said			"

As the game is right now, we can easily figure out all the options and future progress before hand, and once a game is figured out, it usually loses its fun.

												Its a great mix of space sim and armored core like ship building.  You go in 4v4 matches against real players or bots.  There is an incredible amount of depth to be found both in ship building and tactical and strategy planning.  The objective of each team is to destroy parts off the enemies carrier.  Doing this will lower its health and harm the enemy team differently depending on which part gets destroyed.  Matches go from 10-20 minutes usually and you get plenty of money after every match to quickly upgrade or buy new parts.			"

												Ah, the game is hard, is it? I have trouble understanding how a game can be 'hard' when it's against other players. Doesn't that mean you're simply worse than other players? That's actually the only possible explanation. And GoD Factory doesn't hold your hand and equalize players like other games might. It's fair. You're rewarded for intelligence and strategy, and punished for stupidity and foolhardiness. It requires teamwork, initiative, audacity, and strategy. For players used to running around a 'multiplayer' match by themselves, killing enemies without regard to objective... sure, GoD Factory might be 'hard.' But since it's a PvP game, that can only mean they're playing it wrong. It's a more old-school game where you need to construct your ship with some goal in mind, formulate a plan on the fly to fulfill that goal, and execute it with only your balls and your brain. So far, the game has had a smooth launch - compared to most other games we've been seeing - and the few bugs it has are easily worked around. It's exquisitely balanced. It's gratifying to see devs who obviously spent way more time honing gameplay than polishing pointless bits and bobs to make it look 'nice' while playing like crap. Sure, it's rough, but it runs smooth in all the right places. It renews my faith in game devs to see this game launch with such well-tuned, challenging, rewarding gameplay. So - you want gameplay? This game is all about gameplay. You want teamwork? This game requires it. You want just the right amount of mechanics to make strategy worthwhile? GoD Factory has that too. It's well-balanced, fine-tuned, and a heck of a lot of fun. I have not had this much fun in a PvP game since I was playing mods for Half-Life. The negative reviews on this game are more of a reflection on the incompetence of this generation of gamers more than the game itself.			"

												Being a fan of Star Wars Galactic Starfighter (aka GSF), I was looking for a standalone space combat game that offered a similar feel, with more customization.  It was this title that won out over several others I own.  The ships themselves are so unique in design, and the environment is very immersive.  As far as gameplay, I find it quite engaging.  As I have not played the game extensively yet, I cannot provide an in-depth review of every aspect.  Nonetheless, considering price and content, I highly recommend this title to fans of space combat.  My only complaint is that the game can be a bit confusing and things are not always intuitive.  Having stated that, when I requested assistance through the company's ""Contact Us"" address, I received an accurate and helpful response within less than an hour!  The developers are very engaged and support their product fully, a product they should be in my opinion, very proud of!Update 01/20/1016: After almost 100 hours into this game, I can definitely rates as one of my favorite space combat games by far.  Ship design allows for almost endless flexibility and though the controls take some getting used to, it is worth every moment of effort!			"

												This game is confusing to play. It is also seemingly designed to be hostile to new players.When you start, you are instructed to select two of the four starting ships solely based on a text description with no idea on how they operate in an actual game.The starting ships also start without a secondary ability, but you have one in the tutorial. So new players are penalised for joining a game without trying to navigate the equip / buy menus.It would be better if new players got four fully kitted out ships at game start so they can experiment with which ones the actually want to fly.Bad/New players are further penalised by the respawn system. If one of your two main ships die, you have to use a low quality drone ship in it's place for the rest of the up to 21 minute match. Imagine if in dota, when your hero died you had to play as a creep for the rest of the game. That is what happens here.It's difficult to figure out where all the players are. You seemly can't see enemies that are outside your personal detection range except as small dots on a minimap where is a hard to even see where you are, which makes intuitive team co-ordination harder. When you are attacking the enemy carrier, its hard to tell what is attacking you, a turret or an enemy player(s). It's hard to tell what you are being hit by at any time, your only clues are 1. your health is depleting 2. Sounds are happening. The general lack of information makes it hard to decide what to do at any given moment.The game needs a 'simple' mode that new players start off on. Featuring smaller capitol ships without internal components, less attackable components and easy to access / multiple hangers so it's easier to navigate. And you main ships respawn after a minute or so, so you don't get stuck with drones a few minutes into the game.Also, the ship customisation is really not something to be excited about. The only interesting parts are the two abilities you can choose and the two to three weapons you can equip. There are also another 6+ parts like 'thrusters' that change a bunch of numbers. It would be better if you just picked the ship, abilities, and weapons.Also, new players are penalised by the 'Grade' system where you can level up your parts to get better parts, so older players have better ships and more experience at playing the game.Also there are no tooltips in the shop, so you have to enter each weapons screen to figure out what is does instead of waving your mouse over the icons.The quick join button isn't 'quick'. Quick play sends you to a random game, where you have to then set yourself onto a team, wait for players to ready up and then the host has to be awake to start the game. It would be great if a queue system was implemented, where it automatically places players together and starts the game.It's probably a great game for premade teams that setup skype that have unlocked all the ship parts, but that's probably going to a small % of any player base, it doesn't make sense to design any game to them first.The art style and music are great. I would really like the play a game that controlled and looked like this that wasn't a team based dota-like.			"

												this game is just fun. short and fast action in full customizable ships to aim for different strategies. learning curve is a bit steep, but that is some of the games special style. just never hesitate to ask. the community is small but humble. :)			"

												Fly with a ship and be responsible for taking the right or wrong piece of spaceship into the battlefield.  It deserves a lot of attention to tweak every gunship parts available and you can either choose to enhance the versatility of two species or to develop the whole culture of spatial craft from the four species/gunship types.It can be very exciting to play with players.   Playing solo is also entertaining.  For hardcore gamers !  When you destroy your two available ships, you have replacement gunships that are weaker.  It is very frustrating when you lose both of your very own crafted ships on the first half of the match but a good player lobby allows an easy simple balancing of the level of difficulty encountered by each team at the beginning of every match.

												Combat Flight games have always been a favorite of mine, soaring around in a fighter at high speeds and getting kills is an adrenline rush like nothing any other game can give.GoD Factory: Wingmen gives this rush. Like a flying MOBA, it pits you against 4 other units, Bot Controlled Or Human, with Objectives to take, areas to control and unique abilities and weapons to utilize in tandem. Everything is based on your own playstyle, your team.The customization is high, with each part having various stats and abilities attached to it, as well as 4 different stages that affect its overall performance. Controls are tight, they react extremely well with just a Keyboard/Mouse. Graphically the game is gorgerous. The games only downside as of right now is it's extremely Tiny community.I highly recommend anyone who likes action, who likes teamplay, who enjoys getting a change of pace in their games, to Buy GoD Factory:Wingmen.

												I would recomend this game to EVERYONE, those who like: a good game, a space game, a versus/competitive game would like this one, it is indeed quite small, there are few maps, and the objective is always the same, like a MOBA, but better, you have more options about how to win, how to play and the customization/graphics are awesome (both customization AND graphics), the effects are beautiful and the gameplay itself is easy and fun, a little hard to master, as a good game must be.

												From what i've played so far i can say that this game's controls are tricky but amazing, it looks very slick..Only two issues for me are :- The game needs more modes, maybe a solo mode of little mission to get used to flying or like bases on asteroids idk..- Sadly that's not up to the devs, but the community needs to be bigger, i've only been able to play with bots so farThe game looks really slick, i can't wait to have the Oculus Rift to try it with this =)This makes me wish a space mmorpg with these controls would be incredible (basically EVE Online, but with a fun gameplay)			"

												In short, this is 3d shooter-maneuver game with 4x4 lobby action.Features:* 1 v 1 space mothership battle in space* getting and choosing upgrades for your ships* using two customizable in-battle abilities* coordination with your [up to 3] teammates* running away from angry enemies who don't like you near their mothershipPros:* not Yet Another World War 2 Simulation with ""real planes"" which is disbalanced* not Yet Another Game Pretending To Be Space Sim (space simulations do not exist)* upgrades for ships are directly influencing your balance levels and showed in percentage weight of your team setup - easier team setting* maps are quite big, with jumps and regeneration zones (though I did't get in everything this yet)* 4 races with only 2 slots leaves you with at least 6 combinations [but usually much more setups]* after you get your hand with it, allows you establish your team for fighting more skillful and good teams* weapons allow you to choose different combat role* unique: weapon powers combinations* unique: power-heat-weight ship balancingCons:* no single player things -  it is MP game* not fun to be played with bots - obviously, as it is same as Counter-Strike in space* game not have much popularity [yet], but there is always some guys in lobbyVerdict: Counter-Strike in 3d is unique game idea, which no other product offers. If you are bored with every other game, try this.Best played with joystick+kbd, but mouse+kbd or gamepad is good viable play style.			"

Posted: August 31, 2014
												I honestly had never heard of this game until the day before it went live.  After watching a couple of vids, pre-ordered it on the spot.  I've never done a review on Steam before, but I really wanted to put in my two cents about this game.  Here it goes:First here is a description of what the game actually is:  Online Team-based PvP Multiplayer,  Online Team-Based bot Multiplayer,   There is only one map currently, only one game-type currently (Take out their carrier before they take out yours), 4 different classes of ships (Glass cannon, Support, Bomber/bruiser, Tank/Support), progression system similar to that of Warframe (Leveling up ship components levels up your pilot rank, leveling up your pilot rank unlocks new ship components), High octane space-combat.[6-10] Pros: [8] Graphics quality:  While this is no Star Citizen, the games looks absolutely beautiful without being too demanding on my rig.[9] Art-style: I love this game's art-style.  It feels like Zone of the Enders meets Wildstar. To my knowledge, their is no space sim currently out or in development with this style.  It's a refreshing add to the genre.[7] Progression System: The model they used is an excellent progression system in my opinion.  Fight to earn XP-->XP levels up your ship components-->level up your ship components to get Pilot Rank XP-->Ranking up unlocks ship components-->buy and equip your new components-->Fight to earn XP.[8] Gameplay:  This game is fun to play.  The combat has that ""ZING"".  You feel your thrusters ripping your ship through space.     You feel your munitions slamming into your opponent's hull.  [10] Tutorial quality/Learning Curve:  Not too steep of a learning curve.  The devs have included a nice tutorial, which awards you with in-game credits for each peice you complete. After completing the tutorial, you will not only know how to control that space ripping flight we talked about earlier, but you will also have enough credits to buy all the components needed to build an entire ship. [7] Price:  The game is $20.  If you pre-ordered it, you got 2 copies for $20.  Maybe the devs could have given us one or two more maps, but even though they didn't, I would say the game is worth the $20.Oculus Rift support:  I can't rate this portion because I don't have a Rift dev kit, but I felt like the fact that it has the support needed to be mentioned.[1-5] Cons:[1] Depth:  This game does not have much depth.  There is one game-type, and there is one map.  There is no single player compaign.  Can't see myself playing this game longer than a week or two before I put it down for a while.[4] Match time: Because each team's carrier is attacking the other throughout the match,  each match will last only a maximum of 25 minutes.   In my experience, most matches are done in ~10 minutes.  At the end of most matches, I don't feel like I got enoughy time in the game to satisfy me.[7.5] Overall:  I nerded out and dropped 20 hours into this puppy in two days.  I will probably toss another 10 hours at it over the next day or so.  Unfortunately, the game isn't going to keep me going for much longer.  Hopefully the devs will come out with some new content in the near future.			"

												Other then some usual hiccups with a new game hitting a large market this is a fun take on so many F2P space games.  Yet there is no microtransactions who would have though it was possible.  There is a solid leveling system with a large number of parts and each parts has 4 different qualities that you can upgrade to just by earning mastery points from using them in combat.This games 4v4 matchs (PvP, or Co-op) focus pretty heavily on team play with many modules benefitting team mates as well as yourself.  With attacking and defending of your carrier creating some real back and forth game play.			"

												9.5/10GoD Facotry: Wingmen is the space shooter i've been waiting for, and with only 7 developers they knocked it out of the park. when it was released i got everything i had hoped for. First off, there is someone in global chat all the time to help with any issues anyone is having and response time for bugs and glitches is the fastest i've seen, 2 issues were fixed on day one after being brought up that very day. The detail in this game is amazing and customization is hella fun and allows you to make your ship however you want it. The soundtrack is awesome and graphics are gorgeous. My only issu is that there is only one game mode and map so it can get a bit repetitive, but the faced paced action and small places you can get into to escape push that out of my mind. Get this game, it deserves a lot more attention. Love this game, totally worth every penny, will not disapoint!EDIT: Developers plan to add new maps, game modes, and environments in the future.			"

												It's a very nice game. Spaceships combat 4v4 with the objective of destroying enemy's base. 4 different races and great customization, you can only choose 2 basic ships in the beginning but while you rank up and you'll be able to buy different parts for your ships or even create others and mix pieces of different races in order to create your personal ship. Controls are not very familiars but with a bit of pratice you can master your ship quite well and even make some kill. This game is not meant to be a pure Fps, so strategy is required and much collaboration. There's only one map but i think that they will be added as soon as population grows up and shows interest. Maybe playing many hours alone could get boring btw if you have some friend and you can play together and coordinate your attacks this game gets really awesome and i recommend it. Yeah also play tutorial and gameplay will get much clearer.			"

Basically you equip higher class parts, because no matter of them fuction higher parts are better. Then you atack enemy capital parts or defend yours.			"

												This is a review from someone using a gamepad:This game is pretty fun. It's very remiscent of the last Star Fox game except online. Although you do have the option to play with just bots in practice matches, however you still level up in these although I'm not sure if the rate is lower or not. Controls: I'm not used to have a multitude of buttons to press to be effective let's be real here most set ups use a few schemes and that's it. Get that notion out of your head every single button on your gamepad you WILL be using. With that being said it can get and feel very hectic. Graphics: Nothing cutting edge but pretty and does it's job. Wish the explosions were a bit more there, this is no Star Citizen but then again it doesn't aim to be. Music: After a few matches I just lowered the music volume and threw up my Zune software to listen to music whilst being murdered by those better than me. Gameplay: It's a 4 on 4 match with the objective of destroying the opponents Ship. There are numerous ways to do this by taking out certain parts of the enemies ship. Again even if those of you that aren't all that great there are smaller things that you can take care of: Your team want to go for the generator? Go take out those pesky guns that damage them while they go do their thing. Customization: Good lord it's pretty deep for the pricetag at least in my opinion. Different color pallettes, each Gun/Weapon/Missle has 5 different Mastery levels that you'll invest into with both credits and the usual using of the weapon. Balance: Not sure on this front; I've only played a few public games and everything seemed balanced besides the teams themselves usually see a team at 70% vs 40% which is the indicator of the 'weight' of the team.All in all the game is definately wirth the 20.00 now enough about the review time to jump back in the game.

												Positives -It's balanced, it's incredibly fun and nice looking, and it plays so well with a variety of controls (I'm presonally enjoying the gamepad). Some complaints I've noticed seem to be that you NEED a joystick for the game, but that simply isn't the case. I absolutely sucked at flying in the X franchise, and even the Star Trek games on PS1, but even I've grasped a lot of the flight controls enough to play well on this game. It doesn't detract from the game for anyone who's familar with 6DOF games whatsoever.Really love how the matches play out and I think it has a lot of potential for small groups of friends, it's one hell of a LAN party game.For those who like some meat and depth to the tactical side of their dogfighting sims, this DOES have it. I personally think that the damage types and combos page of the wiki is a good example of this, check it out: http://god-factory-wingmen.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_TypesHell yeah I reccomend this game!Drawbacks -I was hoping for Armoured Core style parts and ship customisation, but I don't think theres as many parts as I would have liked to see. I do think it's awesome that each part has an actual model, as I hate games that offer 100's of items that all look the same, but a little bit more variety would really help draw in more contested ship building between players.

												Pros:-Easy to run, great looking, solid control setup for a variety of control schemes. Input friendly, can use multiple inputs at the same time (mouse, keyboard, joystick, footpads, you name it). -Gameplay is solid and fast paced, with a wide variety of ships to choose from. You can customize ships from a good variety of weapons, wings, and hulls among 4 races. Long range snipers, stealth bombers, close quarters tanky ships, and interceptors are all very possible to build. Some races and hulls favor other roles above others.- 4v4 PVP or with bots, always a nice option for more relaxing gameplay or getting the hang of the map.Cons: to me, the ""manuvers"" and boost cheapen the whole dogfighting experience. Any ship can do an almost instantaneous flip, which turns a good portion of fights into ""streak past them and flip around and shoot them and boost away to go repair"".-Only 1 map, with 1 game mode. Granted it is a big map, with a lot of objectives and varying ways to win the match. But still.			"

												super cool right up until you encounter bugs which make it all but impossible to play. first if the game doesnt start if your about to start a match or by trying out the tutorial and crashes do this Go to steam Menu bar2. Click Right on icon ""God Factory"" > Properties3. Click SET LAUNCH OPTION...4. Insert ""-force-opengl""and for the love of god dont delete the starter ships it will not let you make new ones thus preventing you from playing the game after that until they decide to fix that particular bug. otherwise very fun id recommend this game when they fix the prevention of making new ships if you delete your starters but until then its a nonow a simple fix has been implemented for noobs like me who delete all their ships wont do that again. as i said in the comment below its super fun			"

												If Kinetic Void and Strike Vector had a baby, this would be it-10/10Sure, at first the control layout is a little weird, however unlike most games the Mapping is incredibally easy, on most computers the game is fluent and smooth.Its gameplay stands up more than first advertized, you can develop tactics and create your ship for certain roles.Exellent game, go try it out.

												GoD Factory: Wingmen is a 4v4 team based space ship shooter.  If you have played Strike Vector, you'll be right at home, but with a major difference; your objective is not to merely kill the opposite team but to destroy their large Carrier Ship before they destroy yours.There are many parts to each of the Carrier Ship on both teams, each part brings along with it a penalty if it is let destroyed by the opponent.  For example, the enemy team will have 30% less ammo capacity if you destroy their Ammo Warehouse.This is a small game, with only 1 map and 1 game mode, but what really set this game above others is the level of customization for your ships.  If you are a fan of mech games like Mech Warrior, you will enjoy the level of customization here.  For newer players, perhaps building the ship is as easy as putting the highest rank parts they can on their fighter, but as you play more you will find additional challenges on balancing the ship as merely adding high level parts will not only put your ship overweight, overheat, or over energy consumption, but your ship will also lack focus in their role on the team.This is a game that I highly recommend to give a try if you enjoy space ship customization - did I mention that the graphics are very nice and that the details on each ship part is very cool looking?  also it has a very nice cosmetic colouring system.  At the moment of this review, the game's player base is a bit low, going up to a peak of 100 or so players at night more me (EST).  But unless people take an interest in the game and try it out this game would not fly.All in all, I really recommend this game, but if the price is too steep for 1 game mode and 1 map, I would suggest putting it on your wish list and wait for a deal, this is a very under appreciated and under populated game.

												I only played a short amount during the beta but I did enjoy the general mechanics and gameplay. I liked the idea of needing to change your ship part way through in order to change and update your strategy and inorder to actually repair and replenish your ships meaning that you had to be aware of your ships various levels.Overall I was happy with the game in it's beta form.

												This game is very addictive. I would suggest playing about 4 games, take a break, continue another 4, then take a break again. Rinse and repeat. If you go more than that, it becomes quite repititive.On the other hand, the controls need some getting used to for the keyboard and mouse. My first and second game went horribly due to flying issues. But after that, I actually loved the flying. It was challenging and you have to pay attention to the mini map WHILE making sure you don't ram into debris. If you love challenges, this is the game for you.Customisation in this game is fantastic. Graphics are brilliant even on medium. I have yet to try low. I like the unlocking credits and colours through achievements. I find this concept smart. A sense of reward for the players, make them feel like it is worth hunting achievements unlike other games.You absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY ... cannot solo. Unless you outlevel everyone else by what?  3 levels? I dunno. Not very fun smashing newbies unless you need a serious boost in ego.The community is quite friendly surprisingly... Well, so far.Hope they add more stages like racing, capture the flag, hunt the rabbit (kinda like a treasure hunt, looking for a particular ship or asteriod or something), co-op against a crazy alien race etc.			"

												Shot down my friends, fought with spiteful bots, crashed into the dock wall, got a drone, pwned the other team. Would pwn again anytime.The ultimate spaceship dogfighting game so far that I've seen, GoDF Wingmen delievers here an immersive and delciously realistic view of a futuristic battlefield. The gameplay is smooth, you really feel like you're in the gunship, and the weapons system and customization keeps the game intreresting. Think League of Legends, except you are in a spaceship with extremely powerful weapons and complete control of your movement. Think Star Fox, except with complete freedom of your movement and an even stronger Star Wolf than ever before.Ignore the guys below who say ""it's better to plug in a controller"": you can change how sensitive you mouse is to your movements to your liking. I also found the controls easy to get used to and not clunky in any way. It is true that the game is dying due to the lack of new content, but there are still a couple of players around, definitely enough to start a game with in Steam's system. The graphics are just off the charts. Every little detail about being in a gunship and flying in a carrier just strikes me as amazing. Flying inside a carrier reminds me of Star Fox 64's Venom, except with complete freedom to smash into the walls and shoot whatever the heck you want. The only real complaint I have here is that there is no mode except cooperation, that you can't go around being a juggernaut or free-for-alling each other in the depths of space.You want to be the Guy? Go play this game. It'll give you all the awesomness you want.			"

 Strategic Space Battles I recommend this game if the idea of intelligent competitive space fights appeal to you. The concept is deeper and better than just blowing up the other ships. Strategy is important as just randomly killing won't be enough. You need to think and plan in order to gain and keep the advantage during the match all the way to the end. With multiple ships at your disposition, you can quickly switch to make sure you have the right tool for the kind of job you're planning or to adapt to enemy movements. All in all, it's great fun that can only get better.			"

												You know all those arena games that say they're the arena game for when you don't like arena games? This is such an arena game.Skill-friendly to maneuver and slightly less build-restrictive since you level outside of matches. Definitely still just as convoluted though, but its accessibility plays it down a bit. Great customization options. Want a ship that's basically a melee fighter? That can happen. Want to nuke things from a distance? Sure thing. Be mindful of teamwork: Always go for the objective, K/D means nothing in this game.

			I take a quick look @ 'GoD Factory: Wingman' - This is one of those mulitplayer games that is hard to master but satisfying to pull off! Just imagine a multiplayer version of the classic Starfox.		

Just imagine a 4 v's 4 player version of the classic Starfox where each team has to destroy their opponent's capital ship. The game itself looks gorgeous and the craft you fly feel like they have been taken right out of your favourite manga. The more you play, the better you get... it's as simple as that.No lenghty tutorial is going to prepare you for the task ahead, it's brutal but oh-so satisfying once you start to master it. Nothing comes close to pulling off a cool maneouver and getting your 1st kill. If your not willing to put the time and effort into this game then fool on you.... and you'll miss out on a great experience. - Enjoy!			"

												Do Not Buy.  This is a Grind to level up and unlock ship parts system, But there is only one map in the game, and one game type ((blow the other carrier up))   That's all this game is, Also it has a bad lobby system ;pThis game needs more game types or if the main mode is going to be this carrier assault mode, more carriers to make it random.  At very least team deathmatch and free for all, and setting up lobbies so you can min and max levels of the ships people can use.This doesn't feel at all like it's finished, and it's going to need a lot more then just bug fixing.

												So far, this game is like HAWKEN is space. Fast action, but with only one play mode for now. You have different parts you can install, and they all give different levels of pros and cons to the overall craft. The mechanics are pretty easy to translate if you have played anything like Armored Core, Chromehounds, or HAWKEN in the past. Again, so far, I am having a lot of fun with it, and I'd give it a green light if you like games liek the previously mentioned. Visuals: The game is only about 800MB in size, so they spent more time on mechanics than actual graphics, which are still pleasing, and at the same time, not overly flashy. The game is both TPS and FPS depending on preference, with which both are aesthetically pleasing.              I'd give it a 7-10 for a game that is within the $20 range.Audio: Surprise surprise, the soundtrack is fast paced, and engaging. I really enjoy hanging out in the menus, just listening to the ambiance while upgrading a new part to the Mark II or Mark III versions. And in combat, the music is neither distracting, nor does it take away from the gameplay. I really dig the tracks, and I think anybody that plays arcade games or sims will enjoy it.              I will give this a 8-10 for a game within the $20 range, and much praise for what that $20 buys you.Gameplay: So the AI isn't the smartest, or super adaptive as the AAA titles (Joke much?) But the game applies some serious power to the bots if you don't have a complete 4 V 4 match with PCs. The controls have a slight learning curve, but with the choice of flightstick, X360 gamepad and Keyboard/mouse, coupled with the intergration of the Oculus Rift support, you can have a blast at your own speed. YOu really need to learn the tricks to survive very long out there.             I give the game a 7-10 for the learning curve, but once you get past it, sensitivity is adjustable to suit you.Overall score: All things considered, I am going to give GoD Factory: Wingmen a 7.6 out of 10. The price is right where it needs to be. The gameplay isn't overbearing, and it's intuitive with the choice in multiple input preferences. Audio is spot on for a game that cost's you $20, which brings depth to the game, and with 7:1 audio, the firefights are pleasing. The game gives you paint schemes and in-game credits for completing achievements, and tutorials, which prods yout o want to get that one extra takedown. So far, the game has no mod support, nor Trading Cards, which bumped the score a little, but still. Very satisfying, good way to kill some time. Go get it!Be sure to check out my Youtube for more of this review!

												Oh what can I say about this lovely peace? Played through both betas/alphas and still can't get enough of this game! If you're like me and have noticed the lack of fast paced (or very fast paced) space fighting/pilot games that you can get home from work, jump right on it and slide right into a match! Then you'll finally be satisfied!! This game has grown so much in the short few months that i've discovered it. At the rate it's growing in a another short few months im sure this game will seem like a whole new game all over again because of all the new content.  TL;dr:  this game has come along way! and will grow even faster in the future and become even better then it is now. Hop on this train to success it only gets better from here!On to the acutal ingame review. One word comes to mind.. REFRESHING!  The acutal flying feels slick and well thoughtout each system you create is its own monster to control and learn all over again to perfect and mirror your own flight style. This game rewards the indiviudal who says, ""I want my role to be _____, allow me to make that.""and this game delivers. I wanted a long range bomber, bam! had one! Then I was like, I want a (in your F*ing face tank monster of doom) and just like that I was able to make it so.  The flight controls in this game are yours for the taking wether it be joystick input or mouse everything is crisp and responsive and makes you feel at comfortable, but also enough (edge) there to make it feel like these ships have their own personality. (which they do.. and that personality is what ever you want it to be.)   TL;dr pt.2  Buy the F*ing game already and get into the battle and kick some a$$! "

												Project Sylpheed meets Battlefront II's space battles. The multirace mechanic provides pretty diverse gameplay for something like this, and the number of parts means that you can mitigate some of the negatives associated with each race or go for something very specialized.It's just a shame that quick battles bother to have a lobby, since teamstacking is almost unavoidable. It's a very fun game when it works and the teams are balanced, but it's difficult to get to that stage.(also, there are AI battles, and the AI isn't completely mindless most of the time. I've seen a lot of people grind up on these and then go play multiplayer when they are ready, with better gear.)Personally, I enjoy it.			"

												Pro’s•	Fun and challenging space combat •	Tactical gameplay encourages teamwork•	Good combat co-ordination tools•	Ship creation with lots of possible builds and little to no “simply better” components•	Generally good balancing (some items still need tweaking)•	Relatively quick progression through tech tree (17 hours and have unlocked most items on at least basic level)•	Reasonable AI opponents for when you want to play solo•	A blast to play with a joystickCon’s•	Lacklustre match making•	Team balancing is left to individuals leading to wildly unbalanced games•	One game mode (although it is really good)•	Minor bugs (that I have noticed) Picked this up on pre-order and gave a copy to a friend, we have been playing every night since.To be clear: there is only one game mode, which in short involves destroying your opponent’s carrier before they destroy yours. Destroying an enemy’s carrier involves taking out key components each of which have a certain effect on your opponents team when destroyed, ergo choosing the right areas to go after is key and will vary from match to match depending on your team and opponents.  Each component (except the core) is worth one health point (two for the core), additionally every three minutes the carriers main guns will fire reducing your opponents health points by one. Provided you get into a well balanced match (see below) this game mode is deep enough and challenging enough that it does not get stale, so while additional game modes would be appreciated (and I hope being worked on) the existing mode is good enough that it will offer many hours of gameplay.Ships and components are generally very hard to take down and (with some exceptions) can be repaired or will regenerate. Each player starts the game with two gunships (only one can be active at a time) of their own design, however each gunship has only one life. If you lose a gunship it is replaced with a low level drone which can be used instead, and each time you die you have an increasingly long respawn. The combination of these penalties encourages a hit and run style gameplay that focuses on preserving your ships (a refreshing change from many games which have little to no penalty for dying) and makes taking out an opponents gunship a potential game changer.Co-ordination is achieved by using an action wheel style system which tends to work better than trying to type in commands in chat and has options for attacking or defending all major components of the carriers. While those using voice chat will still have some advantage you can generally co-ordinate with a group of other players enough that you stand a fighting chance regardless.Ship creation uses a parts system. There are 4 distinct races (in terms of abilities, general stats and gameplay roles) with different primary abilities and ship components. There are 12-13 key components (depending on if you have one or two wing weapons) and each of these has at least 3 components (generally more) and some of these can be shared between the races. Each component has a further 4 ranks that can be unlocked (each generally a straight upgrade on the last), leading to a large number of possible configurations. Generally speaking there aren’t many cases of a part simply being better than another (there are a few notable exceptions) so its not simply a race to get parts higher on the tech tree, a part low on the tech tree is still likely to have benefits over a higher item on the tech tree at the same rank. Regardless of this parts are generally easy to unlock (both in terms of credits and experience) and at 17 hours of gameplay I have unlocked a large number of parts, including the ace level parts, the resistance is about right to keep you wanting to unlock more components but not so slow that you feel like your grinding.This games major downfall is in the matchmaking and balancing. Each ship you build is given a class, higher classes are generally better than lower ones (plus or minus some allowance for build methodology). When you drop into a lobby the classes of all players ships are displayed along with a balance indicator for each team (based on the combined score of each players ship classes), unfortunately at the time of writing that’s it, 7 of you playing with class one and two ships and someone drops in with two class 8’s, not much you can do other than kick them from the match. The game does not seem to account for a players highest ship class nor does it allow you to search for high or low level matches, so it is normal for high level players to drop in with low level players, which even if the teams can be balanced will end with the lowest level players being made into mincemeat (not much fun). As a work around to getting face rolled by ace level pilots you can play matches against AI’s for money and XP until you are at a reasonable tech level but it’s not an ideal solution. It does seem however that this would be relatively easy to fix and I hope it is presently being worked on.There are occasional crashes and bugs to be contended with, but this close to launch that was to be expected, there aren’t a lot of game breaking bugs (other than a crash on load glitch that one of my friends encountered but a quick look at the forum found an easy workaround). Every now and then you may have to restart the game due to the game freezing or an issue with the in game store not correctly debiting your credits correct (the Database Error glitch). None of these should discourage you from buying the game as they are about on par with what would be expected of all games close to release.The game in its current state is really worth the $20 odd dollar price tag, its minor downfalls are exactly that: minor, and easily corrected. All of which are overshadowed by well thought out gameplay, good balancing and reasonable progression.See you in my crosshairs-Fallingdreamer.			"

												Pros:Fast paced pvp space combat. Easy to learn flight controls, perfect for joystick (but maybe too fast for them). Each race has their own specialty and ship customization. Cons:Game can use more maps and destructable Capital ships or Megastructures. More ship components. Some massive PvE or campaign. Matching and Lobby room need more fine tuning.I really recommend this game but at the moment, the player base is somewhat dead. Need a second breath of life and we're in business. Real good game, just need more content.			"

												A really good space fighter game, with teamwork playing a huge role in the game. Graphics are amazing, and the game handles well. Ship building is great, and a key feature. And it REQUIRES you to work with your team to achive victory! So no ""Lone Wolf""ing. Unless you like losing.However the games main flaw is its lack of players. Sadly the game is not popular as of 9/19/14, and at most 20 players are online. Very hard to find a match, and for  now playing with bots is all that goes on.			"

												Great fast paced arcady style space combat.  Ships can take a lot of damage before going down, and the boost/manuver system lets you make sudden escapes.  This is good because you really want to keep your ships alive. Once they are destroyed, they are gone for the rest of the match, and you get a weaker drone to replace it, but with a little teamwork you are still valuable. The ships are well balanced, and have a amazing amount of customization.			"

												as othere said, the multiplayer is dead.. but this isn't the only reason why i refunded it. the graphics are a sore to look at. especially ships. they're so overly-engineered(and in a visual way not in a practical way) that its just... WTF am i looking at!? is it a ship? a human? a sexy space alien girl that shoots lazers? the UI.. isn't informative. and the ships are just way too fast.  the combat is not ''small agile ships dog-fighting'' its A-10's dog-fighting with only their miniguns at mach 1! (remember A-10 isn't fast in real life and thats kinda what makes its mini-gun work) its not that i can't react in time.. its that after i start to shoot i'm already past the enemy without doing much damage.. and controls are.... clunky.

												If anyone thinks that this is space shooter with tactical element, then he or she is dead wrong. It's a really a MMORPG arena under the thin space shooter skin. Don't buy this game if you expect a space shooter.But even if you're into this genre - there's this off-putting progression system. You need to grind to unlock ship parts and you need to grind to upgrade them. And you will need to - ship stats DO matter in this game a lot, One can spend most of the ammo reserves and still barely scratch the enemy if level disparity is high enough.Speaking of level disparity - this game lacks even the most basic matchmaking system. I have regularly seen matches with coordinated teams of lvl 7-8 ships vs random new players with default ships. These matches are as fun and unpredictable as you can imagine. More polish from developers and community effort might make it a good game in the future, but for now I would not recommend it. Save your money and time for better game.			"

												Upddate:They have since fixed the drop issue and it is now rare for a player to be dropped mid game.Unfortunately, my recommendation of don't buy still stands due to new developments.  Namely, their release method.Because GOD Factory was marketed as a full release and was recieved with the same expectations, the vast majority of the gamer base lasted a grand total of 1 week.  This is in part to the game breaking drop bug, as well as the single map/game mentioned in my original post.  With no replayability and complete loss of confidence, the average size you can expect to see playing the game at any one time is around 20-40 players.  This makes it difficult to get a good match going without having to resort to bots.  With such great mechanics and graphics, it's a shame that this game failed so hard.  From a developer standpoint, i think it would be great if they could continue to recieve the support they need to make a truly great game, but from a player/buyer standpoint, I don't think they're taking this anywhere soon and thus it isn't worth the buy.Previous:Given that this game is advertised as a final product/full release, I definitely do not recommend the game AT THIS TIME!  Primary Reason:  The game is basically incapable of going more than two matches without dropping players from a match, turning a decent game of 4v4 into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game of chance wondering which team will be down a man in 5 minutes. With the frequent crashes and drops, not to mention the SINGLE map and match type, this game barely even qualifies as a beta, and i certainly regret paying $20 for it.  Though that's more because it decietfully advertised as a full release.If the drops could be fixed and at the very least more maps/carriers are implemented to keep the game interesting, then absolutely buy this game. Here's why.  The customization options are incredible, as well as the way the parts are unlocked.  In some cases, yes parts you get later are better, but that's not true for all of them.  For example a human level 1 part still serves as the best bomber component in the game.  You do work to get up to higher tiers on any given part, but a few matches in and you're there.  Basically it's a trial run on lower levels and reduced cost to see if you even want to invest in a new component.Not only do the parts' abilities differ, but there's a visible difference on the ship you place, which affects the tight areas you can fly through or crash into.  The color's also turned out to be a nice feature as sometimes you want to hide against the dark background or look big and shiny so people try to avoid you.  The controls are amazing, though you may want to alter the default mouse/keyboard bindings.  Handling does actually make a noticable difference in how sharp you can turn.  The weapon types have different visuals and effects, and teamwork is encouraged by the very nature of the damage they do.When a ship dies, it's gone for the match and replaced with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drone.  Personally I think that's awesome as it encourages you to play a bit more tactfully and try to get your ships out of a sticky situation alive.  Otherwise it would simply be suicide mission one after the next.  Even after you get drones, you are still disuaded from this tactic as the respawn time continues to grow.  Ammo is a bit small, especially for an attacking ship supporting bombers, and requires frequent trips back to the docking bay.  I understand the necessity of it though as it keeps the ships swarming around and not breaking off into small clusters throughout the match.  All in all, a decent concept when it's playable, but for now i stick by my recommendation.  Don't buy this game until they fix the connection issues.			"

												Unless you really love grinding through an awful progression system, playing with ♥♥♥♥ed design mechanics, and trying not fall asleep in terribly boring matches, I cant possibly recommend this game. The progression system is terribly slow, the game is only semi playable with a remote, and if you do get a remote, the matches are so generic and boring that you might as well spend your money elsewhere. The game would be reasonable as F2P, but I wouldent say anyone should pay any real money to play this game.			"

If you want to turn left, you can't just move your mouse to the left--you need to perform a combo maneuver in order for your ship to turn.There were also a grand total of 10 players in games and in lobbies when I tried playing.

												The game is great in theory.  Going into battle, getting better parts for ship, then go into battle stronger.   The game has two teams pitched against each other.  The point of the game is to destroy the opposite team member's mothership.  The mechanics, the graphics and the game's pitch are very good (again.. in theory).  What ultimately drove me to give a negative review to this game is the ship controls.  I am currently using a mouse and keyboard and it is very hard to do anything meaningful with any of the ships.  Compound this with extremely fast action and you get lost very fast.   To top it off, you are looking for certain parts on the mothership to disable to deny the enemy from certain benefits (like the ability to scan you from afar), you get there and you shoot and you shoot.. but... you can't completely stop the ship (I understand inertia in space - but there is no option to go in reverse so that I can either stop or go back) eventually leading your ship into the hull of the mothership.  It seems the developers spent a good deal of time creating this game but ultimately it is the gameplay that makes a game and like I said before unfortunately the game controls killed this game for me.

												Just a random space game which tricked me with the so-called ""ship sharing"".You actually go to the battle with 2 ships in your hangar, but only man one at the time. If you ship is destroyed it will be replaced by a underpowered version of your ship, or you can take the second ship of your hangar. The sharing option is just about your mates letting access to their hangar, but it's still 4 v 4 battles with 1 person/ship. Hugely disappointed. The controls feels ackward as well.			"

												I never thought I would not recommend this game but wow the lobby system on this game is god awful. You have to wait literally 30 minutes to play a match it is crazy!!! I finally got into a match and got kicked and said screw this. I waited quite a while to play this game finally bought it and im still not able to play it because the lobby is awful. I did play through the tutorial and it was amazing the playing that i did do in the turtorial was great i just wish i could actually play the real game but i dont have 30 minutes to sit and wait for a match then get kicked and wait another 30 minutes.--------------------------------------EditSo i finally got into a match and this game is not what i thought it was at all. I thought this game was a dogfighting space game and it is not that at all. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy base seems simple enought but it is not. You fly out into space and you have no real idea what is going on and you fly to the enemy base and just shoot at it that is the point to this game. I thought there would be much more to it but that is it. There really is no explanation of how to play the game i went thru the tutorials but they dont tell me anything about the enemy base and how to destroy it but the whole entire concept of the game is quite boring though. I feel like the developers of this game are not marketing it the way they should. They market it as a dog fight style space game but that is not what it is at all. You fly out into space and shoot at the enemy base. I thought this game was a arena type dog fight game but it is not it. The thing is i have been really excited about playing this game. I first saw it on youtube in a video about pax. The footage of the game looked incredible dont get me wrong the spaceship design is cool and the flying is great but the game is not .			"

The one match I did manage to get in, its not that great, Black Prophecy was much better aswell as completly free and it tanked a few years ago.

												The controls are insanely too sensitive on whatever settings, it feels like moving ontop of a icey surface with the most slippery pair of shoes in the world. Gameplay is nice, but the ability to aim is like trying to thread a needle from 10 miles away with a blindfold on. Sounds below average nothing special.Overall my current rating is a 3/10, if the controls were improved. Cause right now it feels like i want to vomit, on how slippery the controls and aim is. This will change whenever the update comes along.			"

												I have played a limited amount of this game so far, but in my opinion, the controls are horrible. I have tried playing with a keyboard and a xbox controller and iI have come to the conclusion that, the game handles much better with a controller. A nice idea, great art direction and pretty fun gameplay. BUT the controls are terrible. Nuf said			"

												No one plays this game anymore. It was fun, but it barely updates. I wanted to see this game succeed, and maybe it will some day, but right now , it's dead.  If you wana buy it, buy it for dev support purposes. You will go against bots more than actual players right now.			"

												One of the best space dogfighting simulators I've played. Just the right balance of arcadey physics with a real sense of control and maneuver, and the gameplay is surprisingly strategic; there's tons of interesting choices of whether to dogfight or attack the enemy carrier, which part to hit, how to build your ship. Good progression curve on both ship design and strategy. The only possible downside is that the community isn't as large as it should be- some times of day you'll have to settle for smaller matches because there just aren't enough players online. Hopefully that'll change soon.			"

Not to metion unlike most games like this the controls are really spot on a joystick is not needed i still prefer useing the joystick but it have great keyborad and mosue controls as well as control controls. The only issue with the game curently that i can find is not enough people have it and it can take a while to get a match going thats not all bots and its ♥♥♥♥ing fanstic game 8/10 money well spent i highly recommend it			"

												One of the better games of this genre. Very fast paced and tactical.I loved to play this back in the days but sadly it highly depends on other players and as there are very few others playing this now, you either have to wait for ages to find a game or you will get frustrated and deinstall.The developers should do a Free Weekend to get this game the attention it deserves and to raise the player base a bit.

												I played the weekend alpha (before it was on steam) when it came out a few years ago. It was the most fun I have ever had in a game like this. Sadly. when I opened the game today, I saw that I was the only person in the world who was playing. The complete lack of players is depressing...			"

												Update: Haven't played the game for a long time but it's obvious the game's struggling community has died off. Well, it was fairly dead even before it's first birthday really... Originally recommended the game but am changing my review to a no. Though I'll leave my thoughts on how wonderful the game was below. -This game is a beautiful space shooter Where a squadron of 4 work together to take down the enemy Carrier while engaging in dogfights against the enemy squadron. The game in my opinion has a heavy emphasis on teamwork which many games are sorely lacking. If you are shot down your ship is scrapped for the remainder of the match and is replaced with a much weaker drone which is a factor that supports the emphasis on teamwork by causing Lonewolf-like actions to pay a heavy price if failed.I would like to say that the costumization options for your ships is not entirely diverse but i feel that would be an unfair judgement since i'm comparing it to most FPS games where there are many more different things to customize. For a flight simulator there are more than plenty of parts and pieces to choose from when designing your ship. With that being said.There are plenty of different playstyles possible in this game and it all comes down to how you build your ship and how you and your teammates decide to playout the match. The game does a great job of providing different types of damage as well as having different effects for combining different types of damage. This not only provokes a player to equip various different weapons but helps give players a reason to work together when attacking a single target to combine effects in hopes of bringing the target down quicker and recieving higher scores which is essential for unlocking new parts and pieces for your ship.I like that the game is a sort of MOBA style and presents an objective while still providing benefits to dogfighting with other players.The fanbase atm is teeny tiny with no clear reason as to why the fan base has dropped. This is probably the only negative thing i would have to say about this game. But at the same time ive found this to be a positive thing as well. The player base is low but because of that all of the players are kind and cooperative with each other. Players are willing to talk befor a match and decide their plan of action. No one spouts random hate and trolling comments while waiting for the match to start. Sometimes when everyone is willing to wait for a full lobby you can be sitting there for quite a while so the friendly company is a welcomed difference from almost every competitive game ive ever played (Yes CoD i'm refering to you when i say this as well).The artwork is bright, colorful and everything you would expect from a space setting. While it may not be a great idea to play the game if you're epileptic the colors are far from overwhelming. Quite frankly space battles from Star trek are flashier than what you'll find in this game. The developers managed to find a happy medium between Beautiful artwork and not overwhelming ones eyes causing them to strain within 5 minutes.All in all i have to give this game an 8 out of 10. I have high hopes for the future and expect that rating to change to a 10 out of 10 before long			"
