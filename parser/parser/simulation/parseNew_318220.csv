 Developers Before I go into my review I need to tell you all some things. To put this in the nicest way possible, the developers are an unprofessional, and hypocritical team of failures. If you go into the forums or look at their facebook page you will notice that any negativity against them will result in a ""professional"" and instant lash towards you. In the community forums you will notice that they have whined about negativity towards their ""finished game"". You will also notice that they say they will listen and answer everyone who has a question. I have asked a couple of questions and got no answers from the developers. Only answers from other community members telling me that they do not answer anyone. This game has been abandoned for quite some time and left with bugs and barely any gameplay to justify the price. As far as we're all concerned, they're back to just fix the bugs, add a ""sandbox"" mode and then throw their hands up and be done with it.  I have been banned from the forums yesterday after talking about a promising sounding new police simulator called 'Police 10-13'. Apparently they can't answer questions, but do visit the forums frequently to find an excuse to ban people that don't hold their game in high regards. To be fair, part of what I talked about was how the developers making 10-13 are making themselves look and I quote ""like idiots"" because there are multiple things they are doing that professionals wouldn't do. And the ban is fair according to the rules. In short, I'm iffy about it like I should be after this farce. Only time will tell and I am still excited to see the news and its development.  With this said about the developers, please be very cautious about their new project 'CTU' (Counter Terrorism Unit). These developers are childish and are untrustworthy.  Story The only story there is is a quick intro scene saying that your father was great at being a police officer. After that you're thrown in with a pop up text tutorial and you figure out the rest. Gameplay While it's clearly clunky and buggy, it is fun for a while. I put in 8 hours before getting very bored. I went back into the game to see if anything was changed or added despite what people said just to make sure, and nothing has been done. All there is is just a few cars you unlock by entering 'codes'. Your duties will differ. You will give chase on foot, get into gunfights, set up speedometers, arrest drunks and those that have harmed others and sometimes break and enter homes that have been reported to have someone armed and dangerous. It's realistic to a very small degree and has potential. Before the game was released, it had a different name and had a lot more going in (more buildings, looked much more polished, basically everything that makes a game look good to hype it up in the beginning). If all that was there it would be really good. Sound Voice acting is terrible, music is very dull and on repeat, guns don't sound right etc. The sound isn't terrible, but it isn't good. And all of the talking past the introduction is silent and through text. Graphics  The graphics are basically a more polished GTA: San Andreas. Lighting is better and textures are smoother but not by much. It looks like one of the later PS2 games. Overall It's good in short bursts if you don't care for too much content but the bugs will irritate you enough to not want to play. With Police 10-13 planning on coming sometime in 2016 I would hold off. And there are other simulators much better than this one. The GTA IV police mod is the best one and there's an older and sillier simulation that feels complete as well called Police Force if you don't want to wait. But this ""simulator"" is worth $5 at best and even real police officers are voicing how bad this is. Get a better simulator or hold off for Police 10-13. Small Immediate Edit I've had this review written out for quite some time and could not post it up until now and have no idea why and so I saved it and waited. Now that I've finally been able to post it, please spread the word about not getting this game at any price. I have never fallen victim to bad developers as I'm usually good about asking for opinions and looking at whether the business is professional as well up until now. And again, it isn't because I was banned from the forums. I have nothing personal against that. Just their empty promises, lack of news and refusal to keep an open mind and accept the fact that not everyone will be happy and they screwed up badly is why I am bashing them directly. I hope my review helps and happy gaming!			"

												I hadn't purchased a game for full price in a long while, but was itching to try this one after watching Robbaz's (YouTuber) playthrough for it. I saw that it was on sale via the Humbebundle store for $14.99, so I purchased it there.The game is really fun, and if you like police simulators at all, you will enjoy this game - I will continue to play it and see how it develops. Unfortunately, however, I have to leave this at a ""do not recommend,"" because I feel very disappointed at the product I was presented with. The simplest way for me to have given Enforcer a ""thumbs up,"" would be for the developers to have this labelled as an early access/beta game. As an avid game reviewer, I CANNOT support this type of presentation. I have a fairly massive backlog of games in my library left to review (on top of my backlog of games to play), but I decided to bump this up to the very top, because I want as many people to avoid making the mistake I made in buying this game AND believing it to be a final, finished product. I went ahead and tried it out despite many of the negative reviews, but I implore everyone and anyone interested to wait to see whether or not the game actually develops further.Because quite obviously, this is a largely unfinished, barebones product. It both plays and feels like an early access game, and I would know, since I had a pretty potent early access game phase. Unlike the cesspool that is Starbound, I sincerely hope that the developers for Enforcer continue to work on the game, as it definitely has a lot of potential. Now, on to the meat of the review.The aesthetics are good, the detail in the environment and character models are decent. The rain effects are pretty weak, and there the vehicle damage is insignificant. There seems to be a very low pool of character models, with the main difference being the color of their outfits. The vehicle pool is also considerably tiny, and you will notice this very quickly. The sounds and music are average, but I prefer to play my own instead. While in your police cruiser, there will be chatter over the radio, but (again) that pool appears to also be small, so you will notice repetitions within the first hour of playing. The controls may take a bit of effort to get used to - there is a pop-up help menu right when you begin, and a super quick tutorial after you select your character sex and name. The help menu also provides descriptions for most of the things you can currently do in the world, and I strongly recommend you take a look through everything to properly orient yourself in the Enforcer world. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with police simulators. You can play the game on normal or realistic mode, the latter having permanent death and more rapid/frequent missions for you to do. I've played this game quite a bit and enjoyed it a lot, however, many of the game elements show the unpolished quality common in early access game builds. For example, the AI is very basic, and many times you might ask a car to pull over, only to have them rear-end another car. Of course, the sloppiness of the AI will fool you, as this event will NOT constitute as an offence of any sort (at least on top of whatever offence that particular NPC might already have committed). I've seen a car speed through a red light and drive straight into a civilian crossing the street (not hurting the walker in any way, oddly enough) and - after pulling him over - the only recorded offence was speeding. When you pull over vehicles - you can do so by toggling your cruiser's warning siren, or calling out on foot - you will be given a few options like: apply breathalyzer, write ticket, and check license and registration (this will show you any offences the driver has committed). Something I don't really like about the latter feature is that you can set up traffic cones to create a roadblock, then go through an endless lineup of cars and spam the ""check license and registration"" option. Even if the car had been speeding blocks away from you, you will magically know that they were speeding with your omniscient police powers. Note, that this is also a pretty cheap way to farm police points, which contribute to your police ranking (the higher your ranking, the more money you make after each shift, and the larger the variety of missions available to you).After pulling people over, you can arrest drunk drivers and either put them in your squadcar (to take them to the police station), walk them to the station, or call a police van. Calling a police van, ambulance, or tow truck will bring you to a loading-type screen, and everything will occur behind-the-scenes, then bring you back to real-time. I don't mind this, considering how quickly you can pull over and check cars. Some NPCs might flee if you ask then to step out of the vehicle, and a quick taser shot will make them complaint again. Abusing your power (shooting them again with the taser, or even using your pistol) will cause considerable penalties to your police score. One thing that really irritates me about this game is that it seems to only register ""lethal force"" as acceptable if the NPC shoots at you first. So, they can pull out and aim a gun at you, but until they shoot, you best use a taser, or worse - wait. NPCs commonly drop their weapons after taking one or two shots, and you MUST arrest them after this, or incur a penalty. I tried using a taser just to make sure they would remain complaint after the criminal dropped his gun, but received a heavy penalty for power abuse (annoyed me quite a bit). I also had a scenario where 2 NPCs were shooting at me (I still used only my pistol and not my sub-machinegun) - I killed the first person, and received a penalty for killing the second person because he hadn't fired at me yet. The crime/consequence algorithms can use a lot of refinement. It takes about two shots for you to die/be hospitalized, and the only way to heal is to sleep in your bed, or pay a fee at the hospital. Respawning (if you are playing normal) results in a considerable penalty to your police score.I've taken a screenshot of a parked car hovering in the air, stuck in an odd position. I gave it a ticket and towed it - scoring some points. As I continued playing, I was disappointed to see so many cars randomly stuck in the air, at different elevations. Clearly, the bugginess throughout the game should speak volumes regarding its quality as a finished product. You are the ONLY police officer in the small city (map is split into grids, and you can travel to each one by driving - or teleport whenever you leave your house).There are three meters you must take care of - energy, hunger, and stress, You can eat while you are on duty (you must select ""on duty"" in your closet at home to start your shift), but you cannot sleep or recover stress. After enough time has passed, you will be able to end your shift by going to the police station and selecting that option. You can, however, continue to work, but your gauges will continue to fall. To fill these, you can sleep at home or eat at any place that sells food (you pay $5 when you interact with your fridge). Stress is recovered by going out with your friends or family, and each social call costs 4h of gametime. While off duty, you have a meter that will show you how long you can stay off for, and continuing to stay off duty after your time is up will cause you to progressively lose police points (you can get fired/lose the game if it falls low enough). When you go for social calls, it will take you to a loading scene with a picture of whoever you decided to spend time with. A much more effective way (as of now) seems to be to buy a television in your house (use the online store on your laptop) and repeatedly watch tv. Doing so not only raises your stress, but also fills some of your energy (allowing you to skip sleeping in bed).			"

												Plenty of reviews out there saying 'Great ideas, terrible exeuction'. I'll join them. This game really looked like it had all of the right aspects to simulate police work, as well as a life simulation in general. I'm not going to hate - the developers just need several months to improve this. I got bored after two hours or so. Very repetitive.			"

												In real life I am a police officer. So I was interested to try this game and see how ""realistic"" it was. I like the premise of it mixing boring things with action. However I can't really get into much more.Why you ask?Because as a gamer, I realize this game is HORRIBLE. Bugs, poor controls, poor AI, poor everything. This was a HUGE waste of money. I don't mind giving money based on the idea the dev has. But the current price point is embarrassing. This is a five dollar ""game"". If that...			"

Posted: June 17, 2015
												I regret having to give this game a thumbs down, because I really do think it could have been something. In it's current state, it isn't worth the $20 price tag. The game lacks content and gets boring real fast. At this moment, there is only ONE developer working on this game. In the discussion threads, the developer explains that to him, this game is complete, and basically everything from now on is just icing on the cake...WOW... This game is basically an alpha...if that. I understand the whole small team, low budget thing, but to say this game is, in any way complete, is just plain crazy. PROS:+Can be entertaining in small bursts.+Sandbox+The game does have potential (maybe not anymore, but it did).+It has an aspect of realism to it.+The updates are free (as they should be), and the developer stated he didn't want DLCs.+Developers respond to you if you ask a question or comment on something.+Pretty cool customization of your police unit. You can also purchase things like a new flatscreen or a couch for your house with your hard earned cash, which is sweet.CONS:-Bugs/Glitches (apparently not enough to be game breaking as the game is completed--spoken by developer)-Stiff movement system for driving and on-foot. Frustrating controls.-Poor animations.-GTA 3 graphics.-Not enough content to warrant a $20 price tag. It needs more missions/guns/cars/skins/buildings/everything.I really wish this game had more fans and a workshop, because that would change things. More content, better graphics/animations, more skins/customization, would add to the longevity of the game. At the state that this game is in, I cannot recommend this title.Verdict: 5/10 "

												This is clearly a game with a relitively low budget, but still is a very fun police simulator and, in my opinion, worth the money. In this review I will assess the positives and negatives, explain some of the features and finally give my verdict on the game.Positives: - Variety of different missions (passive and direct).- 7 regions to explore.- On and Off Duty modes.- Level up / Ranking system in the police force.- Can interact with every NPC civilian.- Police cars have warning sirens, full sirens, and lightbars that can be customised.- Variety of clothing and vehicle paintjobs.- Realistic feel of policing.- Can storm buildings, make civilians surrender, stop fleeing vehicles by hitting them with yours.- Has an easy and hard mode.Negatives:- At the time of its release, it is quite buggy.- When an ambulance / police transport / tow truck is called, they are not actually seen.- Car physics are not very realistic.- You get reduced career points for actions such as breaking down doors even if there is a criminal inside.- You are the only patrol officer in the game.- Fleeing NPCs act as if they were not being chased if they get clear of you a few metres, then run again when you get close.- Limited things to do Off Duty.- Does not have a very comrehensive help / controls screen.PLEASE NOTE MANY OF THE ABOVE WILL MOST LIKELY BE IMPROVED / FIXED AS THE GAME DEVELOPS!Suggestions:- Could have custom loadouts (e.g. different weapons).- Could call backup such as a SWAT team.- When the player reaches a high rank, they could command other officers.- Needs more vehicles and Off Duty activities (could maybe respond to specific emergencies).Analysis:I am someone who is a big fan of police simulators. Arma 3 Altis Life was great for this, and Enforcer: Police Crime Action is quite similar, only it is single player. You can drive around the town centre looking out for speeders (cars drive around 20mph and around 30mph is considered speeding) and you can pull them over, use the breathalyser or frisk them if you feel it is necessary. On the start of every shift there is a passive mission to complete by the end of the shift, for example setting up a roadblock with cones and checking 6 drivers for faults on their cars. There are also dispatch calls with generous time limits such as finding a person wanted for assaulting passers by. For this you would go and talk to the victims to get a description, then wait until there is intel about where the person was last seen. You would then go to the scene, find the person matching the description, and park up. Normally when you call out for them to stop, they will run off. You can pull out your tazer, and when you get close you fire. After that you can arrest the suspect, take them to the station or call for a transport. You get career points which help you rank up after completing every mission.Off duty mode is really unique, and has a lot of potential. When you have enough money you can buy a car, and you can also customise your home with new furniture. It is also possible to level up your stress level buy going out with friends or your mother, and other people. Instead of actually interacting with your friends or mother, the game teleports you to their house and puts the time forward a few hours, and says that you have spent time with your friends / mother, without you actually seeing anything. Physically doing activities may well be something the developers add in the future. When off duty it is also possible to fill up on food and replenish your energy by sleeping. You have to be careful though as spending too much time off duty will reduce career points.Conclusion:This game as mentioned earlier has obviously been developed on a low budget, but they have made that budget stretch as far as possible. The gameplay is enjoyable even though the graphics and physics are not fantastic. Now it has been released, it is likely that if lots of people buy it and the developers have access to more money, the game will be better optimized, feel more smooth and have some great new features added. That will of course come over time so if anything, the money you put in to buy this game will be an investment, so they can improve it. That said, even before the game is developed further it is still great fun and I can see a lot of hours of gameplay from it.Overall Verdict:I would recommend this game to any fan of police simulators, or anyone who fancies a go at being a police officer. It may at first seem very rough and strange, but believe me, you will probably get used to it just fine.I rate Enforcer: Police Crime Action 7/10 at its current state but it has the potential of being a 8/10 or even 9/10 game.UPDATE: It is now August 2016 with very little development since the review, sadly I would not recommend the game any more.

												Great idea, poor execution. An open world sandbox police 'sim' is something i've wanted to play since the likes of Police Quest. And this game pretty much has that idea down. Unfortunately, it's let down by its execution. The graphics and animation are poor, worse than GTA 3. The AI is all but non existant. All NPC criminals either run from you, give up, or stand in one spot and slowly shoot at you. Pathfinding is poor - pedestrians will mindlessly walk into anything blocking their path forever. The physics are poor. Cars don't crash so much as 'stop'. Hitting a tree, building, or even a pedestrian will cause your car to stop on a dime. Other vehicles also have a tendency to fly into the air randomly. If this was early access, I'd say wait and see, but as a fully released title? Sorry, can't reccomend it especially for the price they're asking.			"

												This game at it's current form demands a lot of patience from the person that plays it. Most of the AI is very underdeveloped: pedestrians walking everywhere, stoping for nothing and nobody. The driving in the game is a nightmare. Speed is a relative term at the moment, getting from 20mph to 134mph under a second... and good luck stoping... without immidiate reversing. Missions are quite repetative but so is the life of a police officer... as I would imagine.The time passes real quick. An hour in the game equals to a minute in our life not leaving much space to complete missons without doing 16 hours shifts. The concept of getting hungry, tired and irritated is a great idea, but at the moment they don't have much effect on our character. Ranking up is also a great idea... yet again, doesn't really change much. You are still putting those speeding cameras out, regardless your rank. But enough of the negatives.It's a police simulator! Yes. You are wearing a uniform, you have your police cruiser, which is by the way very nicely detailed, as far as sound and lights go. The weapon mechanics is acceptable and it is fun giving out those tickets for broken lights or  speeding thorugh town to attend a burglary. The developers have a great vision. There is no doubt about it. This game might have been released just a bit too early, but their presence in forums and announcments on up-coming updates is reassuring that buying this game at this price is an investment. Now it is up to us if we are willing to invest and see the development through. I am, because it's exciting to be part of developing a great police simulator.			"

												My biggest problem with this game is that it feels like a very early access inide game and no where near like the complete product.Firstly the driving mechanics are aweful the controls feel clunky, it feels like driving a tank and you even have to turn off the engine before you are allowed to get out of the car. I don't think they will fix this either because it is one of the core mechanics of the game. Unfortunatly when you do anything it is done through a menu system, for example you call to get a prisoner transport and instead of seeing a car come out and pick up the prisiner you get a screeen shot saying it has been done, this is the same for ambulances, tow trucks ect. The graphics leave a lot to be desired, most of the game looks pretty poor the models look like they came out of a ps1 game, this would not be an issue if the game mechanics were better. Also every citezen looks the same i think there are no more than say 10 character models. The map is split into tiny sections you have to drive through checkpoints to get to different parts of the map, there are so many loading screens in this game for pretty much everything you do.All the above points are things that are core parts of ther game and will probably never be changed/fixed at the time of writing there are many other issues too such as bugs (cars floating in the sky), I feel like the duty time is too short it makes you rush to complete the day, buying yoyur own car is far too expensive compared to how much money you make, you have to get a taxi home because home is too far from the station. Hopefully the modding community will come to the rescue of this game but at the moment i wouldn't recommend this game, ive played played games that cost £4 - £5 that have been more polished  and genrally better games.

												Began duty, went straight to the living room, spent all on duty time watching tv in my couch, checked out by the office to get (hard earned) salary. 10/10Blocked a crossroad, got everyone out of their cars, called the tow truck, earned a promotion.10/10Edit : Somehow, this game has a mostly positive review rating on steam, this is not deserved nor acceptable.Bugs are not that much of a problem, the problem is that there is very little content to this game, you will be bored fast, I played more than 6 hours because I'm a masochist.You who read that review, you must know that this game has only 5 kinds of missions-Ticket incorrect parked cars-Radar flash speeding drivers-Check cars for♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-Check drivers for high alcohol levels-[random missions] Find the culprit(s) of a theft and arrest him/themYou will be doing these same missions over and over from start to finish.Do you really want this ? I say you really don't.TL;DR : You will be bored by this game, don't buy it.If you want to have a little bit of fun with this game, just watch the birgirpall ""I broke enforce police crime action"" video on youtube.That is all there is to it.

												If you like cash-grabbing indie companies that delete comments that out their lies, ban forum users for having negative opinions about their ""game of false promises"" and repeatedly guarentee new features without ever following through even once, then this game is for you.In all seriousness, you could take your 19.99 and trot down to your local movie theatre; spend it all on popcorn, go back to your car, power on your smart phone, log on to the forums for this game and just sit there munching and reading Odin's responses to the community and that would be more consistent, fulfilling, and entertaining than this game will ever be.

												II have been looking for a game like this for a long time but I guess my search will have to go on.Looks like this game is based on Police Mod for GTA IV. It offers you plenty of options what can a good officer do, like patrolling the streets, stopping cars, checking drivers, chasing burglars and vandals.You always play in the sandbox mode and you have to watch your needs (hunger, energy, health). You have to complete some of the missions during duty hours (some of them are optional and randomly generated) but it gets very repetitive very soon. Technical side of the game is a problem. City looks empty and sterile. You see some pedestrians on the streets but they all looks the same (only few types). Driving mechanics is also bad, it feels nothing like any of the GTA games. For the standard price I cannot recommend this game, fair price would be 10 Euro.			"

												Note: Reposted as it appears to have been removed.Final Update:26 March 2016 - Deleting off my HDD, devs don't give a damn about fixing this mess, but keep coming up with new exotic excuses as to why. This game will never be fixed, as they are playing everyone daft enough to buy it as mugs.12 Febuary, update a disaster, so bad, they rolled back to previous build. Do they understand the concept of Quality Assurance?5 Febuary. Latest update FINALLY released. WTF, more bugs than ever, more unplayable. What the hell are the devs doing? 27 January. Latest excuse is that players want free update?? Since when has it been normal to charge for bug fixes?10 January 2016, still no update or comms from the dev. Only sign that there not dead is the censorship in the forums they are carrying out..19 December, no update, and devs actively censoring the forums to remove any 'negative' threads and comments, while not actually giving any response.Unfinished and full of bugs. Devs talk a lot about the 'update coming', but was due June 15, still no show near end of October 15. Many threads locked down and being directed to their list of excuses as to why they can't finish/ can only have 1 person part time working on it (Looks like they believe their next game is more important than actually finishing this one). And finally, if you want to try and see any progress they claim, you have to have a Facebook account (for a game thats sold on STEAM)?Below a small list of some of the bugs/poor gameplay i have experianced:i. Unable to execute handbrake turn(car slides sideways and backwards at about 40 degrees).ii. 70 mph max on road and offroad, road and terrian has no effect.iii. Suspects running up a cliffside half inside the sheer face.iv. Any vehicle impact(such as stopping drunk driver), by rear ramming, results in your car being bounced high onto the air, as the car stops dead on the road(the physics suck).v. Chasing a vehicle off map ,new map has car sitting on side of road, engine off and suspect vehicle disappered.vi. A suspect pulls a gun on you, but if you shoot them before they open fire, you get a hefty penalty, for opening fire on an innocent. Then when you call for the medical services, you get a bonous for completing the mission and removing another criminal from the streets.0 Comments	 Subscribe to thread  (?)			"

												At first this game is amazing, then it gets predictable and repititive. This game is not finished. The developers seem to be working on it. It seems like an early access game.  Part of this game is not really realistic, Like responding to a robbery. They ALWAYS escape on foot. A red circle follows the suspect, even if you have not arrived yet.You do these following things over and over:1)Give parking tickets2)Stop drunk drivers/arrest3)Inspect license and vehicle/ticket4)Go to drug dealers (arrest or shoot)5)Go to hostage situation (arrest or shoot)I would say 7 hours maxes out replay value. I would not spend $20, only $10 (its half off right now) with the condition there is going to be at least 25% more content. Good:This is the only cop game I am aware of.It makes me feel sorry for cops. Realistic mode= one life. If you die, you die. Like being a cop in real life!Fun, until you figure the mechanics out and can predict everything.I got nervous because somebody pulled out their cell phone and I thought it was a gun +++High speed chases during routine traffic stops I ask for somebody to open the door, they do, they have a weapon, I blast them away +++Shooting bad guys (especially on realistic mode) +++Bad:No randomness, easily predicatableYou can't call backup. Bad guys are only activated one at a time if you get in their vincinity Can't see where bullets are coming fromNO BODY ARMOR REALLY??!Promotions are not very valuable at all. Not enough upgradesFun goes downhill fast "

												I wouldn't recommend or even suggest this to anyone. When it came out it had a lot of promise with a dev team that would interect with the players on the forums, addressing bugs and even trying to put in mod support. The content was growing with new vehicles, a reworked and revamped map, and albeit it isn't content, bug fixes.Then it stopped, promises of a huge patch that would add a lot more content and bug fixes was constantly pushed off. They would even start silencing the steam forum of any sort of dissent and eventually the communication stopped. After a bit of a lull they finally came up with a date to expect it. And when the time came, nothing. They addressed it again, gave it another date and once more, nothing.This game showed a lot of promise, considering that there isn't much of a market for Law Enforcement Simulators or even games.  Heck it even had a skeptic like me thinking that they could pull it off.The game in its current state is better then it was when launched, but still retains some of the odd bugs paired with its awkward driving controls and weird AI, you would swear you leapt from the Alpha test to the beginning stages of Beta testing. As for the customization, you can change the skin on your police car and your uniform...and that's it.Although, I may have been gifted this game. I feel nothing but awful for having recieved it knowing that they have willingly spent money on this with the goodness of their heart.If you wish to pursue another Police Simulator, I would recommend that you purchase GTAV and download the LSPDFR mod. The difference is considerable. Especially due to the customization of the LSPDFR Mod that allows you to improve your Law Enforcement experience.			"

												Very rich ideas, the small amount of people who made this knew what they were doing and did really good for a couple of people. This game is underdeveloped, but is still fun. Love everything about this, feels like lcpdfr but better. It has chases, searches on the street, arresting drunks, arresting gunmen, murderers, searching houses with a warrant, customizing cars. I do not like the nypd style of the cars for this suburban/rural area. Please developers dont let us down, keep adding on to this and this may be one of the most popular games of all time.			"

												DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This game leaves a lot to be desired and honestly feels like an early release at best. It absolutely is NOT worth the $19.99 at this point in its production and will need many large updates to make it anywhere close to worth its asking price. I will list some pros and cons:Pros:-It's a police simulator and those are hard to come by, if nothing else it's an attempt to deliver a very demanded but rare game format-It's ambitious: There are many features such as buying police cars, living life off work, etc. which are nice on first play-Practial button layout Cons:-Really, really clunky - the car driving and handling may be some of the worst I've ever tried. Sure having features such as having to turn on the engine and the realistic idle movement of drive and reverse are fun in theory, but the steering controls manage to be un and/or late responsive while the gas and reverse are over-responsive. It's horrible. Running and crouching aren't much better.-This game doesn't look pretty. I get that it's not a large studio producing it but if you're going to charge me $20 at least have more than five car and character models in the game-Everyone in this game has a gun. I have done 10 missions and 9/10 ended with the suspect pulling a gun-Shooting controls are very poor - the gun often will not fire the first few shots unless you zoom in, which can lead to getting you killed-Boring mission types - There are a variety of missions and the idea of questioning suspects and searching nearby buildings is a great one, but the tips are only clothing descriptions and all the searches end in you having to gun down a pistol wielding suspect-Simple features such as tow trucks, ambulance calls, and police pick up lack an animation and instead take you to a brief load screen before returning you to where you were witht he action performed - things like this REALLY make it feel like an early access-Whoever developed it is not an English speaker and google translate is not flawless. Many spelling or wording mistakes really prevent it from having a professional, clean fealIn conclusion, don't buy this game. I was incredibly disappointed with this game. I was quite excited that a new police simulator was finally being produced as there are barely any available. Don't get me wrong, I know it is a small project and wouldn't be upset if this were an early release, but I paid a decent price for it for far from a decent product. On the very bare outside it looks similar to LCPDFR, but don't be fooled. This game is far from being worth its asking price and will need some serious updating in the control, mission, and visual department before it comes close its asking price.			"

												Well I once had a good review of this game.  But almost a year and no updates or anything since the last preview build.  No fix for the multitude of bugs in this game.  This game has so much potential but apparently the develper has said FU to the people who have been following this game, and purchased it in 2014.  THe game is a good concept but after about an hour of game play and going on the limited number of calls you get real bord real easy.  No back up units not much interaction.  You can call for a police van to transport a prisoner but there is no cut sean and the person just disapears.  Same with tow trucks the car just disapears.  Even though the game is now 4.99 I would wait until it .99cents because anything more than that is rediculus.  You get more gameplay from a 50 cent arcade.  Will deff not be purchasing anything from this developer in the future because obveusly they like to take your money and not follow through on the devel of the game.  So don't wast your time.  yea it is great for about 5 min but buggy as heck and really not worth anything more than 50 cents.			"

												Cool idea, badly made. This game at this stage is not worth buying it especially not as a release version. It has some really nice implementations like choosing your patrol vehicle and customizing it. Also the missions are fun. BUT sadly this game is so full of bugs and annoyances that I can't recommend it right now. If even slowly driving your patrol vehicle onto the concrete of the downtown gas station damages your car badly (up to 10%), that's just not how it should be. Also the handling while driving is annoying. The slightest push of a button can completely turn your car around. Not to mention all the bugs like flying cars that are not reachable which makes it impossible to finish certain missions, too fast decreasing of gas and car condition, clipping errors (eg. handling your submachine gun), invisible road bumps that crash your car and so on. As said, the idea behind the game is pretty cool, once the developers flat out MANY bugs and annoyances, it might be actually pretty fun. Until then, I don't recommend it.			"

												The game isn't bad, just missing some features and what not. I had wish I could participated in the development of this game... However, the graphical/physics engine and such, just seems very old. I understand it isn't an AAA Title, and really no AAA companies, would ever make a game like this. It's decent aside from the bugs. Few items missing, flashlights, spot lights on cruisers, hand held radar, in cruiser radar, really I could go on and on. I can't say I agree with carrying an MP5 on the chest either... Though it is what it is. If anything, it should be an option to obtain, a shotgun from the cruiser. With special certifications, patrol officers are able to carry a patrol rifle as well. Usuaully stored in the trunk, this rifle is usually an M16 or an M4, depending on the agency. I do have former law enforcement experience, now turned Fire/EMS, though yeah, besides the point. I hope it either improves, or some other company decides to begin a title similar to this.			"

												While the game world is still quite empty and the missions are fairly similar, I do think this is a fun little game! I like that I get to play a police officer, a regular police officer and not a member of Special Branch or something like that. I like that I am able to costumize the patrol car even if the options are not that diverse at the moment but I certainly hope to see more vehicles or paint themes in the future. The same goes for uniforms and off duty attire and I'd love to have more play on the off duty hours to make the time spent there more than just about eating and sleeping.So overall this is a decent game and if you go in knowing that it isn't GTA V then this game surely provided me with a fun evening when I bought it.

												This game is not a full game. It handles like an early developed mod. It was created for the ground up so as a single developer, this is something to be proud of. However, as a game that claims to be full, it is not even close. There are many areas that are lacking. Many features that were promised that still have yet to show up. The player movement is clunky, car acceleration random and almost uncontrolable, useful customization almost non existant, features that felt like dead ends and were started but never finished. The world feels so empty, and you have such a large area to patrol, I feel like this should be state patrol or sheriff's department. It's so empty. You are the ONLY COP. This is not a complete game. If you're desperate for a police game, ok buy this, but other than that? Don't waist your money. Get GTA IV for $20 and downloand the mod LCPDFR. Its clunky and crashes, but it still feels more complete than this game. You can download additional callouts, bug fixes, custom cars, custom uniforms, different scripts for police AI, the possibilities are endless... Unfortunately this game just falls short. If I knew anything about developing I would totally help this guy out and crank out an awesome and complete game. This game has potential, but a year after launch? Still feels empty and incomplete.In this current state, I would not recommend it.			"

												I want to point out that Enforcer: Police Crime Action is like calling the Half Life Series Scientist: Atoms Destruction Wait. And yet it is still a much better title (and game) Then any of the ""Simulation"" Games released for the purpose of a quick cash grab.It's simple. You play as a police officer, male or female, and are tasked with the daily routines of being said police officer. You go do a shift by beginning with a mundane mission and will either get interrupted with a more exciting mission or just simply go through the mission and gain points. Points mean you are promoted and get money, thus allowing you to spend it on your house. The closest comparision I have is True Crime: New York City in terms of random missions and being tasked with being a police officer.The game doesn't look impressive, but it get's the job done. It has good character and vehicle animations that allow you to tell what a character is doing and what they plan. The appeal of just going through the daily life of a police officer is a welcome compromise between the hardcore idea of being an officer (Swat series) To the matienince of health and hunger levels (Deadly Premonition).The worst part about this game is that it feels cheap. The love for this game the developers gave to it is clear, and I enjoy the experience thus far, but there are a lot of times where I find cars flipped over for no reason, the camera constantly get's stuck to one position and once someone screams you will hear that scream throughout your shift like that victim is haunting your soul. If given more assets and time, this game could honestly be as good as Euro Truck SImulator in providing for a niche audience.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: YESDespite the cheap look this game has, it is a game with a lot of love and detail put into it that already feels like a unique experience. SUGGESTIONS TO DEVS: Focus more on bringing in the social life for the protagionist; I actually felt like this town could be given a lot more history and more characters that you could interact with.

												This game is suprisingly fun for me to play even when not much is happening. The graphics are not the best but they don't take away too much from the gameplay, plus the game came out pretty recently so I'm sure a lot of bugs will be fixed and things added. It's a pretty realistic simulator, as you get rewarded in points for giving out tickets correctly, capturing criminals, and helping out people, and you lose points for arresting innocent people, police abuse, civilian casualties, etc. And as you get points you get promoted, which earns you a larger salary each time you complete a shift, and you can buy items for your house, cars, gas, food, and ammo. You have three meters (stress, energy, and hunger) which you can replenish while off duty or on duty, but you get penalized for staying off duty too long, and you can stay on duty as long as you want as long as you have enough energy. The animations are pretty good for each action like walking, asking questions, hand cuffing, etc. and the only bad part of the animations is the idle animation for you character, as he/she just stands there lik a ragdoll and slightly breathes, and some of the animtion transitions are jumpy but still pretty good. It kinda reminds me of Watch_Dogs except you are the cops and no hacking, but is still fun. You still get some fun out of this despite some bugs and overall apearance, but again, the game is new and I'm sure will be fixed and imporved in time. If you take a look at the news feed on this game, you can see that they are frequently updating and have laid out plans for the future, and I think now might be a good time to get this game so you can get a feel for it and watch it improve, and plus you get a free soundtrack. (If you like that kind of stuff...) I guess you could mess around and just arrest everyone, but i'm not sure if you can ""lose"" the game yet unless you have realism mode on. Trust me, this game is going to go far, don't let the appearence fool you...			"

												Okay so the game was good,  There was a time when this game had potential and was going to be good, then the game creators said they were going to Update it in June of 2015 then they said July, then they said Fall of 2015 it is one year later and it has not been updated with what they said they were going to add.Let's get to some of the other bad stuff in this gameEvery Vehicle is being driven illegaly. Some may ask why? Well, because every vehicle in this game don't have licence plates.  And for a Police Simulator to not incorrperate Licence plates it's pretty bad.Let's talk about driving.  HORRIBLE DRIVING IN THIS GAME.  The vehicle speeds up way too quickly.  AI driving is horrible.  And let me tell you about traffic lights.  Cars will stop on green and go on red.  Some traffic lights don't even change to green.  How about pulling over vehicles.Oh this the worst.  If a vehicle is running from you, you actually have to hit them with your vehicle to stop them.  Just parking in front of them after they start running won't stop them.  (Pretty unrealalistic)   (If you don't hit them with your vehicle then you can't open the pull over menu.)So in this game we are seen as the only police officer in town...  While you are playing this game you will not come into contact with another police officer.  Although, if you exit your vehicle you can hear a police radio.  Some YouTubers have said that he/she is so lonley being the only police officer that he/she is playing recordings of a Police Radio.  Honestly I wouldn't blame him/her.  If you are looking for a Good Police Simulation, buy Grand Theft Auto 4 and Install LCPDFR (Just search up LCPDFR.COM) or get Grand Theft Auto 5 and install LSPDFR (Just like before except now it's LSPDFR.COM)  With this mod you can actually run licence plates, pull people out of vehicles and stop someone who is running without hitting them with your vehicle.  And better yet there are actually a lot of other police, so you won't have to worry about being the only police officer in town!To end this there is a new police simulation coming out sometime in the next months called Police 10-13 (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252178673) I can tell you that this one will have potential graphics are way better, and they have been working on it for over 3 years so awesome!

												This is a game about being a police officer.I drive with my sirens on and lights flashing, swerving not only between the two lanes, but off the road on either side. I miss ramming other cars on the road...for the most part.I will pull over a car for no reason, and even if I find nothing wrong with it or the driver, I'll still have the car towed, leaving the driver stranded. I get 30 points for every car I have towed, even the ones that don't break any rules.I frisk everybody. If they have a gun, I will arrest them. (Thanks, Obama!)I'll get a call for teenage vandalism, and when I investigate, one of the vandals will start shooting at me. I'll return fire, putting a bullet in their spine. 10/10 would horrifically abuse my power and authority again.Edited to add: The game is made 1000% more fun if you go to options and enter ""hohoho"" (no quotation marks) in the Secret Codes section. I've seen other reviews complain about vehicle handling. I tried out a police SUV and within two seconds I'd rolled onto the side, and after five seconds (during which the car was still going forward) the car re-righted itself. The janky vehicle handling is a plus in my book.The only thing I'd like to see is some kind of story mode, and/or more variation in the type of cop tasks I can do. (Preferably hilarious ones that let me be more jerkish). And maybe a point to buying fancy furniture? As far as I can tell, the cheapest couch, cheapest TV, and cheapest refrigerator are all I need to satisfy all my needs.			"

												So far this is the best *dedicated police sim* available. If you are a fan of LCPD:FR, you'll love this - it's more refined and less glitchy. It is not without bugs and glitches however, but once you accept that 1. It's the first day of release, 2. It's their first PC game on the market and 3. The team consists of 4 devs you really appreciate the work that has been put into it (especially if you've been following the game since it was first announced like I have).Some feedback I would like to give the devs: 1. Currently certain areas in the roads are buggy, making your car flip at high speed, or just hit invisible objects.2. The cars could be a bit more durable - police cruisers (particularly the Crown Vic) are known for their ability to take a lot of punishment, at current time i lose about 2-4% of vehicle health by going over small bumps at the gas station.3. I'd love to hear more variety in the police radio clips, currently the clips are from the NYPD and as such reference New York locations, it'd be awesome to get voice actors in to record some radio, or at least grab a few more clips.4. Change the hunger animation, or remove it. I don't have a problem with the animation, but it'd be better if it only played once - when the hunger bar drops right down and from then on only having the text notification. I get what it's trying to achieve, and i like it: but at crucial times (foot pursuits, shootouts) it's annoying to have to stop for 3 seconds for the animation to play, leaving you very vulnerable.Some things I'd like to see added in the future: 1. More player customisation (especially some kind of Sheriff / State Trooper uniform)2. More NPC variety 3. An extra civilian car or two (perhaps a charger for about $25,000)4. Perhaps a police motorcyle (and proper uniform of course) for more highway patrol type players. For anyone who has actually read this far, you should definitely get the game if you're into police sims - the devs are very open and actually listen to our feedback, so give it a play and tell them (constructively) what you think - at $14.99 until the end of October you really can't go wrong!

												As a fellow law enforcement fan myself, I can say that this game is a good, fair-enough simulator.However, there are MANY Problems with this game, which doesn't change my opinion on how much I like it.Some of these includes;-Glitches; Cars/trucks parked in mid air.-Car goes flying in the air at high speed.-AI Pulls over with a sharp right turn, resulting in a Horizontal parking.-You do not hold weapons correctly etc.And also laggy sometimes.I really like this game, and hope to see improvements in the near future, making this game truly better than LCPDFR Becuase at the moment, it is sadly not.

												This game has a LOT of bugs. Driving through intersections your car reacts like it hit something. Your cursor can randomly get stuck. The ballistics make no sense, e.g. shooting at a vehicle window and nothing is happening.Gameplay is clunky, largely because of the horrible driving mechanics. Other commentors have said the driving is like Crazy Taxi; that is wholly accurate. There are some good parts of the game, but overall the game is repetitive and the flow of gameplay is hampered by the whole ""stress"" situation. This game would benefit a lot from a campaign, or at least set missions like in GTA. You need a car when off duty, but you only make like $500 a shift and your net income is more like $100 a shift after vehicle repairs (necessary due to aforementioned clunky driving and the fact that ramming cars is the only way to stop vehicles that do not pull over). The cheapest car is like $16,000. You can call taxis...but not to your house.So far I've been exploiting the bugs in the game to actually get any play in. For example, I quit after going off duty and then when I log back in I'm in my house, fully rested and fed. I also call my sister, who apparently drops me back at my house after we're done hanging out.There are so many elements of this game that just feel very amateurish and silly. I do not recommend this. Get LCPDFR, a mod for GTA IV.			"

												This is a fun game so far. However I would enjoy it more if it had controller support. Also, I find the off-duty part of the game... well... boring. There should be an option to either turn it off, or at the least a game mode with limited off-duty time. I get the ""stress level"" part of the game, however it's not really needed as visiting family is not really a game challenge and more less a waste of time; you could just as easily say he/she does that without having to play it out.

												A great concept, but sloppy execution. Think of True Crime New York City; you could give tickets, inspect cars, frisk people, etc. However, like True Crime NYC, this game is rather broken. The world feels empty, the NPCs are nearly identical aside from a few color differences in clothing, there is a lack of dialogue. In all aspects, the game can be done if you look past these things but it really needs a lot of work. The aimming is clunky, the driving is dodgy, the weather effects are ugly. There is no denything that I still enjoyed the game. However, until the game is polished up, I will not be touching this game for a while. There are many ways the player can boost, or outright manipualte the way the game is meant to be played and quickly level up. Despite the bugs and exploits, you can have a fun time but the game can get really boring really fast, there's not much to do when off-duty. In conclusion, if you can look past the bugs and exploits, you will most likely like this game if you enjoy police simulators. However, if you are like me and suffer from strong OCD, the glitches will really drive you insane. If and when this game is a little bit more playable, I will indeed consider rewriting my review. Great concept, fun at times, but it needs a lot of work. 6.5/10.			"

												This game has a lot of potential in it, however the dev's have abandoned this game. They promised updates since June then nothing was heard until August, and now nothing. I had hope that this game would get the needed updates to make it more playable however that doesn't seem like it will ever happen.The game becomes quite repetitive with the few calls in-game (and if you ever get one) and the energy system that hardly gets you through one patrol. The visuals are ok for the most part but could use some touching up. The main issues with this game are the physics and the animations. I can understand that this is an indie game and I'm not expecting AAA game quality but you shouldn't bounce off into space when you get rear ended by the AI.Overal if this game had the key issues fixed and if the price was lower I could recommend it, however with its current state and being thrown into the trash by the dev's I can not recommend this game to anyone.

												Enforcer: Police Crime Action is a good basic police simulator.  You are able to do some basic police stuff and you must take care of your player with food and comfort.  However, the game gets really old after a few hours of playing.  You are very limited with what you can do and the map is very unique.  When you enter a new section of the map, the game must load the new section as aposed to just continuing driving.  The bright side to this game is that it is compatiable with Mac users and it is the only realistic police simulator out there for Mac.  However, for PC users, I DO NOT recommend this game.  Instead, I recommend the LSPDFR mod for Grand Theft Auto V.  I know it is a bit pricey for the origional game, but trust me, it is a lot better then Enforcer.  I believe that Enforcer's price should be reduced to about $5.  However, the gameplay is not what makes me so angry.  It is the fact that the community wants to help the game by trying to give the developers ideas to make the game better, but the developers are not listening.  In fact, the developers have abandoned the game.  Everyone knows that this game has huge potential to become a major video game, but the developers have completly abandoned the game.  So do not try to give your ideas to the developers, because they do not care anymore.			"

												First I will start this review by touching on the admins of the game here on Steam. Quite frankly they are terrible with customer service, after asking a simple question one of their admins gave a short response (did not answer the question) then proceeded to lock the thread. Not the best way to handle a customer.The game itself has its high and low points. Despite what the designers state, it does feel a little repetitive no matter how you play the game. The limited customization of characters, the fact that characters don't have traits upon creation or their experiences working make the player character feel bland. The personal interactions are also very bland and don't do much to bring the player into the world of the officer they are playing.Enforcer does provide a large playing area where you can explore, yet the world feels a bit empty. In a day and age with so much attention paid to how Police Officers perform their job, you do not get any of this in the game. You do not even have other officers, events that change how the community sees the police, or a Chief that imposes training on the force.Unfortunately, it causes the game to feel a bit hollow. While you have the option to choose from a number of police vehicles, and freedom to patrol where you want, there's just a great deal missing that causes the game to not feel satisfying.  I am recommending the game only based on the fact it's the only one of its kind and it's not terrible if you have low expectations.The developers also should take a hard look at how they respond to customers as well.Of note, I definitely logged more than the six hours of game time it is showing.True Score: 5.5/10			"

												I do not write a lot of reviews, but I feel this simulator needs one. I'm not going to review the story line, but just the gameplay itself. Enforcer: Police Crime Action centres around a single municipal police officer in a small desert town. You respond to call the dispatch informs you about and you have the options to respond to the calls or not. There is also real-time events happening in the city as well. It likes to focus mostly around the every day duties of a police officer and it does this very well. The simulator also goes beyond the duties of a police officer and you have to maintain you social and home life when you are not on duty, like manage your stress, eating, sleeping, and spending time with friends and family. Now that I have vaguely explained the game, I'm going to go into pros and cons of the game.Pros:-The simulator/game, or whichever you prefer to call it, does an amazing job of immersing you into the life of a police officer. The lackluster graphics still do not get in the way of making you feel and believe you are the law enforcement of this town and tries to make you thorough in your investigations and arrests, making you feel like you want to make a difference in the one-cop-town.-The callouts. There is, at this stage of the game, quite a few different types of callouts that dispatch will give you while you're driving aroung town, looking for any law breakers. You can do simple things like, stopping some delinquents from vandalizing a public building to solving a kidnapping and finding the kidnapped and taking out the kidnapper and calling in an ambulance to take the kidnapped person from the situation.-The rank up system. There is a huge list of different ranks to go through, from just a simple patrol officer to the chief of police. The list is quite large and every crime you solve and even just giving an illegally parked car a ticket helps you earn points to rank up and earn new things, like different police vehicles and customization items to them, as well as making your paycheck at the end of each shift more bountyfull.-Being able to make vehicle roadblocks and checkpoints, for example, like creating a drunk driving program where you stop vehicles and perform breath tests to catch drunk drivers and even inspect vehicles to make sure they are road-worthy. Even just doing this can add enjoyment of feeling like a police officer and busting those damn drunk drivers a ticket and time in the slammer.-The game does balance the action and simulation very well. I have had to chase down many suspects that attemted to flee and deploy the tazer on them, watching them get the jitters and then give themselves up after one hell of a shocking. You are equipped with a pistol and a SMG when there are those times that you just can't take them down the nonlethal way. I found myself hiding behind my vehicle helplessly as the offender continues to sling lead my direction and found myself trying to figure out how to take him down and end the situation.I could name many more Pros to this game, but I may edit those in at a later time, but let's address the obvious Cons of this game now.Cons:-The graphics are horrendous, but given the small team that made this whole game themselves, you find yourself not caring too much, but this is a Con because the optimization is pretty bad. For a game that lack a lot of detail in the town there shouldn't be an excuse why I only get less than 20FPS on the medium settings on my system. The optimization is really bad and I run a pretty good system, so I should get 30FPS or more on the medium setting.-Physics are non-existing. You are, what feels like, stuck to the ground, like your car is a giant magnet and stuck to the ground. There's really not much else to say about the physic-less world, but let's hope there is some sort of physic engine added in later, probably much later.-The controls, oh the controls, they are awful, with no sensitivity sliders, or custom key options. You turn your car almost 90 degrees by just barely tapping the ""A"" and ""D"" keys. It makes it hard to stay to one side of the road and you find yourself all over the damn road and crashing into everything.-Damage system. Your car takes way too much damage easily. Just by bumper tapping or hitting curb, you'll find yourself repairing you vehicle up to 3 times a shift and the shifts are very short. To get to parking lots, or the gas pump, and the garage have no slope on the curb, so you always take a lot of damage by just trying to get into the gas station. It's extremely frusterating and annoying. This huge flaw needs to be addressed immediatley. Like, now, seriously. It almost ruins the game for me.-Your food, sleep, and stress bars. They deplete waaay to fast. I think they have been fixed, but they still go down way too fast. They need to be slowed down by 10x or more.Okay, so I hope this review helped people deceide whether or not to invest in this game. Is it worth $16 on sale? Maybe, but maybe not. If they release a MAJOR and I mean, MAJOR update soon. Then hell to the freaking yes it's worth it, but as it stands no. Helping this small team of developers is worth it, though. This game has AMAZING potential and I'm so damn excited to see what they have in store for this game. Personally, I give this game a 8.5/10. I love this game. The police simulation games come in a small amount, like Police Force 2 or the LCPDFR mod for GTA IV, so I welcome this game and I am happy to support the developers. Keep it up, so far this game has me hooked and I can't wait to see what you all have in store for this.			"

												Played an early version of this game a year or two ago and it's not noticably improved, I wouldn't of bought this game I've only got it as they where giving it away for free at the PC Gamer Weekender to everyone who went. I meant to talk to the devs about how bad this games is but I got distracted by some really awesome games.Tried playing it last night when I started the shift I was told to give 3 tickets to ilegally parked cars, I only spotted one a Taxi that was parked on the pavement by a building so I ticketed it and lost points for issuing an ilegal ticket. Then I get a call about a drug dealer so I go find him he's in between 2 buildings holding a pistol, I dodge his bullets and tazer him and collect the evidence and send him to the jail, I go back to looking for cars to ticket when I get a message about a kidnapping and told to look for clues, yet I am not told anything about who was kidnapped or where they where kidnapped from after driving around aimlessly the game finaly gives me a location, I turn up at the house and I can see half a guy sticking through the front door holding a gun, so I open the door inwards and creep to the side of it and tazer him as well, collect the evidence and send him to jail and it tells me that Kidnapped 1/1 so to me I've completed it but it wouldn't let me talk to the lady that was the kidnapp victim and just standing there, in the end just gave up, but the house it's self had a seperate room with a corridor going down the side but there the wall met the outside wall there was a window sticking half into the corriador and half into the other room. This is a game with so much potential I really want to like it but it just feels like half a game I would have to give it a rating of 3/10 The car is hard to control and so easy to smash into other cars, the graphics looks like half way between Minecraft and GTA 3 and the missions have not been thought out fully, Oh and you can't aford to buy your own car but your only allowed to drive your police cruiser when your working, so you either have to walk for ages or take a cab and waste all your cash!

												Enforcer is one of those games you have to take a chance on to enjoy. The graphics are bad, its really outdated looking for a 2014 game and the driving engine is handmade in Hell. However, the gameplay is there in spades - fans of Maxis' SimCopter will be at home here. You play a uniformed cop who simply works a shift and is faced with mundane tasks like setting up speed cameras to record speeding vehicles, or chasing down armed suspects after a botched home invasion. You can ask a suspect to comply while you check his ID, frisk him for weapons or arrest him, and use your radio to have him taken downtown or have his vehicle towed, all with an intuitive interface.The missions are quite repetitive and if you're quick to complete them, you can face a boring period of wandering around looking for speeders or drunk drivers while waiting for an ""official"" mission. However, if you like police themed games, Enforcer is not too bad.			"

												Do not buy this game unless you cannot live your life without having some form of a police simulator game in it. When the game was first released in Early Access, it looked fairly promising. It has the potential to be entertaining at first, but then just becomes tedious when you realize you keep pulling over the same 5 character models. Sometimes you get emergency calls, there are about 3 different ones and they are all exactly the same each time over. It is just a barren, empty shell of a game that has been abandoned by the developer.The reason I say it has been abandoned is that the game literally did not change whatsoever from the first day it was released in Early Access, up until now, when it is in its ""complete"" form. Don't take this as a ""waaaah developer ripped me off because I bought a game in Early Access"" This is just my observations of the direction development took in this game, and in my opinion it was a miserable failure all things considered. The developer, Odin Studios, has also released another Early Access zombie survival game, Better Late Than Dead (lol) on the same broken engine, so I would avoid that too! :^)			"

""C26 Check. C26 Is on the scene."" Police! Possible drug usage has been reported here. (Door opens silently, house is empty.) Two shots were fired while I was attempting to load my weapon and I went down. A R.I.P. message pops up in my view. ""We have a missing person."" Alright! I'm good at driving fast and find people! Two hours later, I still haven't found  anybody.  Pros-Realistic GameplaySleep systemFood systemGasOther realstic thingsCons-I have no idea what I'm doingNo multiplayer <-Make it happen! Overall, This is a fantastic game!I have turned my cheek multiple times but this really cuts the cake. Every moment from driving to case work has been outstanding. Even after remaking my character multiple times I throughly enjoy the game! Keep up the good work and thank you for this!  "

												I supported Enforcer during its infancy, when it was actually known as Police Tactics. The developers were friends of mine on a forum, and I eagerly expected the release. The trailers provided a great insight into what we could be doing when the game was officially released; however, it seems the actual product wasn't really portrayed very well. Enforcer: Police Crime Action delivers a fun and different experience with its gameplay:You have an off duty lifestyle, tied into the game with an actual need (Stress level). While it's not really superbly fun and you can't spend more than a few hours off duty before getting bored, it's a cool feature.Being on duty involves multiple 'tasks' in which you do not have to finish but increase your career points, leading to promotions. These tasks can be anything from pulling over a required amount of vehicles within a certain amount of time  to call-outs, robberies and drunks being just a few.Vehicle customization is a neat addition, offering four different vehicles (two are unlocked via secret codes, obtained by registering your game) all with their own liveries. Lightbars, light colours and wheel types are also some of the changeable options.To experience the features, you really must watch a gameplay. Of course, being a police officer, a day is never the same, and you have to watch someone play it to see this. Of course, as it's only a first release, bugs are to be expected, but this game has started very poorly. Driving needs a hell of a lot of fine-tuning, it feels clunky and not at all fluid. The entire game is sort of clunky; it plays very much the indie game it is. If you're looking for an LCPD:FR contender, you're not going to find it. LCPD:FR expanded on a triple A game engine, fully developed and rounded off by Rockstar; Odin Game Studio has built this game from the ground up and it stands as a completely different game. LCPD:FR has the advantage of calling in backup, more vehicles, an urban environment, backup, etc, whereas Enforcer is somewhat primitive in this approach, featuring no backup and only a crude radio to call in prisoner transport (this is executed via a loading screen), but I feel after many updates the realism will shoot up, making the game a more immersive experience than it currently is.The usual bugs are found, odd animations, cars flying everywhere, but these don't really affect gameplay too much (they did on the first release; gunfights were a mess!),, and provide a few laughs. It is a bit annoying, though.As it stands, Enforcer: Police Crime Action needs a lot of work, but if we do get that, it could easily be worth its £14.99 asking price.  "

 Enforcer: Police Crime Action is a simulator game, and nothing else. The game has about 10-20 hours of gameplay, and is sorta fun until the moment when you realize that you have taken the same call 10 times. PLEASE NOTE: The development studio that made this shut down, your money will go into a bottomless pit if you buy this. PROS:Decent gameplay.Graphics are tolerable. (in comparison to JC3)It does get that simulator feel.Immersive enough (just enough) to be a little scary at times.Okay menu screen music?CONS:As i said in the intro, the game has very little variety. Even the shrubbery looks copy pasted.The story is utterly unnecessary, Simulators need no story. Take farming simulator. Do you need a story to understand what you are there for? Unless you can’t read, no. Same applies here.The game has been 100% abandoned by the developers. (The developers are abandoned too.) Unless you want a unfinished, unpolished game, DO NOT BUY [/b]The cut scenes are rendered in game, green region travelling walls and all.The NPC models.. Err, are strange…BugsThe scripting is strange.. When I was playing the game a little so I could make this review, I pulled a guy over for wrecking into a cement truck*, and randomly, after telling him he could go, he just randomly sprinted off and ran at a car furiously until I arrested him. *that wasn’t considered a crime, apparently.Some callouts are WAY too easy. I was called out to an injured person call, and I walked over, and called an ambulance, then it was over. No robbers. Nothing.One of the buttons while you are on duty does nothing that I can see (also, why a gun while off duty? I have never been attacked? Is that a thing?)In the game, it appears that you are the only cop in the city. Are you getting shot at by a gang? Tough luck mate. In real life, the entire city would come to kill them  if a single shot was fired at an officer, let alone 20! But in the game, you are the only person with a gun that isn’t trying to kill you!There is nothing stopping you that I know of from going and frisking everyone on the streets, farming easy points from the random illegal item system.  So much for the fourth amendment.In closing, It’s kinda fun, but unless you want a unfinished game, don’t buy. "

												It's really not that bad. Let's just get that out of the way. Now, on to the review.This game needs some tlc for sure. The car physics aren't that great. They work, but don't expect GTA or Forza handling. The interface suffers from some flaws such as some wonky dialog boxes to choose actions, some odd ""loading"" type screens when taking certain actions that remove a car or an object from the world (such as towing a car or calling an ambulance) and interfacing with cars, drivers and suspects lacks useful feedback beyond a text message at the top of the screen. Some visual feedback would be nice, such as seeing missing/expired plates and/or defective equipment on the cars prior to a dialog-box based inspection once the car is stopped. It's a usuable system, but a complete overhaul to make it more intuitive and user-friendly would be a welcome change.The career system is lacking. I've yet to see any difference in the ""ranks"" beyond unlocking a new vehicle type. It would be nice to see it fleshed out more. Having to go ""off duty"" to reduce your stress level is an interesting idea, but lacks any depth beyond refilling a meter. Some more direct interaction would help it. The station serves little purpose except to drop off prisoners and request a ""warrant"" but I have yet to figure out what that even does.There's a currency in the game which is earned by working and can be spent on furnishing for your home (again, not a bad idea, just needs some work to makeit interesting.) Beyond appearances, everything seems to give the same stat boosts. Take the TV for example. The cheap and the middle priced TV both give an equal amount of stress reduction, negating the point of buying the more expensive TV. The other part which makes no sense at all is you have to pay for your own gas and vehicle repairs. I could understand repairs to a point, as you should be punished somehow for wrecking a squad car, but fuel? That makes no sense. Require fill-ups, sure. But no cop pays for fuel from his own pocket. The controls are functional, but again need thought out a little better. For instance, when ordering a suspect to stop, you have to use the ""C"" key. If you have your gun out, in order to fire, you first have to ""aim"" with a right click. I would remove the ""aim"" portion (since you should already be aiming if your gun is out) and bind the command function to the right click, so you can give orders quickly and still be prepared to shoot. Again, not a big issue, just an annoyance.So what is good about this game? All of it. It's a hell of a concept, with many underlying systems which make it all work well together. It's not perfect and it's a buggy mess, but it does have a certain allure and charm. The different styles of cruisers are really cool. Thee are several customization options once rank 3 is unlocked, including rims, paint scheme, lightbar type, and colors of each side on the lightbar. Once again, it needs more, but it really is a cool start.The missions can be repetative, but the constant stress of responding to a call and not knowing what you're walking into is really well captured. Sometimes it ends in a gunfight, sometimes they run then turn and shoot at you, and sometimes they just surrender or you really have to work at identifying which person is the right suspect. Again, it has it's flaws, but has potential. The biggest complaint I have is that there is always a suspect somewhere when given a call. It would be nice to occasionally find out no crime was actually comitted, but that would require a much more in-depth investigation system which I doubt this game would be capable of pulling off.Sometimes drivers pull over, sometimes a chase ensues, sometimes they bail and run on foot. Again, you never know what you will get. I can't commend this game well enough at mixing in the unknown to every contact with a car or suspect. It really is a good mix and keeps the game entertaining.If you want a perfect, AAA game with minimal bugs, tons of content, and bleeding edge graphics, then skip this title. However, if you enjoy finding hidden gems that might be a little rough around the edges, then definately give this one a shot. Have realistic expectations of what teh game is and is not and you will find it really enjoyable. Also, if you have younger children that are always fascinated with police, fire and ambulance vehicle every time they see one, then play this with them. There is no gorey bloody deaths, and while there is the occasional shootout, you still have to call an ambulance for the ""bad guy"" and be the good guy. For some with small children, it can be a good option instead of GTA and stealing cop cars.  "

Posted: December 27, 2014
												Well overall to summarise on this game, if you enjoy being a cop then go for it, especially if you havent played a cop simulator game before. As i got into it i was enjoying it, seemed quite new and refreshing, with placing speed cameras, traffic cones, stopping traffic, breathalising drivers, checking for damage etc. Then you got the missions that come up suddenly like theres been a report of a robbery so you have to investigate and catch the suspect(s).But so far into the game, this is pretty much all i've done. You start off as a police officer rank and work your way upto chief of police, and in the help guide in the game, it says as you progress ranks you unlock new missions and therefore take on more challenging and complex jobs. Yet this hasnt been the case, as i'm now a Lieutenant and i'm still doing the same jobs (getting the same jobs) that i've been given since the start and its now all too repetetive.So to sum up for me...i good game, different. But longetivity doesnt seem to be there for me, as i just keep getting the same missions despite having been promoted ranks and i'm now not too far off the top rank as lieutenant. Maybe someone else will back me up on this or reassure me that new missions do come up once you progress from lieutenant.Bit disappointing in this respect but a decent game. I'd recommend buying it when on discount.			"

												Edit: keep in mind I made this review a decent amount of time ago, some of the problems have been fixed such as your car getting damaged while entering places like the gas station after the map was entirely redesigned, however many other problems mentioned still persistLet me start off by saying this game shows potential, however with that beign said, this game is not a finished product.The game has a number of problems that need to be fixed before it can truly be considered a worthwhile purchaseone of the first problems I noticed while playing the game is that, at least in the starting region, driving onto the platform for the gas station will damage your car, there is literally no way around this from what I have seen, this also occurs in other locations around the city such as the repair station (or whatever it is called). Furthermore the missions are often rather repetative as the criminals will often spawn in the same locations every time. In addition there is literally no incentive to bring the criminals back alive (if they have their gun drawn) you recieve the same points for killing the criminal as you do for brining them back alive (unless they dont have their gun drawn, points are lost for shooting at them).  As well despite the several distinct regions in the game, they all feel almost entirely bland as they are rife with either unenterable buildings, or land with nothing on it. Another thing that I must complain about is the fact that shooting vehichles does literally NOTHING, if you shoot at a vehichle it will not do any damage to the vehichle or the driver, also problamatic is the fact that if you shoot at a civilian vehichle, no points are deducted. Another problem is that if you simply quit and reload your game, your stress level will be reset and your sleep and hunger levels are also almost enitrely reset, which removes the necessity to take anytime off. There are also rampant glitches, such as the fact that the main city (or at least the one your house is in the region of) is rife with invisible potholes on the streets that will do damage to your car if you go over them at too high a speed and possibly even send your vehichle flying. As well I have noticed sometimes that there will randomly be vehichles just sort of floating in the air. I have also noticed that sometimes in the city various vehichles will run into each other for no apparent reason, maybe it is just the drunk drivers but I dont know.Overall, I think that if the problems with this game are fixed it could be a good or maybe even a great game, I really do like the concept of a game where you play as a police officer as it has not been done very often, however until they fix the problems listed and the many more that I probably didnt notice or think to write about, then it is not really a worthwhile purchaseUPDATE: they are improving the game however, so hopefully soon they will fix the bugs that currently plague the game			"

												While I've seen more than a few rather negitive reviews on this game, I'd like to add to the growing pool of positive ones.This game lacks a certain polish -- it almost reminds me of the old GTA or Driver games, yet has a sincere charm to it. It's a great concept (as mods for GTA V such as LCPD:FR have shown with their massive fanbase), and this actually isn't a bad excution of it, while it needs some serious bug-hunting and polish, the potential is certainly there.Problems:1.) Days are way too short, you don't have time to do much, then your character is clutching his guts in agony while standing in the road.2.) Time compression is extreme, gas runs out, hunger sets in, and your character becomes lethargic all while driving to work.3.) Physics are non-existent, one stop light in particular sends cars flipping across the road, good entertainment value, but certainly immersion breaking.The good stuff:1.) I think a game like this has had a demand for some time now, while we've seen a few teasers over the years they've often turn to little more than a flash in the pan, unless you count the CoD clone SWAT games (police=FPS... wut?).2.) The game-play is rather straight forward, and the Sims-esque needs give you a break after putting the hurt on drunk drivers for a couple hours. I know after playing GTA V with LCPD:FR for a couple hours, I often got bored and started a massive killing spree -- no reason to do that here.3.) Options: car liveries, and player clothing. You have several asthetic options right off the bat, all of which seem to have had work and thought put into them.4.) The future -- I think this game will get the polish it needs, the devs are small enough to work with their potential fanbase, and although I haven't had look at the files yet, probably has a good modability factor.I know what you're asking and why you're reading this: ""Red, should I buy this game with my hard-earned money?""Well, I really couldn't tell you -- while the potential is there, it isn't yet. Is it worth $20? Probably not.. not yet anyways. Do you have $20 you want to spend and help a small company along the way? Then buy it. But if you don't want to spend $20 just to see if you like it, then I wouldn't recomend it, you'd end up hating it like the rather harsh people who've commented before me because now you think you ""wasted"" $20 on ""this"". Give it a shot though, and keep an eye on it, I know I will.-RedHorizon			"

Thats how some games are! I wanted a Police Simulator so I searched and they were the only people to make such a game! I couldn't find not a single Police Simulator like this one. I said to myself this took some risk on their part because of such a small community of people who like Simulator games like myself. I really hope they are able to make another one and learn from the bugs that are ""here and there"". Its called trial and error. To me the game has heart and in the end comes out a winner!  :)  "

												It’s a good game, if you like GTA LCFPD or Arma life without the multiplayer. Its easy to gain rank in the game. The good thing is, it has the making to be a really great game. Open it up for modders and watch the game come to life. It would also be great to put in multiplayer as well. I am waiting to find out the engine of the game to start to create 3d models for it. What I saw so far is there are not enough different cars, need more variety of people. Why aren't there a lot of gas stations, or more cars to buy? Add more cities or scenery. The lights effects are pretty cool, but you should have more patterns like a Wheelen bar or liberty one? It’s a game built on being a police officer, yet there is no customization for your uniform or gear or weapons? Currently there is two games that are getting built “EmergencyNYC” and “ Police 1013” which won’t be released to 2016. This gives you a chance to make the game a whole lot better than it is now, you have fans I to help you out. You can make it better. Last thing as it stands. The game as it stands is an alpha trying to go into a beta version its barebones with good start, but I think it needs more. I would recommend this game to friends, but mostly on realistic mode for a challenge and if it was open to mods.Thanks "

												When you take into consideration the fact that the team who made this game is very small and also had a miniscule budget as well as it being there first foray into PC gaming, it really is a great game! Sure it has its bugs and glitches that do get annoying but they can be remedied with some bug fixes and patches. The game devs really put alot of time and effort into it as I've been watching this games development from the very beginning, since the days there supporters could be counted on one hand and I must say that I am not disappointed.I'd recommend it if you're a fan of LCPD:FR.Infact hell, I'd just recommend it because I'm having so much fun :)Edit: As I have played alot more of the game I've come to the conclusion that I'd recommend that people should wait a wee while for the major bugs to be ironed out and optimisation of the town, Vehicles, states and such to be implimented as some are a little frustrating at this time.

												Well, where can i start?I was excited to play this game and oh boy was it a disappointment.The graphics in the game a bearable. I mean they're not really good but it's good enough.The AI well they can be really dumb. I saw an ai standing on the hood of the car and the car was going at least 20mph. It was quite funny to watch. The AI have they're spasms but honestly it wasn't that much, so the ai are good for what they are.The missions.. Oh my god.. The missions are unbelievably repetitive. I would say after an hour playing the game you'll be really bored because the missions are repetitive, you go round stopping them to check their vehicle and you do that almost every shift. Yes, you get the odd occasion where you get asked to stop a drug deal but even that is boring. The reason why is because you only need two bullets in your gun to kill the drug dealers, those kind of missions go way to quickly. Overall the missions are a pile poo. Another thing is sometimes you don't even get those drug dealers, arrest a murderer and that get really make you just want to quit the game.The driving well not much to say it's easy and their is nothing wrong with it.I think other than that the game is good. There need to be improvements but apart from the poopy missions the game is good.IMPROVEMENTS:1: Being able to mark a point on the minimap2: Need a storyline and more interactive missions.3: Ai cops4: Fix the game all togetherWell, that has been my review on this game. I do not recommend this game at the moment, who knows maybe in the future this game good be fxied but for now i highly recommend you don't spend your money on it. I have already requested a refund so i shall be getting my money back and getting something a little bit more my taste. Anyway i hope this helped.			"

												I want to make this review short and sweet since this game is hardly worth my time to review, however I find it my duty as a gamer to ward off people hoping to buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥---------------------------------------------First off: It's plagued with bugs. Flying cars, glitching NPCs, falling through the earth, getting stuck in the ground or buildings, failing an objective despite completing it with flying colours, hell some objectives won't complete at all and you'll be stuck in a state of boredom limbo.Secondly: The game is horrendously boring, so far I've only experienced 5 different events multiple times, and 2 flavours of side activity. Most of the time will be spent mining trading cards or waiting for the off chance that you actually get given an objective that you haven't completed 50 times previously.Thirdly: The team has abandoned it completely. They are nowhere to be found except in their miserable fiefdoms, moderating their forum with an iron fist like a Cold War era Russian dictator. They don't listen to it's player base, they don't update their game, they break all of their promises and they have the *gall* to insult players with actual concerns, actual criticisms and actual desires to see this game completed.---------------------------------------------In summary, stay away from this mess, the game is broken and it won't be fixed and the development team are petulant children not deserving of a single cent from you.If you want a police simulator, you're better off getting the First Response mods for GTAIV or V.

												Ever since I heard about this game, I was very excited for it to be released. I bought it the day it came out, and I think it was worth the 15 dollars I spent on it, but maybe not the full price. At least not yet. The game still needs a lot of work, but I appreciate that the developers are working hard to fix all the issues with the game. I'm not sure how quickly it will be fully fixed, but when it is, this game will be really great. For example, I am still having issues with cars flying in the air, and a lot of pop in. I'll be driving down the road and sometimes objects will just appear right infront of me. This makes it almost impossible to drive through town without almost totalling my car each time. I also am still having a lot of issues with lag. If I was playing a game like Skyrim on Ultra I might question if my computer can handle it, but with this game, I'm pretty sure it still needs to be optimized for more graphical set ups. I have a quad core and radeon duel graphics, so I think I should be able to handle this just fine... Any ways, once all the issues are worked out this game could be a lot of fun. I'll still thumbs up it because I have faith it will get better!			"

												This game showed the same amount of promise every game in this genre has shown. The devs have unlimited hopes and aspirations from the community and only have to make a halfway decent game to appease everyone and keep from being picked apart and that's exactly what this game is... Halfway decent which sucks to say because we have yet to see a good realistic police sim. 5/10While the devs got the base mechanics of the game right, there are just too many empty promises they made to the community to rate this game any higher and I feel like I'm being generous with a 5.

												Wow, this is so unfinished it makes Temper Tantrum look like a triple A title.Let me tell you about Enforcer: Police Crime Action. After having no idea what the hell this was ( i got given it free for attending a event in London) i came home and was not really expecting much, Booted the game, the idea itself is interesting (not unique in anyway) but atleast intreseting. But Wow within litteraly seconds i was shocked at how bad the current state of this game is. Its like a half arssed student project. The models are awful, the animations are awful, the world iteslf makes no sense (its a 20 second drive from corner to corner of the city) The mission are boring such as - Place parking tickets on cars. The game gives you guns and everything at the start so theres no sense of progression, The world is bland and clearly just thrown together without a thought at all, there are around 20 meaningless people that walk the entire earth, the cutscenes dont render correctly and when they do there a left over assets in the background, if the cars hit the player they just bounce off (due to the player weighing more, because of lazy programming) this game is FILLED to the brim with Bugs, i fell off the map twice, litterally played this for 30 mins and will never touch again. Now i wouldent mind if this game was £1.99 or something, but £15. What a joke, this is a unfinished mess, and the devs care only about money not the quality of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Since when does the police officer have to pay for refueling & repair costs to the police vehicle while on duty? Don't the tax payers cover that? Also where are my free donuts?

												This game is about a police action simulator in a small city, mixing genres of action, adventure and RPG. The player control the life of a police officer in a sandbox world, taking many kind of missions and at same time try to develop his career, building a non-linear open story.Enforcer brings you a different concept about how you can play a third person police game. You, as a player, can choose between a man or a woman to build a career and earn ranks if you are up to the task.The players have freedom to do many actions, but they will also suffer the consequences, especially in their career score points which can enable new promotions or not.Besides random mission calls during 365 days of a year inside the game, the player can patrol and talk with every civilian roaming in Towns and rural areas. After finishing your job, you can go home and upgrade your house, buying new items and furniture, or even a new car. Take care of your family, this can also helps you to control your stress.Choose between normal and realistic modes where ""permadeath"" is activated.Drug dealers, drunks, speeders, kidnapping, house breaking and many more missions will keep you busy and alert. And don't forget to punish that drivers that parked at wrong places, shame on them.Community Rating6.2/10			"

												Let me start this review off by saying that this game has its quirks, but also has a peculiar charm that keeps making me come back to play it. While it has a lot of fun things to do, it currently is quite buggy, which the developers have promised to fix in patches, along with new features in the next few months. So here are the pros:- Has a fun concept; patrol the town and surrounding country looking for criminals or traffic violations.- Different dispatch missions; various calls like drunks causing trouble, robberies etc.- Multiple ways of catching criminals; tasers, guns, shout at them to surrender etc.- You can kick people's doors in an arrest them with a warrant (this is buggy at the moment tho)Cons:-VERY buggy and not very user friendly at the moment (probably fixable in patches soon though)- There's no backup system, so ATM you're the only cop in town-animations, drivng physics and pursuits don't really work properly.-tasers make people hover in the air for a minute (???)So overall, if you're a fan of games such as SWAT 4 and GTA 4's LCPDFR mod, i'd recommend you give it a try after a few patches. For the dev's first PC release, it's pretty decent, with a good graphics/sound options menu. "

												Ever played The Sims or GTA and wanted to have more fun as a cop, then play this. I have a feel that this is a first ever game made by this developer/group and for a first its pretty good. Be warned, this has more of a GMod or just a mod feel to it and really you might feel its incomplete or early access. It feels like that to me but it seems that the developer is active and adding content which is good. You can either wait for more content to be added or wait for it to go on sale when the price is more around where its worth.			"

I wouldn't reccommend this if you are looking for a modern action game, but if you are looking for a niche police simulator it is good.

												Keep in mind this is very early in the release in the game:The basics of the game are quite simple; you go on duty, you pull people over, and respond to calls. It is very simple for the sole reason of it is a sandbox game- you roam and do what you want. The controls are a little difficult to adjust to but after you get the hang of it you find it all the more fun. The games concept is amazing. For a small team of developers the game could not really be any better thus far. Although it is not ""Next Gen"" in terms of graphics (or conrols for that matter) does not mean it is a bad game.  Yes, the game has several bugs that are being worked on. The game has the potential to be the only one of its kind and excel in the market. After the update late last night (day 2), I can already see the major imporvements and fixes. As long as the developers keep their ears open to the community I do not see how this game could be beaten. "

												I do not recommend supporting this company.  Any defense of traditional Europe/traditional values is branded by the forum moderators as xenophobic and autobanned.  Any profit they make off of you would probably end up promoting communism on some level, promoting destruction of European culture, identity, and economy.  If you're one of the people who has had enough of the BS with the elites selling out the traditional Western countries to create the nightmare they call the ""global village"" (translated- make everyone in the west poorer, make it impossible to start business, freeze up the economy with regulations, etc..), then don't support these guys.  If you think Europe should NOT be invaded by parasite vermin from around the world who are doing nothing but mooching off the welfare state, you are not welcome on their forum.  They do a great job destroying themselves.  What's even more ridiculous, is that I was DEFENDING the developers in the forum, telling complainers and perennial whiners to shut up, because they only paid 20 bucks and to stop thinking it's going to give them their dream come true.  Developers will even ban the people who defend their work if you go against their weird political agenda of inclusion of terrorists and unchecked invaders in Europe.			"

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupDisclaimer: The copy of this game was provided by the developer for review purposesFew words about the gameEnforcer: Police Crime Action is a a game that shows complete opposite side of GTA series - the righteous side of the law. You're in control of policeman, starting your career from the very bottom of it, showing us with lots of details how does the average life of law-enforcement officers looks like.Advantages - Good, quite uniqe concept of game - Absorbing gameplay with tons of various missions and events - Sounds are done quite well and voicing of characters is predominantly very good, big ""+"" for it - Control over your characters, whether on foot or by car, is bit weird yet very responsive - Map is impressive thanks to its size and diversityDisadvantages - Mechanics and physics of game are horribly... stiff I would say. There is almost no smoothness anywhere you look around - Graphics are kinda not satisfying as for 2014 release - After few in-game days, it forces you to be always on duty as things that are out there to do are really limitet - Buggy and glitchy as all hellSummaryGame is obviously highly unpolished but devs are constantly coming out with new updates to it, fixing quite alot of issues  (when I watched footage from about 1 year ago, game was in really, really worse state), but still, in my opinion it should be in Early Access right now. Yet after all, game is interesting, I might even say that it's bit addictive once you'll get sucked into it, I would love to see even more refined version of it. Even with all this negativity towards game and developpers, I do recommend trying it out. It's interesting and entertaining and belive me, thanks to ""unfinished"" state of game, it's even more fun than you would think it is!Personal score6.5 / 10If you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												Surprisingly good! Since I'm not a cop I can't tell whether this is realistic or not but I'm guessing it's in the right direction. The overall gameplay is good but it has some flaws. Physics are odd and trucks weigh less than your person so you can actually flip a truck by running into it. Whenever I taze people they seem to fly away for a couple of seconds. None of this is game breaking but it should be fixed.Great level of customization. You can change quite a few things on your cop car as well as your house. You can also buy your own car.The game does however feel ""early access"" and does feel a bit dated as well. I hope the developers will continue to work on and improve this game. The game is still good and worth a shot. Price is decent as long as they continue to work on the game.			"

This game needs to be in the hands of developers that are deticated to this game. Until the devs come back and finish this game, my opinion is this. DO NOT buy this game, save your money if you want a good game about police go buy ""This is The Police"" which is a very good game in my opinion that involves police.			"

												Overall, this game is fun to play. At times it is fairly buggy and sadly it does not recieve regular updates to further enhance gameplay. However if this genre is your cup of tea then by all means I would reccomend it if you have time to kill. The game itself is fairly realistic; essentialy you complete day to day police tasks such as issuing parking tickets and arresting drug dealers. You have a health bar along with a hunger bar, strength bar and an awakeness bar (both of the 2 latter can be refilled on duty by using fist tool for a while). All the police vehicles in this game are fairly nice however chases tend to be uncommon.Please note: This game is not good for laptops, mine succeeds the minimum requirements but realistically you should use something more powerful, my laptop struggles to handle this game and thus fries itself.

												Surprisingly good! Since I'm not a cop I can't tell whether this is realistic or not but I'm guessing it's in the right direction. The overall gameplay is good but it has some flaws. Physics are odd and trucks weigh less than your person so you can actually flip a truck by running into it. Whenever I taze people they seem to fly away for a couple of seconds. None of this is game breaking but it should be fixed.Great level of customization. You can change quite a few things on your cop car as well as your house. You can also buy your own car.The game does however feel ""early access"" and does feel a bit dated as well. I hope the developers will continue to work on and improve this game. The game is still good and worth a shot. Price is decent as long as they continue to work on the game.			"

												Fantastic game=))) I am a big police games fan so this game is big for me.There are few issues with that game like cars flying, sometimes npcs disappear. Not much to do in the off duty mode ( a few small activities would be good because you just kinda stuck in on duty mode)Also whats up with npcs walking near roads at night in the desert? =))))Also feels like you are the only cop in the whole area ( adding other police officers on duty would be good, maybe a small interaction with them would also be good)Missions are good  7/10 but if put some more action into it and just add a few more.Graphics are good 8/10  ( I not really interested in graphics)Give more life to the world please becuase it is nice , diverse and big environment.Maybe more outfits and things to buy for the house etc.On the whole 8/10I hope that my review will help to you guys.ThanksP.S keep making good police games			"

												This has been by far the worst purchase I have ever made on steam. The system settings they require, should make it easy for me to play, I mean hell, I play Skyrim on here no issues. But for whatever reason, their game is as laggy as they come. My theory, is that the render distance goes to far or something, because there is absolutly no reason why I can play Elder scrolls and not some indie game who's developers have REFUSED to message me back. My computer is a good computer, but its not a super computer. If you have a self-built super computer, you're probably okay to play. It is fun if you can get past the lack of ability to play due to high lag strands. If you're at all in the 99% range, don't get this game. It's unplayable and a waste of money.			"

												If you have ever played GTA IV LCPDFR then you know the love of serious, realistic, police simulation games. In addition if you have played LCPDFR you know the struggle to get the mods you want to work, hell you had problems getting GTA IV to start, but you did what you had to, stayed up through the night to get everything working because you know how fun it is, and now you are looking at this game because its like LCPDFR except you don't have to worry about bugs, crashes, bad mods, no. Finally a game based around the idea of police simulation. Now the question is, is this game good? Is it what we all wanted? The answer, is yes. Amazingly this seems to be the first success of its kind and on my very first day of playing it I already had 5 hours, keep in mind this was not made by Rockstar, this was made by an indie developer so this is not GTA 6 Police, not even close. This game still has minor bugs, it still needs polishing, it is not finished. Currently the game is very enjoyable and playable, none of the minor drawbacks that I just mentioned damper the games ""fun factor"" at all. All I meant by saying that is do not expect GTA 6 Police, however what you will find is a game with good graphics, decent animations, a good selection of vehicles, and a good system of fighting crime. And I know that the one question you still want answered before you buy this game, so I will tell you, yes, you can*Pull people over (Traffic stop). When you do this you have the option to check their plates and license, use a breathelizer, ask them to exit the vehicle, issue a ticket, and I believe a couple more. And yes, sometimes they do run and you must chase after them, but whatever the random situation is you have the choice of letting them go free, write a ticket, or if need be, arrest them and transport them to the station or call a police van. You also should tow their car however that is optional. Now for your characters abilites, you can fight with your fists, you have a pistol, you can direct traffic, you have a taser, and you have your radio to call a police transportation van, an ambulance, a tow truck, and help if your police car runs out of gas or has reached its maximum damage capacity. (Yes cars use gas I know its awesome!) And of course you do get random callouts. There is also a level system, I do not know off hand how many levels their are but I believe their is about 15 or 16. You start as a corpral and make your way all the way down to the final rank Chief of Police. Now depending on your rank you will get more dangerous callouts and get paid more at the end of your shift. Now I do not want to spoil the whole game but you do have shifts and off your shift you go to your house, you can go out with friends, own your own civilian car, eat, watch TV, shower, sleep, and many other things. Now this system of off duty is not the greatest, their is not much to do and it will probably be polished in the future. But I do think that it is good because in a game that is centered around police simulation it would be awkward to be on patrol 24 hours a day 7 days a week, so I do believe this is a good system that was put into play. So that is pretty much what you are getting, also do not forget the whole game is open world, no missions! Now if there was one thing that I could say was the biggest problem with the game currently it would probably the car physics, they are not unplayable but they are not Iracing physics. That is pretty much the end of my review and don't think you know everything now because I am happy to say there are many more features in the game still that you can do as a police officer! I do believe it is worth the money and my final rating on the game *CURRENTLY is a 8.7/10			"

												In my opinion, this game is very broken and incomplete. The game at its current state had good features, but is capable of so much more. Pursuits are ok, callouts get repetitive after a while, car gets damaged way too quickly. I think this game can come a lot farther and better than this. You can add better, more realistic features like spike strips, roadblocks, ai cops, more callouts, more realistic movement, and better physics. Other han  that i would not reccommend the game for 19.99			"

												As much as I watched this game receive a lot of negative publicity when it first launched, all the glitches, the game breaking glitches, and so on. Just about yesterday did I really give this title a chance. Now I am addicted to it. For some odd reason. Allow me to give some Positives and Negatives on the game. So you can decide to make your purchase.Positives: -Plenty of Dispatch Missions to take advantage of, which are Challengings and Fun.-Your Police Vehicle has many customization options.-Wide vast area with much to explore.-Plenty of criminals to arrest.-Responsive Controls.-Driving feels very fluent, but takes time to get used to.-Music is actually very good.-Voice acting is on point.-There is always something to do, even when there are no missions available.-Ranking up feels rewarding as you get an increase in pay.-Weather & Night to Day transitions are wonderfully done.-You are able to decorate and buy new things for your home.Negatives: -Aiming can be a chore to pull off, when you are about to get shot.-Sometimes when doing routine checks on cars, the person driving the car will run sometimes, also very far.-When you arrest someone, you are forced to walk. When you want to put them in your car, especially if they run a far distance, walking takes forever to get back to your car which will inspire you to call police dispatch to lighten the burden.-When finished with routine missions, entering the police station for a warrant based on a mission is a problem. When you step back outside the station, the game forces another routine mission on you, removing the perp from the map. Making it difficult to find where they are again. Unless Dispatch decides to update you on their location, which can take a terribly long time.-illegally parked cars don't spawn often, unless you quit, and restart the game. So when asked to ticket illegally parked cars, there are usually none in the street. There is a way around this by ticketing cars on the street by checking their license plates, and ticketing them that way. Its the only way around it.-You take no damage by getting hit by cars. They usually flip over you. Also you cannot kill a pedestrian by hitting them.-You can only arrest one person at a time. When you're after two perps, you have to dispatch the one first, while the other has the chance to escape as you cannot go after them when you have someone handcuffed.-Sometimes Dispatch missions never show up. Because of a game glitch. You have to sleep 8 hours & restart the game. The glitch is caused by the Stress meter being too low. The game gets confused and doesn't turn back Dispatch calls on.-AI pedestrians have a habit of endlessly walking into vehicles, perps in houses run endlessly into the wall, or the door with their body peeking out of the door when you try to arrest them.-The game has a bad habit of throwing you missions even after your shift is over. They should stop. Because when you end your shift with a mission active, even if its routine, you are penalized points. Which you need to rank up.Even with the negatives I think the game is still very enjoyable. Regardless, its up to the buyer. Happy New Year everyone.			"

Posted: September 7, 2015
												I love police games and have played many variations over the years. I was looking forward to purchasing this game and trying it out. Unfortunately, it's fallen not short, but extremely far from my expectations.This game at best feels half done. From the graphics, the game play, and especially the driving almost nothing exactly feels right. The one thing they did try is attempting to give the player more options in how to catch those who break the law. Even this they did with a great shake.Enforcer : Police Crime Action resembles GTA in it's works. You are a police officer who can switch on and off duty by changing clothes inside your house. The house and your clothing can be customized/purchased and a car can be purchased for your own personal use. When you start out without a car, you'll be getting around by cab fare. There are three main bars you need to worry about : stress, hunger, and energy. Stress can be relieved by sleeping or hanging out with relatives, while the other two are quite obvious in how to replenish. What the game sort of did right was the simplicity in choosing what to ask a suspect. For example, imagine me standing on the side of the road and I see a car. I press C to tell the car to pull over then interact with the person inside by pressing the right mouse button. Upon pressing this, I'm given a few options to choose, from asking the person to step out of the car to using a breathalyzer. The animations are basic and none vary from person to person. Some drivers will be intoxicated or some sort of reason will pop up for you to apprehend them. Although it be it the case, I will give the game kudos for adding decoration to the command menu. When setting up a road block, you are able to walk up to your car and pull out some cones. You can also set up a radar to catch speeders but your involvement in that is literally minimal. You set up the radar and that's as far as you go. You will be waiting until you've reached the goal amount or until you get interrupted by a call on the radio. The game is sort of stale for this reason and other users have mentioned this as well. When a call does come up, a little adrenaline rush comes up and so does excitement... only for so long. Upon arriving on the scene of the crime, you will not catch the perpetrators in the act. Rather, they will be somewhere in the area and it's up to you to ask people for suspicious activity. Approach a perpetrator without a gun cocked and you may be kissing the pavement reminding yourself for the next time to run around like an idiot everywhere with his gun drawn. The game tries to act like a cop game, but I don't know of a single cop willing to run around with their gun in their hand pointing them at everyone and telling everyone hands up. This is the other thing, the objectives for the day such as issuing tickets are fun (to an extent) but when you get a call and usually the outcome involves you firing at the suspect and calling an ambulance, there isn't much to brag about. In the game SWAT 4, suspects were unsure whether they wanted to surrender or not which put the player in a real hot seat and gave them a feeling what it was like to be an officer. Here, the scenario always ends up with a call to the paramedic. It is cool that they give you all sorts of options such as being able to call for a police pickup-up of a suspect or being able to tow a car, but even then options feel quite limited. You are able to stop and frisk anyone you see in the street, but again, it's very limited in how everything goes down. People will 99% of the time shoot at you when you answer to a call on the radio. When stopping people on the street, they will give up right away. If they drop anything while they put their hands up, you are able to collect the evidence. Doing jobs properly will result in acquiring more XP and $$. I should mention that cars do get out of the way when your sirens and lights are on. As an added bonus, you can use your turn signals and even put your hazard lights on. Graphics are at best GTA 3 quality and sounds are as basic as you can get. There is no variation in sound as every bullet and siren will sound exactly the same. The game feels empty due to the lack of ambiance. Every map sections more or less resembles each other to the tee.What's wrong with this game? Well quite a bit. Driving first and fore most is the stiffest I've ever seen in any game. Stopping doesn't really stop you and using the hand break will not get you to where you need to go within a turn. If you forget to turn your engine off, your car may start rolling away. AI will keep walking into you and will not try to avoid you, and sometimes will continue walking into a wall. The other drivers on the road have zero intelligence. When they are told to pull over, they will crash right into you or another car. Also, when you do get run over, you don't get ran over... you get pushed by the car. Apparently it's normal for a cement truck to push a person along like it's another day in Mr. Rogers neighborhood. Not only that, the game feels extremely empty. No one interacts, no one looks around funny, no one looks suspicious, no criminal is on scene upon arriving at a forced entry crime scene even if you're right next door to the crime. I want to love this game and because I'm a hardcore police simulation fan I will play it sporadically, but as far as it goes, this game is only meant for people who have an extremely high tolerance and appreciation for this sort of genre.Giving it anything better than this would certainly be a crime.RATING : 6.0/10(This game is definitely not worth it's stated price)Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C Sounds / Music C Replay-ability C Overall  CScreenShots : Every map resembles this type of sceneryA.I's do a pretty good job pretending you don't existSet up a solid roadblock complete with radarYou won't have to call the fire department ever because nothing will ever be on fireThe collision system is extremely basic in the game.

												GRAPHICS-Its not bad but not good either , The devs can really improve this but it is alright too me atmAUDIO-Pretty good nothing sounds out of the ordinary GAMEPLAY-Pretty fun , Challenging when you want it to be and easy when you want it to be , You do everything a 'Normal Cop"" would do. (Give tickets , Patrol , Stop and frisk (lol) , Give DUI test , ext)  this is a very uniqre game , theres not alot of games like this out there . Whats even more great is that the Dev is very active on the forums and is very dedicated to this game , its grown quite alot ever since i bought it , every update theres something to look forward too. 8/10 - If you want to be a cop , this is your game			"

 Overall Went on my first shift, and i already love the game, its pretty good if you are into police if not you may not like it then. since all you really do is police work, then every now and then an intense gunfight My First Shift so i drive out to town and get my first mission from dispatch, they want me to check on 6 cars to see if there are any drunk drivers""how hard could that be""it would turn at later, that this task became one of the most intense firefights i have ever experienced.anyways up to the 5 driver, i pull him up, get out of my car, walk over to his car and i started to talk to himwhile talking i hear gunfire in the distancethen a call comes from dispatch""ALL UNITS I REPEAT ALL UNITS BE AWARE WE HAVE ARMED GUNMEN DOWNTOWN, I SAY AGAIN ARMED GUNMEN DOWNTOWN""then i realisethe gunmen are nearbyi immediately let the driver go and proceded to get back to my car to take coveri equip my MP5then gunfire gets closeri see two civs run at meboth get shot by two gunmen armed with pistolsi return firenext 10 minutes are just one of the most intense gunfight everi get squad flashbacksgunmen begin to rush mei realise im completely out of ammoi switch to tazer and get ready to taze themi pull off a 360 taze scope#reked100/100 would taze scope again			"

												If you are tired of playing LCPDFR (GTA4 police mod) because it crashes or you have played it enough...This is an awesme game. There are some major issues still. I think this game should be in early access.The major isues are:Big amount of bugsHorrible steeringAI could be smarterBad fps. I get on my computer, even if it's not the best one, in maximum settings around 12fps.Positive things:Nice amount of missions, can get repetitive sometimes.Nice and detailed sound effectsOk graphics, you can compare them to GTA San Andreas.Nice amount of vehicles (5 in total)Overall is an OK game for now. The developers are still updating it. I consider it  a bit expensive for the graphics and content. I give it a 6/10If you want to purchase a better police simulator, in my opinion, check out police 10 13 on steam greenlight.			"

												EDIT 30/10/2014 - The developers released an update and I must admit this game is slowly starting to grow on me after playing for a few more hours.The developers are extremely honest and open about the game and are ready to make improvements with feedback from the community.A second update is to be released today and I am looking forward to see what changes they have made and how it has been improved.ORIGINAL REVIEW AT LAUNCH-Total garbage in its current state.The day/night cycle alone is an absolute joke. How long is a day in your world? 2 minutes?When you are hungry an animation plays as if you were being stabbed along with a hideous sound effect that sounds like someone scraping a rusty knife against another rusty knife.AWFUL!Should definitely not be called a simulation because it's totally unrealistic and breaks the immersion itself continuously.I had high hopes for this, but as of now I am very disappointed.I only played for 30 minutes because the game is just terrible. Great idea, really bad execution.Do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of gta4 and install the LCPD:FR mod. Now that's what I call a police simulator!			"

												At first this game is amazing, then it gets predictable and repititive. This game doesn't seem to be finished, as part of this game is not really realistic. I can understand some of the design implementations such as a red circle that follows the suspects. However their seems to be no physics in the game (ragdoll effects mainly being a concern).  People generally always seem to escape on foot, no hot pursuit action going on which is a little sad. You do these following things repeatedly: 1)Give parking tickets2)Stop drunk drivers/arrest3)Inspect license and vehicle/ticket4)Go to drug dealers (arrest or shoot)5)Go to sick person to make sure they aren't hurtI would say a couple of hours maxes out the replay value. This is the only cop game I am aware of, as you play the game you feel sorry for cops a bit. Realistic mode equals one life, if you die, you die, like being a cop in real life. Bullets can hit you and you would not be able to tell from any visiual indicators in game of where it was shot. There are some things that are removed from being able to be a real life cop, such as backup, bad guys only operate one at a time, no body armor, promotions which don't give any extra endings.			"

												Just did my first 20min run of the game, and it left me giggling, partly from the brick like control of the car and environmebt. Has a POSTAL 2 feel about it, actually it is postal from a cops perspective. Not the violence or language of POSTAL 2, but the same quirky movements and environment and game objectives. Wouldn't surprise me if the same gang that made postal made this game. Will update and refine my review as I go. So like Postal 2, get this game you'll love it.			"

The NPC and AI behavior is a little strange and the driving mechanics are a little wonky at times (The car does not respond bery well to control inputs.)  But other than that I think it is a great police simulator!  Definatly reccomended!			"

												I have found the best way to describe this game. Whilst going through this page and looking at reviews, I figured I should try it. It was on sale and I said to myself ""Why not?"" I personally am a very very very large fan of the police genre of gaming (My favorite games being the SWAT Series, especially SWAT 4, LCPDFR from GTA 4 and various other examples) and while I am very biased in my opinion, which is why it is my opinion, I feel compelled to say that I can see the arguments on both sides. Yes, this game is buggy in various ways (Though not as many as I read about. Maybe I was lucky.) And yes it does have questionable graphics. But this game, to me at least, was not made for the general population. It was made for the people who specifically like to play regular cops and aren't all about the shooting and explosions life styles (I realize the hypocritial way I said SWAT 4 was my favorite police genre game, back off xD). This game has an outstanding amount of minute details. So while I do recommend this game, I recommend it to a very small percent of gamers. If you want a game that's about shooting and explosions then this is not for you. Whilst I love explosions and shooting myself, it's a nice change of pace. And yes, the devs do update this game (As shown by the police motorcycle) but at the same time it is a small dev team so you have to accept some problems. All in all I feel this game was made for me and some other small percentage of gamers. If you are truly stuck on if you should buy this or not, I recommend watching gaming reviews and not someone whose messing with the engine of the game and make up your mind for yourself.			"

												Good Game... it's my first Police Sim but I enjoy it. It is a fun game but has a great deal of flaws:1: Graphics obviously aren't the best2: Vehical Handleing isn't the easiet to get a hang of3: And there is some weird thing glitches, like once I got a report of a murder suspect so I got a warrent and went to there hosue, I walked in they pulled a gun so I shot them, but the game took 1500 points from me! Also when you pull drivers over and inspect their car it sometimes says ""Illegal Licences Plate"" Normally you get arrested for that and in this you can only ticket the criminal. 4. I activated the HOHOHO cheat which added a christmas theme and IT WON""T GO AWAY!!! Other then a couple flaws it is an enjoyable game to play if you can deal with the bugs, I hope you the makers see this and hear other player's cries for help and they fix these flaws, it would make the game 10x better!

												I would definetly recommend this game. The Graphics arent Great but this is the first good police simulator that takes place in the U.S. that doesnt require any mods. I compared this to LCPDFR and i think that LCPDFR has better graphics and better vehicals but there are more ""police like"" features for this game and with some good mods this game will definetly be on everyones wishlist. The thing that they can improve to make it just as good as LCPDFR is if they had more realistic vehicals with a more relistic ELS.			"

												Alright, so i will not rate this game more so because i honestly believe the idea is GREAT.  Seriously i felt like it was real but the graphics, the mechanics and some issues are what is seriously hampering the games progress.  I recommend a revamp on the game to build it up for an official release.  To the creator/team;You guys are great for putting forth a game that not many people could make.  Just my advice being an avid gamer is try to not rush things.  You can see that games like GTA V and other big titles are taking their time either because of competition or because they feel they can fix things for a great release.  You are on the right track and i hope to expect more from you all.			"

												This is fairly decent for the price. It has some very nice gameplay elements. It has the potential to expand and become better. Everything works well.Pros  - Gameplay is decent. You work as a police officer, then when off duty, you get to enjoy personal time. meet with friends and family, eat, sleep, watch tv, use a computer. Its a nice mix.         - You get to customize your house and vehicles.         - You can Purchase new vehicles.         - The Realism is there, but it is wanting to be improved.Cons - Driving is a little touchy, Graphics seem blury and blocky sometimes, but all managable.         - The Controls are a little fiddly         - The AI vehicles & People randomly spawn in front of you when your racing to an incident.          - Traffic doesn't flow nice.I've enjoyed the game so far.

												This is a game Ive been looking for, for sometime now. I really love the the game as an idea, so far there have been a few bugs. Now i paid for the game knowing there were bugs and there might be some problems. IF you buy the game keeping an open mind then you should be very pleased. I would how ever like to see/ hear more on the radio. The same few things being said over and over does get very old quick, so i just pull up a real police scanner for the noise. also the hunger and tired thing, i understand maybe a flashing message but something that locks you up so you cant move is not realistic at all, that being said also i would like yo see the game opened up for the steam workshop i think it would add alot more to the game and also take alot of the pressure off of the team and allow the community to mod it here and there to make it better, like more cars, diffrent types of calls, more actions when it comes to interacting with the world. I really enjoy the game and can see what it can/will become. I hope with a few more months of work this will be the game ive dreamed of for years			"

												Already addicted. This game has a very realistic feel to it, and has many different features that you can do; For example you can walk up to an civilian NPC and ask them if they have seen someone with a warrant, if they seem drunk you can ask them to take a breathealyzer. You can also check the NPCs for drugs and weapons along with many other things. Somtimes you're hiding near a highway with radars ready to catch speeders. Sometimes im patroling watching for gang/drug activity. The only downside to this game is that the graphics are terrible, they're similiar to the ps2's graphics and have similar graphics to GTA: San Andreas, but I hardly even notice the bad graphics and they're easily overlooked. This game is especially impressive considering only FOUR men came together to make this game. I would defintely recommend this game.			"

												Before I wouldn't have bought this game for the £15. Seeing as it was half price I thought I'd give it a shot and I bought it. Great small game in short! If you are a fan LCPD:FR mod for GTA IV then I highly recommend this. Only played roughly 20 minutes of gameplay but I can tell you you'd love it. Bought it to also support the developers for doing a great job in this new genre. If you get your kick from graphics then this may not be for you, I won't say they're terrible but more or less just look old.I'm hoping for some sort of multiplayer coop, graphic update (or mod support), more vehicles/skins, animations, player models etc.Quite impressed. Really recommend if this is up your street! "

												Repetative is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this game. In the trailers it seems as if there are cool crimes to arrest people for such as robbery, murder, or kidnapping. While ther are these crimes that occur they RARELY happen. In the mean time there is really not much to do but the boring repetative stop and frisk, or pull over a breathalize. The controls for this game are a whole other problem. The car is near impossible to steer which wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to pay your money that you made in the game to repair it. Overall, I think that this game started out with a good concept in mind but with a lack of variety and hard to use controls, the idea never blossomed.			"

												Great idea for a game, but not the correct price for the current product.I have read that the developers are really working on it, but, in my opionion, there is REALLY much to do to sell this game at 20 €...Now, it worth a price of 6-8 €, not more.Really, the game at the current state seems more like a good alpha, that a finished product.

												So, when I saw this game, I thought it was going to be like Police Quest and be a police sim with some kind of accuracy about it.However, it's a good deal more like GTA from the police perspective.Honestly, I think the thing that throws me off the most is the dialog.  A lot of what's said from dispatch, or the written text, is odd and strikes me as non-English speakers who've never watched Cops trying to write dialog.  I would expect less ""There's a murderer on the loose"" and more ""Shots fired; civilian casualties"" or ""Armed suspect reported"" or the like.  Google searches reveal that the dialog used to be even worse, so this is *after improvement*.There isn't much polish; the little things will constantly eat at you.  Like, trying to back up your squad car feels clunky, or having it slide backwards down a hill when it's parked (which I guess is fixed in the latest patch).  You basically harass and pull over random people to try and make your quotas, with only a few traffic violations being ""externally visible"".  I will say I was really impressed when, at night, I could actually see people with their headlights broken and ticket them for it.  That was cool, I'll give them that!You can't pull people over for running lights, you can't issue tickets for accidents.  The game doesn't seem to care if you, yourself, drive recklessly and there doesn't seem to be a penalty for damaging innocent cars.  Scarface: The World Is Yours had better traffic law mechanics.  I couldn't even pull over a truck that ran a light, then rammed into a street light and blocked an intersection.And finally, the weather; when it started raining, the sound of the storm was really overwhelming and irritating.  And it was raining inside the police station, which was great.  In my house, at least it wasn't raining in there but it was still equally loud as outside.  Really obnoxious.One of the things that made Police Quest cool was they actually hired law enforcement folks to help design the game.  I'd love these guys to take another shot at this game, with Enforcer 2, and actually hire a cop to help them make it.  Despite all my problems with this game, I really want to love it, and I really tried to, so please try again.			"

												Of course, GTA5 with LSPDFR and GTA4 with LCPDFR are better than this game. Good grapchics, there are many nice plugins, excellent system. I'm fun of LSPDFR/LCPDFR. Everyone's reviews are correct, I think so. But, I think that it is very difficult for me to critisize this game in comparison to LSPDFR/LCPDFR.One reason.There are few games which able to do patrol duty in video game market. Very famours patrol duty game is ""Police Quest"". P.Q. is very nice game but it is too old in today. I understand that P.Q. system is plannd and excellent at the video game age. "" Is P.Q. fun or not fun ? "". I answer "" very fun "". Just the same, P.Q. is too old game. Can we find in easy other patrol duty game at current game market ?. That is not easy. Police patrol duty games (simulation, adventure, action and other) are very few. So, I praise this game developer's challenge at the video game market.Other one reason. G17 Media, LSPDFR and LCPDFR developer, members are working without benefit. We have to buy only GTA5/GTA4. Of course, we can donate to G17 Media but is it enough for them?. G17 Media  members has enough income from everyone's donation ?. Other LSPDFR/LCPDFR plugin developers are too. We can benefit by their non-benefit and non-paid working. The better way, patrol duty games are published at video game market.As soon as we will be able to find other patrol duty games at a market. EmergeNYC from FlipSwitch, Responding from Visionary Studios, Police1013 from Wingman Games. I'm very happy. I want to praise every developer's challenge.			"

												75/100Enforcer is a simulator game for being a police officer. You work every day and do missions that dispatch gives you, check for drunk drivers check for expired licence plates and such. From time to time you get a ""special"" crime such as murder robery and assault. The game it self is not bad, i personaly enjoyed it. But ofcourse it is not perfect and there is room for improvement. The physics engine isnt really doing its job well but tbh it kinda ads to the fun. The 20 € they ask for the game is a tad to much and i simply do not belive the game it self is worth that much at this state but if the game dev's improve some parts of it i would definitly recomend this. I have gotten this game in a giveaway and i am happy with it. The +'s of the game :The feeling of driving around as a police officer is really good. You can advance your carrer by doing good things. Ofcourse you can write tickets to the people who did nothing wrong but you get penalized which i really like, since it removes the ""being a cop like in GTA"" feeling. You can see your actions give good or bad results. There are several ""maps"" or well, area's inside of the mountain town you are working in and that gives it some diversity. You can get better police cars and you can even have some sorth of a customization when it comes to your police (and the civilan car you can own later in the game (its costly)) Some other features i enjoyed in this game were the fact that you can use comply to make people listen to you, its not one of those meh youre just a cop, you actualy have some respect and authorty as a police officer. There are ofcourse moments where the perp's run away by foot or by car and you have to chase them which adds to the game's action. Id like to add that the graphics in this game is relativly ok and that it doesnt really kill the good vibe the game has.The -'s of the game :Like ive said in the upper part of this review the physics engine is a bit dull, if it happens that you are parked on the sidewalk people will walk all over your car, if you accidentily run someone over you will just slide underneeth them. Another thing i find bothersome is the ""roadblock"" with the traffic cones simply stop the car, there is no riding around them and such which i belive would improve the game a ton. And maybe a bit more variaty in the missions we get since, stoping 20 cars is ok but still. Im sure that higher rank cops dont do that :) All in all i would recomend this game to people, maybe not for 20 but i do belive that you should grab it if you find it on sale. The 12 hours i have on this game (atm) have been speent by enjoying in the game, and not really being bothered by it. Also to finish this game isnt for everybody, so do watch the trailers, and do follow it. Since i belive with effort from the dev's this can become a really good Police Simulator.			"

												Not the game i expected it to be, its sortt of poor. The game looks amazing, in screenshots, the game itself plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ car physics suck,  gameplay is quite buggy and boring. The game has cutscense for when you call for a officer to come pick up a prisoner, all it is, is a picture. Same as if they are injured or if you are impounding a vehicle, civilians are buggy, gameplay is very repetitive. This game should be in early access not a full release, it is no where near complete and needs alot more work done. i personally dont reccomend this game, espcially for people who love games where you play as a officer of the law or role-play or anything, it is not done and not good.

												I've never had a game in which I've had to turn down the graphics so many times, yet even on the lowest graphics, the game is still laggy and the vehicle controls are way too sensitive even on the lowest settings. I have to constantly pay for vehicle repairs because everytime I press 'W' my vehicle jolts forward at 30mph and rams into a vehicle. I enjoy the weapons design, and the vehicle designs, but the lag is way too much for a game of such a small size.			"

												Read my whole review (you too excalibur).The games is fun and all and but in it's current state it's not a good game... It needs alot of patches and bug fixes an example is when a car hits you, what happens is that the car makes a flip. Another one is when I travel from one part of MV to another one, my car loses 1 hp. When my sirens and lights are on some cars still manage to hit me and the drivers are not drunk.. Things are very expensive. I was on a mission I had to shoot 2 drug dealers, I got hit once and and shot like 8 bullets. My car got hit by another car and i had to pay for the gas. I had to pay 100$ for the bullets, 200$ for medicine 25$ for my car and 11$ for the gas plus the food that is 5$... I earned 600$. My total expenses were 341$ 600$-341$= 259$. The cheapest car costs 9000$... After my shift I have to either walk home (like 7-10 minutes running) or waste 20$ on a cab to my house. You have to pay to get food out of your fridge, it's 5 dollars... wtf? The physics in this game suck, driving is laggy even with the lowest graphic settings with me and I have no clue why because I can run games like arma and BF4 on max FPS. 2 body shots with an m9 can drop me but with my mp5 I need 4 body shots (m9 fires 9×19mm Parabellum bullets and so does the mp5, this means that it fires the same bullets but I need more shots to drop someone). The map is split in small parts which is really annoying because I get lost alot (for anyone of you who has postal 2, think about going from one part to another) This wastes alot of time on just loading that and I get lost sometimes trying to find my house.. Also when I arrest someone and as for a van to pick them up I see a screen saying ""Good job, one less criminal on the streets""... They could've added a truck to pick them up.My advice to you: Don't buy this game unless you are willing to deal with the bugs.This game has potential, if you fix these bugs it will be an amazing game.Thanks for reading this.

												I want to give this game a good rating. I really do. But sadly, this game does not deserve it.I've tried this game a couple of years ago when it first came out. It was absolutely broken and pretty much unplayable. Now that I got an opportunity to try it for free I checked it out again.It got only a bit better than it was before.List of weird stuff I've experienced:1. The AI is REALLY stupid. The cars bump into each other (some of them fly away when it happens).2. When you're looking for a criminal, you can find him often being stuck at the wall of some building.3. The car still gets damaged pretty much all the time (especially when at the gas station) and the fuel runs out very fast.4. Pretty much 50% of the down population have serious problems. Most of the cars they drive are damaged, they're often drunk.. sometimes when you drive through the city, people get out of their cars and try to shoot me. (as far as I know the bullets still do nothing to the cars)5. Spending time with people is a joke. Why would I get a round of applause every time I spent some time with someone?Afterwards, I get teleported to their homes and there's a police vehicle parked in there. What is the point of it? I can't get into it when I'm off duty.6. The optimisation is still very bad. The game has very low quality models and terrain, visibility on low settings is like 10 meters.. yet it still runs like crap. As a hobbyist Unity developer, I know that it could be optimized to be much more efficient than it currently is. I think that the devs had just given up on it. 7. The vehicle controls are REALLY bad. I'm absolutely sure that for all the money that this game have made, the developers could have purchased a decent car controller script from the asset store, instead of having all the players struggle with the current one.I don't think that the developers of this game have consulted any police officer. Why would the officer have to go to the mechanic and repair his vehicle on his own cost, while being on duty? The same goes for refueling. It's paid for by the state/country. I guess that it's an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the game from being boring.Absence of other police officers is also un-immersive. I suppose that it could be justified with the station being understaffed, but I can't imagine an officer responding to a kidnapping or an armed robbery alone and singlehandedly arresting everyone.Also - Tazer is not a bow. The character doesn't have to aim at the sky to hit a suspect with it.And the last thing - the price. This game at this state is definitely not worth this price.On the other hand, I liked the car models and their customisation. Music is not bad as well.I'm not impressed with the rest though, sorry.Overally - I'm disappointed.			"

												The PC gaming world is very short on police simulators. This one had good promise but falls far too short. For such a small genre in the gaming world, these games should be made well and unlike anything anyone has ever seen. This game doesnt do that. Pros:Its one of the few ""simulators"" out there.Ability to unlock new cars and stylesCons:Terrible mechanicsTerrible soundClunky drivingSame calls over and over again with no sense of achivementNo sense of police work.If you want a good police game. Download LCPDFR for GTA 4. The bugs and crashes in GTA are worth the trouble for the LCPDFR mod, which far surpasses this game times 1000.			"

												After playing for a pretty long time, I have concluded that this game is lacking in all aspects. For example, when I customize my vehicle, it gets completely damaged from the drop animation (at least I think thats what damages it). Another reason is that the game is completely empty, just a bunch of very dumb AI walking around with cars spawning in front of you while you're trying to drive. I see what the devs are trying to achieve, but it looks like they have given up on their game and have moved on. I feel like I have been robbed of $20 because this game is not even worth that much, I would estimate that this game is about $1 at this stage. Another reason I feel robbed is that they actually think that this game is done and have slowed down on making updates which is what makes me furious. This game is not even half done, its 1/10 done. In conclusion, I rate it a 3/10... I will give it a good review when the devs actually start giving a damn about this game.			"

												To me graphics do not really matter. The game physics is great for a 4 man team! I think now that the game is released and people are supporting it they should get more developers and add controller support, maybe more mission, better physics, more commands, ETC. I don't agree with the people who say ""don't waste your money on this game"" shut the hell up and have some fun. This game is one the best games I spent 20.00 on. Think of it as an investment because one this game is fully developed and done, it will be damn amazing! I support the team 100% I have not had any crashes or anything runs smooth no lag nothing! Im running a stock Alienware X21 with 1080p 24 inch monitor is anyone is curious. Well that is all I would buy the game if you have an Extra 20.00 tell the developers what you think it need and help them work it out its going to be a great investment!			"

												You Know I Don't Really see what Everyone was all Angry about this Game, I watched Several Playthroughs and really enjoyed what i seen, Now this Game isn't For Everyone. Def Not Worth $19.99, But it is on Sale as of Right Now 10/18/2016 For only $4.99. Now Would i Recommend this to Someone who like Simulation Style Games. YES. But only for the Right Price, and Well the Right Price is $4.99. Now The Game has its Buggy Moments, For Example: I can't seem to Detain a DIP (Drunk In Public) without using Force (Tazer/Shooting Subject) Which then I Lose Points Hard Core for it. 500 Points for Tazer, 1.5k Points for Shooting. But I am getting out of The Point of this Review. Overall for an Indy Style Police Simulator i Give it a Solid 5/10. ONLY BUY is Game is on SALE. Most Def not worth Normal Price of $19.99. If you can Wait tho. CHECK OUT POLICE 10:13. Still in REALLY Early Development  Not even in ALPHA but its being called the BEST Police Simulator EVER. So there is my LAME but Truthful Review.

Product received for free
												Honestly its like GTA San Andreas but playing as the cops.However I got the game for free and still don't feel like playing it.The map is pretty small, it becomes clear what the limit of the content is, and the graphics are what you expect from a game which could have been released in 2008, not 2014. It actually looks way better in the screenshots then in the actual game. Do not buy this game for sure, you are wasting your money.			"

												I dont often review games but this needed to be said. The devs on this game are thieves for releasing this game from early access. It is clearly not done and yet they had the audacity to pretend to support it and make it seem like they will be finishing the game if  only we stuck with them. i would highly recommend staying away even for free			"

												: Hi, first of all I really like the you released, and I have a few ideas and bugs i've found in the game. Here are the bugs- 1. Includes floating cars, primarily in the downtown area, even after the updates, cars still float. 2. Some cars do not pull over by siren, when i'm trying to pull certain vehicles over, they fail to pull over, when i go in front of them they just drive into my car. 3. I found that my left indicator keeps coming on while driving. 4. When I press the number ""4"" in-game my character is frozen and it can't move. Very big issue. Now enough with the bugs, here are a few suggestions- 1. More police vehicles, assuming the map takes place in America, I, living in the United States assume you don't know much about our vehicles. My city has these cars (Fayetteville Police Department) -2007 Ford F-150 -2012 Dodge Charger SRT8 -2007 Chevrolet Tahoe -2012 Dodge Caravan -2005 Chevrolet Impala -unmarked 2012 Dodge Charger -Unmarked 2010 Chevrolet Impala Of course, since you don't have licensing you can't get the exact models, but its just a idea on what our police cars look like. 2. Police backup I think that calling backup that come in there cars, armed to help you out would be great. I think that would have to be my biggest concern with the game is the lack of other police. 3. Less loading screens It would be nice if when you called a ambulance, a ambulance was actually responding and you can see the ambulance doing its duties, same with calling a police van to pick up someone you arrested, as well as when you call a tow truck, just to add to the realism, i saw you did alot on off-duty, but don't forget about on-duty! 4. Mod compatibility, I think it would be nice for members to be able to create mods that maybe you developers never really thought of. 5. Less rain- I'm not sure if it rains alot in Brazil, but here in North America, it doesn't rain every single day. 6. More call outs- Here are just a few ideas that I think are very important to implant- -Car Accidents (VERY IMPORTANT) -Drunk Driver -Officer Assistance -Domestic Disturbance (2 people fighting, even when you get on scene) Those are pretty much the most important call outs I think the game needs. 7. Faster cars I found the cars go only about 17 mph through the city while the speed limit is 30, I never actually caught someone speeding. I think people speeding should be very visible. 8. Speed Radar I think it would be nice to see the exact speed of vehicles passing by 9. License check It would be nice to check people's license by going back to the police vehicle and checking there name on the police computer. There, we can see if the driver has a warrant/expired license/revoked license. It would also be nice if some drivers didn't have a license as well. 10. Police baton Not very important, though just a small feature. Overall, its a great game.			"

												You Know I Don't Really see what Everyone was all Angry about this Game, I watched Several Playthroughs and really enjoyed what i seen, Now this Game isn't For Everyone. Def Not Worth $19.99, But it is on Sale as of Right Now 10/18/2016 For only $4.99. Now Would i Recommend this to Someone who like Simulation Style Games. YES. But only for the Right Price, and Well the Right Price is $4.99. Now The Game has its Buggy Moments, For Example: I can't seem to Detain a DIP (Drunk In Public) without using Force (Tazer/Shooting Subject) Which then I Lose Points Hard Core for it. 500 Points for Tazer, 1.5k Points for Shooting. But I am getting out of The Point of this Review. Overall for an Indy Style Police Simulator i Give it a Solid 5/10. ONLY BUY is Game is on SALE. Most Def not worth Normal Price of $19.99. If you can Wait tho. CHECK OUT POLICE 10:13. Still in REALLY Early Development  Not even in ALPHA but its being called the BEST Police Simulator EVER. So there is my LAME but Truthful Review. I like these Style of Games so i will continue to Play until i have reached maxed lvl and Retire. Happy Gaming			"

												Honestly, its OK??!..... Just update the god damb game, seriously. You will get more money if you update it because more people will want to play a finished game and this game has a massive potential if it was finished. Plus the drifting is terrible, you drift to stop just to find out that somhow your car slides back to its original position. And dont even get me started on the AI, that also needs to be updated, i speed threw this ""town"" and all the cars only pull halfway of the road so i have to swerve onto the other side of the road, witch by the way is impossible. It is slightly realistic, but once youve played it for an hour or 2 you give cus its so boring. UPDATE THE GAME AND YOU WONT BE GETTING AS MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I kinda recommend this game.			"

												Alright. Never written a review before so. What the hell! Ahem...I'm going to give this a 3/5 in this case. Mainly because its in its baby stages, and theres more to add in this case. So far, the gameplay is alright, Simple so far. Start out as a beat cop (Sort of) Walking around, Ticketing vehicles, setting speed traps, pulling over drunk drivers. There is a minor story in both the male and female characters, but that quickly liquidates as..Well. Its a sandbox..Free-roam. So I can't mark down points on that.The location is....Clunky. In my personal opinion (And others may feel free to disagree) It feels as if you could either move it to a more populated area. (Or create a second map. That would give players a much wider sense of adventure and exploration) Or just expand the area more with more to explore. Eitherway, Once you've seen all the areas, thats it, exploration over.Combat? Well. Rarely there. Or I havn't really progressed far yet. (First Sergeant so far) Fists are rarely used (You could throw a baton in there for variation.) Firearms are suddenly thrown in. Maybe remove the SMG? I find its rarely used around now. Probably for later ranks. Tazers are not the only non-lethals out there, Pepper spray maybe? Good for short-ranged. Less range than the tazer. More range that your fists (Or baton if its implimented). Two hits and your dead, unstandable. Frustrating when you forget the tazer has only one shot and you have to reload. Maybe throw in body armor later on? Seeing as you will more and likely going up against drug dealers, cartels, gangs. It'd be logical to later on recieve body armor for a small cost. Hey. If it gets worse, throw in S.W.A.T armor/uniform! Baby stages!Missions. So far. So good! It started slow with simple hunt down drink drivers, or wander drunks, or setting up speed traps. And as I ranked up I started getting more into the dirty side of crime by hunting down the occassional drug dealer. Like I said, in baby stages so far, but more can be added. So looking forward to more here. Some missions I find quite entertaining. 'Go to X and find Z' One I just find inasne......'Illegally parked Vehicles' Okay. So 25 Minutes to find 7 wrongfully parked vehicles. I don't think Mountain Valley has a drug problem, I think it more has a parking problem. And they're so well hidden that I can't find them! I have to traverse map to map sections just to meet my quota! Oh. And some times are too generous. 25 Real time minutes is pretty much 2 shifts. But when your first shift ends, that progress is lost. Be alittle more less lenient on times..... And...Less illegally parked cars...More drugs and gang violance.Progression. So far, I'm liking the rank tree and the standard 'Gain certain amount of EXP/Score' to rank up. Maybe unlock more uniforms/Vehicles/Housing and such as you level up. Hell. If you get to Sergeant, throw in an NPC Companion maybe! It pays to be ranked! And this job is too dangerous to go alone!Driving. Okay. So far. This will be the main negative part for this. I took a car out, and I swear I was falling into a 'Back to the Future' Moment. Gently press the accelerate button...And...Atleast a second later. 99MPH..... I had to immediantly slam on the breaks to slow down. Heck. At one point I was going in reverse so fast I had to slam the handbreak on as accelerating did nothing! This requires quite abit of tweaking! And the car repair costs are manic, not just because its expensive, its more that its difficult to NOT hit anything. Cruise helps. But. Eh.A.I. Uh. Its not great, but its not so bad either. Maybe some more character models for look. They're not so bad walking, they just horrific when driving. Stop one car, the one behind slams into it and slowly (And painfully) Tries to continue moving. Usually people stop as soon as they hit a car, (Or see a policeman giving a ticket to the person in front.) A bit of an intelligence tweak may be required on the drivers.Customisation? Meh. Five off duty uniforms. Two on duty uniforms. Not great. Maybe add shopping here? Or a new flashy uniform when you rank up? Only one house. Little customisation. An expensive fridge does little to no better than your cheap stock one. Overall Verdict? So far. So good. Alot of tweaks to be made. It does in its own way feel unique. Realistic. And none of that 'Good cop, Bad Cop' rubbish. (Though kicking in doors is quite a good one without caring for minor loss points.)Improvements?- A much stronger progression system. Maybe additional uniforms per promotion. Access to more equipment.- The cars. The speed is an issue. If I go any faster, I might break the time barrier and see the game in the future.- A.I. Yeah. Intelligence Tweak when driving.- Either friendly Police A.I to assist you (Seriously, Can't be the only policeman in this valley right?) Or impliment a co-op feature (Though give that time, Co-Op and multiplayer is when the game is a good few builds away from completion)Overall. Keep it up. And keep going! "

												!!!!UPDATE 5/4/2015!!!!!!WHERES THE BACKUP, ONE COP FOR LIKE 5 CITIES, GIVE US SOME OTHER COPS AT LEAST A PARTNER. IF YOU WANT A GOOD POLICE SIM, BUY GTA IV AND DOWNLOAD LCPDFR MOD YOULL ACTUALLY SAVE SOME MONEY.Pros:Solid game premiseNice EnvironmentDecent audioDecent GraphicsGreat potentialCons:This game needs only three things reallyGraphical enhancements (textures,physics engine, for both peds,vehicles and world)More detail (Interiors, diversity in vehicles/peds, calls, activities,)Everything listed above including are all cosmetic and can be brushed up over time.The main issue with the game issimply the lack of well a police department. The ability to have a partner call for backup, ems, fire etc, and actually see it in action is the main feature missing in this game. Even in the most rural of areas there are at least a handful of officers. Even if backup would take a while it would arrive. Other than that I see great potential with this game. Overall as of now ""IF"" you would like to play a game where you are a police officer that makes a good attempt to do more than just high speed chases and shootouts, and adds the day to day aspects of the job than purchase this game ""WHEN"" it is on sale. As of ""NOW"" $20 is not worth what the game currently has to offer.If in the ""FUTURE"" this game had a: dynamic, immersive environment, similar to that of GTA, the addition of a functioning police department under a broader Emergency System that encompases patrol, detectives, and swat, as well as other units,  a ranking system that allotted you actual command appropriate to the rank i.e. commanding multiple units, support, operations, etc. As well as expansion on the ability to buy/customize your house, buy different cars and have a sort of off the job ""sims"" like experience. Now that game I would pay $60 for.			"

												Amazing Concept, Sadly the game isn't quite there yet. It's been said by other reviews, but it really does feel like it's in early access and not quite finished. Apart from the floating cars, etc. mentioned by others, these are the things i found frustrating:- Fuel consumption. Appears to be the same regardless of engine revs... when i first started, i got into my patrol car, and played around with the keys etc for 5 mins. In that 5 mins, my fuel went down to 70%! Just idling in the driveway! Did they install a lawnmower tank in the car?- Refuelling - Apart from the lack of driveway access to the gas station which knocks 7-8% points off your damage just getting next to the fuel pump, Why do I have to pay for the gas? Maybe it's different in other parts of the world but where I come from, the police department pays for the fuel, Not the officer!- Bad Drivers! So, I'm giving a ticket to the truck parked illegally and some bozo drives into my patrol car (which had its lights going parked up on the side of the road). So I pull the driver out, Pat him down and breathalise him and he comes back clean. So I arrest him and take him to the station and apparently i've arrested an innocent man! I guess its not against the law in mountain valley to not look where you're driving. I imagine the same thing would have happened had I arrested the 2 people in cars outside the police station who were sat stationary on the footpath driving into the concrete planter boxes... Innocent too I imagine..Its an awesome concept. and has the posibility of being one of the greats.. but it needs work. I would not recommend it right now.. its a disappointment. If the developers actively listen to the reviews and make some changes that make the game a little more realistic (it is after all touted as a SIMULATOR not an arcade game) then I'd be happy to re-review.. but if like me, you ignore the reviews and buy it anyway, be prepared for a let down.

 Enforcer: Police Crime Action Small Review	Written by: CheezyTheNerdIn this short review I will be going over a few this about this game, an In the future will write a review a full longer review for this game. Keep In-mind this review has been written on my beliefs In which I have seen an experienced, we all experience things In different ways. I am writting this review to show people my experience on this game.  Review    Gameplay The overall gameplay for Enforcer: Police Crime Action, Is basically grand theft auto with less features In a nut shell . The gameplay Is kinda hard to play, with It's slow moving ability an the slight less appealable grahpics. (Which I will speak about In the graphics section). This game has a lot of policing features more then most Police Role-play games , but overall some of the features are quite buggy an not to real-life standards. This game had so much potentianl In certain areas but now just lacks the motivation of the development team to place the certain items In to that game. I rate the gameplay for Enforcer: Police Crime Action a 3/10.    Graphics Enforcer: Police Crime Actions graphic portion of the game lacks In some what of a way. It feels like the game was just based of a pre-made system such as unity. In most games being released there Is a Increased In graphical enchancement. I was terribly upset with the graphic portion of this game, In lacked certain graphics but I can't expect much In a game that wasn't properly prepared. I would rate the graphics for Enforcer: Police Crime Action 2/10.    Developers I haven't spent to much time In looking Into the development team, but I can say this the team Is small and not that much time seems to be put Into this project. I state this because most games they have the deverlopers always reaching out the public of gamers looking to hear what they want In a game. I have followed the forums for a bit to see if any of that Is happening an I haven't seen much of It. I feel that If that this team was larger and had more love an motivation towards this game an It's future I could see a better future for this game an it's community. I would rate the Developers portion 5/10 I believe this game should have went In alpha before becoming a full released game, It was all rushed an didn't recieve the proper attention It needed from the developers of the game. Enforcer: Police Crime Action Rating - 4.5/10	I did enjoy playing this game an have made several videos of It, In which I will have attached below.(several videos I have made)

												Pros;- Graphics are not bad- Large map- Seems like a lot of hours playing time is envolved- Interesting customization options for cars and homes- Massive potential to become a great game if develops spend time on updating itCons;- Driving feels stiff and can be very tough especially at high speed- Missions feel repetive and sometimes can be a nusance- Lack of a sturdy story line- Sometimes feel's as if there is no point or goal except from the level system- Days go by very quickly and the character gets tired fast- Struggle to keep my stress levels correctAt the current stage i would give this a 6/10 becasue it is an interesting concept. However i feel like there is alot of improvement that can be added to this game,. Here are my ideas;- Story Line and Missions to complete as well as everyday cruising etc...- Better turning because at slow speeds turning is smooth however it is a struggle to stay on the road at high speeds and i tend to crash... alot!- Time needs to go slower and you need to be able to have like days off and things to do during your days off. I know there is Visiting people but this is just a waste of time. Thanks for Reading!			"

												At first the controls are just awful, the police cruiser handles like a bag of chips and the graphics are at least 10 years out of date.I could forgive the poor graphics if the game wasn't broken, my first real mission was to arrest some bloke who had broken in to a house. Fine I go there and see this man standing frozen outside of the building. When I get closer (He is still frozen) the man pulls up a gun and aims it at me the protector of worlds, obviously he is sent to a dark oblivion. This would be ok if the game didn't punish you for it. How can I be punished for shooting a suspects that aims a ♥♥♥♥ing gun at me?In all avoid at all costs.			"

												The good: The concept of the game is great. Being a police officer and being able to do whatever a police officer does on a daily basics makes the game great. Not to mention the ranking system which gives the game a more MMO feel, where you need to get enough points to rank up to the next level.The bad: Sadly, there is more bad then good. Pretty much the only major bugs/glitches that the game has is with vehicles. Just driving a car feels really bad, in the sense that simply moving forward and turning left for just a second makes the car almost instantly turn 90 degrees. Also sometimes when driving fast and colliding with sidewalks or passing intersections makes the car fly into the air, and do a couple of flips.Another glitch is tha sometimes when firing at an armed criminal, your bullets dont shoot correctly. And by that I mean dont shoot at all, leaving you free to get shot by the armed criminal.I am still recommending this game because as a police fan, this is perfect for me. Adding on that there is no other stable game that accomplishes this.			"

												Enforcer: Police Crime Action,Is one of those games that don't look like much when you watch the screenshots, but after playing for just a couple of minutes I'm alreay caught in the game.It's fun, cool and somehow gets the job done.This game is not about shooting and gunning down some unknown people. this game wants you to uphold the law by sticking to the law.A very fresh take and it's a lot of fun.Isn't their anything negative?Uhm, yes, as a matter of fact there's.For instance:- The ingame map is not always that clear for some reason (Could do with some better artwork, or at least a zoom level)- Textures are adequate, but sub par for modern games. Although it doesn't hinder the gameplay and fun factor.- Controls are not always clear. There're many different options and as such you're not always sure how things work. A quick peek manual would be nice.-Ingame time. A full days lasts 24 minutes. In my opinion that's way to fast. I like my days a bit more longer lasting. Let's say 60 minutes or so.So far, this is a nice game already and I'll see myself having lots of fun with it in the future. Especially if they're able to fix some of the things mentioned above.			"

												I really want to like this game. I mean really. I've been griping for years that after so many incarnations of GTA, we could at least have one open world cop game. (True Crime doesnt count there's too much of a fantasy element there) But in it's current state, this game is only kind of OK. But at the current price, it's just not worth picking up until some things get ironed out. Such as the driving; it's the worst driving with a mouse and keyboard I've ever experienced. I feel like this could be remedied by figureing out a way to have controller support. While it wouldn't really fix the problem, it could make the problem a lot less evident. Character movement is akward, though not as bad as the driving. I would go out on a limb to say that it's passable, but it still needs work as well. I also feel like the devs are working on trying to work on making the game bigger and more complex before addressing these fundemental issues. Overall I cannot recommend this game for it's current state and price. There is loads of potential here though. So hopefully one day that price will reflect what could be a very cool, unique game.

												With in 5 mins it brought me back to my youth (this is not a good thing)  1987 and the spectrum plus 2! walking and driving the car you have to press the old w,a,s,d buttons! crouch is left ctrl run left shift.The controls are dire, there are a few bugs, cars swerving all over the road yet nothing I can do about it! Its alarming that  its already on sale just a week into its release, I would have felt happier if this game was an early release and there was a good chance of big improvements but I'm guessing there wont be.  This game is an 18 cert game, there is a mod you can get for 18 cert game that gives you all this for free and pulls it off much better.Advice to the developer is improve the physics and give the game 360 controller control at the very least.******this could be a good game with a lot of work******			"

												This game has a LOT of potential. So far, in its early stages, it's proven to be a very fun game. I played it for about 2 hours and got to level 4. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't figure out how exactly I can get my new car. Now, in the start, you have to spend the first 5 minutes just reading through a very long text that explains how everything works. Instead, I'd suggest a categorized way of looking through things. That way it's better to look over things later on as well.The game mechanics are.. they're not the best. It's sluggish, the car handling is pretty crap and civilians driving trucks often cause traffic jams because they can't turn a tight corner. As far as civilian interaction goes and completing missions that involve finding suspects, it's pretty much impossible. I mean my first callout was a vandalism case. I asked the guy who called what the vandals look like and he gave me the descriptions of them. Problem was, the descriptions matched like 3 nearby NPCs. I'd have no way of knowing which one of them is the real criminal. Some diversity in appearances would be nice. Just retexture the clothes, if you must.DUIs are a little confusing. So I check someones breath and they're under the influence. I get them out, place them under arrest and it gets ticked under ""Innocent Civilians Arrested""? DUI is an arrestable crime in pretty much every state in America. Wut.As far as on-duty off-duty time goes, I think there's way too much effort put into the off-duty aspect. The stress level is.. meh. Hanging out with your mother/sister/grandparents/friends doesn't even give you any stress points, which is weird. And what's with the applause as if I've just won an Oscar after hanging out with people?The police vehicle itself is well done, as well as the interactables. Indicators, siren and the strobes themselves. However, it being just red is kind of bland. Red and blue in the future pls. Oh and while I think to mention it, please add a tutorial on how to get a new police vehicle, because I have not got a clue on how to get my new ones. The game is built on a strange engine as well. I mean the graphics aren't really top of the line and I'm lagging horribly unless I run it under low graphics. It doesn't make much sense that I can run Payday 2 better than I can run this.There should also be a little bit of further research be done on the ranks. I mean you don't have Police Officer and then Senior Deputy. Deputy = Sheriff's Office/Department (county). Police Officer = Police Department (city). All in all, like I said, it's a pretty good game with a lot of potential. Needs a lot of polishing. I mean the English itself in the game is sometimes bizarre.			"

It's a mix of Shooter, Simulation, Roleplay, and Strategy. And you have to balance all three to be successful, thats what makes a good game, variety and uniqueness, not graphics. If you think otherwise, then you're not a real gamer. I'd recommend you just get it now if you're on the fence, 14.99 is alot better to spend than 19.99, and the price on the Excaliber site is nearly $25, so you're gonna have to make a choice.

Feels like it hasen't been finished, and could still need bug fixes, updates and more..Though what you can do in the game is the good part, or kinda. This game is an alright police simulator. You rank up, can do normal traffic stops and shoot criminals. Though as this game could have become way better, I would still recomend it. Since it does work, and is rather stable.			"

												Great Idea, poor execution.I've put a great deal of time into Enforcer at this point and the best way I can describe the game is a speed trap simulator. The first few days of a character are engaging and exciting. Hearing the radio chatter, responding to your first few calls, arresting a drunk driver. Unfortunately after that the game seems to fall pretty flat. My biggest complaint so far is once you move past your first few shifts, the emergency calls seem to drop off to zero leaving you to complete the bland main daily mission (ticket X number of cars, Catch X number of speeders or drunks) Effectively turning the game into speed trap simulator 2014. Scanning the forums, this seems to be a major complaint stemming from the Steam release of the game. Many ideas have been proposed, like tinkering with the game data or quitting and reloading your game (this apparently gives you a call or two before it returns you to insane boredom). I don’t know about you but having to shut down every time I need a little excitement seems a little counter intuitive to me.Don’t get me wrong, it is still exciting when a driver bails from their vehicle leaving you to give chase on foot, though you will soon find that all runners will return to a walk no more than 100 paces from where they started leaving you an easy target; and this brings me to another point of NPC pathfinding. Nothing ruins a good chase than your suspect suddenly getting stuck on a wall....or a car...or a street sign....Finally I would like to address Super cop and his Jet Fueled police cruiser. Quite frankly, after having a load screen inform me that I could die in as few as two bullets; having a semi-truck plow into me only to be sent flying into the air as my officer stands stoically in his place seems a bit silly. Getting behind the wheel of your cruiser you’ll find yourself subject to some crazy driving physics too. There is very little engine noise from the vehicle giving you the feeling that you are more floating than driving. Oddly enough driving on the shoulder is more engaging as the noise of tires on gravel begins to create the illusion of automotive transportation.In summary, given the current state of the game gives this the feel of an early access game being sold as a finished product. From the sound of it this is very much still ""in development"" with the dev's still looking for ideas to expand and grow the game which is commendable. Unfortunately this has left quite a bit to be desired in the base game mechanics.If you are a hardcore simulation fan and need something new to eat up a few hours this may be for you, otherwise steer clear until a bit more work is put in, or it lands in your local bargain bin.

												This game is great and adds a lot of realism to this new up and coming genre. However, it needs tons of fixes, those being;-Button mapping-Animation Fixes-Better driving-Could do with better graphics but right now theyre ok-more animation fixes- better weapon controlsLike I said this game is great but ever since the developer abandoned it, it has gone a bit down hill. If the developer would come back to the game and release more updates then I can guarantee that this would be a best seller among this genre. For now anyone wanting to support a good cop game should go support EmergeNYC. It's an open-world game that has been greenlit and is currently in development. I've been following them and so far they've shown wonderful skills and a cool representation of New York City. If you don't want to support them just follow the development and tell your friends about it.			"

												This is a well put together game. I love playing it everyday and all day if i had the time. I like the concept of the game and how you can pretty much do what you want. I would like to see a spot light added to the game. I also wish you can detain the subject your dealing with in your vehicle until your done investigating making the decision if your going to place them under arrest or let them go. Im very big on the lights n i love what they have done so far but i will like to see the LED lights reflect off the buildings and other nearby objects from like a block radius because when i turn on my lights i like for people to now im in the area from miles away just on how bright my lights are reflecting off of other objects. I also would like to see more graphics especially in the city. My biggest dislike is the handling of the vehicle, it never stops in time and turns are too aggressive i just wish it was more realistic on the stops because i also crash into something because it takes forever to stop no matter how fast are slow your traveling. I also want to be able to use the computer in the vehicle to run ID's and driver's license. Although im waiting to see all of these things happen this is the best police simulator game I ever played, this game is going to make history.			"

												This game is pretty cool. Driving is weird but you'll get used to it. It gets boring tbh but if you're like me and you like pulling over cars and every now and then drawing your fire arm this game is for you. It is pretty realistic with reguard to how you handle different things. When you get shot twice you die for sure it is none of this never ending health things. Overall would recommend to someone who is looking for a below level graphics but interesting gameplay in a police simulator.			"

												I've just set up my roadblock and I'm checking cars whether their licence and registration is in order. It's mostly boring work as most people have their papers in order, but I guess it's a part of the job I can't neglect.Suddenly dispatch informs me of a robbery in progress. I promptly respond that I'm on it, get in my squadcar and haul♥♥♥♥♥to the crimescene; sirens, lights, the whole schebang.As I get there, the robberer seem to have fled the area. I ask a few witnesses and luckily I could get some valid information from them on the robberers appearance, what clothes he wore and his approximate age.One man, walking away from me, fits the description to the letter. I order him to stop and as I do, he turns around with the speed of light with a 9mm in his hands. He fires off a shot and misses me by a quarter inch. Pedestrians, people on their way home from work, scream in fear and suprise from the sudden and loud noise. At this point I'm glad I hadn't developed the nasty habit of doughnut-eating like many of my collegues. I pull out my own pistol and return fire. Three times I pull the trigger in rapid succession. All shots land in his upper chest and the robberer collapse to the ground, face down, in the middle of the streets. He's not moving. Between trucks and sedans I close in carefully. People around me stare at the macabre scene in shock and disbelief.I pick up his gun and the goods he stole and call an ambulance. Just another day on the streets as a Lieutenant in the Mountain Village Police Department.Somewhat messy gameplay, tricky as hell to drive, some bugs, but money well spent and very different from a lot of other games I've played. Addicting and fun.Will patrol again. 7/10			"

												I've been waiting for a game like this for so long! Finally some people have deicded to make one. It's not the best game you'll play, it's not the most beautiful looking one either. But it does the job. Specially for a price of $20 this game is worth it. They're constantly making changes to the game and adding new things which have already improved the gameplay a whole lot. In all honesty... if you want to play a good police simulator then I'd say get this game. You can set up radar controls, perform traffic stops, breathalyze drivers and the other missions offer a decent variety of things to do. They also added vehicle costumization which let's you put different light bars on your cars and a different color scheme. As for bugs, I havent encountered that many and none of them are serious... except for that your character somewhat appears to be Iron Man... if a car or even a truck hit him, the character takes 0 damage... no problem! All in all I like this game a lot, and I'm excited for what the developers will do with this in the future.			"

												Where to start, well like some games and large aspects in history Enforcer is the wrong excecution of the right idea. I love the idea of a Police Simulation because unfortunately at 16 I can't go out and ""Simulate"" police work. The idea of the free-roam police game with no set objective intrigues me along with the side missions that come with it. The game is just a bit buggy (a bit? HA!) The game reminds of the kind of game you'd get in a cereal box along with Monopoly and Rescue Heroes because the graphics are just about the same. I find myself stealing police cars in grand theft auto and doing the same thing that I do on Enforcer but unfortunately I can't right tickets or use a tazer. I love the basic elements of Enforcer : Police Crime Action. I think the game is a good buy if you want a repetitive and menial game that has no specific goal but honestly with my lack of knowledge of police forces it is pretty acurate (Except the game doesn't make you do paperwork!!!)    I thought the personal aspect of the game was... different. I think once again it is the wrong excecution of the right idea. If they merged it with the personal life of say ""Sims"" for example and the graphics of Arma 3 or GTA 5 I think you'd have one hell of a game. But unfortunately the game just isn't there yet. I'd say buy it if you have 15$ hanging around but for the price it really isn't worth it unless you're up for it. I'd still recommend the game and I intend to continue playing but there is A LOT of work to be done. 7/10			"

												This is a well put together game. I love playing it everyday and all day if i had the time. I like the concept of the game and how you can pretty much do what you want. I would like to see a spot light added to the game. I also wish you can detain the subject your dealing with in your vehicle until your done investigating making the decision if your going to place them under arrest or let them go. Im very big on the lights n i love what they have done so far but i will like to see the LED lights reflect off the buildings and other nearby objects from like a block radius because when i turn on my lights i like for people to now im in the area from miles away just on how bright my lights are reflecting off of other objects. I also would like to see more graphics especially in the city. My biggest dislike is the handling of the vehicle, it never stops in time and turns are too aggressive i just wish it was more realistic on the stops because i also crash into something because it takes forever to stop no matter how fast are slow your traveling. I also want to be able to use the computer in the vehicle to run ID's and driver's license. Although im waiting to see all of these things happen this is the best police simulator game I ever played, this game is going to make history.			"

												I bought the game a while back and never put thought into posting this but here i go.In a way the game feels a wee bit empty, there's no punishment for not resting or eating or anything like that, i went two days in the game without resting or having my character eat, I feel as if there should be some reason to eat and rest other than to feel like your in-game money and time.One thing that's really problematic for me, The car acceleration is goes up way to fast and the steering can be really stiff, while it isn't a huge problem it just bothers me when i have to pull over npcs and i struggle to stop the vehicle.I am looking at this game in a none-negative way since it's still incomplete, And i know programming and such is really time consuming.Would i reccomend buying it now? No, but i would reccomend it once it has plenty of content.			"

The game lags a bit in the downtown area even on the lowest graphics settings which makes fighting crime there difficult, and 2. I wish the game was a little bigger, as in more things to do after you reach Chief of Police. Like buying another house, or different cars. Also, there are only 2 types of Police vehicles you can get and the other 2 are permenantly locked. Other than those few things, the game is awesome.			"

												Seems almost like an Early Access game, but its a ""finished"" product. Creators have promised an update months ago but never deliver. Driving in this game sucks. I feel like im playing a 10 year old product when I tried to play this garbage.			"

												(Important note for Fsecure users: Disable deepguard while you play this game)For anyone with an interest in police work, this is a fairly good game. The calls are varied and the situations feel organic with the suspects reacting in a believable manner. For example, drunks and thieves are unlikely to pull a gun on you (but much more likely to flee) while hardcore criminals with drug raps and worse tend to violently object to your stopping their crime sprees. Also, the locations of the criminals are not automatic and sometimes you just have to go around looking for them either from witness descriptions or behaviour described in the initial call (example: rowdy drunk). The game does give you hints after a time in the form of radio updates about the rough location of the suspect(s), if you are worried about never finding the perps. The police procedures are sometimes a bit off (you generally want to cuff the perps before searching them, devs...) but overall the basics are there. Note that this game is meant for people who WANT to follow police procedure. If you want to mess around, the game basically ignores it and it will feel weird. But then again, if you just want to mess around in an open world, why are you here? GTA series are that way --->The game has problems too. The driving model is wonky and there are some glitches and bugs around, some amusing (like trucks launching in to orbit) and some not (a car parked 10m in the air....).Its not the prettiest game in any way, shape or form either. In the end of the day, this is a game for cop fans and no-one else. Being one, i recommend it. If you have no interest in patrol police work then this game is really not for you.			"

												Police Quest meets SWAT meets GTA III.This is the ""right side of the law"" simulator, I always wanted many other games to be.The interaction and immersion is great. There is sooo much you can do, while capturing the day-to-day grind.  While this could become boring, it does a pretty good job capturing the realistic career-risk of any ""routine"", where even a routine traffic stop can turn suddenly violent and the player faces sudden and possible death.It is not perfect.  There areas I wish would be improved upon.  My primary issue is, there is no, ""backup"" support.  You do not have a partner, and you can't call for backup.  I feel this, could be rectified in an expansion, which, maybe we will see some day.  This shortcoming, I was able to justify with the rationale, that, the town is pretty small, it ""might"" be possible, that you are the sole law enforcer on payroll (and of course dispatch).Enjoyable game, does a great job of immersing the player in the atmosphere.  Visuals are well done in many areas.  The open-world, random citizen/criminal generation keeps the replayability going (and humorous at times... my first day on patrol, my first three suspects were woman truck drivers... immagine my shock when this cute girl in a sexy dress jumped out of her truck and pulled a gun on me...).The realistic mode really draws you in to the life & death risks of the job... you learn to rapidly eject from your car in a chase, taking up cover behind your car, very quick.  My player has died in the line of duty four times (meaning permadeath-restart from scratch), before my latest actually has survived up to LT (and still going).There is a more arcade mode... haven't played it, where death is not possible, but injury is.  This brings me to the 2nd issue I have with the game, I believe their should be a second mode, where both injury or death is possible (not always one or the other).Great game.  Hope to see more from the developer.Definitely recommend this game.10-4!			"

												First of all this game has a lot of potential but at the moment it's average. The handling and driving in this game needs some serious attention. It's feels very.. clunky, for example when you press A or D its like the wheel gets full lock straight away. Also I think there needs to be another camera angle while on foot, the current one is confusing... I dont know whether I'm playing in first person or third, I think this is casuing the shooting to feel awkward as well. When interacting with people/objects it feels klutzy it needs to be smoother... more free flowing. I think if all these issue's where addressed and along with some smaller tweaks the game will be a hit!!			"

												This is a well put together game. I love playing it everyday and all day if i had the time. I like the concept of the game and how you can pretty much do what you want. I would like to see a spot light added to the game. I also wish you can detain the subject your dealing with in your vehicle until your done investigating making the decision if your going to place them under arrest or let them go. Im very big on the lights n i love what they have done so far but i will like to see the LED lights reflect off the buildings and other nearby objects from like a block radius because when i turn on my lights i like for people to now im in the area from miles away just on how bright my lights are reflecting off of other objects. I also would like to see more graphics especially in the city. My biggest dislike is the handling of the vehicle, it never stops in time and turns are too aggressive i just wish it was more realistic on the stops because i also crash into something because it takes forever to stop no matter how fast are slow your traveling. I also want to be able to use the computer in the vehicle to run ID's and driver's license. Although im waiting to see all of these things happen this is the best police simulator game I ever played, this game is going to make history.			"

												I've been waiting for a game like this for so long! Finally some people have deicded to make one. It's not the best game you'll play, it's not the most beautiful looking one either. But it does the job. Specially for a price of $20 this game is worth it. They're constantly making changes to the game and adding new things which have already improved the gameplay a whole lot. In all honesty... if you want to play a good police simulator then I'd say get this game. You can set up radar controls, perform traffic stops, breathalyze drivers and the other missions offer a decent variety of things to do. They also added vehicle costumization which let's you put different light bars on your cars and a different color scheme. As for bugs, I havent encountered that many and none of them are serious... except for that your character somewhat appears to be Iron Man... if a car or even a truck hit him, the character takes 0 damage... no problem! All in all I like this game a lot, and I'm excited for what the developers will do with this in the future.			"

												If your looking for a good police simulator then look no further. This game(as it is still in development) provides almost all the policing experiences a cop could experience in his every day life. However there can definitely be some improvements to the game as far as exanding the map to be more of an open world sandbox and have additional CPU police to patrol around as well and maybe even multiplayer. This game has a huge amount of potential to be the best police simulator out there but it still needs quite a bit of work to get there with minor bugs and a little bit more of a relistic feel. What I mean by realistic feel is when you play the game everyone and everything gameplay mechanics wise seems to be robotic almost, the civilians almost seem like they have no life to them at all, they look like robots walking around and the driving is a little unrealistic in the sense that if a car runs into you, it doesn't harm you but it harms itself by somehow flipping over and going out of control. Like I said though, this game is a great simulator because of the wide variety of missions and calls that a normal cop would answer to in real life. The basic concept of the game is fantastic, its working out great as far as how policing is done so far. If your like early development games and policing then I highly recommend this game, however if you like a full complete game and not something in development then I suggest waiting a little longer before purchasing the game however the price of the game may increase like almost all games that are in development always do. My suggestions to you devs as far as making the game that much better is 1-Multiplayer. Co-op multiplayer and maybe even VS Drug Lords VS Cops/Swat2-Implement more AI- patrolling around and busting bad guys and all is really fun but the lack of other police patrolling around and no backup seems a little unrealistic and a little dull, having a team to work with or maybe even command when your a high ranking officer can definitely spice up the gameplay and make it a lot more interesting.3- Implement S.W.A.T- Everyone loves swat...No question about it. Swat is a huge help during tight situations and if there was even an option to play as swat and just go on raid missions, breaching and clearing, taking out High Value Targets and etc. that would probably spike this games badassery up by a ton. Everyone loves that feeling of being a badass S.W.A.T with a team about to breach and clear or just go into an area to raise absolute hell. Implementing S.W.A.T AI backup in the game and even a S.W.A.T mode would just be awesome4- Connect the maps together to make one big sandbox- Instead of seperate maps, connect them! I think most people would prefer a sandbox rather than different sections, especially if the different sections of the maps can be really small in comparison to the main city.5- Implement more traffic violations- I've noticed that every time I pull over a car for blowing a red light or even crashing into another car yields no bad outcome whenever they are pulled over and traffic stopped. I always mistake pulling people over for blowing through red lights and think I'm going to ticket them but the game doesn't pay attention to them blowing red lights, implementing that would be pretty cool too.For all of those people reading this review all the way through good job! lol and thanks for reading. As for the Devs, nobodys expecting all these suggestions to happen in like one week, we can wait however don't blow the suggestions off otherwise the game will get dull very quickly because there is a lot more that you guys can add to increase the feel of being on the Police Force. Don't quit! This game has potential over all other police simulators to be the best because so far you can do a lot more in this game as far as policing than any other game made so far. You guys are doing a splendid job and I wish you the best of luck developing this game, I can't wait for the final product because if you guys can make it this good this early in development, you guys can definitely make it amazing with time.

												The concept of this games is great. That said, sadly this game is not up to modern standards.I would rate it 2 of 5.The game play is not really changing, so it wears out already after a couple of hours.As for the quality of gaming it's quite bad, and it feels like a game you might have picked up 10 years ago.I you really need a cop game, go for it. If you want a good new game, don't go for.			"

												In theory this game seems sound. Poorly executed unfortunately, is the final outcome. What I have experienced is a game that should be on early access, with a disclaimer. Bluntly put, this game is unfinished. Floating vehicles, trees placed in middle of dirt road, gps minimap that doesnt even scale properly with ingame, ie; player dot is offroad but still clearly on the road. Main core mechanics of on duty and off duty are just absurd, aswell as hunger system, ie; hunger bar is empty, you stop, loose all movement, control and grab your stomach. This process takes almost 3 seconds. Getting shot at? In a foot pursuit? Guess what? On top of all that, Textures are horrible. Worst game I've played in a long time, definitly a DO NOT BUY!!!  "

												The reason I'm saying no because as of my review date (10-25-14) the game still has many bugs. The drving mechanics are very wonky. The game mechanics just are kind of angering, the sleep, stress, hunger, gas, and car health meters go down way too fast. And because the most per shift I've even gotten so far is $300 and taking into consideration $50 for gas and $300 for repairs, you begin to lose money or make very little profit. And the game in general lags horribley.On the positive side, I do see a chance for this game if they work the driving mechanics out and I'll look into about changing the depletion speeds. Also I would like to see a longer allowed time to be off duty, and if your cop car either had to stay at your house when not being used or at the police station when not being used. Instead of this thing where you park at the police station, go off duty, take a cab home, go to bed, wake up, go on duty, and boom your car is magically in your driveway. Just make it go one way or the other.Anyways I'm sure I'm missing out more major bugs, but anywyas I would not recommend buying this game until they fix quite a few things. And like I said, it has a chance, hopefully.			"

												15 minutes into my first shift and I get shot because I was too hungry to move.10/10Serious Review - This game is not too shabby. If you're looking for a Police simulation game then this is as close as you will get. It is no way perfect. I torrented the game first, sort of as a demo, and it has improved A LOT since. It is a lot more optimized and the graphics have been improved significantly. If you enjoy Mount N Blade and graphics don't bother you as long as the gameplay is fun then you will have no problem with this game. I will say that it REALLY needs multiplayer. It get's really lonely being the only person in the game with an IQ level above 10.			"

												I gotta admit, this game has it's pro's. I like a bit of realism, and being able to pull over, check, breathalyze, arrest and transport is lot's of fun. The constantly running perps who take you miles from your vehicle, the tedium of keeping your stress level down, and the annoyance of having to play hours before you can drive around off duty are pretty big detractors. Having said that it appears the developers are working very hard to get this right (eventually) and that speaks volumes for the games appeal. Is it LCPD:FR? Nope, but it is trying, and with the addition of backup units, even a cutscene style state police call where they come and ""help"" by arresting the fleeing vehicle, (I'm tired of spending tons of money fixing a cop car that has to be used as a battering ram every time I get in a chase) would make this game absolutley worth it. For now 6/10 with the potential for 9/10. Go ahead and buy it, play it a little and wait for those awesome updates I'm expecting soon.			"

												This game is the crack baby offspring of Goat Simulator and GTA 3, who then dressed up their birth defective child as a cop and are telling people he is the real thing.Seriously: Please do not buy this. I could do an hour long non-stop video of problem after problem (graphical issues, hit box detection problems, faulty mission monitoring, awful gun play and driving mechanics, and don't even get me started on the physics...the list goes on and on).I still have no idea why there are so many positive reviews because the game is being sold as a serious simulator.I'm keeping this review short: No. But you have to love this stuff:

												YES! YES! YES!This game is great and if you ask me, underrated. So far, there's enough to do in a day to keep you mostly satisfied. I would like to see more in future updates. I will leave a list of my own suggestions towards the end of my little review here. The graphics aren't impressive, but they're at least tolerable. The vehicle handling has something left to be desired, mostly the handling. Cars pick up speed well enough but turning without hitting anything is tough lol at least for me it was. If you crash into a pole it will knock over, that's a plus. I really dislike a stiff enviroment that doesn't react somewhat realistically to that kind of damage. Car models are decent and acceptable. Customizing your apartment is a nice perk, although somewhat limited. REALLY enjoy the traffic cameras. Theyre fun to play with when you just want to sit and watch the pedestrians try and get one over ya behind the wheel >:DWould like to see in future updates:Longer shifts (I am aware that players can edit files to lengthen day and night times, since I and others are not this comp savvy...I would like the devs to give players an option to set their shift lengths in game.)More cars! :D Cant go wrong with that can you?SWAT teams after certain ranks, which can also brings me to this : add more NPCs that rob banks and shops. Multiplayer modes like Cops VS Robbers, Co-op shifts, and just open servers for random lawlessness.MORE CUSTOMIZATION FOR YOUR CHARACTER AND THEIR HOME! :DArmor upgradesVehicle customization on a deeper level (speed, acceleration, breaking, armor rating, ect)Weapon customization (purchasable unlocks, attatchments, police equipment, ect)When you reach police cheif, there should be an option to ""run the city"" where you are able to command other officers and oversee them. Perhaps some officers are corrupt and you need to do some surveillance? Or you need to manage a dispute between to officers who are partners? or you need to hire or fire more officers? upkeep on funding for vehicle management and police needs (equipment, weapons,  ect)A ranking system that goes a tad bit beyond medals you only see dangling after a days work. Perhaps some wearable rank insignia? Or more priviledges/jobs to do that officers of that rank do irl? profile badges that signify rank?A ""superior NPC"" who monitors your performance, chimes in with advice via the radio or in person after a days work, pushes you to do better or to do certain things to make quota.Just my own input.Two thumbs up so far, though! If you want a good simulator that's fun and gives you that epic ""respect mah authoritah"" feeling, here it is :D			"

												====================================================================================Summary====================================================================================Enforcer: Police Crime Action is a Police Simulator where you live your life as a male or a female fufilling cop duties and normal civillian ones such as visiting relatives. The games main gameplay is going on duty which is where you get your main objective which can be something like 'Use Speed Cameras to ticket 4 cars.', though you don't have to complete this, you can go around and interogate random civillians and frisk them and if they have anything illegal then you can arrest them. Missions can range from kidnapping to armed robbery. You take 2 shots and then you're dead, on realistic you will lose your character though on Normal you will have to pay a hospital bill. You can decide to go the police brutality route if you wish, though no matter how many times you shout 'Stop Resisting' you won't go unpunished. The game is very unpolished at the moment but it's the only game of it's kind and so It's a nice change of pace and a very fun experience.====================================================================================Gameplay====================================================================================You can either go on Duty or Off Duty, being Off Duty allows you to parcitipate in things like visiting relatives and driving around in your personal car (which you must buy first) and decorate your own home with your hard earned cash. While on Duty you will be given a Main Mission though you don't have to do it, there are a variety of different things you may have to do but the more intense missions come later in your shift when you may have to deal with an armed robbery, burglary or even a kidnapping. You will be interogating people around to see if they have any info leading you to the guy/girl (Though in the game everyone is an 'It') you're after. Be warned however as people can pull guns on you so it's best to be prepared in ALL situations, 2 shots and you're dead though you are given a bit of leeway as they take a while to shoot each shot. Of course if a civillian happens to be walking down the street you are allowed to pull out your taser and begin zapping them while they clearly resist arrest though of course you will be discredited and if this occurs too many times and your score goes too low then you will be fired.====================================================================================Conclusion====================================================================================I give the game a 7/10 for being fun, interesting and unique as hell as Police Simulators aren't really a thing but this game makes it a reality. The game should be in early access due to optimisation issues, bugs, flaws in systems and just a lot of problems though the devs are updating the game and a new update promises a partner which should be interesting, I'm giving this a positive review as this game is heading in the right direction due to fixing the game up after the awful launch. Maybe wait a while till you purchase the game when you see fit that the game has been patched and made better. As long as the devs don't stop and they persevere this could be a great game! Though if you are contemplating picking it up now I would get it on sale such as of the time of this review the Humble Bundle for £3.			"

												Can be a buggy mess at times, but it has the potential to be a great game.  There aren't a lot of police sims out on the market so I'm thankful that the developers at least tried to make something of that nature.  With a few good patches and some extra content, it could be an outstanding game.  For right now however, I'd simply lean toward giving it a passing grade.

												While not perfect this game is fantastic. I say this because rarely does a game make me lose all track of time. I grew up with the Police Quest series and until recently, I've played the Police Force series from Excalibur Publishing  (makers of Simulator games). About a year ago, the maker of Police Quest, Jim Walls, was trying to revive the Police Quest series and bring it into the 21st Century but sadly it left Kickstarter and ceased. If you've played Police Force, there are some things alike. You can walk around, accept emergencies, and use the number keys for ""actions,"" Enforcer definately uses Police Force as a foundation but expands on it greatly and whoever put it all together definately should get a raise! I have to say that the devloper and his team really did a great job. You are able to have a home and when your shift is over, you can spend time there eating, watching TV, showering, sleeping, and/or taking a nap. Any of these things can help your stress, hunger, and alertness. All of these can have an affect on your aiming in sticky situations as well as your life ( you can die if you don't eat). You can explore any of the 7 regions but your patrol area is within Mountain View. You can buy furnishings for your home and at a higher rank, you can upgrade your patrol car as well as buy a car while off duty. Your home is kind of bland. I wish that my house looked a little nicer than the shack it resembles. I do find it odd that when I'm off duty, my patrol car seems to be parked at my house. I though I would have to drive (walk, or take a cab) to the Police Station, and get to my patrol car. When I go to the Police Station it's void of any NPCs. Your main reason inside the Police Station is too check email, ask for a warrant, or go off duty. When you have suspects in custody, all you do is click the police station door (without going in) and a window pops up asking if you want to put the suspects in jail. Clicking the window, tells you how you did (giving expierence). You also get expierence putting tickets on illegally parked cars and towing them away when a driver fails a breathalyzer test.While on duty, dispatch will squawk emergencies and you have the option of excepting. If you do, dispatch alerts other officers that ""26"" (your call) is in route. It would of been nice like in Police Quest, to be able to click a button to alert dispatch og your whereabouts (ex. ""dispatch, 26, is heading south on main or dispatch, 26, is on scene or requesting backup. I found that when a suspect raises their gun, you don't have much time to react which in real life is true but there should be something that allows you to walk up to the suspect and if he/she pulls out a gun, how can you survive.  I have to say that the game makes you learn. If a murder suspect or drug dealer is your emergency, you bring your car close enough, and if things get hairy; jump in your car for a better strategic location. I did find that outside, the perp runs and you can command them to stop. The one in the mini-mart only allows me to take him down. I wish there was an other way instead of killing the suspect. By the way, the mini mart only had a counter.Your patrol car is fantastic. I love how you can get in, turn on your lights, (high beams also),  turn in the warning siren ti pull people over, turn on the emergency lights for persuit, and siren. You can set up speed traps and road blocks to check traffic. The help screen is a nice touch. I wish that there was a quick tutorial that goes thru it by putting you in each situation.I love how this game is open ended on the realistic side. It won't end unless you retire. You can rise through the ranks from patrolman to trooper captain ( I think, I would habe to look). Rising through the ranks seems to allow you to be able to buy a car, upgrade your patrol car and/or buy another. That seems it. I wish we were able to see other cops, mingle with them as well as call for backup. In Police Quest, you would be at the Police Station, shower, change into your uniform, go through a briefing with the captain, grab your walkie and patrol keys. I see the speed limit signs which is realistic, however, when I was not called to an emergency, I find that me speeding, had no effect as well as running red lights. I thought when you don't respond to emergencies, as a police officer, you still must obey all traffic laws. All in all, for $19 (from the release date till Oct. 31st, it's $15) this game is really good. Yes it has bugs (cars parked 5 ft. in the air), poor path finding by NPCs but the game has already been thru 2 patches so it will be interesting how this game evolves. I'm hoping it's constantly supported with added DLC and expansions. This game has the potential to be fantastic. Now while this game has some bugs, it certainly doesn't make this game unplayable. It's still very enjoyable!Interstingly, a patch came thru during the weekend. Cudoes to the developer for working ""after hours."" Don't think it's not appreciated! "

												1. Random shamelessly spawning citizens right before your eyes -12. For a new game I really expected the citizens not to spawn and at least attempt to go about their daily lives they basically just walk around and eventually disspear. Games way older than this give at least some goals to the NPCS (go to sleep, eat, go to job, etc) -13. The AI does not notice cars. If they are walking across the street and your car or an NPC car is in their way they will continusly walk against it. -14. Not really open world at all. Most buildings you cannot go into. -15. The NPCs many of them look the exact same.  -16. NPC detail is horrible -17. graphics are pretty bad compared to the games I generally run anyway the people look very undetailed. Games that I have that were released years before this game look better than enforcer. even on ultra the detail is pretty bad for this game. -18. Horrible AI intelligence -19. I put out a road cone an NPC car bumped it and went FLYING through the air. -110. A suspect pulled a gun on me he did not fire within a second I frisked him and found nothing -1Pros1. game gets regular updates +12. easy to edit game files so you do not have to eat every hr or fillup gas every couple minutes. +13. its the only police sim I know on steam +14. Still fun to play a bit I hope they keep updating and improving the game though. +1			"

												Enforcer: Police Crime Action has it's moments, but has had minimul effort put into it on certain topics of the game. When handling every day human emotions and requirements (e.g. stress, hunger, thirst) It adds to the realism within the game. When dealing with stress you can watch television, or perhaps go see a loved family member or friends, but quite frankly when visiting family or friends I noticed that you don't actually get to play the part in hanging out with them and instead it brings up a photo with the sentence underneath saying ""You have visited a friend/family member"" which is quite a let down.The title being ""Enforcer: Police Crime action"" makes it obvious what the game is based on, but when performing traffic stops you have choices of what you can do to the driver you have pulled over. If you want to test a driver for alcohol consumption then you can, but if you decide not to check for alcohol use and it appears they actually had been drinking whilst driving you get ""points deducted"" from you, and all I could think to myself is ""I don't recall Police Officers having magic powers telling themselves, after they had checked the driver what the driver had done wrong."" And I also don't remember my local Police having ""points"" taken away from them, I mean they're treating it like it's a challenge when it is not.Another thing that caught my attention was you can't actually begin your shift at the Police station, and instead you start it at your wardrobe which I thought was random. The thought of not having to go to your area of work placement, and taking orders from your boss/ Police Sergeant is another sign of poor effort, and I had the complete opposite image of the game before I bought it and when I was reading the description.When I noticed that you could upgrade your home I started to slowly change my opinion to a positive state of mind about this game, until I noticed you cannot use them and is mainly there for show. When watching TV you don't actually get to observe anything. Another point which shows lack of effort is when your hunger level gets very low, to recieve food you don't go to the store and buy the food, you don't get the food delivered to you, you pay your fridge to give you the food which made me sigh deeply as I wanted this to be a simulator and not a life that takes it easy on your worn out legs relieving you from walking to the store.As a conclusion I would not recommend this game to anyone. This is because what they say you can do in the description on the Steam page is not 100% accurate at all, and mainly consists of having text grief being thrown at you for when you don't check a drivers ID. Also for when you think you get to live a normal life in this game it is the complete opposite and you do not get to spend time with family or friends, you just get to see an image of them when you click ""Hang out"" with them on your mobile phone. Over all a 3/10, mainly because of the lack of effort that was put into this game. If more detail was added such as actually being able to spend time with people, and having to do what you do in reality then I could most likely bump it up to 6, maybe a 7.			"

												This game is better that any game i have ever played before its got everything from drug busts to vandalist catches and high speed care chases this game is perfect if your looking at being a police when your older it captures the pure essesce of being a police and matches it with a really smart interface and sharp sumulation this game is officaly my favorite.you cant get much better that this game even GTA 5 dosent compare to this this game.this game is one of the funnest games ive ever played and ive played alot and really recommend it to anyone who reads this, this game has so much fun packed into such a small package and it dosent get old ever for as long as ive had it this game is still fun and you never do the exact same thing ever, everyhing is difrent and always exciting to attempt to catch all of the bad guys out there.if at least 1 person buys this game after reading this review my time would have not been wasted trying to convince YOU that this game is the exact thing that careers in the police force start with and shows the moral way to do things in the real world from the police point of view.

												Enforcer Police Crime Action is a police simulator. The player gets the choice of playing as a male or female character. Pros: Explorable world.Realistic criminal scenarios.Cons:Generic dialogue.Some bugs.No way to fix your car while out on the road. The siren sounds fake and annoying.Gameplay:It's my first day on the job. Not much happens but it goes well.I got fired on my second day. I replayed on my third day and this is where things really got interesting.I got killed! XD			"

Posted: April 8, 2015
												First off, I love this game. However, it does have flaws that need to be adressed.1: Vehicle handling is awful. Doesn't even make sense at times.2: Running criminals will stop and walk normally like nothing ever happened after 30 yards, instead of continuing to run or trying to hide.3: Criminals with guns with will sometimes wait up to 8 seconds to start shooting you.4: There are not enough things to spend your money on. You only get to buy 3 cars, and buying furniture for your house is nice, but not enough. It would be nice to be able to buy a new house, and place it wherever we want. 5: You can not recruit a partner, which is very unrealistic.6: Gun play is not very good, considering there is no recoil at all. It would be nice if there was, and as we gain stress levels, the recoil becomes greater. 7: Criminal AI is awful, they stand in one spot when trying to shoot you, instead of trying to get behind cover.8: We need more content, after you play the game for about 3 days, you have pretty much seen everything there is to the game. Give us more missions, more cars, more houses, more gun options, gun customization, a recoil system, partners, trucks, ect.9: It would be nice to have an actual Story Mode. This would entice us to keep playing and staying interested in the game. It mentions that your grandparents dont have much time to live, maybe you could play on that a little bit? 10: MULTIPLAYER! The fun of this game would increse tenfold if we could play with a friend. I'll say this again, I love this game and want to see it grow. However it is very unpolished and until the problems listed above are adressed, I couldn't reccomend this game to just anyone. But if you could look past the problems, you just may find your new favorite game.			"

If they could add some of these things i think it would be one of the best games i have played,     They should add     -Be able to call for back up.  - be able to Run a divers ID in a cop computer -Make it to where the drivers  pull over off the road and so it's not blocking traffic -MORE RADIO SOUNDS (Keeps playing the same thing over and over and over again.) -More  types of cars, (There is only  3-4 types of the same old vehicle) -AND make it to where when a call comes in saying there is a robery not just to make us go and find a guy walking down the street, But to make us go to like a gas place, or a Food market, and see people robing it and stop them, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME,   -LAST THING  yes i know that there are not many cops off duty because of the story line but come on to be the only cop in the state on duty is dum make to where like i siad we can at least call for back up or see random cop cars driveing down the street.   -THANK YOU			"

												FYI: This is a serious police life simulator. If you are looking for a police games that you can just mess around with, I would recomend GTA 4: lcpdfr. If you are looking for a serious police game, this is the game for you. You are a cop, odviously, but after your shift is over, you go home to sleep, watch TV, or take a shower. Between your shifts, you can also explore the town of Mountain Valley. So if you are like me and like these kinds of games, then i would highly recomend this game. If you don't like serious games, I would not recomend this game to you. (Ps. sorry if my spelling is bad, it is not something i'm good at)			"

												Okay so this game is pretty bottom tier a lot of the games talk is about how there is so much to do but there isn't. The game had a lot of potential but most of the features are stupidly added (eg. A Tiredness Bar that does nothing that raises your stress level which also does nothing). Then the game wants you to spend time outside of policing but there is nothing to do off duty so you just play On-Duty the entire time. The driving is horrible and the walking is even worse if that is even possible. How this game even is able to be priced for how terrible it is I don't know, but I wouldn't even recommend this game for $5 if you really want it. Get it for $1.			"

												The whole premise of this game is great, you just play the everyday life of a cop rising through the ranks by catching people speeding, dui's, drug deals etc. HOWEVER, i wish they probably had more of a budget on this or whatever happened to make them stop updating, right now its more like a police simulator.Pros: - You actually can make traffic stops and even the simple mundane tasks of a normal cop, with the occasional drug deal/ homicide.- The energy and stress level bar is actually realistic, certain activities cause your character more stress than others, the same with energy.- You get paid and can customize your home with different furniture (although it isnt much), for example,  getting a better couch allows you to sleep less but reduce stress and improve energy levels more than the old one.- You have a variety of squad cars to use (although you have to input codes to get them) like a charger, pick up truck, motorcycle. you can also customize light colors and what the car looks like to a point.-The graphics are good, well good for a small time developer.Cons:-AI is pretty bad (while i was parked a guy just walked over my car from the hood to the back of the car, another was just walking into a wall)-Repetitive, theres no real plot or story (Why i called it a simulator)- when you reverse it takes ten years to start going forward again- If you get shot twice or get shot with health even at 99% you die instantly.- Voice acting is very minimal like literally i think the actor said only 4 sentences. Improvements:-Ai actually be intelligent-better health system (so you dont die with one shot) - More missions-When you choose to hang with friends maybe have like a cutscene or something.-Call back-up also NPC cops.-if you shoot someone and call for an ambulance, one actually comes and you can try to keep them alive while it comes.But all in all, its fun but probably should cost like 5-10$ less, if the updated it more than maybe it would be worth 20$			"

												I've had this game in my library for probably close to a year now. At first I was really optimistic about it. It had amazing potential, and despite the bugs, it was fun to play and the developers seemed to be involved. 9 months later, this game hasn't been touched and there's aspects that make it almost unplayable. The glitch that makes this game unplayable for me is the one where your weapons sometimes don't shoot at all, no matter how many times you try. This leads to the criminals killing you.  This game is like finding out you're pregnant with Albert Einstein and 9 months later giving birth to Kanye West. 2/10, wouldn't recommend.			"

												FYI: This is a serious police life simulator. If you are looking for a police games that you can just mess around with, I would recomend GTA 4: lcpdfr. If you are looking for a serious police game, this is the game for you. You are a cop, odviously, but after your shift is over, you go home to sleep, watch TV, or take a shower. Between your shifts, you can also explore the town of Mountain Valley. So if you are like me and like these kinds of games, then i would highly recomend this game. If you don't like serious games, I would not recomend this game to you. (Ps. sorry if my spelling is bad, it is not something i'm good at)			"

												I think this game gets unjust reviews. Sure, its graphics can be considered lacking, maybe around a more ps2 style, but that just means older pcs are welcome to join in on the fun. Driving is touchy, especially in the different models, but there are more than enough good moments in this game to keep a player coming back. The pedestrians are quirky, so it may seem lame to some, but I think it breaks up the repetitiveness of the game. Different things to do, such as setting up road blocks or speed radars, busting drug dealers who seem to always have a gun, serving warrants and more. This game isnt difficult to learn, and is a great time killer. I got on Steam sale for 9.99, and I would say that is the price YOU should shoot for. Pros-Variety of missions leading to different styles of gameplay.  (Laid back pulling speeders over, or gun ho, busting dealers)-Customizable clothes, cars, and house.  (Not a huge variety, but enough to set you a part)-Easy to learn-Tons of potential-Taser the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of someone. Cons-Outdated Graphics (Older systems welcome)-Touchy driving system-Lack of interaction with HQ, other officers, and other agencies.-Turning on/off car over and over-Turning on/off all your lights and your siren. -Gas and damage system are “iffy”7/10 Would smoke a bowl waiting for speeders just to have the perp run on me so I can shoot them in the back with 10,000 volts.

												The game is fun for the first hour or so but after that the fun starts to wear off... Majority of the game revolves around searching for drunk drivers and the occasional robbery or murder that pops up. The game is full of potential, however with repetitive gameplay, poor driving mechanics and mediocre graphics the $21 price tag is just too much to ask.			"

												They just relased the game with all the bugs and glitches. There were no new updates since the ""release"". Well an other: ""don't buy early-access example"". Its a shame because this had so much potentional. If there is a sale and its like 5€ or something you could buy it, till then stay away its not worth your money! Alternative which is probably cheaper on sales: GTA4 with LCPDFR mod. It costs less, has better functionality, isnt that glitchy and it works. Compared to the mod: not worth a buy.The only real pro: It is realistic. You play an hispanic police officier, randomly harass black people, arrest them for no good reason, drive them to the woods and shot them if they dont cooperate as you wish... but i'm not sure if thats a plus :S			"

												Just bought and seems to be a near perfect police simulator. Though just to critique a few minor things: the load screens between sections of the map really dull the immersive quality of the game; having to turn your car off and coming to a full stop before getting out of the car is realistic, though a little tedious; driving sucks, it's like you are on ice or something; the missions seem a little vague at times, but there is a tutoial I ignored or I'm just a little thick. Other than those minor things, it makes being a cop seem fun, bonus-the paperwork is done for you.			"

												So after much thought I am among many of the others who'd say don't buy this game. It's unfinished and vary clunky. The game had such great potentail but, looks as though the Devs just gave up on it. I'd love to this game actually Improve or even take of. It needs a real over haul to even be concidered half way decent. Lets start with graphics they are close to those you'd get on your PS1. Game play is vary dual not enough missions, lack of conustumization options, and the realism is low. Driving cars is like trying to control a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RC car with a bad wheel. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the first hour and kept coming back hoping for more only to be disappointed.			"

												For some reason cars are flying up when they ram me, I must be super(cop)man. Maybe I can recommend it when I actually 'learned' how use all the game's functions and features. But the game lacks tutorials. Seriously, I never got any information on 'how' to do something. You just start at your house and you are on your own from there. No info, whatsoever. The only thing I figured on my own thus far sleeping, grabbing my uniform, driving and how to grab a gun/tazer. I suppose shooting people for no reason is all you need to know.While I got the game for free, I would not pay $20 for it. The game is too basic to be worth that much.			"

												Day 1------------------------------- Went to set up speed traps on the main highway, got a call from dispatch about 2 possible vandals in the area.-Asked witnessneses about said vandals, found one.- Asserted myself as a police officer, immediately got shot.-Returned fire, killed suspect, didn't see his friend behind me.R.I.P. 10/10 Would patrol the Ghetto again.Pros---------------------------------You can do anything that a police officer would in realistic fashions, Check for Drunk drivers, set up road blocks, speed traps, issue tickets, search people for drugs, weapons, etc. -Customizable home, and squad cars-Ability to purchase new guns (New pistol, assault rifle and SMG)-Cars and suspects will both try to run from you which leads to ""High speed"" pursuits (at 30 mph) -Investigate calls of possible thieves in people's homes at 3 am (Which is always fun kicking in doors)-Multiple dispatch calls across the state, everything from murder suspects to drug dealers, to just a routine traffic stop that turns into a gun fight.-That look of disappointment in your grandfather's eyes in the picture when you visit him. :P-Herbert the pervert, which is a strange looking individual which you should keep your eyes out for, you'll know him when you see him...Cons-----------------------------------------------Buggy (I've seen some really weird♥♥♥♥♥♥playing this game.) Seen everything from people driving cars with 4 hands, to cars driving down the road with people standing in front of them like nothing happened. (Once I even seen two semi's get it on.)The only bugs I have found that break the game is that in realistic mode, Dispatch remains silent and you never get calls after the second day, which makes it pointless to even carry a gun. In Casual mode though, there is no problem with Dispatch giving you calls.-Arcadish type game (You get points for completing 911 calls and arresting criminals as well as other police duties, all they do is count towards your rank as a police officer which is kind of pointless considering the only thing being a high ranking police officer provides is better pay. No rewards other than being a State trooper allows customizable vehicles.  -Crime rate is way too high which leads to boredom of the game really really early, and leads to repetition, which is why people tend to only get about 9 hours in on average before never playing it anymore.I pulled over one drunk driver, only to have 2 more drive past me as I was getting out of my cruiser.Then another car sped past them in the oncoming lane going way over the speed limit, and meanwhile Dispatch telling me that there has been an assault in the area.FOR GOD SAKES I AM THE ONLY POLICE OFFICER IN THE ENTIRE GAME D: I can only do so much.

												I know I only have about 2 hours playing this game, but I just have to state that I am having no issues with the old-style graphics (and if you are a ""graphics make the game"" kind of person... God save your soul!), the random floating cars are rare (No-one else mention that?) the combat system is based upon your characters well-being (so your aim will be sh*t if you are tired/hungry/stressed) .Game runs smooth.No option to adjust audio settings whilst in-game (Scratch that, I missed that part lol)You are the only Cop in the 7 areas (for now I hope, in a future update maybe there will be the ability to call for back-up)The options are very basic (early-access, give it time) hopefully in the future you will be able to have specific actions, like ticket amount or time spent in a cell for crime committed etc.Really good game, practically one of a kind as there are very few games that are open-world play-as-police games.9/10 Would recommend for any budding bad*ss :)			"

												I have never regretting buying a game more than I have this one.  The graphics and voices are complete garbage, but that's not the worst part.  The controls and bugs to this game are complete crap.  Scratch that, it's worse than crap to a point where I cannot think of proper words to describe how bad it is.  This feels like an early access title that had a lot of potential.The developer seems to be releasing updates to fix bugs, so maybe one day this will be playable.  For right now, it's just a bad title.			"

												Great concept. Should be considered an early access game tho. Needs some polish. I would love to see this game improve. It has so much potential. The environment graphics look fantastic, but the character models and vehicle models need some work. A tutorial would be greatly appreciated. Tooltips are great for reinforcing what a tutorial taught you, but shouldn't be relied on as the tutorial.In conclusion, great concept, needs some work on execution. Hopefully Excaliber keeps the patches coming.			"

												Note that this game is not released yet. The devs think that it is but it is still in early development. Prepare for plenty of bugs while playing this game!Plus side: Great idea of a game. Most games, you are the criminal and if you are a cop, you are undercover. This really is a great police simulator. All it needs are some patches!			"

												Pretty good game. It's hard to beat some of the mods for GTA (LCPDFR), but this game definately comes close and has a lot of enjoyment. It's very stable, and has only crashed a hand full of times on me (Mac OS X). The creator really spent some time with and polished it up nicely, and put a lot of details in like customizing the vehicles, different incidents, and different missions to do. The driving is awful though. The vehicles have poor handling and are difficult to drive. Also, you have to manage stress, sleeping, and hunger levels in the game. To me, that's just a waste of time, I just want to play a cop simulator and not worry about the rest of that junk. To reduce stress, you have to go out with your mom, friends, etc. The game is a little bit more encompassing than I would have liked. Although the game definately met my expecations for being a cop game, and it just missed the mark of my ideal cop game ever so slightly.			"

												In this game you roleplay as a cop. So I did my best to roleplay a cop.In the game,  I saw a suspicicious black male driving a car. I turned on my siren and asked him to pull over.  I had my gun drawn on him as I approached him. After I approached him, I asked him if I could see his id. When he went for his ID, I shot him because I thought he was going for a gun. He ends ups dying and I lose my job. The next day, I'm hired at another police department.  10/10 REAL POLICE SIMULATOR			"

												I bought this game because it look like a pretty good game so far i have ranked up.Buggy: yes the game is a bit buggy but what do you expect out of a game when it newly fresh also the streets do need to be redone some arears the road sticks up. Sound: is pretty good but also a little buggy sometimes.Mission: you won't get board of the mission but the only thing is the timer in which you have to complete them.Weapons: you get the standard weapons  Gun, taser , and machine gun.Stress Relief System ;  It's okay but you either have to visit friends or family or watch TV to be calm.Eating and Sleeping:  Just make sure you watch your meter before it drains.Fuel consumpton and Damage :  To me i think it too much but hey can't live in god mode all the time  just make sure you fill up.Money; It takes alot of money to do things but really why the high prices.Vehicles:  Crown victoria, Dodge Charger, SUV and a undercover Crown Victoria  Depending on your Ranking.Vehicle Etc.  You can change the lightbar the light bar color wheels and paint.Character:  You can pick between a Male or Female it lacks customization.Movement:  Needs ImprovementShooting:  Needs ImprovementGraphics:  Needs Improvement.Forget it the games needs a ton of improvements.But i could go on but i don't want to board anybody. Might edit this after work.Overall Truth:Do not waste your money on this. I only do this to  help other people out.  The Developers have enough experience to really do a good game but choose not too,  The only really thing I do not like about this game is that you are the only cop in town there no backup no nothing noone to help you when you need it.  I know its a small town but my goodness why put alot mor pressure on the player.Game Rateing is a 3 out of 10.			"

												want to harrass people for being black? then this the game for you. it's just an autist game, its trash and unrealistic. There's an half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥story and it is so uncompelling its not worth getting into. just go out mow down a bunch of people shoot someone for no reason and get fired, rinse and repeat. its like postal 2 but the autist who made it is a stickler for the rules. its basically like those mod servers on games where 12 year olds want to pretend to be a policeman or in the army so they feel liek they have some sort of power over people.if this game was a person it would a 15 year old autist who constantly begs to be a moderator on minecraft or dayz just so he can fly around and tell people what to do. this game is trash and would make for some good memes.

												Hello My name is Jamie Griffin I run a HUGE GTA 5 Police clan called GEC. We love your game and want to incorporate it into what we do as a clan. What we do as a clan is a FULL POLICE RP server hosted of Fivereborn. As you may already know Police 10-13 is gaining ground but not fast enough! This makes you guys the ONLY police RP game available to us that is even good at all! What we as a community would like to do is make this game MP and fix the games bugs that we have documented and taken feedback from community forum. You guys have a heck of a backlash from the community but we think we can help! Please contact us if you are interested our clan is based out of Canada but our script guy is out of England (This is for ENFORCER: Police Crime Action)Flag this message  Delete this message "

												This is a great game I personally love it. But, one day all that would happen was in the main menu all I could see was the police car lights flashing and the camera moving which is what would happen in the background if the main menu pops up. But that is the problem, only that pops up, the main menu doesn't even come up. I have tried everything. Deleting the local game content, restarting my pc. I really love this game but I wish that it would work!!! I'm so furious!!!!			"

												-So my first day on the force as Officer: Officer Hyena-I am tasked with finding cars parked in the wrong spot. I leave me car halfway on a sidewalk to investigate in a town consisting of about 3 blocks of houses-I find around 6 cars, give them tickets, give one correctly parked car a ticket because it was an ugly shade of yellow. I can no longer find my car.-Hear a report of a woman buying drugs. I go toward the general area of the crime on foot-It is at the other end of the town-It leads me down an alleyway. I round the corner and she shoots me in the face with a military grade assault rifle-But she is white so I taze and handcuff her-I don't have a car to transport her-Her punishment is to WALK the entire distance of the town handcuffed behind me.-I then get a report of a kidnapped child-My shift already ended. I get a taxi home and sleep. After all: 'The first 24 hours are the least important time to find someone who is kidnapped.'-Best 30 minutes of gameplay ever			"

												Apparently, this is the best brazil has to offer. Its no wonder that country is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the world. Yes ive put alot of hours into this game despite how broken it is, which is a testemant to how this could be a really fun game. However this makes it all the more unforgiving that its been years since any patches have been made and the same bugs that made it a chore to play on day 1 are still there. For 19.99, i feel like the devs owe me about $15 since they only made about 1/4th of the game they advertised. But if you ask any questions or give criticism, you get your thread locked. Amazing how much time the devs have to patrol steams forums when they are so behind on the update. Maybe the only computer in all brazil powerful enough to make a game broke half way through development. Poor tiny brained zika people.			"

I'm looking forward to better updates for this game.			"

												Oh dear! I committed a crime by buying yet another pathetic half arshed game published by Excalibur Publishing. This isn't as bad as Police Force, but it's not much better. Buggy, terrible driving mechanics, below average graphics and more!Save your money folks. If you're looking for a quality police simulator, look no further than the amazing GTA mod LCPDFR.

The game is awful.
It's full of bugs, it's so raw that if it was a chicken it would still be making eggs.
The mechanics are awfully poor and bad implemented.
House customization -> only appearance, it does not help you recover stress faster.
Recovering daily stress -> spending 1 minute repeadly clicking the television each time starting an awful animation of you watching television.
Replenishing ammo -> BUGGED, you spend 100$ to ""BUY AMMO"" and it only replenish the cartridge inside the weapon, not the others.
You spend most of the time with dumb quests like ""parking tickets"", ""make the alcohol test to driver"", ""place the radar and go afk to make yourself a coffee while the quest completes by itself"" and after those the number of quest is really little and repetitive, there's no campaign questline, just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ secondary quest, bad implemented, bad animated.
The list of this game is so long that you should try it just to see it by yourself, this is a game of ""police"" and I find it ironic the devs asking 20€ for it, it's clearly a legalized robbery.
I can just wonder if this game was made by a drunk russian guy or something. "

												Great News and it is not about this game  This game lacks so much and this game is not worth 20 dollars and in my opinion will never be i recommend not buying it at all unless you just want a game that is repetitve and lacks graphics big time as well a physics. dont worry about even recommending anything to developers because i dont even think they care. so this game rating is a 4 out of 10. the great news is that police 10 - 13 (released in 2016) will be what this game should have been plus they are releasing it on console as well as pc its more realistic and defines what police have to endure on a daily basis this game mocks that nothing is close to real at all. i reccomend saving your money and buying police 10 -13 more work and time and quallity will have been well worth the wait.p.s. If Enforcer: police Crime Action was worth $5.00 i would buy it at that price because that is its true value especially with the lack of updates.			"

												I don't recommend this game because it crashes often... The concept is solid, but the programmers really needed to test it on more systems. 4 gb of ram for this game is a steep requirement?! I can run the Sims 3 with most of the addon content all day long without crashes!I meet all the requirements yet when i try to leave my house dressed as a cop the game crashes every time. I can seem to leave the house as the off duty version of my protagonist, but as the cop it's a no go. I have a suspicion that the way the programmers have the game handling the memory allocation has something to do with this issue. I think the game is trying to load everything in one big data dump on the computer eating all the memory all at once. I also found that it crashed out upon trying to re-enter my house as the off duty version of my character, again sounds like poor memory handling coding.Interestingly enough i tried running the game in 256 color mode and it runs, except the game is unplayable because it looks like you have the predator's eyes...At least it wasn't very expensive, but i really wish the developers would have told everyone that they needed 8 gb of ram instead of 4 to run a flash game...

												プレイ時間: 47分総評: 定価19.99ドルは商売を舐めすぎ。ていうか1ドルでも高い。普段はタイトルとか考えてレビュー書いてますがこの作品に関してはそれすら考える事がめんどくさくなる程に本作をゲームとして楽しめる要素はありませんでした。ですが私はどうしてもこのクソゲーを間違って買う人が一人でも減る事を願い、こうしてレビューを認めています。とは言え、私の文章力では本作の一体どこが面白くないのかを挙げる事も出来ません。なぜならば、本作をプレイした47分間のただ一片とも「ここは面白かったな」と思える箇所が無いからです。ゲームエンジンの問題からキャラクターのRagdollが突如プルプル震えただとか、85度くらいの斜面を車両でBig Rigsよろしく登りきれるだとか、なぜか自宅と警察署を除く全ての建造物の内部に家具などが一切なく、屋内でも外が雨ならNPCが室内で傘を差しているだとか、おもしろSSやネタ動画のソースとしては使えない事もない事を除き本作を楽しめる方はごくごくごくごく僅かではないでしょうか。あらすじ主人公であるあなたは理由はよく分かりませんが片田舎に引っ越すと同時に自動的に警察官になっています。あなたの自宅には専用のパトカーが友人か何かのジョージによって置かれたまま放置され、お前は警察官になったんだから自由に使っていいという事を自宅のPCのemail内で明かされます。おわり。真面目に書けよ私はいたって真面目にこのレビューを執筆しています。先のあらすじを書いた本当の理由はこのゲームは一事が万事このようなノリのまま全力でプレイヤーを置き去りにしている事を伝えたかったのです。あらすじに関しても本当にこの通りであり、それ以上もそれ以下もありません。ゲームの目的も一切明かされませんし、チュートリアルも存在しません。更に言えば現時点ではSteam上にすらプレイガイドが存在していないのです。私は47分しかこのゲームをプレイしていませんが、恐らくこのゲームの目標は「犯罪者を挙げ、報酬を手にし、自宅に家具を買う」事です。いえ、見間違ってなどいません。もう一度念の為に書きますが、このゲームは「犯罪者を挙げ、報酬を手にし、その報酬で自宅に家具を買う」事です。意味が分かりませんか？私にも分かりません。オチもありません。本当にそうですから。なおこの家具に関しては購入すると勝手に設置されていく為、ハウスカスタマイズという要素で楽しむことは不可能でしょう。プレイを開始したら即座にワードローブに向かい、着替えなければ外に出ても何も出来ないため制服に着替えて外出します。すると間髪入れずに無線が入り、「検問をして怪しい車を挙げろ」というミッションが下されます。私にはこのミッションの達成方法が最後まで分かりませんでしたが、自宅のマイパトカーを左クリックする事によりカラーコーンを立てる事が出来、それを道路に並べる事で一般車両が停止することを発見し、車道に立ってみたら車がプレイヤーに激突しプレイヤーが車にめり込みスタック、カラーコーンを数個以上置こうとすると画面中にYou can't put anymoreというエラーが並び尽くしHUDを専有とい珍事が発生させる事は出来ました。尚、これはプレイ開始から3分で発生した出来事です。結局当該ミッションのクリア方法が分からないまま散歩を続けていると、突如「空き巣が発生、現場に向かえ」という指示が無線で飛んできたのでマップ上で赤く光っているドットの地点に向かいました。その家に到着し、「ドアを開ける」を選ぶと礼状がないので開けられないと言われたので仕方なく「警察だ開けろ」を選択した所、そこには先に挙げたようにがらんどうの室内で傘を差したままこちらを睨みつける住人がいました。その住人の前でEを押してインタラクトすると会話ができましたが、選択肢が「何かありましたか」しか存在しなかった為、それを選ぶと「何もなかったわよ！ありがとう」と言われミッションクリアとなりました。おかしいだろ。Steamだとは言えネタでも買われないゴミこのようにゲームの面白さは皆無ではあるものの、プレイした時間＝話のネタが増えるという面で言えばSteamというストアの概念を既に超えたコミュニティー上ではもしかすると購入する価値はあったかもしれませんが、本作は超強気の19.99ドルが定価のためにおいそれとギフトする事も難しいのでこの面でも存在価値がありません。かと言ってBig Rigsのように派手にぶっ壊れた動画も恐らく撮る事ができないのでその筋の方にとっても価値が低いでしょう。残った用途としてはクソゲー実況用でしょうか？それでも盛り上がりに欠けると思いますが。私は本作をgiveawayで無料で手に入れましたが、このクソゲーに47分間のプレイ時間と5分ほどのDLに時間を費やした事を悔やんでなりません。もし本作を購入していたら当然ながらRefundに踏み切っている事でしょう。通常考えうる楽しむためのプレイを目的としているなら、本作の購入は見送りましょう。			"

The graphics are PS2 era and the controls are a little wonky, but the game is pretty solid.   There is a decent amount of things to do, so for the price point ($21.99 CDN) I would reccomend it if you love police games, movies, shows, etc. If you are only semi-interested, I would purchase during a sale.Also, the game was made by just four people, so it's nice to support them. This game is really good considering only the four of them worked on it.			"

												(ABANDONED COMPANY WENT UNDER)   more info below about gameLet me start by saying ignore all the extremley negative reviews. This game does work it just take time to figure out. It really dosent give you much of a tutorial which is a down. OVERALL, This game is an ok game. It shows great potential and I DO RECOMMEND this game. I look forward to seeing this game develop and cant wait to see it in the later stages. PROS- Rare game type- Fun after figuring it out- Great potentialCONS- No Tutorial- Lacking ambiance (dont feel involved/in the game)- Needs to work on the tweeks; shooting, pursuits, just overall stuff in the game- IMPORTANT  needs AI police officers that you can call for back up or help you in pursuitsCurrently 5 of 10     but there is lots of potential and i like the idea of seperating from mainstream games.

												good idear, Games is on the same open wolrd engine as Bus simulator and truck simulator so grapighs are not great.I am a fan of ploice games, like Police qeust and  Swat. so I thought this game was right down my ally.However it needed more time in devlopment.crimes boil down to just  4 types1. speeding (get out of car place speed carma done)2. parking (find car get out tickt and tow)3. driver or  car check (stop car talk to driver check driver check car ticket or arresset if arrest also tow)4. Minor/major crime (Find victems get a discption head for the red blub look for anyone runing stop them process and arrest if there in a car tow it gather any droped everdance)It needed more time spent on how crimes worked.

												Was a game with lots of potential, an american police simulator? How many of those do you see, if it had been finished and bugs worked out, I bet this would have been a great game. However, with driving being the most award thing, few verity in calls, a crappy ""Story"", and a few other things. This is hardly a game that you can get more than few hours of game play. To make maters worse, the company developing it went under, so the hope I had of this game developing up when I bought it are gone.			"

												I'm a fan of police work, I slightly want to be a cop. But as much as I like this game and it's aspects, it is a gigantic mess. Awkward animations, bad voicework, terrible car physics, and to top it all off: It has the graphical quality of a 2002 game.I WANT to love this game, but I cannot look past all the bugs, sillyness and missed potential!There is a list of things in the forums that people want in this game, but I don't think the devs are up to the challenge....6/10 Play with no intention of being an actual police officer, play like a Los Santos cop.

												Avoid this game at all costs. EXTREMELY poorly optimised, poor graphics yet still runs like garbage. No tutorial, you are thrown into the game and asked to complete tasks without any kind of guidance of how to do them. For instance, I got asked to breathalyze 9 people. I had no idea how to go about this process, and wasn't told how to arrest anybody either. This game is a complete joke and it's rather insulting that someone out there has the nerve to actually charge money for it. 20 minutes was all I needed to decide that this game was just not worth my money. Thank God that Steam introduced a refund system. This is the first game I've availed of it.			"

												I love this game because you can finally be a police officer. You, the only cop in town, have the authority and people listen to you! While you do the normal missions, dispatch can call you for various emergencies. YOU HAVE TO SLEEP AT LEAST 8 HOURS EACH NIGHT IN ORDER FOR THEM TO KEEP CALLING! Taking two gunshots can get you killed, so gunfights are especially nerve-wracking. Sometimes if you pull over a person and they run, you have to draw your tazer and press C to make them stop.   There are also realism factors like turn signals, the warning horn, and others. You have to shut off your engine to exit the car, but once you reach 12mph or lower you can press R, the car will stop, and you get out.  Love this game and love that the Devs are still working on it!			"

I think the biggest bug right now is if you own a civilian car and you accedently hit a patrol car function, it crashes the script to the civilian car leaving you to have to restart the game. I still had fun playing many hours of this game. There are other bugs to but those are being address in the July update.			"

												This game is purely awful for what its price is. It's EXTREMELY glitchy to the point in which you have to restart your game multiple times. The driving (one of the main parts of the game) is extremely touchy and awful. There's no car to human interaction (if you try to run someone over you just drive under them and they walk over your car...?) The land is baren, it's not a sandbox. This game is worth it if you can buy it for 2 maybe 4 bucks. NOT 20. do NOT waste your money on this trash. Refunding this 20 minutes of playtime.			"

												I was extremely excited for this game. But  when I purchased it I could tell it was rushed. This game has an offduty system which needs work. The game needs to tell you all the laws i have arrested people for valid offenses and lost points. Not to mention when off duty you have a bar that is time till you have to be off duty. Honestly of there is a sequal to this game that is well done and not rushed i would still buy it. But this game is a no go for the price it currently has. Also when you get shot at (which happens rarely) you shouldn't expact backup. This is becaise there is no AI police officers. Not even EMS that shows up. All you do is select an option on a radio for people who are hurt, sick, or shot.			"

												While the repetive parts of the police work (stop vehicle, check license, test breath, ask to step outside, call tow, call pickup) could be bearable, the parts where you have to call a cab to get home, walk to get a shower, watch a shower animation (that's actually watching a wall to avoid nudity, and I'm being literal here it's a few second unskippable cut scene of a plain wall) to wind up your ""stress control"" bar make this game way too boring.Idea is interesting, the execution horrible.

It has potential, but in the current state, you'd think it was early access and not a completed game.  The AI is pretty dumb and predictable. There are bugs. It gets boring quickly. I'm not hating on it, I really love the idea, but as others and myself have said, it needs some more work.For £14.99, it really is not worth the investment. It's barely worth £6.99 in my opinion.

												At the current price tag of 20 euros I cant recomend this game, maybe in a steam sale for less .The game has a very good idea but thats about it, it has a lot of cons so lets start with the good things to soften the blow-Pros,-Good idea-certain mechanics like random ""special"" assignments add a bit of flavour to a rather bland game-It runs on a low spec PC (Due to horrible graphics :)-Cons,-HORRIBLE graphics-Repetitive on duty tasks-Off duty tasks and activities add absolutly nothing to the game. (Could have been better for you to always be on duty, in my opinion.)-To go off duty, if you are in a remote region you must pass through other regions to get to the police station, you will get assigned rutine missions as you pass through each sector. This might not seem like a problem to you now but when you start to get into the game you will find it very anoying.-Firefights are very random, example: Stop a normal car on a rutine alchohol check, car stops, driver gets out and starts running away, i persue the driver through the streets, she stops, turns around and puts hands in the air, I tazz her (my bad) and she just pulls out a gun, pumps me full of lead and BUM! Im in the hospital.This game had a lot of potential but franckly is not worth your time.-P.S: Game stopped working when I stop civilian vehicules, the keyboard is disabled and I cant do anything. Left me with a bad feeling, I cant play it anymore!			"

												I took a chance on this game despite the mixed reviews and was disappointed with the result. This game really should be on as early access because it is far from what I would expect from a completed project. The AI is poorly coded, for example I parked at the roadside to set up a speed camera and within seconds 6 npcs were walking continuously against the boot/trunk of my car going nowhere.When you arrest someone they magically teleport to you as you lead them back to your car and if you stand still they start to circle you like a derpy shark. There's no tutorial to explain how anything works (probably because most of it is broken).The vehicle handling is laughable and the lack of softbody physics is brought sharply into focus when you crash into a lamp post only to come to an instant halt.The camera clips through walls and gets stuck on the outside of the car garage when you drive inside.There's an unacceptable number of bugs and poorly delivered gameplay elements here that leaves me astounded that the developer would honestly believe that this was ready to move into beta never mind a full release.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Hang on for ""Police 10-13"" it looks like it could be a great game and more importantly the devs are active with their community.0/10 "

												not a terrible game, I appreciate it is quite realistic ( despite skipping cutscenes where the tow truck tows the cars away, or the police van takes the criminals away ) and replacing them with 2-3 second black screens. As well, vehicle handling, in my opinion is nearly impossible. 0-150 KM/H in 3 seconds? and slowing down.... good luck braking from 150, because when you do, you will lose control of your vehicle, and likely hit a few cars, damaging your police car, forcing you to waste your earned in-game money, and losing score to call a tow truck to fix your car that was damaged beyond believe upon hitting a no parking sign. Until this update comes out, that was promised mid-July, but no notice has been given as to why, in early August, there is still no update. Unless the update covers the biggest issues I can find in this game, such as vehicle handling, ( which also makes it impossible to get into a good position to arrest drug dealers ) this game is lacking. As well, I have seen a few bugs so far, such as people walking over my police car ( yes, they litterally jump up, walk over the roof, down onto the hood, and keep talking on their cell-phones like nothing happened ) or stuck spinning around behind some vehicle they constantly keep walking into. You have alot of work to do devs, and if you ever manage to release the much-awaited, and promised update, I will be happy to revise my review. But until then, I do not recommend this game.			"

												As current law enforcement I can say that this game is decently close.. But still has room to expand.Positives:Decent RoleplayEasy controls/Xbox 360 controller compatibilityCustomizeable vehiclesInteresting scenarios, from traffic stops to drug bustsLarge map with varrying terrain/environmentsNegatives:Graphics are a little behind the times, and some animations become flawed. The former is tolerable, but the latter could use minor work.Load points are.. Obvious, a bit to obvious. You can see their green glow from far across the cell. Other than visually unappealing, they function well.Perpetrators tend to have three modes, shoot, run, or surrender. When they shoot, it's tolerable, and requires some fast thinking. When they run, there is an issue.. You character can't run as fast as the AI, so being away from your vehicle on foot chases always fail unless you can get them to surrender quickly. When they surrender, there are some arrest issues. Such as when you go code 3 because someone blows through a blockade, pointing a tazer at them costs points. Other times they work fine.Cars/people are unvaried. There are a couple several models for both, different clothings, skin colors, car colors, and issues with the cars. However, increased detail, in-depth conversations, random generated rap sheets and more models and even clothing would make the depth and roleplay value tenfold.Physics is... Simple. In Enforcer. Gravity seems to be low. The impact of wrecks causes more of an ice-skating situation. And punching the breaks at high speed causes some interesting/unrealistic sliding. Also, don't worry about running over civilians, they will levitate over your vehicle. And sometimes even run over the top.Vehicle specs/damage could be refined heavily. I have drove a P-71 Highway Inteceptor for a few years. The top speed is not 70mph, it is more in line of 140mph (With the govenor, it's more like 120). All vehicles need the physics refined, and the specs adjusted. The damage to the vehicles could be more specific. Such as flat-tires, optional upgrades for tires, bumpers, lights, ect..No fires. Ever. Which is disappointing. Happening upon a field fire would be nice. At least to report.You and the dispatcher are the only directly interactable public service. Other police vehicles/paramedics/tows and ect would be nice. Being able to call backup, or to see another officer pulling over speeders would be cool.Certian situations are cause for arresting someone. There are occassional bugs where someone shooting you will get you punished if you fire at, or arrest them.More/better houses could be added, upgrades and all that.More weapons/outfits/character customization would be nice. Actual vendors/shops and inventory would be cool.Instead of taking perps directly to the 200sqft police station/jail you should take them to a penetentary.Traffic lights and laws for AI needs repaired/overhauled.... I can't think of any more things right now, but I am sure to renew and revise this opinion as the game developes. I would very much like to hear from the developers about my views/opinions.All in all.. This game is well worth the price. It is good. It has potental. If you like law enforcement rp, buy it. :)			"

I only hope enough attention is raised by this horrible game to sink the entire inept studio.			"

												A fun game, I played 3 hours before i got off my computer chair, This game could do with more missions , as there are only a select few that pop up, and the controlls are Clunky, And coming from an ARMA player that says alot, Graphics need a major update, along with the AI ( considering this is an AI based game) and so does the combat systemsAlthough all of this and more is wrong with the game that wont stop me from (After i wright this review) hopping back on to ENFORCER and playing another couple of hoursI DO recomend this game, BUT!!!! At the same time i recomend to the DEVS that they dont stop updating this game because it could be the NEXT POWERHOUSE OF SIMULATORS , competing with the like of Euro truck simulator or FSX Good day			"

												When I first bought this game I was amazed because of the ""Open World"" kinda Police sim.It's still bugged as an Early Access game.... BUT then I found out that the game was released as a full game....... Full of bugs! WTF?!PROS:Fun to take the uniform on and go on dutyYou get a main mission everyday you go on duty (ex. Pullover cars and find 5 DUI, setup speedcams and get 5 cars who drive too fast etc.)CONS: (where to begin?)They started with loads of updates, good replies on ppl messages on the forum.....Then they almost stopped.... It was like that they got the money they wanted..........NOW they'd been promising us a MAJOR update that was due in June 2015 - We're now September 2015!!! A lot of people has been complaining about this and the lack of informations.I think that most people don't mind waiting for a good update, even though they move the release date...The problem starts when the devs in this game - Goes from:""I'm sorry it's gonna take a little longer - I will move the release date to MIDDLE of Augst! As the LATEST!"" - To not replying anymore when we're 3 weeks due to their supposed release.So all in all - IF they would have been honest with the players it wouldn't have been such a big problem. But hiding behind your computer (either working on another game, or just doesn't bother answering), is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move!			"

The game is still in its original state and the helpful team of developpers are now much more detached and unprofessional. I Simply cannot reccomend this game as of now.			"

												Enforcer: Police Crime Action was supposed to be a great thing; a literal police simulator, with many graphical details and missions, it was supposed to bring a new light to emergency service simulation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Enforcer failed to bring what it boasted. The graphics were pretty basic, the physics in the game made me cringe, and the customization between characters, vehicles and equipment was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. This game was supposed to be so much but unfortunately, it fails a lot of it's promises, and in some cases, are worse than some things you'd see on the market.			"

												**** update review the below was written when i first got the game not updated in months despite promise from dev's - seems dev's have abandoned game DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS UNLESS DEVS START TO SHOW INTEREST AGAIN *********Played a few hours and I have found it a good time filler. Game is far from perfect so much more that could be done at the moment you go on duty do a few car checks and give tickets and go off duty. Sometimes you get a call for a missing person, drugs dealer or thief but not very often.I would recommend the game if someone is looking for a time filler and a bit of fun but I would also only recommend buying it on sale until the game is improved with more content and more to do.

												It's a heaping pile of crap.I hate to be so harsh, since I believed in this game from the beginning, but the truth hurts. The idea was brilliant! But the graphics look like something that came straight out of the 90s. The game play is no better. The story line hurts, it just hurts. There is a levelling system, but it's utter bull dung. I wouldn't be so critical of this game if it was free to play, or cost under $5. But the $20 price tag that they've slapped onto it is just laughable! Especially since there hasn't been an update to fix the bugs in close to half a year (the devs scheduled one for August, it's October..).Seriously, if you have to throw away $20 just light it on fire. You'll get more enjoyment out of it than by playing this thing.			"

												Like others have said great idea, but poor execution. I tried really hard to love this game, and did at launch. However, it dawned on me just how little there is to do in the game. It also doesn't help that major things just as driving mechanics have not been addressed. Major features that were advertised seem to have no impact on game play, such as the stress mechanic. One issue I did notice was that when cycling through the graphics settings I was unable to go from ""ultra"" back to low, as the ""ultra"" setting would automatically crash the game on my PC. However, my computer is FAR from a top of the line gaming rig so I will not count that against the game; but it is something to keep in mind though.Overall, poor execution on a game that had a lot of potential, and honestly quite a bit of hype surrounding it all things considered.

I found my time in Mountain View as a LEO and Citizen to be very fun and adventures. The graphics are ok but I really dont care for graphics. Aslong as the game has no serious defualts with the graphics, I like it. The controls are good for me, easy to operate and execute a mission with. Takes Police SIms to a whole new level, being able to talk to and actually ask people questions, ID's, Traffic Enforcement, etc. I would recommend this game to anyone intersted in Law Enforcement.

												I used to think that this game had a lot of potential when the game was released, back when the developers still cared about improving the game's entertainment and simulation aspect. Since early 2015, the game hasn't really received updates that would make the game less buggy and add more realism. Right now, with the type of care that the developers are putting into Enforcer, they are currently all talk but no walk. They promise then postpone repetitively an update that was scheduled for July 2015, the update was supposed to have small extra features. Three months later and still no word on the update's release date or progress. Then the developers even admitted they have no ETA on the update. People shouldn't expect this game to be a simulation; there are a lot of realistic features that aren't included, which makes the game very repetitive.			"

												I bought this game on launch day, October 24th, 2014. There has since been very, VERY, few updates, and the devs show no proof of progress and only say ""update incoming"" every month, only to have it 'delayed'. The game is most certainly fun, it is. The main issues are the fact that the game gets old quick, with some calls getting repeated 4-5 times in a row. The game is buggy and driving feels like someone put a brick up their♥♥♥♥♥ pulled it out covered in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and threw it on a lubed up slip n slide. With no progress in MONTHS, I say the game is dead, the devs ""promise otherwise"". Buy at your own risk.			"

												I hesitated alot after reading some reviews and watching some videos. I have a lot of respect for the emergency services world. But after finally deciding in picking it up, I was very impressed. Yes it does have some glitches, but thats just a small pasive issue for me. Thumbs up, I get to work as an emergency servies operator for my career, and play officer at home :).			"

												Ok, i am from the Police Quest generation and although comparing that to this game, its probably best not too.  This game is still extremely buggy:1. Random flying cars2. When ever i visit friends or family off duty, my Police Car follows although i cant use it3. I watch cars crash into each other and funny enough as a Police Officer i cannot action it4. The graphics are poor, even maxed out on my Alienware 880 SLI5. Poor character animations6. When shooting dead on target it still missesPlease sort out this buggy game and i can forsee i extremely good sim.Enough said.			"

												First off I am loving this game so far. Some really good ideas and has been well excuted for a game still in early development.Here are some things I'd like to see implemented in the game.-Have more variety of missions as you move up the ranks. As I've ranked up I am still getting the same menial tasks while on duty. I'd love to be able to do drug raids and busts as well look for clues at a murder scene etc.-Have the option to choose a career track. Have the ability to choose whether to become a SWAT team member or Homicide Detective etc.-Have more things to interact with and do while off duty. Have a bar or nightclub where the player can go for a drink to lower stress or even meet a partner to date and eventually move into your home.-Have bigger houses to buy-Have food places modelled indoors. This could work gameplay wise with robberies in progress happening inside the places or hostage negotiation situations.-Fledge out the precinct indoors a bit more. As you rank up you get your own desk. You could also have a meeting room where the chief tells you about a wanted criminal to track down etc.-More NPC variety. Once you pull them over and as you walk up to their car they could take off and start a pursuit. I also haven't encountered any of them who try to punch you, it's either they run away or draw a gun. There should be an inbetween.-Add new items like pepper spray or baton you can use on unruly NPC's and Spike Strips for speeding cars who are dangerous.The game is still in early development and I am sure the developers have a lot of plans for the game they want to implement. I am keen to see how this game pans out in the future :)			"

												I've been playing this game for a while now, and I found it to be fun, and it has a lot of potential for the future. For now it has a few problems, but it is still fully playable. It may be a little repedative, and a little clunky here and there, but it is enjoyable.At this moment I will give it a 7.5/10, and this will probably increase as the development gets further along.

												I really enjoy playing this game and I’m glad I bought it.I like that I can decide whether to take a mission or just do what I like; I can go and arrest some crazed murderer on the other side of town, or I can go on a power trip and randomly pull people over, search them, frisk them for weapons or do a breath test.The graphics are as good at they need to be in this type of game.The only criticism I have is that I wish the map was more varied and that there were more destinations to interact with. Other than that I really like this game and will be downloading the upgrade very soon.7/10			"

												Alright first off, I dis NOT expect a amazing game while playing but I expected a lot more than what this game has to offer. I played for about 4 hours today and I do not see myself playing this game anymore. It is the same thing over and over which is expected of a simulation game. BUT the driving mechanics are horrible plus there is only so much you can do in game. When you get promoted in game, nothing changes but you get more money per shift. You dont get a new uniform or responsibilities which makes you not want to continue playing. I would not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Preemptive tl/dr; Nice concept, bad execution. Looking for realism? Don't buy. Looking for something like <Insert random word> Simulator 2014? Could give you some fun.Got off the bus near my house in the middle of the night, it's raining and I've just got a shirt and hotpants on, should've planned that better. Got a squad car in my rather crappy yard, suppose it's my colleagues wanting to greet me. Turns out it isn't, it's my own personal squad car with a never ceasing stream of chatter through the comm radio. Nevermind, I better go to bed instead. I enter my house and I feel the sudden urge to charge through the living room at full speed, I must've looked like a malformed gorilla with my freakishly large arms waving about. Oh well, at least no one saw me, I'll go to sleep now, wake up fresh for my shift tomorrow.I decide to take a cab to the station, seeing as I can't use the squad car in my yard. They all look funny at me when I arrive, I'm apparently not supposed to check in here at my shift, they tell me to just get changed back home and drive out, they'll assign me as I go. But they graciously enough let me check my e-mail on the computer and offer to sell me ammunition for 100 bucks. Seems kind of strange to me, at my previous assignment they equipped us with that kind of stuff for free. Oh well, note to self: Don't shoot too much.Once again I call the cab to drive me home. I check my wardrobe and there it is! My uniform, a handgun, a sub-machine gun and a tazer. Ready for all eventualities. I go out and enter my car, start it up and tries to back out the entrance to my rather crappy yard. This car handles like a rhino, at least when backing. But at least it accelerates quickly, I went from 0-110km/h in like 2 seconds. No one really cares when I speed past red lights on the sidewalk in 110. The perks of being a cop.First mission! Catch four speeders with the radar. Well that's ironic. Anyway, I drive out a bit away from town. If I should really call it town, more like a glorified block. I set up near a slope, that way they don't see me until it's too late. I go to get my radar and holey moley! There's tons of radars and cones in my car. I resist the urge to litter the entire area with radars and decide to just place two instead. That proves to be quite a difficult task though as the radar keeps falling over when I try to put it on the ground. After some effort and planning I manage to get a couple up anyway. A couple of people speed by, the radars automatically issues them a ticket, that's awesome tech. Suddenly this big freakin' truck comes wobbling across the road, I yell for him to stop the vehicle. He swerves into the side of my squad car and stops. I proceed to tell him to exit the vehicle and promptly does a breathalyzer test on him. He's clean. I'm pretty suspicious about the guy though so I ask for compliance, I frisk him and check his ID as well as the plates on the car. Nothing, he's clean, the truck is clean. Oh well, gotta let him go. It's not like I gotta pay the damage on my squad car by myself. Right?... Wrong. I call dispatch and they tell me to be more careful and charge me 600 bucks. I mean, c'mon.As I walk back to my freshly repaired car, dispatch calls about a kidnapping. I'm so all over that. I get in my car, blaze my sirens and drive around aimlessly. Where am I supposed to go? I start asking people if they've seen anything suspect. No one has. Dispatch calls again, says they have a possible location. 10-4. As I watch my GPS I realize that when I switch the settings from ""mini-map"" to ""overview map"", the map is rotated so they don't look the same. Very unintuitive gear they assign here. Oh well, I manage to find my way at least. I get out my car and draw my gun, I feel my adrenaline pumping. In panic I realize I can't crouch with my gun drawn, I simply can't! I'll have to manage anyway. I see them, a girl lying on the ground and a fat white guy just stands there, looking at me, before I get the chance to tell him to get on the ground, he pulls out a gun. I shoot him in the chest. He staggers but is still alive, he points the gun at me and I shoot him again, right in the chest. He staggers again but he's still standing! What kind of beast is this?! I pop off two more bullets in his chest and stomach. Still standing. One final shot and he's down. Mission complete. 200 points to me. I call an ambulance and they take both the perp and the victim away. No further investigation needed. That's efficient policework. I grab his gun from the ground and get back to stopping cars. There seems to be A LOT of drunk drivers here. One of them swerves right towards me, I panick, my life flash before my eyes and I prepare for permadeath. He crashes straight into me and comes to a complete stop, I didn't even flinch. Seems like I'm made of some tough stuff. I arrest him then I go home to sleep. Busy day.			"

This problem has been around since October and has not yet been fixed.  The devs are more concerned with adding christmas items and motorcycles to the game instead of making it playable for new people.It's 10/10 as a Game Crash Simulator.Run as far as you can from this game.I want my money back.  I'll give the devs 24 hours to refund me before I take it up with paypal.			"

												Overall 7/10-------------Out of the hundreds of games I've played in my life, this is the first that I've ever found to make an honest attempt at a  general Police Officer experience (excluding dreadful paperwork and and the less interesting details).  The mechanics are a bit shoddy but ultimately functional 99% of the time so it's entirely playable for long periods without running into frustrating game breaking errors.  The graphics are comparable to The Sims zoomed into ground level, nothing impressive, but again it's tolerable.What stands out in this game is the wide variety of experiences and factors taken into account for each civilian and situation you encounter.  This game makes the effort to include experiences ranging from stopping people for speeding, broken lights, and swerving suspiciously to tracking a kidnapping or a drug dealer to a specific house, requesting a warrant, then searching the location for the potentially armed criminals and evidence lying around.Personally, I consider it worth buying for $15 or less if you're intrigued and don't mind the graphics or clunky physics of a small indie game.

												This game is pretty amazing for a small team that made it. It is still in the works non stop so there is always rrom for improvement. The team is constantly making new items to make the game fun. A lot of people expected like a grade A quailty and HD grapichs suchs as LCPDFR but if you look past the grapichs aspect about it, This is truly an amazing game. In their recent update notes they stated that they will be adding more missions and more content soon which will keep the game from getting reoative and getting annoying. You serve as an MVPD polce officer and have to keep to the streets of Mountiain Valley safe. While on patrol you can take all sorts of calls ranging anywhere from murders to a sick person. If you don't feel like doing calls you can do regualr traffic patrols too. This game has a lot coming to it, So I would give it a try.			"

												This game has potential and will continue to grow and get better! it was obvious within the first month of release, the creators did very well at fixing major bugs in a timely manor. Although I expect much more out of games like ""10-13"" on Greenlight, this game is by far one of the better Police Sims, it will be good to hold over until the release of 10-13... The only other remark I have is that I think as of where the game state is now it should be 5-10$ cheaper than advertised.			"

												Well, this game has a decent system. But when it comes to AI, I can't say that. So here is my scenario, I pull someone over as my mission, I park my car. I put road cones out. Stupid car behind my suspect, decided he couldn't wait any longer and went around the cones, and T-boned my car. I then lost points and had to pay money to get my car fixed because this guy kept pushing my car down to 14%. I was pretty mad. Due to things like this I have only been able to get to a Sergent rank. Also, apparently I am the only cop in existence. I have no way of getting backup and no way of help breaching a wanted suspect's residence. Could use a lot of improvement.			"

												I think this game is fantastic. We've all wanted to, at some point, be a police officer, driving around town in our fast police cars with sirens and lights blaring, answering calls and getting bad guys. This game tries to fulfill that childhood dream and has done a darn good job at it. Now I know the graphics arent superb, but the game has plenty to offer. Dense customization of your car and house, 7 different police vehicles to date, and the ability to purchase a personal car that you can drive off-duty. You can also attempt to persuade criminals to surrender, taze them, or shoot them in the face with a pistol, a submachine gun, or a fully automatic assault rifle (3rd option is my go to). Also the map is quite large, and split up into several regions.If I were to add/change anything in this game, it'd be as follows: have the ability to call for backup, because as of now you are the only officer in town. Also multiplayer would be nice, maybe even modes where you could play as a cop or a criminal. Also co-op, which would tie in with the ""calling for backup"". Also I would like the mouse sensitivity inside your house to be the same as outdoors, because inside it is really hard to look/turn around. Also different siren sounds would be nice ( I discovered today that pressing F changes the siren to like a phazer :D)And that just about does it. Thanks for reading this review, I tried not to make it too long. Now I must go, for I have criminals to mow down with an assault rifle! >:) "

												The developers had a brilliant idea - let the player be a normal cop, usually taking care of small problems such as illeagaly parked cars, drunk drivers, sometimes getting some risky missions. Unfortunately, the idea is not followed by graphics - it's ok, but looks old - and sounds - which are quite.. poor? Also driving the car, in which you spend most of your day, is completely unrealistic; shooting is a bit too slow; there are not enough missions, everyday you do the same. The game is also full of smaller or larger technical issues, bugs etc. But you know what? I really enjoyed every minute of Enforcer. I really hope that the developers get rid of those problems and - with more money and time - the game might become perfect for those looking forward to playing any other role, than another criminal or special forces soldier.

 Great Idea, Still a WIP Enforcer isn't a perfect game, it gets addictive for a while but then it gets boring. The graphics resemble GTA: San Andreas, but slightly better. The game loses motivation, it's current state is kinda bare essentials. The clothing is pick and choose(liek you have little choice), the UI is modern but still improvable. The city life is not very alive, Npc's don't really have character at all. The Main character barely shows life but this game is fun to play for a little while. I'd give this game a 7/10 in it's current state.			"

												Let's cut to the chase here and say what has to be said: Good potential, bad execution. When I bought this I had expected they would bring me a reasonable 20 euros worthy product but what I got was a prodect that belongs either in early acces or in the ""below 5$"" section. As I started playing this game I thought ""seems to lead up to something"" but slowly as I played more I had grown to hate it. It offers very little freedom in what to do as you can do almost nothing at all. There's very little missions to finish and not even super mario for the nintendo 64 is more repetetive than this game. My typical day in a game like this is: I fill up the useless energy, food, and stress bar that are there for no reason by for one instance meeting up with friends (which you don't actually get to do, the screen just turns black for a moment) for no reason. I go to my closet and click on ""on duty"" below the 5 listed useless options of clothing you could wear when not on duty.  I walk out of my house and step in the car, look at the roads and see about 5 cars behind of each other of which 2 are halfway embedded into the ground, 2 are speeding in the most unrealistic way and 1 is driving like a total (ahum) ""r'tard"" because he/she is probably on alcohol.  I get a mission right away saying a drunk is behaving violently in the park so I go there with sirens and lights on. I drive over a steep mountain (cars in here are like horses in skyrim except they go 150 km p/h) and land on the dirt perfectly. I drive over a lantern pole (gta much) and get to the place. As always there is 2 witnesses and they describe the character, I see the exact matching description, walk up to the guy with my gun and turns out it isn't him, get a penalty for aiming at an innocent. I see the right person and walk up to them with a gun saying freeze and they pull a gun on me, by this time I start shooting the person and by 2 shots in the head the person lays down. Now apparently calling an ambulance will still work out. I get a bonus for shooting someone, and another bonus for shooting the ambulance.There is about a variëty of I think 10 missions intotal in this game and bare in mind that this whole story is a more action packed optimistic version of the actual game, in that way I am making commercial for them for over-appreciating how broken it is. Pro's:-You get to be a cop-Good concept-Driving is so broken it's funCons:-Repetetive-Looks like unfinished product (yet is not in early acces)-Anything you do in this game raises no excitement whatsoeverFinal judgement: 4/10Consumer recommendation:If you're a fan of the police and simulation thing do buy this game, you might actually enjoy it. (but don't get your hopes up) Best is to wait for it to go on sale. If this does not convince you here are some games that are cheaper and way better: Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Mount and blade : warband. These are games I think you might enjoy if this game drew your attention.Producer recommendation: Game should be placed under early acces if this is an unfinished product (and believe me it is). And if you do consider this product finished: Don't ask 20 euros for it, it's a far way from being worth 20 euros.[Update] Recent changes have been made in this game, bugs have been fixed and playing it is not a general dread. Yet as I keep thinking this game should not cost as much as it does, it did turn out into a good game. I did not expect the producers to adress any of the issues since it was never stated it was Early Acces, but I am glad they did it. This is a buy, but only if you like simulation combined with police.Final final recommendation: 6.5/10			"

												Like others have said great idea, but poor execution. I tried really hard to love this game, and did at launch. However, it dawned on me just how little there is to do in the game. It also doesn't help that major things just as driving mechanics have not been addressed. Major features that were advertised seem to have no impact on game play, such as the stress mechanic. One issue I did notice was that when cycling through the graphics settings I was unable to go from ""ultra"" back to low, as the ""ultra"" setting would automatically crash the game on my PC. However, my computer is FAR from a top of the line gaming rig so I will not count that against the game; but it is something to keep in mind though.Overall, poor execution on a game that had a lot of potential, and honestly quite a bit of hype surrounding it all things considered.

												The game is terribly under-developed. The quality of the game would maybe have been satisfactory 12 years ago, and even then, by low to mediocre standards. Very little content, very poor visuals (including animations, which are terrible), and the overall game mechanics are very bad. This is just ridiculous and I deeply, deeply regret making the purchase. I almost feel scammed, even though that's not the case. Almost everything about this game is bad (or at least developed very poorly). The CONCEPT of the game, however, is very interesting, so I'd rate the game 2/10 for that. If this had been pre-alpha, or some teenage game project, I would've understood, but this is just unacceptable.			"

												First things first—the game is pretty good.But I cannot justify giving it a thumbs up in it's current state. Even at the sale price of $10 I'm a little dissapointed. If I had spent $20 I would be mad. Bottom line,  This is a $5 game. If the cars weren't unusually shiny and some better models were used I would like the game MUCH more. It would be nice to see some lighting options as well (traffic director, better flashpatterns), but if that is a big concern for you, maybe LCPDFR is worth the hassle. I think that really sums up the game quite well. It's ok, but if you have any interest in a police sim you're better off with LCPDFR.			"

												Not a bad game at all. Has its glitches here and there but nothing game breaking, just minor things that occure not too often. Has lower gaphics but that doesn't take from the game itself. Controls took a little getting used to but after about 15 minutes you pretty much get the hang of it. I hope the developers will continue to add to this game, it has a lot of potential. Would love to see more regions perhaps as ways to pick where you want to work, like a bustling city instead of just the rural area, perhaps some more buildings to go into, even while on duty like stores, restaurants, ect. Kinda like how real officers do, who eat while on duty or patrol stores. More interaction with NPCs while off duty would be nice, such as building relationships or stopping in at a friends house and actually going to clubs or restaurants. Hopefully they are working on these or will consider it now it's been said. But over all I give this game a 9/10 and a recommend.			"

												I used to think that this game had a lot of potential when the game was released, back when the developers still cared about improving the game's entertainment and simulation aspect. Since early 2015, the game hasn't really received updates that would make the game less buggy and add more realism. Right now, with the type of care that the developers are putting into Enforcer, they are currently all talk but no walk. They promise then postpone repetitively an update that was scheduled for July 2015, the update was supposed to have small extra features. Three months later and still no word on the update's release date or progress. Then the developers even admitted they have no ETA on the update. People shouldn't expect this game to be a simulation; there are a lot of realistic features that aren't included, which makes the game very repetitive.			"

Yes the game is a bit rough around the edges, and will need quite a bit of work going into the future, I can already tell the staff working on this is prepared and dedicated to doing so. Many major bugs have been fixed in the last update and the game is shaping into a fairly good game. So here is a list of Praises and Gripes.Praises:- Great overall concept, very workable ideas- Decent replayability- Dedicated staff- Much potentialGripes: - Animations aren't great- Modeling is slipshod- Driving controls are unbearable- AI are generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pathing is offSo overall I'd reccomend the game, even though I can hardly get someone to pull all the way off the road, it is still a fun game worht the buy.

The company sees a way to get back in favor with the public when policeman >Yourcharacters name< is killed by a street gang. Your body is reconstructed within a steel shell and called RoboCop.And thus everytime you play this game from now on you will be saying lines from the movie and when you stop a drug dealer and he pulls out his gun you will say ""Dead or alive, you're coming with me!""Or when you pull over a car driver who was drunk driving Or stoping people for suspicious activity Or calling ambulences for people who are hurt10/10 Would Robocop again			"

I would've much rather had a smaller, but thoroughly polished game-- than this which tries to do everything but there's such a lack of detail into some of the ideas that have been implemented that it ruins the game.Also, the updates which were promised months ago, still  haven't come.

												This game is great and I am having so much fun with it, although it feels much more like a early early access game then a release.Graphics: 2/10  On high the textures are nice but the overall scale and quality is poor.Dialouge : 0/10 NPC's never talk they just use text and you just use the same 5 phrases over and over and over again.Gameplay: 6/10 Although some stuff is boring I am really enjoying this gameSetting/Story: 2/10  The story as I've seen so far is non-exsisting you have a setup and then nothing more. The city you are based in is very bland and average, red lights also take waaaaay to long to turn green (not that it matters as you can run them at any time) One thing that dissapointed me was you never see another cop and you can't call for backup.What I think they should add:Other police officers around the city to make it not seem like you're the only cop around.Graphics over haulMore customization.Having to check ID's in your squad car to see if they're wanted.Higher chance of traffic stops turning to shootouts.Getting in trouble for arresting people wrongly/ breaking the law yourselfMore diversity of NPC's. I've pulled over the same guy like 30 times.Large scale crimes that require multiple units and SWATOverall the game lacks serious depth hopefully they will add some of these things and it will be a MUCH better game.

												Preemptive tl/dr; Nice concept, bad execution. Looking for realism? Don't buy. Looking for something like <Insert random word> Simulator 2014? Could give you some fun.Got off the bus near my house in the middle of the night, it's raining and I've just got a shirt and hotpants on, should've planned that better. Got a squad car in my rather crappy yard, suppose it's my colleagues wanting to greet me. Turns out it isn't, it's my own personal squad car with a never ceasing stream of chatter through the comm radio. Nevermind, I better go to bed instead. I enter my house and I feel the sudden urge to charge through the living room at full speed, I must've looked like a malformed gorilla with my freakishly large arms waving about. Oh well, at least no one saw me, I'll go to sleep now, wake up fresh for my shift tomorrow.I decide to take a cab to the station, seeing as I can't use the squad car in my yard. They all look funny at me when I arrive, I'm apparently not supposed to check in here at my shift, they tell me to just get changed back home and drive out, they'll assign me as I go. But they graciously enough let me check my e-mail on the computer and offer to sell me ammunition for 100 bucks. Seems kind of strange to me, at my previous assignment they equipped us with that kind of stuff for free. Oh well, note to self: Don't shoot too much.Once again I call the cab to drive me home. I check my wardrobe and there it is! My uniform, a handgun, a sub-machine gun and a tazer. Ready for all eventualities. I go out and enter my car, start it up and tries to back out the entrance to my rather crappy yard. This car handles like a rhino, at least when backing. But at least it accelerates quickly, I went from 0-110km/h in like 2 seconds. No one really cares when I speed past red lights on the sidewalk in 110. The perks of being a cop.First mission! Catch four speeders with the radar. Well that's ironic. Anyway, I drive out a bit away from town. If I should really call it town, more like a glorified block. I set up near a slope, that way they don't see me until it's too late. I go to get my radar and holey moley! There's tons of radars and cones in my car. I resist the urge to litter the entire area with radars and decide to just place two instead. That proves to be quite a difficult task though as the radar keeps falling over when I try to put it on the ground. After some effort and planning I manage to get a couple up anyway. A couple of people speed by, the radars automatically issues them a ticket, that's awesome tech. Suddenly this big freakin' truck comes wobbling across the road, I yell for him to stop the vehicle. He swerves into the side of my squad car and stops. I proceed to tell him to exit the vehicle and promptly does a breathalyzer test on him. He's clean. I'm pretty suspicious about the guy though so I ask for compliance, I frisk him and check his ID as well as the plates on the car. Nothing, he's clean, the truck is clean. Oh well, gotta let him go. It's not like I gotta pay the damage on my squad car by myself. Right?... Wrong. I call dispatch and they tell me to be more careful and charge me 600 bucks. I mean, c'mon.As I walk back to my freshly repaired car, dispatch calls about a kidnapping. I'm so all over that. I get in my car, blaze my sirens and drive around aimlessly. Where am I supposed to go? I start asking people if they've seen anything suspect. No one has. Dispatch calls again, says they have a possible location. 10-4. As I watch my GPS I realize that when I switch the settings from ""mini-map"" to ""overview map"", the map is rotated so they don't look the same. Very unintuitive gear they assign here. Oh well, I manage to find my way at least. I get out my car and draw my gun, I feel my adrenaline pumping. In panic I realize I can't crouch with my gun drawn, I simply can't! I'll have to manage anyway. I see them, a girl lying on the ground and a fat white guy just stands there, looking at me, before I get the chance to tell him to get on the ground, he pulls out a gun. I shoot him in the chest. He staggers but is still alive, he points the gun at me and I shoot him again, right in the chest. He staggers again but he's still standing! What kind of beast is this?! I pop off two more bullets in his chest and stomach. Still standing. One final shot and he's down. Mission complete. 200 points to me. I call an ambulance and they take both the perp and the victim away. No further investigation needed. That's efficient policework. I grab his gun from the ground and get back to stopping cars. There seems to be A LOT of drunk drivers here. One of them swerves right towards me, I panick, my life flash before my eyes and I prepare for permadeath. He crashes straight into me and comes to a complete stop, I didn't even flinch. Seems like I'm made of some tough stuff. I arrest him then I go home to sleep. Busy day.			"

												I have never left a review on a game since iv had steam, But being a Cop sim lover this game is awesome. i just wished id bought it along time ago. if you like cop sims. or like gta cop mod or like playing cop on arma 2 or 3. then this is a great game. its not just all about being a cop you also have goals as a off duty cop to work toward. like buying a car. or fixing up ur house with new stuff or going out with ur mom or friends, and you also on duty have the goal to work toward being a better cop so you can go up in rank and unlock new stuff such as cop cars. The main goal im getting at is if uv been thinking about getting this game but just dont know yet. then take my word i was the same way and im very happy i got this game.			"

												This is a Police simulator in the style of GTA. I say Simulator because it can get repetitive with your main duties are traffic stops with the uncommon mission of assaults and drug dealers providing some excitement.I played a character in Hardcore (can't be revived from death) for a bit more excitement and got gunned down by some drug dealers which I wasn't careful enough to secure before arresting.I picked this game up for free as part of a website's promotion, but it would still be entertaining if you can pick it up for less than $10.Some tips on the game, get yourself a TV and Couch, watching TV restores stress and energy so you don't need to sleep. You can finish your shift at home at your closet, this will save you the $20 and taxi ride home.			"

												Well, this game has a decent system. But when it comes to AI, I can't say that. So here is my scenario, I pull someone over as my mission, I park my car. I put road cones out. Stupid car behind my suspect, decided he couldn't wait any longer and went around the cones, and T-boned my car. I then lost points and had to pay money to get my car fixed because this guy kept pushing my car down to 14%. I was pretty mad. Due to things like this I have only been able to get to a Sergent rank. Also, apparently I am the only cop in existence. I have no way of getting backup and no way of help breaching a wanted suspect's residence. Could use a lot of improvement.			"

The graphics, driving physics, as well as the traffic ai have also been improved. The game is quite entertaining. For those who are wondering, the developers have not abandoned the game. How do I know this? Because new screenshots have been released recently (as of October 2015) that show upcoming updates for the game. This game is great.

												Not a bad game at all. Has its glitches here and there but nothing game breaking, just minor things that occure not too often. Has lower gaphics but that doesn't take from the game itself. Controls took a little getting used to but after about 15 minutes you pretty much get the hang of it. I hope the developers will continue to add to this game, it has a lot of potential. Would love to see more regions perhaps as ways to pick where you want to work, like a bustling city instead of just the rural area, perhaps some more buildings to go into, even while on duty like stores, restaurants, ect. Kinda like how real officers do, who eat while on duty or patrol stores. More interaction with NPCs while off duty would be nice, such as building relationships or stopping in at a friends house and actually going to clubs or restaurants. Hopefully they are working on these or will consider it now it's been said. But over all I give this game a 9/10 and a recommend.			"

												This is a pretty good game, however it could use a lot of work. They still need to add AI backup, character customization, moer crimes(bank robberies, shootouts, ect), and a better system when you pull someone over. Once these things are added, I would highly recommend the game, but right now it's not the best it could be for a police game and without AI backup, it kind of feels empty. As of now, I would give it a ""buy"".			"

												This game has a lot of bugs and very bad graphics, There aren't many customization options and the ones that exist look terrible. When you buy ammo it doesn't say you have more magazines and you still have the same amount of magazines you have,If the game gets patched or reworked to become more better maybe I'll recommend it.

												There are a lot of things I like about this game, and of course quite a few things that could be improved - but overall - it's kept me entertained.  I'd like to see a little more variety in tasks. It'd be good to iron out a few little visual bugs - like when someone gets out of a vehicle - there's still someone sitting inside, or when you tell someone they're free to go, and they still stand there gormlessly. An auto-rest option would be good - as it's pretty repetitive at the end of a shift to have to go home and watch the tv 4 times. The directing traffic option does nothing other than make you look silly. It's a good base game - has a lot of positives going for it - but if ever there's a version 2 - could do with a lot of improvement. If you just like the idea of cruising around in a police car issuing tickets and catching drunks, it'll keep you happy.			"

												Two years in, it's time to change my review. When Enforcer was released, it didn't have GTA:V's LSPD:FR mod to compete with, and it was a great concept. Now? It's just a good idea with poor execution. I commend the team for trying something new, and I wish them all the best, but I can't recommend this game. Hopefully they'll return with another attempt.

												At first I thought this game wasn't worth my £7.49 I payed for it. However, the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was. The game does have some good points but I have noticed a few minor errors within the game that should be addressed. First of, there are some mistakes in spellings and grammar. For example in the ""Contacts"" menu, it says ""4+h"" when it should say +4h. Moreover, in a some places the developer has forgotten to add a ""s"" on the end of words.Another issue is that the car picks up speed quite quickly making handeling difficult. Moreover, the speed on the roads need to be increased. On long back roads the speed should be 50 or 60 MPH and not 30 MPH. This gets annoying when the NPC drive really slowly and you are stuck behind them...I am also having an isssue in the car customization and when I change to get on duty where the screen just freezes or I cannot move. I don't know if this is a problem on my side.Right now I just pull over random cars and find many things wrong with them without me even knowing. For example a car looks fine but when my officer goes to speak to them there registration plates are illegal or their brake lights don't work or they are drunk , but from their driving they don't look drunk... The game needs to add more of a realistic feel when pulling over cars. Overall, I would give the game 3.5/5 stars. As far as recomending the game to anyone, I am on a fence. This game still need a lot of work and I don't believe it is worth 15 quid. There are better games out there at around the same price. However, once all of the issues have been addressed then the game would be more fun and seem more realistic. It would be cool instead of making the car teleport to the station you could see the actual tow truck or prisoner transport show up and take them. The map also needs to be faced the right way as you do not know how many times I have taken a wrong turn due to the oreintation of the map.The game came out on the 24th October 2014. Right now it is the 9th April 2015. So I'm wondering what the developer has done as the game still feels as a Pre-release or Alpha version and not the full, final version of the game. The game can be fun but as days progess it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again... Once the car controls have been masterd and most other elements of the games have been ironed out this game can become big! The game is fun at the moment but when new features get added the game will be a lot more. Kudos to the develpors as this is their first shot at PC gaming. Hopefully I don't have to change my review. Also get the game whilst it is cheap (7.49 pounds) as I don't see anyone buying this for 15 quid! Thanks for reading.			"

												This game is absolutely unfinished, unpolished, and frankly broken. A lot of people have been saying that his game has a great idea with poor execution. Customization here is pointless only to just make your house look better. Visuals? I could care less about visuals as long as they dont make it horrible to look at. Here is the problem though, animation quality is terrible and i do get that animations are hard to make. Another extremely major problem here is that this game is marketed as a finished product but what we are presented here is clearly not a finished product. This is not marketed as an early access game as it should be. Sound effects are pretty bad besides a couple that i really do enjoy. The radio sounds are the things i have a problem with because they are taken from somewhere else and used over and over and over and over and over again. Voice acting isnt terrible but there needs to be more of it. Now onto glitches. When cars hit people they dont die........WHAT!? I'm not kidding. People don't die when cars hit them. Rediculous..... Also when i serve a warrant on a suspect's house, if that timer runs out and you kick a door down in his/her home, you will lose career points. That is BS. I see the same modeled person sometimes 2-3 times in one area. There is also very little missions to actually do in this game. When suspects run in this game, they go about 20 yards away from me then do what they were doing like talking on the phone, when THERE IS A COP CHASING THEM. If I was a cop chasing a suspect, they would be running as fast as they could not trying to re-blend in to a small crowd where if i catch up to them again, they pull a gun on me, WTF. This happens literally every single time i chase down suspects like a robbery  suspect, or a man who assisted in murder. There is also no other police units as in you are the only cop around for the shift, you cannot call for backup in a big firefight. I wouldnt have a problem with any of these said things listed above if this game was marketed as an early access title which it clearly is not. This game is not worth $20 because of it being so unbelievably broken with little content with a foundation that is unstable at best.			"

												The best Police Simulator (That is an actual game itself and not a Mod/Add on such as LCPDFR and LSPDFR for GTA IV and GTA V). I found my time in Mountain View as a LEO and Citizen to be very fun and adventures. The graphics are ok but I really dont care for graphics. Aslong as the game has no serious defualts with the graphics, I like it. The controls are good for me, easy to operate and execute a mission with. Takes Police SIms to a whole new level, being able to talk to and actually ask people questions, ID's, Traffic Enforcement, etc. I would recommend this game to anyone intersted in Law Enforcement.

												Love the game, but it has a few small problems.The cars get damaged to quickly, I can't drive in to the gasstation without damaging it.Also, I would like it if I could ticket someone, when they are not in a vehicle, so I can tow the vehicle and also ticket the civ.Still, the game is allot of fun, Really like the simplicity and also the good and fun gamplay, the controls are sometimes a bit akward though, and I can't seem to change the camera view when not in a vehicle.7/10- EDIT  DECEMBER 2015 -Allright after many months I have decided to give this game a thumbs down because the call the game finished (its not) and because updates have been to slow, its not worth 20 euro's. I'm not saying that the developers are bad, because they do respond to questions, but it is just not enough.Driving is still anoying and it still has it fair share of bugs.If they improved the controls, fixed all the bugs and added more content I might be willing to change my verdict again. Right now it's not worth more then 5 euro's.5/10			"

												If you are a fan of the LCPDFR mod for GTA IV, this is a must have game! It has all of the elements of the mod but into its own game and quite a nice one at that. The cars have different models and I like how you have a life outside of being a police officer as well. However, you have to carry out different tasks (such as eating and sleeping)  in order for your character to be happy. I dont really like this part of the game primarily because it takes up a lot of in-game time which leaves you with barely any time to explore. This makes the game feel like a mod for sims.Other than that feature, I actually really like the game! Stopping cars because of speeding or wreckless driving is tedious for some but I for one could play this for hours at a time! This may deter you from the game but so be it, if you get bored of repeating the same actions then you will get bored of this game! The game is great and really has potential of what could be added to it like multiplayer, such as ""cops and robbers"" themed games. Love it!			"

												I usually don't vote no on recommendation for games, but I feel I should for this one. It's not that it's just completely horrible, it's not. However, the game controls are really hard to use and the movement/action of the character is not smooth by any twist of the word. I just find it so aggravating and tiresome trying to play this game because my character ends up doing things I don't want him to do or I can't figure out how to do something.On the flip, the idea behind the game is good. I like the police simulation theme and a lot of the ideas behind traffic stops, speed traps, responding to calls, etc. is really cool. But when I spend the whole (in-game) day trying to do only one of those, the game needs some work. I'm sure if you put enough time and effort into this game, you may get good at it and might actually enjoy it but the learning curve is crazy with this game. I'm sorry but I don't recommed this game.			"

												Review Edit: I have to say this game and the developers have lost my interest! They've been talking about updates for months and yet nothing! They even stopped giving a time frame for the update. Sadly this game had died at the hands of the developer. I no longer recommend this game.I highly recommend this game!! It's simple to understand and use but highly addictive!! I can't stop playing once I start!			"

												Well i think this is the best police simulator, it was very detailed about their jobs and etc in everydaybut yes, the poor graphics and the controls was too difficult especially when driving or shooting criminalsThe funny is, even the best settings would make this game runs at low fps. And yes the best settings doesnt make any difference for ""making better"" of the poor graphics.Do i recommend this game? no, even for free. Hopefully the devs would remake this game, especially about the graphics			"

												This is a Police simulator in the style of GTA. I say Simulator because it can get repetitive with your main duties are traffic stops with the uncommon mission of assaults and drug dealers providing some excitement.I played a character in Hardcore (can't be revived from death) for a bit more excitement and got gunned down by some drug dealers which I wasn't careful enough to secure before arresting.I picked this game up for free as part of a website's promotion, but it would still be entertaining if you can pick it up for less than $10.Some tips on the game, get yourself a TV and Couch, watching TV restores stress and energy so you don't need to sleep. You can finish your shift at home at your closet, this will save you the $20 and taxi ride home.			"

												I AM SO♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF. I stuck up for this game! Thinking that it was going to be a great cop game! You know? Go around the town, stop crimes, stuff like that? THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE SINGLE NEW ADDITION TO THE WHOLE GAME. I am so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because I bought this game when it was literally starting out! I did a completely different review saying ""Buy this game! It will be great when it's finished!"" but NO! Do NOT buy this game! If you are looking for a good cop game, go buy GTA V and download the LSPDFR mod for FREE. It has a lot more content then this! This you will literally pull people over, ticket them, arrest them, let them go, maybe once and a while get a call out to search a house, stop a drug bust or drunk guy or go do a kidnapping. That is it though! There are no awesome shoot outs or chases! The physics suck so bad to! Your car feels like paper but takes off like a jet airplane! There are some good things but I am so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that this game hasn't been developed at all! Due to the fact I have played this game and loved it before till now, I give this game a 3/10! It has some fun things to it but due to it's lack of content, same missions, no plot what so ever besides your a cop out in this town just because and the physics and graphics sucks just doesn't hold it up. STAY AWAY. Recommendation for a cop game: Go buy GTA V, look up on youtube LSPDFR and there is a perfect cop game.			"

												EDIT: Abandonware... THey built a good foundation and then killed it before they did any updates or upgrades to make it really good. Lame.Bought it yesterday and have been avoiding the family ever since. Loving it so far. Lots of room to explore. I like customizing the house and just tooling around looking for infractions. Missions are pretty good too. A few things though. Right now, since this is in Alpha there isn't much diversity in the things to do. Customizing the house, other than buying a tv and sofa seems to do nothing for you. The missions can be a little repetitive and occasionally you'll get 5 missions in a row and other days you'll get nothing. Controlling the car can be a little tricky but not too bad. For some reason, almost everyone on the road is drunk which makes it easy to find bad guys and level up.Putting these things aside and remembering that this is a brand spanky new game, it is a great bit of fun with infinite potential. If you want a realistic view of police life, I have to think this is a pretty good simulation that will keep getting better.By the way, the developers just posted pics from the next update on their Facebook page... looks like we're getting a police motorcycle soon :)			"

												If you like a simple police game, this is for you. While yes, the physics are not the best, and it can be a bit clunky at times, it is very enjoyable. This game requires a considerable amount of concentration as most of the crimes appear as glitches (swerving cars, no headlights), but if you can master the signs you will be fine.I would say I reccommend the game, however do not be fooled by the DEV team. It really does not seem that the developers have ANY intent on developing further.			"

												At first I thought this game wasn't worth my £7.49 I payed for it. However, the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was. The game does have some good points but I have noticed a few minor errors within the game that should be addressed. First of, there are some mistakes in spellings and grammar. For example in the ""Contacts"" menu, it says ""4+h"" when it should say +4h. Moreover, in a some places the developer has forgotten to add a ""s"" on the end of words.Another issue is that the car picks up speed quite quickly making handeling difficult. Moreover, the speed on the roads need to be increased. On long back roads the speed should be 50 or 60 MPH and not 30 MPH. This gets annoying when the NPC drive really slowly and you are stuck behind them...I am also having an isssue in the car customization and when I change to get on duty where the screen just freezes or I cannot move. I don't know if this is a problem on my side.Right now I just pull over random cars and find many things wrong with them without me even knowing. For example a car looks fine but when my officer goes to speak to them there registration plates are illegal or their brake lights don't work or they are drunk , but from their driving they don't look drunk... The game needs to add more of a realistic feel when pulling over cars. Overall, I would give the game 3.5/5 stars. As far as recomending the game to anyone, I am on a fence. This game still need a lot of work and I don't believe it is worth 15 quid. There are better games out there at around the same price. However, once all of the issues have been addressed then the game would be more fun and seem more realistic. It would be cool instead of making the car teleport to the station you could see the actual tow truck or prisoner transport show up and take them. The map also needs to be faced the right way as you do not know how many times I have taken a wrong turn due to the oreintation of the map.The game came out on the 24th October 2014. Right now it is the 9th April 2015. So I'm wondering what the developer has done as the game still feels as a Pre-release or Alpha version and not the full, final version of the game. The game can be fun but as days progess it feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again... Once the car controls have been masterd and most other elements of the games have been ironed out this game can become big! The game is fun at the moment but when new features get added the game will be a lot more. Kudos to the develpors as this is their first shot at PC gaming. Hopefully I don't have to change my review. Also get the game whilst it is cheap (7.49 pounds) as I don't see anyone buying this for 15 quid! Thanks for reading.			"

												not a terrible game, I appreciate it is quite realistic ( despite skipping cutscenes where the tow truck tows the cars away, or the police van takes the criminals away ) and replacing them with 2-3 second black screens. As well, vehicle handling, in my opinion is nearly impossible. 0-150 KM/H in 3 seconds? and slowing down.... good luck braking from 150, because when you do, you will lose control of your vehicle, and likely hit a few cars, damaging your police car, forcing you to waste your earned in-game money, and losing score to call a tow truck to fix your car that was damaged beyond believe upon hitting a no parking sign. Until this update comes out, that was promised mid-July, but no notice has been given as to why, in early August, there is still no update. Unless the update covers the biggest issues I can find in this game, such as vehicle handling, ( which also makes it impossible to get into a good position to arrest drug dealers ) this game is lacking. As well, I have seen a few bugs so far, such as people walking over my police car ( yes, they litterally jump up, walk over the roof, down onto the hood, and keep talking on their cell-phones like nothing happened ) or stuck spinning around behind some vehicle they constantly keep walking into. You have alot of work to do devs, and if you ever manage to release the much-awaited, and promised update, I will be happy to revise my review. But until then, I do not recommend this game.			"

												At the current price tag of 20 euros I cant recomend this game, maybe in a steam sale for less .The game has a very good idea but thats about it, it has a lot of cons so lets start with the good things to soften the blow-Pros,-Good idea-certain mechanics like random ""special"" assignments add a bit of flavour to a rather bland game-It runs on a low spec PC (Due to horrible graphics :)-Cons,-HORRIBLE graphics-Repetitive on duty tasks-Off duty tasks and activities add absolutly nothing to the game. (Could have been better for you to always be on duty, in my opinion.)-To go off duty, if you are in a remote region you must pass through other regions to get to the police station, you will get assigned rutine missions as you pass through each sector. This might not seem like a problem to you now but when you start to get into the game you will find it very anoying.-Firefights are very random, example: Stop a normal car on a rutine alchohol check, car stops, driver gets out and starts running away, i persue the driver through the streets, she stops, turns around and puts hands in the air, I tazz her (my bad) and she just pulls out a gun, pumps me full of lead and BUM! Im in the hospital.This game had a lot of potential but franckly is not worth your time.-P.S: Game stopped working when I stop civilian vehicules, the keyboard is disabled and I cant do anything. Left me with a bad feeling, I cant play it anymore!			"

Once these things are added, I would highly recommend the game, but right now it's not the best it could be for a police game and without AI backup, it kind of feels empty.

												Like others have said great idea, but poor execution. I tried really hard to love this game, and did at launch. However, it dawned on me just how little there is to do in the game. It also doesn't help that major things just as driving mechanics have not been addressed. Major features that were advertised seem to have no impact on game play, such as the stress mechanic. One issue I did notice was that when cycling through the graphics settings I was unable to go from ""ultra"" back to low, as the ""ultra"" setting would automatically crash the game on my PC. However, my computer is FAR from a top of the line gaming rig so I will not count that against the game; but it is something to keep in mind though.Overall, poor execution on a game that had a lot of potential, and honestly quite a bit of hype surrounding it all things considered.

												I've bought this game back in early 2016 when it was on sale for $9.99, so basically 50 percent off. I bought this game because it was police oriented and was suppose to be like a police simulator. WRONG. It's a decent game at first and you will enjoy the first hour or so of gameplay, before all the bugs/glitches/bad mechanics become annoying. The game costs $20! It should be the greatest police simulator I've played. But it's not. The game is entirely full of bugs and glitches. Too many for me to explain. But there are glitches while driving, a bug where you can shoot and the bad guys shoot you before you can even react, and sometimes it doesn't even load properly.Do I recommend this game? No. Why? For the same price, or even less with discounts and sales, you could buy Grand Theft Auto 4. Why am I recommending GTA4? I assume that if you are looking at this game because of the fact that you want to play a police simulator type of game. There is a mod available for GTA4 called LCPDFR, it basically turns GTA4 into the best police simulator out there. And the fact that you can mod GTA4 to add new guns like the Glock 17 or cars like Crown Victorias make it so much better. And there are mods like ELS which add a more extensive lighting system. For the same price of this game! It's basically a no-brainer. I also have decided to spend the full $19.99 for GTA4, and it's a dream! I have since played it and it works great with my machine. I do have to say though, if you have a low specification computer, GTA4 might not be the game for you, but check out the minimum specs to see if you qualify to play it.Recap: Don't buy this game, it's badly optimized and a complete mess. I recommend GTA4 as a substition for the same price.			"

												Bad boys! Bad boys! Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you! I am a huge fan of the TV Show COPS and while this game still has a long way to go in graphics and story. This game gives me both the good and bad side of being a cop while still leaving out more boring parts. I think it's just funny and fun to play but you can have your own opinons.			"

												*************DO NOT BUY! THIS IS AN UNFINISHED GAME AND THE DEVELOPERS CLOSED THE STUDIO. NO FUTURE UPDATES! WAIT FOR POLICE 10-13 TO LAUNCH!!!************The game is actually very entertaining. You just have to go into it with an open mind that it is still in the works, otherwise all the bugs will irritate you. As of now, everything is pretty routine.  As of now, it's like a mobile game, in the respect that it is just sort of a time killer. Not something you will spend all day playing, but it is fun for a few hours.If you like 3rd person games, and a police simulator that is actually pretty in-depth, I do suggest picking this up. Hopefully, it can only get better. They have already patched some irritating issues, like the invisible jumps in the middle of the road that send you into the sky for a meet and greet with jesus christ himself.What can you do?1.) Stop cars and check registration / Administer breathalizer2.) Use NYC's stop and frisk policy on random people walking3.) Wait for a call for a suspected murderer, vandalizer, thief, or assault.4.) Set up a radar and sit back collecting 30pts per speeder.5.) Go home, pay $5 to your fridge to eat, take a shower, watch tv, go to sleep.6.) Rank up with points, which unlocks free new cruisers. (Better top speeds.... Goodluck staying on road and stopping.)The main bugs that hurt are:The randomly disappearing objects, such as a person you are in a foot chase with, or a car that you are attempting to stop. (Mainly because it gets out of range when you try to turn around your charger that steers like a battle tanker)Random gun jams on your weapon. The gun sometimes just doesn't fire, which leaves you clicking fast and sometimes unloading a full magazine into somoenes face.You cannot relieve stress fast enough. If you try to go out with friends and good ol mom in one day, you get penalized for being off duty too long. And a shower only gives VERY little relief.Cars can, and will run into you.

												This game was the game which really pumped me up. I'd been wanting a proper police simulator / game all my life, and finally I had it. I have played it a lot, and never seemed to get bored. All the time the developers posted new updates, features and new content. It was *AWESOME*.... while it lasted. Suddenly, with no prior warning or message, the developers had seemingly abanadoned the project, leaving an unfinished game with tons of bugs. It really had potential, but I guess the developers didn't care. Thanks for nothing. >:(			"

However the police radio sound is so old compare it to gta III . they are the same, i am sorry it isnt the best i feel if you gave it to someone else with more professional experience it can be 10x better. I do want to see a game like this but in variations of what you can be like more than a police officer, like paramedic or firefighter you know, like sims but gta gameplay id like to say. if this were to be something like that it would be very expensive obviously but this is just poor effort			"

												Update: 9/29/2016Stopped playing after devs stopped updating. It was fine for a little but since updates stopped coming the game has gotten boring.  I can no longer recommend this game.  Sorry...I only played two shifts so far but I am addicted.  Here is my report of the first two days.Day One: I started the shift out finding illegal parked cars and writing tickets.  I spent about two hours (game time) doing this when I received a call from dispatch stating there was a report nearby of two people vandalizing a building.  I then turned on my lights and sirens and sped to the location where the report was.  At first I did not find anything as I approched people to gather more information two indvidivauls, a male and female, began to run from me.  I pursued the male on foot calling out to him to him that I was the police and to stop!.  After about a 20 mins foot chase (game time) He finally gave up and I found drug paraphernalia on him and subsequently arrested him.  I radioed dispatch for a van to come take him away to jail.  I then went back to the scene of the crime and found the female not too far away.  She gave up immediately.  I took her into custody and transported her back to the police station.  End of shiftDay 2:I started off doing speed traps on a rural road for about 3 hours (game time) when I got a transmission from dispatch about a theft that just occured.  I turned on my lights and sirens and arrived at scene to a crying female.  I interviewed her and she gave me an accurate discription of the suspect that took her purse.  I subsequent search of the area I found the male traveling west on the southern most road of town.  I stopped him and idetified myself and he gave up.  I found drugs and further evidence on this subject.  I arrested him and took him to the police station.  After I cleared I noticed a car traveling and a high rate of speed and swerving back and forth.  I activated my lights and sirens and pulled over the car.  The driver was IDed and found that there was problems with his documentation.  I tickted him and cleared the traffic stop.  I then received a call from dispatch of suspcious drug actvity in town.  I then arrived and found the suspected person in the middle of a park.  I walked slowly towards him and IDed myself as a police officer.  The defendeant then pulled a firearm on me and shot twice.  I pulled my service weapon, shot and killed him.  I then called an ambulance to come and clear the scene.9/10  Would kill drug dealers againRe-Edit to the trolls* To those trolls who say 1.8 hours.

												I won't complain to much, coinsidering I got this game for $2.17, which is about the right price. I definitely think this game should've been a F2P. And here's why:1. The physics are awful. In same cases you have to go all ""GTA"" on the criminals in vehicles, but oh my. Cars will flip for no reason, two cars can end up getting glitched together, and the speed, braking and turning is just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.2. ♥♥♥♥ing good luck on foot! Every NPC who chooses to run from you runs at least 1.5x your speed if not 2x. In most cases you can get them to comply by pressing C (default button). And if that doesn't work, you must press the comply button while aiming a pistol or taser with the crosshairs directly on the suspect. If you can even ♥♥♥♥ing do it. The aiming is horrendous. Worst I've ever seen. So if a suspect starts to run from you, might as well just forget that mission. 3. Probably the thing that's most irritating is the amount of armed suspects. And it's usually almost always predictable. Not but just 30 mins prior to this comment I was playing. It had me do 3 missing persons cases. Each one was the exact same situation in the exact same area, in the exact same house, with the exact same outcome. 1 house down from the players house, injured lady (missing persons), armed male suspect, door opens upon asking. No need for warrent to open or kick down. Drug dealer's are always armed and open fire on you. Which most drug dealers might be armed, but I personally think it's a little unrealistic.4. Lack of any other law enforement. You are eapparently the ONLY COP in this city. NO back up at all.Now I will close this by saying: This game definitely had potential. But the devs seem to have abandoned it. Which really sucks, if they were to fix just these 4 core issues and maybe upped the graphics just a little, this game wouldn't be half bad and maybe worth $10. And nothing pisses me off worse than a dipping dev. Releases a half♥♥♥♥♥ barely finished game, takes the money, dips out on the game and it's community. Especially after the DayZ stunt, really proves some devs out there are just scamming. I may continue to play just to get my police simulator fix. But as soon as Police 10-13 comes out, I will log into my Enforcer PCA career, retired, unintall game, install Police 10-13, be glad I spent less that $3 for this game. So I recommend if you want to try this game, get it off of G......2........A's website. It's not worth more than $5.			"

Which really sucks, if they were to fix just these 4 core issues and maybe upped the graphics just a little, this game wouldn't be half bad and maybe worth $10. And nothing pisses me off worse than a dipping dev. Releases a half♥♥♥♥♥ barely finished game, takes the money, dips out on the game and it's community. Especially after the DayZ stunt, really proves some devs out there are just scamming. I may continue to play just to get my police simulator fix. But as soon as Police 10-13 comes out, I will log into my Enforcer PCA career, retired, unintall game, install Police 10-13, be glad I spent less that $3 for this game. So I recommend if you want to try this game, get it off of G......2........A's website. It's not worth more than $5.			"
