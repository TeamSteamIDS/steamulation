												Very similar to the newer Jagged Alliance games like JA: Back in Action and JA: Crossfire, in that it is a real-time with pause tactical action game. As other reviews mention, the tutorial is not particularly helpful beyond teaching you the most very basics of the controls, but I think most of the issues come from a bad localization, aside from a few irritating bugs. Quite difficult to get a hang of, but rewarding to master, and in my opinion deeper than aforementioned Jagged Alliance titles. As a bonus it runs great on newer machines and resolutions, even laptops.			"

												Squad-based tactical wargame, with the very complicated and realistic engine, one of the best in the whole genre.It’s been more than 10 years after the first release of the E5, but up to this moment, you can’t find better gaming experience, when we speak about tactical shootouts “like in the Jagged Alliance”. Sadly, but all this richness on the battlefield goes with considerable amount of bugs, and total insolvency of ""Brigade E5"" in all gameplay aspects except from shooting.E5 New Jagged Alliance was designed as an heir to Jagged Alliance 2, in the country where JA2 is still have one of the biggest fan bases in the world – in Russia. Another one country in that short list is Germany, and there was successful and almost successful alike gaming projects as well… But let’s return there to the E5 title. In short, it is the first attempt of the amateur team of programmers to make “our own JA2 with smart enemies and blondes”. Surprisingly, they succeeded! No, they don’t build a perfect starship which can take all humankind to the stars. And even while I’m calling E5: New Jagged Union the game, in fact, it is a bad game. By all criteria, except one. Normally, when we see something like this, we call it “a project” at best, and turning away, because it is not worth neither our time, nor money. But the engine, created by Apeiron team, up to this moment remains the most prominent and complicated in the whole gaming industry. For comparison, the bits that we saw in the overall decent German game Jagged Alliance Back In Action, are that simple and rigid, so, for one, yeah, almost every 5-years-old can manage it, for two, it certainly gives not enough challenge for the adult connoisseurs of the genre.I can speak very long on that topic, sorry for taking your time there… Let’s finish now.Why you may buy E5 now? It is certainly not the best game in the list. Yet, if you are an enthusiast who played a lot in the Jagged Alliance and other similar titles, you know how little there was made of them. All the genre of tactical squad-based wargames is a very rare breed. Every approach there having at least a little of playability is worth something. If you have a thing for those games, but not familiar with the any of Apeiron games yet (there was 3: E5, 7.62, and Marauder), I suggest you to start from 7.62 or Marauder. They have more fair tutorials, to get the basics. Believe me, until you get the vibe, like how to move, how to use all the opulence of guns and other stuff (the difference between shooting from the hip and using the scope, for example) – you’ll only see E5 as another low-time wannabe JA2-title. But if you will be knowing how to operate – you’ll find out that that game is a hidden gem.Overall mark is 7/10 – all game components are vague, but the combat is so rich, that I can only ask for more.

												Overall it was a good game at the time, offering many new features that other games lacked. But tons of bugs and poor implementation of some features makes this game inferior to more ""modern"" options such as the sequel 7.62 also available on Steam.I remember playing this game several years ago, just before I got my copy of 7.62 High Calibre. I really like some of the features that Brigade E5 included, such as SPM and the weapons selection and customization. But the game was plagued with a lot of bugs that would make you want to pull your hair out. And even after all of these years, a lack of patches or bug fixes will have the game leaving a sour taste in your mouth.If you like this style of game but want some ""improvements"", I would suggest you get 7.62 High Calibre and install the Blue Sun Mod (BSM) which includes the unofficial patch. That game offers newer graphics and better stability (mostly), newer UI and improvements to previous features, new weapons and locations, and a ton of other stuff.Some of the biggest complaints that I have about Brigade E5:1) When leaving items in the bank vault, for some reason any stacked items disappear. For example, if I have 5 boxes of M882 ammunition in the vault, coming back to the vault after a day or so of game time will cause the stack of 5 boxes to magically turn into one box. This tested same with magazines, armor, weapons, anything that was stacked.2) Your weapons get dirty super-fast, to the point where it's simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For example, just moving from one map sector to another and your weapons can gather up 3-9% dirt. Even weapons that were stored in your backpack and have never been fired will still accumulate dirt rather fast. It's as if your characters are spending several hours a day intentionally crawling through mud and muck, and shoving dirt into their rucksacks for no good reason.3) The bank system itself seems flawed, as your money frequently ""gets stolen"" when the bank is robbed. Doesn't matter if you had $5,000 or $500,000 in the bank, every few days it seems a robbery makes all that cash go poof. So while the thought of earning interest is tempting, the risk of losing it all makes it useless.4) The lack of a centralized storage method means you'll often times be hauling tons of stuff to the opposite side of the map just to drop off equipment that you plan to save for future merc hires. And if you need to equip new gear for a specific mission, that still means a lot of walking. When combined with the above-mentioned vault bug, you're pretty much better off just selling everything you're not currently using and buying it when you do need it (if it's even available).5) Enemies tend to spawn in or glitch through terrain, sometimes placing them in locations where they can shoot you easily yet you can't seem to hit them at all. Or enemies that ""hide"" inside of terrain making it impossible to hit them, but they can drop out and shoot you in the nuts when they're good and ready.6) Hired mercs give absolutely zero warning when their contracts are about to end. You'll be marching down the road to your next mission objective when suddenly they say they're leaving, give you no time to extend their contract. At least in 7.62 HC the game will pause and a warning message pops up informing you that they'll be leaving in 24 hours, which gives you plenty of time to either extend their contract or at least drop them off in a location where they can be easily found later should you choose to rehire them.I guess I could actually keep going on and on with bugs, flawed game mechanics, etc. And that's likely because I am fairly biased towards 7.62 HC after having played it for a while. My general opinion is that Brigade E5 was a decent game at the time, and showed a lot of potential. If you're a fan of 7.62 High Calibre already, or just a fan of the Jagged Alliance games, you should play at least a few hours of Brigade E5 even if solely as a means of education and novelty.In regards to my recommendation to play the game, I'll say yes it's worth playing, even if just to see for yourself.

												Raw experience. Only for absolute fans that are still hungry for tactical games.Combat is great, best real time with pause combat I ever played in my gaming life. Most games with RTwP is just a mess.But here, combined with fragile characters make the game intense.No handholding, don't feel bad when you read the only avaliable walkthrough in the whole internet.

												To adress the main complaint, Yes the tutorial sucks I'll admit I had a tough time figuring it out I'll be honest the game is not friendly to newcomers however when you get the hang of it with some patience it isnt all the bad and you might enjoy it. It does have its issues aside from the tutorial, enetering buildings and controling the camera inside also sucks tand the second floor will disappear but not a bug! Just slow down on the mouse and if you lose your character press E and it will go to a first person type view then slowly move the camera other then that I like it just give the game a fair chance! P.S. an hour isnt long enough to figure it out keep that in mind with the other reviews.			"

												I know this game and i am suprised to see it in steam. Apeiron (developer company) is now history, vanished due bankruptcy and ""we-dont-care-go-away"" publisher 1C. But this game is gold. Solid history (kill the dictator, kill the general, kill the smuggler...Or join one of them. Or try to be a tripple-agent), intresting quests and possibility to play around with guns and equipment - a heaven for JA fan. Furthermore, E5 is a base for fan-made modifications, like Blue Sun, Bonus Mod etc, wich can entirely change game process and appereance. But my favorite part is High Caliber with more decisions to make, more fractions to deal with and more ways to make money. Also a lot of big mods (For instance - Hard Lide addon and Blue Sum mod from R@S) add  a lot of intresting quests , weapons => tactical decisions. The only thing,that cant be changed - AI. Sometimes its awfully stupid "

												If you're a 7.62 high caliber player, you might be asking why you would bother getting this when it just looks like an early tech demo for 7.62It is infact, the superior game as far as mechanics are concerned. E5 is woefully unpolished, it has bugs (not game-breaking thankfully) and the story is incomprehnsible and the graphics are worse, but it has several features that make it a better play than its sequel.For one thing, the town maps are more varied and actually feature large numbers of ENTERABLE BUILDINGS with multiple floors and rooms, that the AI will fight you in, as opposed to 7.62s hodepodge of jungle lanes and concrete blob maps with maybe 3 buildings with one room in the entire game. This CQB element can be frustrating, but rewarding as it adds a new and welcome dimension to the gameplay.Secondly, suppressive fire actually works in E5. AI will drop the ground and lose accuracy under barrages of fire, a feature which claims to exist in 7.62 but is actually absent when you examine it.And for such an unpolished game, it surprisingly has less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going on than 7.62, dont have to worry about AI magically appearing through walls behind you here, if they're in a building, they're either coming out, or you're going in.

												well this is a great game but it has some flaws and crashing issues. this is what jagged alliance back in action should have been like.... you get huge amounts of weapons, the ability to modify your weapons with bipods, sights and noob toobs etc.... if you can handle the stuttering and imperfections you will have a good time..... i got this with 7.62 but i want to finish this before i play 7.62			"

												Terrible game full of bugs. I discovered two game breaking bugs even before I was able to get through the first fight - a fight that is ridiculously hard from the outset with multiple enemies flanking you immediately and with one wound you will drop your weapon and it's virtually impossible to recover. That's on the off-chance that the game doesn't crash before you die anyway. You would really have to be a masochist to enjoy anything about this.			"

												Combat system is a buggy, unfinished mess overloaded with features just for the sake of it. Bland gameplay and story. Add to this a very steep learning curve and you've got lots of work for no reward in a game which should have been a successor to Jagged Alliance.It promises a lot, delivers little. And most importantly - it's not fun.			"

												Succesor to Jagged alliance if you wish to play a dumbed down type of simular game. Basic, Boring and pointless to play. Really an idiot game?, Thier is no great game engine the tactics are simple and almost removed from the enviroment, besides in the most basic way. This game is of no comparison to Jagged Alliance.

												I hate to give this game a thumbs down as I absolutely love the genre.Indeed, there's probably a teriffic game buried somewhere within Brigade E5. I liked the few bits I could work out. But after five hours' play - including the tutorial - I realised I was more baffled than when I started.Life's too short.			"

												Firstly I am a huge fan of squad based rts games like this, I have played them all.ALL the X-com ALL the UFO ALL the early fallout and ALL the jagged alliance series.This game is the WORSE I have EVER seen. It is a REAL DOG. Laggy buggy hellthe tutorial doesnt even work. Even If it were free it would be a total WASTE of time.It crashes ALL the time, won't load ANY savegames and is that old there will NEVER be ANY fixes or patches.Even though it only cost around 5 bucks it was a total waste of 5 bucks.In short if you like this style of game, forget it. It is the the worse game of ANY kind I haveever wasted money on and that is saying something after over 20 yrs of gameing.DON'T DO IT....  "

												Ive played Man of Prey, another game much like this, which I rate highly, so I really wanted to like this game, but unfortately I felt a little let down.The tutorial is passible, it however isnt very helpful, and not particularly clear to the casual gamer on how it works. I had a few thick moments with it where the game is constantly asking me to hip fire, and i'm wondering why I cant do it. My character was crouched....duh!There's a lot of be had in this and it does feel very much like an unpolished Jagged Alliance, with a lot more NPC interaction and side missions. The combat is a learning curve, and on a strong computer you can feel liek you're a little all over the place if you dont reduce mouse sensitivity.I am willing to give this some more time and I would love to be proven wrong. I however spent my first 1.5 hours trying to get through the first tutorial, and then complete the first area. For the casual gamer, you may feel like banging your head against your desk after an hour of this. For the RTS/RPG dedicated people, there is possibly a great deal of delayed gratification available to you later when you have an established squad. I however didnt have the patience for this.			"

												Do not, under any circumstances, buy this game. The concept seems good enough, it is supposed to be a RPG/""Turn Based"" Tactical Game. Unfortunately the game is so riddled with bugs that I can not test that claim. I tried the tutorial to attempt to learn the somewhat odd control scheme.  Objective 1, knock out the guard and take his key and gun. Done, objective 2, kill the second guard, obje...... wait, I can't complete the 2nd objective! It won't let me attack the guard! It just gives the same useless hint over and over.  So.... buggy?  I restart the tutorial. I make it even less far.  The roof of the building doesn't dissapear after the intro text this time, so I have no way of controlling my character and furthering the game.....   Don't waste your precious money, bandwidth, or hard drive space on this.			"
