Meadowland is the first game of Mårten Jonsson, and more of an art form rather than a game if you ask me. It bears no complexity in gameplay and only serves for an hour's diversion, yet it presents a naively beautiful display of an age old story.As the dawn breaks, our gaze meets with a sleepy valley under the summer sun. There is a pond, a meadow, a bridge hanging between two huts, an old archway and a cliff by the sea... and a storybook residing just above the valley. The utter presence of ultimate peace. And here, out of nowhere, we come in to this pastoral scenery. As many gamers call it to be ""Navi"" - a reference to the fairy companion of Link from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - we take the role of a tiny glowing fairy.As we move our cursor around the environment, the fairy moves around and explores this limited geography, and when we click on it, it sings. Our aim here is to take clues from the storybook scenes and make the fairy sing in the appropriate place, time and condition to make the story progress. For every scene from the storybook we successfully manage to imitate, we observe the next chapter of the tale. These tiny puzzles are not hard to figure out and their results are exceedingly beautiful in a minimalistic way. The environment has its automatic day/night cycle, and the time of the day is directly a piece of the puzzle so you end up waiting for the appropriate time to trigger the event most of the time. There are some other little puzzles that would change this dreamy geography unrelated to story chapters, but they are all details of the end result. The most annoying side puzzle - which reveals the actual ending whence you manage to complete - is finding the half transparent pieces of a photograph concerning the main story around. These pieces appear randomly around the map in different times and stay around only for a couple of seconds, so if you'd like to see the ending event and grab the related achievement, you keep wandering around to catch those annoying pieces.Even with events with slightly annoying triggers, the whole game doesn't take more than an hour - an hour and a half at max - to complete. There is no actual narrative in game, yet there is a poetic narration about the possibilities imagination may hold power over at the end. Ultimately, it is a simple and elegant display with a naive message, open to interpretation by anyone who'd spare that hour.The current price is an exaggeration for the content you'll be getting but the game goes into sale often or even may be acquired via some bundles. For a dollar or so, I can safely recommend the experience as a meditative choice before going to sleep; putting a silent, comfortable smile on your face. I haven't played the developers newer games here around Steam, but I'm told Star Sky also holds great promise and may very well be worthy to check.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												TL;DR: Meadowland is an ""artsy"" exploration game with interesting but ultimately shallow game mechanics that rides with its dreamy expression.Placed inside a dream, you are a faerie who can fly around and sing in the serene, mystical dreamland. What's going on? Game shows you and immediately gets to the action of finding out yourself.User interface is minimal, only telling you how to move and how to sing. As there are no special maneuvers to attempt, the controls are sufficient for flying around: the faerie goes where you click and hold and then sings when you click the faerie.Singing is the main thing you want to do all the time. Singing at right places (and times) induces special events like e.g. rain or flower blooming. There's also a story that only progresses when you sing at the right place at the right time. Flow of time is seen in the celestial motion but all events nevertheless happen exactly at same times each day or night.Unfortunately ""the song"" gets old pretty fast. It is this echoing sigh sound and spamming it doesn't make it any better. On the other hand the music is nice enough not to be annoying but too forgettable to leave a lasting memory.In addition to moving and singing you are only introduced to a huge book, the grimoire. It acts as both the menu (telling you e.g. that F is for fullscreen) and as the clue for progressing the story. You can read the whole (short) story at one time and then just come and refresh your memory when you are stuck and bored of exploring the world. Your job is to accomplish the story as depicted by the mysterious tome.Story is hard to explain without spoiling it, so at simplest it could be described as a love story. Your experience may vary as it can be interpreted as a tale of companionship or longing. All the same, it only takes about an hour to figure out the story to its end while looking for the other secrets. That is, if it works correctly for you: on my second try of playthrough I was unable to trigger the story events for whatever reason.While not necessarily partial to the story itself, the secrets are the hidden things to try and find while exploring the dreamworld, many of them worth an achievement. In addition to its namesake, the meadows, you can find ponds, trees, a mountain, a floating island and a sea as well as a couple of celestial and atmospheric features. It's fun to see what you can do and find the various secrets of the dreamland, that is, until you have found the few there are.There's also a mysterious puzzle that took an additional hour of my platime, because I missed it in the first playthrough. These transparent pieces are floating in the air and disappear quickly if not grabbed immediately. For me looking for the puzzle pieces was a chore because they are difficult to notice and they appear only at random times. This being my second playthrough, the progression bug prevented me from experiencing the story for another go so I was even more bored just trying to stumble upon the pieces.Meadowland is a beautiful but short exploration game. It managed to evoke both happy and sad thoughts in me at the end in its presentation of the fleeting nature of dreams. While it's short and gets boring after a while if you can't figure out the way to progress, it's fortunately also very cheap: I'd recommend waiting for at least -50% sale and my recommendation of the game is partly based on the small price. After all, you'll probably get only 1-2 hours content of various quality out of it, less if you are not going for 100% completion.			"

												It is a pretty game, but it could be prettier. You have to complete tasks (click on your fairy at the right place during the right time of day or night), and was mostly spent waiting for the time of day to change so I could click on the fairy. This wouldn't be so bad if it was more beautiful. It's also not the kind of  thing I'm going to go back and play, as one play-through was more than enough. Also, upon completing the game I felt it wasn't very rewarding, and nothing really happened.			"

												This was a very nice, relaxing game. There isn't really a lot to it on the surface. You basically fly around as a butterfly or something (who everybody is referring to as Navi lol) singing little butterfly songs and essentially unlocking stuff. Your song helps to create events which further the progress along. The story itself is a minimalist as can be. Basically it is really the representation of a short poem/musing about the limitless possibilities of dreams. You probably wont get that during the game itself necessarily, but the message will be conveyed to you in the end.Overall, not a bad hour long game, but there is also definitely not much in the way of replay value. Presently, the game is a buck on Steam. That seems to be the right price in my estimation. But it for a buck and enjoy. Spend more and you will likely regret your purchase a little bit.All told, for what is basically concept art/poetry in game form, I give this a straight 6 out of 10. Worth your time, pleasant, but ultimately a one and done.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game.Meadowland is a game where you can explore, yes. But explore what? A tiny map of grassland and little glowing flowers.The quests are not clear enough, all you seem to get is picture pages in a 'Grimore' book. (Which i thought was a spell book for dark magic...?)The sound effects for the fariy gets really annoying after a while, especially when you start to click it in fury of trying to complete this game.Yes, it is relaxing (The sound effects in the background are so calming and realistic) But it is way to complex for a sleepy game.The so called 'Jigsaw pieces' are so transparent in the 'realistic lighting' they are actually invisible. It was really hard trying to find those little buggers, and it spent most of my time up completing the whole jigsaw.But... It is a very cute, and sweet game, and it is almost like a 'poem'. I won't ruin the story, but it is a very cute ending. (If you get passed the first level.) And if you think about it long enough, the whole game is just a bundle of cute.So if you want a small, complex but soothing game to aid you to slumber, this may just be the game for you.- 5/10			"

												I do believe Meadowland was Marten Jonsson's (Star Sky, Star Sky2, But to Paint the Universe) first Steam game.  As a walking simulator (though the player flies) the ambition I feel was to tell a simple visual story with the added elements of a puzzle game.  As a puzzle game the visual clues found in the book are a bit difficult to understand but the story is ""age-old"" of when a boy and a girl meet and fall in love.  Biggest review complaint is about an achievement called ""Tree of Dreams"".  To gain this achievement the player must fly back and forth across the whole landscape (day and night) looking for semi-translucent puzzle pieces, a type of mini-game.  A bit tedious but doable.  No offense intended to Mr. Jonsson but I am glad he steered away from actual puzzle elements in his later games.  His later endeavors are still beautiful art pieces but focus more on the tale being told then gimmicky puzzles.  (Since I own all of this developer's work I do feel I have a little right to comment on an artist's growth in a difficult medium.)    The artwork is very pretty and the music soothing.  If one enjoys this artist's work Meadowland is must for the collection.			"

""Dream with a singing fairy and a blooming meadow""Relaxing exploration flashgame on a very small map. You fly around with your singing fairy. Automatic daytime/nighttime change. Sometimes a little bit boring because you just wait for triggering certain events. Sounds and night vision effects are quite decent. But the puzzle pieces collecting is a pain in the a s s.			"

												You move the mouse cursor around and if you hold the button down the fairy flies toward it. You can make some cute effects happen by flying through things like grass and flowers. Sometimes barely visible puzzle pieces are laying around the place and you can fly over them to pick them up and add them to the puzzle. Day and night slowly cycle continuously. There's some stuff to look at, like the two people that live on islands in the sky. There's a picture book to look at as well.The big question is: What the heck am I supposed to be doing here? There's no real goal or purpose. It's just a fairy on a small map with things happening. See the background to the logo at the top of the page? That's the whole map. The fairy is roughly the size of the star on the far left side. (That may actually be the fairy, since that's the starting point.)Also, the visual effect during daytime makes my eyes lose focus to an extent that is physically uncomfortable. I had to look away from the screen several times.			"

												I quite enjoy this game. The core gameplay consists of exploring the map, discovering its secrets and uncovering the story. A few collectibles can also be found if you take the time to look closely. The charming art, beautiful audio and cute story creates a unique and cozy atmosphere. This game is a pleasant and soothing experience well worth a try.			"

												It's not a game.  Know that going in and you won't be quite so frustrated.  Its a VN with some mouse movement.A poem, as they call it.  There just isnt much to do, really.Bought in a bundle (as almost always) and 4/10 that way, due to the lush graphics.  Play before bed for a nice sleep perhaps.  Its not a game.  Did I mention that?  $4?  No.			"

												There is not much to enjoy in this art-game:Pros- Nice graphics- good music and sound effects (with one exception)- Night/day cycle that looks very good- Interesting changes you can make to the scenarioCons- Gameplay is very limited and slow- Not many things to interact- No real story, which is told without worlds (just a sequence of events)- Short and not very memorableConsidering the time spent on this game, I believe you could use it better with more interesting games, considering the huge amount of games on Steam (or even elsewhere).

												This is not a game rating - this is not a game.My initial curiosity was soon dulled by style, music, sound effects and finally by the 'poem'. Most of these elements can be forgiven if one or more are outstandingly good - for me they were not.I was about to write an in depth look at the different aspects but I honestly do not feel this offering warrants such attention.In closing: Art is subjective and personal.

												Meadowland is a fun little game, definitely worth the small amount of money I paid for it.  It's a puzzle game like no other I've played where your goal is to create the dream land.  You play as a faerie singing songs to create a dream.  Some of the puzzles are a little finicky with your positioning, but they're all fairly straight-forward.  I love that there are a few hidden eggs that aren't directly related to the story line.  Game can progress as quickly or slowly as you want.  A nice slow-paced relaxing game - the end is a little bubble bursting for my taste.  I felt like the ending, while relevant and true, was pretty dour for the mood the rest of the game played out.  Overall, well done imo.			"

												full disclosure: a woodlandfaerietruck is a creature born from a woodland faerie mother and a monster truck father (it does not work in reverse). OH HELL YEAH! its a woodland faerie flight simulator!!! everyone knows the woodland faerie is the second best cryptozoological creature of all time, and know you get a rare opportunity to actually be a woodland faerie!!! you can do all the woodland faerie things like fly around and make trees grow and probably do something with fish (i couldnt find the fish). best of all, if you click on the woodlandfaerie, you get to hear the song of my people! please note that the song is very short and also terrible because we are all very bad musicians.overall i would say that everyone needs to buy this to encourage devs of all ages to make more games about woodland faeries and perhaps even woodlandfaerietrucks. final grade: 14 stars out of 10 minus 3 stars for not having cards =  9 stars highest recommendation			"

												This review is for achievement hunters.This is a game where you fly around and sing to activate various plot progressions. There's about 15-30 minutes of gameplay, and it's not entirely terrible, but if you want to get all the achievements, there are two that will prove difficult, if not impossible:1. Tree of Dreams. After you've played the game in its entirety, there are puzzle pieces that you have to find. The problem is that they appear randomly, vanish after several seconds, and are very hard to see. The main problem is the sheer amount of puzzle pieces. I have 2 hours in this game as of this review, and 20 minutes are from playing the game, and the rest are from flying back and forth, back and forth, back and forth looking for the pieces. For such a small game, there are WAY too many of these pieces. It's mind-numbing, and I still haven't even found all the pieces yet. I've collected maybe 30? 40? And it looks like I need about 10 more. 2. The Star Creator. This achievement appears to be bugged in that it unlocks randomly for random people, on random nights of the game...if at all. I have yet to unlock it, despite performing the required action pretty much in every spot available. There has been a discussion about this achievement in the community hub for months, but no signs of the dev updating the game. As it stands right now, the frustration of getting the puzzle pieces, and the bugged Star Creator achievement would make me advise achievement hunters against getting this game.			"

												I wish I could give this a good review.  It has been on my wishlist for a while and I wanted it, I like faries, it's beautiful, and yes the game is both of this stuff just.  There is so very little too it.  I get much more out of free games I play.  You play as a farie and you go around clicking on the farie solving not even 10 puzzles or so.  Not much hints to the puzzles besides a book which shows you pictures given you a basic idea.    Bottom line it's not worth the money in my eyes, it's not worth a dollar.  It's like having one of those pretty interactive pets in away because once you beat it if you stick around to beat it that's all there is.  No replay value.  If it kept the sounds going when I tabbed out to look at the window it would even be a touch better since they're nature and soothing but I can't even have that it seems.			"

It has two different endings and a short ""story"" to tell. If you hear story and think about Final Fantasy, then you will be disapointed. It's more a story of life. For me a game should be paid 1€ each hour, so 3€ would be my price I would pay for this game. I bought it for 1,59€ and don't regret buying it. Of course I could now refund it, but that would only do a real jerk. ;)I enjoyed it and really recommend it to anybody who wants a great experience, not game. <3 (\s/)			"
