								The landscape looks beautiful. It seems you can build everything in this game. Right now you can defend yourself against animals and walk around. the Developer did great work here and I hope they will go for more.Music and sound effects are well made			"

								WARNING TO ALL POTENTIAL BUYERS!  The developers have tried desperately to remove my negative reviews publicly of this mess they call a new survival sandbox game!a) They reported this negative review below to Steam for not meeting community review and forum posting guidelines.. which a Steam forum moderator rejected and left my review intact.b) They filed a ridiculous ""copyright claim"" on my youtube video review of their game, obviously because it put their terrible game in a bad spot light and they don't want the truth of what they are trying to sell you to be know.  (this action has been countered through YouTube requiring the developers to file a federal lawsuit against me to keep removed, so expect the review link below to work again in a couple of weeks from the date of Apr 9, 2015)The above actions taken against my negative review I believe show the shady nature of the developers and how they are trying to hide the 'truth' about their game.  Be warned and aware of this and be sure you take this into careful consideration before purchasing and getting burned.  My gameplay video:

			I review this new early access sandbox online survival game on Steam and let you know if I think it is worth your hard earned money in this video!		

Inferior surival game made by an inferior development team.Trash.  What's trash you ask?The graphics, the sound effects, the combat, every animation in the game, the textures, the lighting, the reflections, the overall design of the gameEven worse then trash is the map design of the world.  This map and mountains is absolutely the worst map design I have EVER seen in any video game.  It honestly looks like the developer used a world creation application and spent about a whopping 15 minutes tops to generate the whole world.  It's lazy design and it shows.It's overly obvious to me that this game is nothing more then an attempt to try and make a buck on the current popularity of survival sandbox games.  Everything about this game from the mobs to the harvesting to the combat screams two words: ""Rushed"" and ""Lazy"".By far the worst game I've purchased on Steam so far in 2015, and quite possibly the worst game I've bought on Steam ever out of nearly 200 games now.My rating at early access launch:  I give this game a 3% (out of 100) Utter FAIL!  (and yes I can rate games in early access and give them a score if they can charge us retail price money for such a game)Avoid at all costs.  Even if it were free, this game is a waste of time, hard drive space, and it's not even worth the time it takes to uninstall it.			"

Early Access Review
								An Alpha survival game with litterally nothing to do. First off you can only craft 36 items, those being mostly for building a base. No options to actually build any tools to gather resources with (like an axe to chop trees with). Couldn't find any wood lying around. An hour of game play, no wood what so ever.Crafting is very time sonsuming. Resources are very scarce. The only resources you can gather are the ones lying around on the surface, no mining what so ever. There's text above the resoucres to show what it is, so that means you'll not be able to chop the trees.Second off, your guide Brad shows up in the middle of the night and tells you to follow him (1st game), except you can't see squat, so natuarally you can't follow him. You don't actually mine anything, all resources are lying around on the surface.There's no mini map, so you don't know where you're at. It's easy to get lost.You get a drone, but the commands for it don't work, so it's completely useless. Also once the drone command window opens, you can't ever close it again. since it uses the same keys as your inventory.I just wandered around until I starved to death.I tried a second game, thinking I missed something. Brad never showed up, found the ruins, well, that's all it is, it just ruins, empty ruined buildings, nothing else. Also found the survivor camp (by accident), was told to talk to someone who wasn't even there. Otherwise the survivor camp is useless.You can't even make a torch, so you have to use the resource gathering tool you start out with for light, it's very annoying. The only danger you have in the game is starving to death.Eventually I just got bored and quit. This game isn't even worth 10 bucks.			"

								Minecraft 3D with space travel and exploration.. kind of.Star on a planet (alone or on a server with friends) and gather basic resources to build yourself a shelter and the means to cook and craft.. but beware, because this strange planet also has strange ruins, caves and creatures all over it. Once you have built yourself a mighty fortress and explored the land, build a spacecraft and head towards the stars to discover other planets and more in Solar System Conflict!			"

								This game is total junk.There is no way all these people giving this game positive reviews could seriously think or believe that.Its got horrid textures and graphics, there is ZERO A.I. in the mobs, the sound effects are abysmal, there is nothing to do.What a complete waste of money and piece of trash. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  - Buy it, and you will regret it, and wish you had listened to me!Utter Fail. Worst game I have ever played.  0/10 for a game and 100/100 for sloppy wet turd rating.			"

								A terrible game, the terrain looks as it was literally made in 20 minutes, the UI is annoying and unbearable to use and from the looks of things most of the POSITIVE reviews talk about the game's POTENCIAL and not the actually game at its current state.Had to quit the game after 10 min because it was that bad,The game hasnt recived any updates within 3 months.Don't Waste your money on this junk, throw in a extra £8 and you can get Rust which is way better, thank god i got this game for free but it still feels like i was ripped off anyways.

								DON'T BUY THIS GAME OR EVEN GET THIS IF ITS FREE. SUCH A WASTE OF TIME. I am sorry to say this but this game is awful, I wouldn't recomment this game to anyone.. personally I could do better map in Unity 5 within a day since the textures in this game are horrible, if he would spent extra 1hr on mixing textures to make it look better it will make a way better impresion. Multplayer it self is really easy to implement especially that there are a lot of tutorials on it in c++, c#.I don't even want to mention word 'potential' since there wasn't any resent updates in the past 3 months and clearly it show sthat the developer has no commitment to this game, just the truth and facts as I was really disappointment myself as gamer and developer. For example simple things as swimming are not implemented or even if you go under the water I would call an event that trigers a code to change the shades/brightness etc. to make it look like you are under the water and physics ofcourse. At least I got this game for free ... DON'T BUY THIS. I hope that the developer will not try to delete this review like in case of other negative reviews e.g. review from youtube guy			"

								Solar System Conflict is a new only multiplayer survival game in Early Access now. The game is continues in developing, so this review gives you only the moment report for the game. Story: You are the new colonist that mothership  was distroyed in the new galaxy system after arrival there. You are trying to survive now and go back home to the Earth. After a few minutes on the Planet you will be welcome there from other colonist and the story begins. Pro: +Nice Nature+Good Sound+Good Musik+ Working survival attributes, you need food and oxigen (and some other more)+ Free world to explore+ As a tutorial use the key ""V"" for a helping drone.+ It should be possible to complete  missions, but seems that  doesn't work at the moment or i haven't found how to do this.Negativ- at the moment need to be worked on performance,- after  you are coming to the colony camp you completly dont know why you have done this? Should you wait for somebody or contact any person or you can go now and come back to the camp, but why you should do this?- a small tutorial will be nice. "

								The game it's great!! you can fly, explore, fight, enter caves. the fact of think about play with friend in the space or fight in the space with him, it's great. Also you can flight to another planet, and it have space realism, I mean use oxygen and fuel, those things are very interesting. But remember that it's a Early game, so maybe you will lose a few times your save game, but it isn't difficult to collect resources.In my opinion 9/10			"

								Ok First i like to say is that we have here a Early Acces game what goes the same way like Minecraft before a few years at all start. Im really impressd what the developer team behind this game do. I know its still at begining of all but what they do for the comunity is unic. For example they give all two days a patch with new content or bugfixes what useres tell them in the comunity place. Look as compare what EA do with costmars ^^ you buy Laggyfield 4 for 70 Euro (PS4 & Xone) and have just a few maps and you can buy for 50 Euro at lunch day more. and as costomar you just a peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥for them. Im sorry for my english but i think you know what i mean. And here at Solar System Conflict i see a yung developer team what like to creat with a strong comunity a big game that is made for the Players and not thems wallet. Dear developers please continue that work =) I belive in you			"

								Game had a lot of potential but was abandoned i believe.Dev's were friendly and wanted feedback in the beginning... but fell silent.I really enjoyed the open building, and easy way of constructing bases, I wasn't a fan of the light limitations (placing too many light sources lagged the servers).Wandering around in the dark really made it feel scary, in my opinion.Also..  I disliked the Aliens you encountered they seemed to be way overpowered.I would reccomend the game if the devs were still living and working on the project, however since they have gone dark, I do not reccomend spending the money. Its not a final product. Still some major bugs.			"

								Aweful game that the developers gave up on so quickly I suspect a scam from the offset. The graphics are little more than stock Unity guff and the sound is appauling. The idea is cool whihc is what attracted me to waste my money. Avoid at all costs. Check out Empyrion is you like the concept. Polar opposite in terms of development.			"
