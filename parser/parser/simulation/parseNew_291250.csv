Early Access Review
								There is one thing we have to get out of the way:  Paragon is a mod/fork of the open source space sim Pioneer, a modern reworking of the great space sim Elite by David Braben that we were all raving about since 1984. As it stands this is as close as you are going to get right now to having Elite itself on steam, which is no bad thing ...... Well worth the purchase price for that little convenience alone.So the 80s style (done perfectly) comes as no surprise, and the artwork (cockpits etc) are good quality.Music is top notch as well, hinting at radiophonic and kraftwerk, it goes to make a perfect background to this space sim.  Runs like a dream and you can max the graphics on a modest PC.It really does have the spirit and feel of Elite.So my recommendation is a thumbs up with crossed fingers, trusting that the development of Paragon will continue along its own lines and not fall down like so many other early access titles have been doing on steam over the last few months.

								Unfortunately, this game has become all but unplayable over the past months. Issues ranging from consistent long load times (or the more likely failures requiring hard resets) at start up to freezes at the end of nearly every jump and worse. I gave it a shot because of the cheap price and concept, but as of 12/17/2014 it may as well be a pet rock. I wish the dev team good luck and hope one day to be given a reason to revise this review, but I cannot in good faith recommend this work in progress and suggest others avoid purchasing this alpha title until extensive work has been done to improve the overall game environment.

Paragon is great, it has different kinds of ships with different purposes, everything is realtime (even while using hyperdrive) so no loading times, and going from space to a planet without a cutscene is true in this game, and because of that the game universe is huge! you get missions, fight, trade, buy new chips and crews and it's good.More info here: KSalue[www.ksalue.com]

Early Access Review
								All I can give right now are very early impressions, but so far Paragon seems like a very competent Elite clone. The game has a great look, and even with some clearly WIP UI screens, it presents information neatly and accessibly. Plus, the music is really quite nice. (Though I've silenced it to play Nujaubes, which also happens to complement the game very well...)So far, most complaints are simply symptomatic of the game's alpha status. Early-game balance is very lacking, with early delivery missions (the only ones you'll be able to take) paying anywhere between $400-700, while ships bigger than the miniscule starting ship costing upwards of $50000. This will presumably be changed in future revisions, but in the mean time, all ship info is stored in convenient little .lua files within the game's folders, so manually changing ship prices is a good way to circumvent the early grind.Also, another minor complaint: currently there just aren't enough keyboard shortcuts. Clicking through the (again, very attractive and thoughtfully designed) menus would be a more painless process if there were shortcut keys to flip between your ship's views, comms, maps, etc. I assume this is on the to-do list somewhere, because it's such a simple thing.Oh, and the autopilot can be downright homicidal. This seems to be true of most space games, but the moral of the story is save frequently and try to keep an eye out for passing freighters when you're docking or taking off from a station.Bottom line, though, Paragon is a compelling and promising space sim. It definitely leans more towards approachability and simplicity than the impregnable X series, or the finnicky Evochron Mercenary (both of which are also good), though it seems that Paragon is aiming towards a fair amount of depth eventually. In the mean time, it's an attractive little Elite-clone and easily worth the $15.			"

Early Access Review
 I love this game's aesthetic themed like an 80's sci-fi movie with retro-futuristic synth music, but unfortunalty this game has become unplayable. It also seems development has crashed into a wall at 100 MPH because there hans't been any updates for a decent amount of time without a word. At anytime before it stopped working I would've recommended this game, but unfortunately I can't. So the devs of Meteoric Games reached out to me on my poorly written review I typed on my phone when I was bored to give the game another go, so I did.My points still stand. The game looks A+ for an independently made space sim, and the soundtrack still gets me pumped, but the large problem is just that; it's independently made. I'm not saying indie space sims are bad, but it's still too early in development for this game to be playable. - It's highly unstable and crashes happen in ways that confuse me. The crashes are frequent but never happen doing the same thing i.e. fast traveling, jumping to another system, or simply requesting take-off.- The new autopilot fast travel is frightening. One second you're in space, the next you're colliding with the inner mesh of a planet (it teleports you inside the planet). It was fine when autopilot actually flew you to your destination, albiet it would occasionally smash you into a station or planet.- The camera controls are stiff, and the flight controls for the mouse are too touchcy. - Things I haven't tested are combat, missions, trading... but that's only because I can't get to that point.Kudos for the team reaching out to it's audience, but sadly this is a review for the game; not the team's performance.

								I'm actually running this game on Windows 8.1, and it is running fairly smoothly. No crashes or glitches so far. The only thing I notice is how bad the autopilot is at landing. I've lost five ships today to the autopilot running me into orbitals while trying to get to the parking spot. So, just stick to non-orbital missions until the bugs are worked out. :D			"

								Paragon is great.This is a fork of the Pioneer Space Sim project, with considerable enhancements that make it worth charging for their efforts.  If you're undecided about Paragon, dip your toe in Pioneer then come back and show these guys some money.Essentially this is a remake of Frontier Development's ""Frontier"" games, the sequel to Elite.  If you want to play Elite, check out Oolite, which is a free project as well.If you're a player of Elite Dangerous, you might consider picking up Paragon as well, because while not multiplayer enabled (someday please?) this is a spiritually similar experience, albeit with much more ""space trucking"" and less of an action component.  It's a pretty chill, relaxing game, and autopilot handles the majority of navigation tasks for you. "

								Minimalistic, clean retro style and music of Paragon is fantastic. It's really immersive. Unfortunately at the current state the game is unplayable because of serious bugs (mainly suicidal autopilot, buggy docking bays and crashing). You must constantly save and even when you reach your destination, it's uncertain whether you'll dock (or take off). Buy it only if you want support developers. Paragon has potential, but give it some time yet.I'll edit my review (and change recommendation eventualy) after updates which will fix these bugs.Tips: If you want tutorial go to http://pioneerwiki.com/wiki/Manual (Paragon is an opensource fork of Pioneer). You have no guns at the beginning. For hyperjump you need Jump module and hydrogen and you must be at least 15km above the surface. Docking is possible only via autopilot (A) and you must first ask for permission. Trading is useless at the beginning, so earn cash trough delivery between sectors (~1000 $).			"

								Im gunna keep this short and simple as i dont usually do this.The game has huge potential, i saw a review and it wasnt recommended but i thought i would give it a chance anyway.It still in the early stages and there is plenty to work on but overall the initial idea works.The universe is apsolutley massive, although i havent quite used any combat abilities or got to grips with the full controls it is still fun. Pros: -Massive expanse to explore-Beautiful backdrops-Huge potential-Fairly easy to play once you have got to grips with the controls-Immersive-Hours if not unlimited gameplayCons:-some bugs need ironing(clipping with ships when docking and departing from stations and cities, auto pilot sometimes needs resetting due to losing destination)-No tutorial; would really appreciate in a following update-hard to use starmap to control warping to other systemsWhen all said and done, the game is worth the money.I hope the developer keeps going in a good direction with this one because like i said, the potential is there, its awsome!

								Finaly they have implemented frictionless space which gives the sim a real space feeling. I don't feel like driving a truck or airplane in space anymore. Also, by doing this, my space ship does not run after moons and planets that either turn or move too fast for my ship. I can now accelerate indefinitively!Don't trust the graphics, this game ain't about graphics, but about being a sandbox where you can explore a vast amount of star systems (when I say vast, I am not talking about 25 or 50, but lots).It is a great facelift of Frontier - First Encounter that appeared in the early 1990s.Thumbs up for the idea.

								Well what could be better than wanting to explore an entire galaxy of stars and planets (and even moons)? Not much this observer thinks but then what if you add space stations and cities or spaceports into the mix? It's not illusion in paragon, it's all there and that concept alone is the basis of a game with plenty of depth. But of course i'm not just reviewing one side but all and so far the plot, as an avid sci-fi fan myself, is very interesting but still has much development. It is curently based in the not so distant future, around the 22nd century if i'm not mistaken, in a world where the Cold War doesnt end!So far however, this plot has yet to be implemented fully and more technical issues have to be solved around how such a massive procedurally generated galaxy can be kept stable and in working order. I take my hat off to the devs who are attempting this task because from what i've seen already if these technical issues, minor and major, can be handled I honestly believe this could be one hell of an adventure.With regards to the depth of the game, this is also something that is wanting but from the hammer and sickle on the space stations to maps of various aligned and non-aligned planets it seems the basis is there to create a universe of mixed politics and motives. Its one thing to play an rpg or free roaming games based in some distant land or with compulsory missions to weigh you down, but to have free reign to go about your business and make a name for yourself? That doesnt sound too bad and the potential is there.As it is you can fly around, see the sights, get a feel for how the game would work and with enough imagination have some idea of the end product but it is a long way off and despite my enthusiasm it has to be said that getting involved with an early access program with massive scope is not for the faint of heart and so only those of patience (and a definite love for sci-fi) should apply now, otherwise give it time!

								From a basic point of view it's Grand Theft Auto in Space. You start small, build your way up doing various tasks to try and make some money, and next thing you know you're swimming in your mass amounts of hydrogen, killing people for thousands of dollars at a time, and building up your crew.10/10(On a more serious note this game was by far my favorite game on Desura and made my top favorites list on Steam. The game is beautiful, and even in it's alpha state has a lot to do! You can of course expect bugs and issues with the game as it is still in alpha of course, but I found it easy to look past those issues and just enjoy the game. Seriously, 10/10)			"

								As of 07/14/15; I think this game is dead. Or will die very soon.Very reminiscent of ""No Man's Sky,"" a game I've been looking forward to since the moment it was announced.Fantastic art style, very simple, but as Neil Armstrong said about the Luna, ""It has a stark beauty of its own.""Simple menu's and UISeemless traveling, to/from orbit/surface of planet, between star systemsI love space. This gives me a great bed for simple gameplay with the enormities of space. I love how this game has started. I can see a long road ahead of it, but I hope it gets finished soon.Things to note as of right now 10/19/14; No customization of controls, or any keybindings for that matter, flying with standard controls takes some getting used toScaling of text is incorrect, sentences get cut off in windowsCrashes, lots of 'em, game is obviously unstable atm (First crash was 25 minutes into my first time playing)Those are the biggest things I can personally think of, everything else seems a bit less important. But I'm sure there will be additions to optimization and shortcuts.It's a fantastic idea, and initially, well implemented. Hope it see's Version 1.0's light of day.			"

								Don't be fooled by the developer videos - this game is far from finished.  It looks fantastic (for the most part), and the retro soundtrack is a very nice touch.  However, development is proceeding at a crawl, if even at all.  The game is a buggy mess.  The interface is confusing, and the tutorial leaves a lot to be desired.  You basically wander about aimlessly, eventually crashing into something or going in circles.  The quests are extremely boring and there's very little feedback in the game when doing them or completing them.  The COM LINK interface, though the metro look is pretty cool, is severely crippled by a confusing layout.  The space flying physics are flawed; there's no sense of floating in space - your ship just stops and goes like it's a car.  Fast travel autopilot is glitched and turned into a boring status screen.  The collision mechanics are glitchy, and you'll soon get used to that VERY annoying 'Game Over' screen which plays some cheesy CGI video reminiscent of something from the early 90s.If the developers get in gear and fix these issues, this may be worth buying.  It has such great potential.  I can only hope for this, but in the meantime, I've moved on to other games. "

								It's a good game, the game is on a good route to improve and evolve. The graphics are nice and the ships looks nice and handles diffrently from each other. there are some missions to play most of them is about going to A to B to deliver somehing in a timeframe. The game now rune fine. They have done a good job on that part now.The ships are easy to control without a controller, it may be even simpler with one. (i would'nt know if it is since i dont own a controller) but i have no hard time using a mouse and keyboard for this game.I don't see the weapons useful yet since i've not ran into any hostile ships yet and the ones i shot just stood there and took it, so that could use a bit of work, but the game's in early access so i'll let that pass. all in all a good game worth the money if you like these kinds of games and would like to support the developers who tries their best to improve the game.EDIT: The performance is now fixed. I will play the game a bit more now and see if the rest is fixed and i will update the review accordingly.			"

								I gotta say Paragon is not a mod nor a port of Pioneer (which in itself is a remake of Elite II: Frontier) but at this point just a blatant reskinning. Virtually everything is identical to Pioneer expect for slightly higher quality graphics with a bit of post processing. Though I was keenly aware of the similarities before I bought this game the promotional videos and info I had read about the game on their site beforehand made it seem that  -even at this early alpha state- they had improved  on some of the base features of Pioneer. Sadly that is not the case at all (at least not as of now). In fact they managed to screw up some basic mundane things that were already working well in Pioneer. For instance, simple things like word wrapping in menus and UI. A large part of Pioneer's and subsequently Paragon's gameplay has you pouring through resource lists, menus and just general text. At HD resolution (1920x1080) the font is oversived, janky, somewhat fuzzy and in certain areas words or phases overlap making it a puzzle to decipher if you aren't already familar with what it is supposed to say. That's a big part of the game and if that's not formatted properly well that certainly degrades the experience. Another simple thing - In Pioneer when you visit various stations and or cities on planets throughout the universe the station personnel is represented by dynamically generated character pictures, made from snippets of male and female facial features of varying ethnicities and...silly mismatched sci-fi type gear. There are like 10 distinct facial features that are aslo mismatched to make somewhat unique (if not sometimes terrifying and creepy O.O) variations of characters to ""interact"" (they are just photos with text underneath them but use your imagination) with. Did Paragon improve upon this aspect at all? No, in fact they replaced that quirky dynamic character generating system with a very boring single, all encompassing male or female faceless avatar. I mean really? Maybe that's something that will be changed in the future but who knows.These may seem like little things but if they can't get these things right, well you get the picture.I personally regret the purchase and would rather just support Pioneer which is free and open-source. It's kind of shameful in my opinion that the Paragon devs are even making money off essentially a straight forward clone of a free game. Maybe in the future they will be able to develop enough unique content as to separate their game from Pioneer but as of now it is a mirror image of Pioneer with just an extra bit of visual polish. If I am somehow woefully misinformed and Paragon was intended to be a visual upgrade mod of Pioneer then my question is how did it get Greenlit on Steam? I seriously would like to know what is happening here.			"

But it crashes all the time, i could really handle that but if you save and them try to load from that save oh wait yep crash crash crash. so no saving for one of these cool new ships they just released on the new patch nope. till its fixed its great minus crashing issues that make progress impossibleIssues that make this game currently unplayable include, hyperdrive use causes crashing, autopilot autos into objects like planets, ships, and lol places it was told to land in. 90% of the time you are unable to load a save game just crashes.I have completely uninstalled this game multiple times, played it on my seriously beefed gaming tower, and also my week little surface pro 2 and this issue happens to both systems. whats funny is even though i crash and get upset i just start new and start playing again, its fun what can i say, but i want to be able to save and continue from that, i want to play and not crash. when this changes ill thumbs up. i know its an alpha but i wont thumbs up a broken game that literally wont work sorry guys			"

								This game is a very unique space/sci-fi adventure. I am one of those people who love adventure and doing what you want in an immersive free play world, and in this game( just not yet ) you can travel to 3 sections of the GALAXY! and then go to THOUSANDS of populated moon and planets. you can also be a pioneer and visit unpopulated worlds. The graphics are in the theme of an old 3Dspace game also it has amazing models of space station colonies and ship along with stars, anomalies, moons and planets. this game  has LOTS of potential but it still has some bugs that can be sorted out, for instance the autopilot is like a crapshute because it can either get you somewhere really quickly or it will catapult you into a ship or a space station or warp ypu through Moons, stars, and planets. I love this game, dont get me wrong and I  know that maybe they are going for realism buor I am just too lazy but the ships are way too expensive bordering the seven hundred thousands when normal mission that pay well require transporting a small group which your begening ship is not suted for and dosnt have any room for any extra things. any way this game is a 10/10 and I definetly going too recommrnd it!

								This space rpg reminds me a lot of Battlecruiser 3000 A.D., with space flight and atmospheric flight (although very basic), trading, mining, missions, combat etc.The major problem I have with this is, after having played dozens of games on Windows 10 over a period of a year or so, this is actually the only one that gave me a blue screen of death, which is weird since Microsoft has such a safe environment for developers to fool around in... (and yes, it's game related, my hardware is fine)			"

								I've been in on this game since one of the early alphas. This was before it was on steam, and really before the space sim genre had begun to come back into fashion. Back then, this was one of the only hopes for an open world space trading simulator. It was buggy, unoptimised, unpleasant to play and to look at, but it was still one of the best things on offer. Today, it has too many competitors which are getting it right for these problems to be overlooked.Unfortunately, I don't think this game can survive the rebirth of the space sim genre.			"

								Just an awful waste of cash. The best incarnation of this game is without doubt Scout Pioneer Mod and it is free and 100 times better. This looks very dated (I know that is supposed to be part of the game). Also it crashes when you click on certain icons within the game. But the worst aspect of all, is that the developers don't seem to fix anything, at least not quickly. The updates are so slow, that it is sometimes difficult to wonder whether or not it has been abandoned. If it hasn't, it should be.			"

								Jumpdrive, formally named Paragon, is a very cool 80's themed sci-fi game. I was split on the my impressions due to the fact that it seemed the dev dissapears once in a while... However it is building itself slowly and when he drops a patch it's pretty good. This game is basically elite at it's core, but with some nice aesthetics and soundtrack that creates a very nice sci-fi atmosphere to fly about in and land on planets. I recommend this game if you are a space/sci-fi lover, and perhaps support the dev/devs to motivate them to update more frequently!			"

								Update for Alpha 7 HF3Saves are currently working for me.  Twelve in a row has got to be some sort of record ;)It was nice to actually get some traction in game for grinding to better ships.Here is what I've now found that I can do 8 missions in a row...1)  Found a game-ender:  Farley Station.  For some reason, the ship will not ""geo-lock"" above the dock.  The autopilot stops about 1m from the surface.  I turn off autopilot and I'm zooming backwards.  When I try to manually pilot to the dock, when my speed is 0, the planet is moving beneath me.2)  Almost always now my starter ship will not dock.  I have to turn off autopilot and hit ""o"", then the dock's tractor beam complete's my ships lateral rotation so that I land.  This has worked every time until I attempted to land at the above (point 1) dock.3)  After docking and coming back from the dock info screen, the HUD mileage flickers.MUCH IMPROVED...  Enough so to recommend.===========================7 HF2===========================I have about 4 hours in this game.  I'm experiencing an ever escalating number of deal breakers:1)  Auto-pilot mostly works.  That, however, is not the problem.  When it DOESN'T work is the issue.  Expect to crash into docks and die.  One work-around would be too...2) Save often.  Except I'm experiencing a crash on save about 1 every 3 or 4 attempts.  So that leg of the journey (since the last successful save) needs to be repeated.  However upon landing (presumably due to the type of station) I again auto-pilot crash.3)  So instead of grinding these nickel-and-dime missions, why not play around a bit?  I modified a ship price so that I could at least make more than a couple grand.  So I fitted up the Starling transport, found some folks wanting to go three jumps for $5000 and we set off.  Landed in the system and auto-piloted to the dock.  Requested clearance and told this impressive space taxi to land.  No auto-pilot crash... time to cash in!  Wait, it didn't land... It's just floating above the pad.  I manually bring the ship back out of position and tell the autopilot to land again.  ...Still not on the pad.Alright.  4 hours in, and I'll be watching for the next patch notes to decide whether it's time to give it another shot.Update:  There was an announcement a week ago that the specific save crash I'm experiencing was fixed.  I'm running their current Hotfix (Alpha 7 HF2)...  Save issue still exists.So much for watching patch notes for fixes to these two (three, maybe more) issues...			"

								Jumpdrive, previously Paragon, is what I would call a total conversion of an open source game called Pioneer.  Pioneer is essentially a remake of the classic open world space game Frontier.  There is a big difference in between Pioneer and Jumpdrive though:  Pioneer is still being developed.  The Jumpdrive devs have all but disappeared leaving a broken game behind.Let's start with the only Jumpdrive gets right:  atmosphere.  The synthwave soundtrack, the cockpits and ship models that look like they came out of a low budge sci-fi movie (in a good way), the colorful backgrounds all looks, sounds, and feels great.  Most importantly, all of these things work together.  None of the ship models look out of place.  Nothing sounds out of place.  Everything meshes perfectly with the exception of some of the artifacts left over from Pioneer, like the travel tunnel.  It all works so well that it pains me that the game doesn't really work.So what doesn't work?  The biggest thing is that Jumpdrive crashes when you try to dock and there's no way to avoid this.  You can take missions, buy cargo, or load up on passengers but whatever you do, the game will crash when you attempt to dock.  This bug ruins the game and it's been there since the last update almost a year ago.  Before this update, there were still numerous bugs.  The game would crash when hostile ships were supposed to be spawned.  In fact, there were no interactions with NPC ships.  Certian planets would not having clipping allowing you to fly through them but not land on them.  Certain space stations would have some kind of invisible force field around them cause both players and NPCs to bounce off them.The devs have disappeared.  The game doesn't work.  You shouldn't buy this.			"

								Shows great promise. With TrackIR support, hotas support, etc and maybe some tweaks to how the craft is controlled, interfacing with on-board gauges and spotting ability, it could and probably will become a very enjoyable game. I'm a simmer myself with a full setup, so it felt a little unnatural to use a tophat to look around and fumble with some of the controls and interfacing when trying to navigate from system to system.Having said that, the game is sure to turn into something unique and quite fun.If you have fond memories of Descent 2, TIE Fighter(which wasn't really a sim, but comparable with modern hardware and a simulator lean) or like me; can't wait for Elite: Dangerous to come out, then this might be a good pickup to whet your thirst for simulator space flight and combat.

								This is a fork of the open source freeware game Pioneer, which is in itself a remake of Elite II. Try Pioneer for free and then of you enjoy it, buy this, as it looks and sounds a lot better.The graphics have been massively improved as has the soundtrack. The game goes for a retro 80's feel (right down to the Cold War In Space scenario) and the optional filters that make it look like a 80's sci fi film or its being played on a cathode monitor!The universe and the individual planets look wonderful and there is a plethora of stuff to do. As with the original elite, the intial progress in the game is extremely slow, but once you gain traction there is a fantastic and absorbing range of activities, you can be a pirate, an interstellar taxi driver, a trader or fight for one of the factions. There's no overarching plot as such, but your imagination can build your own as you play.For the price, this represents better value for money than E:D by a long chalk (and you can land on fantastically rendered planets NOW).The only problem is that it is still a little bit buggy. I cannot load a saved game from the start page, I have to begin a new game, play for 10-15 minutes and then load my older saved game which is a bit of a pain. There's the occasional CTD to, and the graphics can lag a bit when you don't expect them to (and likewise be extramely smooth when there's a lot going on)The game is soon to be updated, hopefully to iron out the glitches and push it closer to beta. If you like space trading games, this is definitely one of the better ones that I have tried.  "

								This game is really fun and atmospheric. Along with that, it has really cool retro type music that fit really well with the gmae and it looks pretty good. My only complaint is that that it crashes very frequently when you try to hyperjump or dock, making the game difficult to progress if you don't save before you do both of these things. I guess the developers left the game to die in the future mainly because they aren't even working on the game anymore. It's a pity to say that i wouldn't reccomend this game for purchase.			"

								Serious potential here. Being a HUGE Elite and Frontier fan, this really ticks every box in terms of feel and gameplay.  Initially there were a few kinda serious bugs which meant progress was slow and severely restricted but the team have sorted these out and it now looks like its all systems go.Flying around planets is really awesome, and is probably only going to get better - it beats Frontier in that regard already.If you liked Frontier then you are going to get that itch scratched here, but please remember this is an Alpha release - nowhere near feature complete and there's not actually THAT much to do at the moment - but WELL worth the investment nonetheless.

								Paragon is what it is. A throwback to 80s movie magic. Back in those days tall hair reigned supreme, and the life-ending creation of self-entitlement worldwide through the birth of the cell phone had yet come to fruition. If you enjoy space, if you enjoy stars, and if you enjoy space and stars this game is for you. *There are some minor issues I run into here and there, like crashing straight to desktop, or m y AI unable to dock at a station- however I have yet to have a gamebreaking issue arise. Most of the issues in this game are what you will find in most AAA-budget tittles. - For the price, worth the buy, worth the time spent, and I cannot wait to see future development. Sure there are other games like X, Elite Dangerous, and upcoming No Man's Sky - but Paragon, with it's worlds, personality in writing, and excellent music defeinitely makes it stand apart from the rest. If you've tried those other games, and are left unsatisfied, this little gem will probably fill the voice and with a low price fairly hard to avoid.			"

								WARNING TO FEDORA LINUX USERS THIS GAME WILL NOT WORK IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. As it should be obvious this game is a fork of the open source game called ""Pioneer"" which is in turn based off of the 1995 game ""Frontier : First Encounters"" which was the third iteration of the original open world space simulation ELITE. Now I thought the idea of this fork of Pioneer with it's 80's theme was a great idea, however after I bought it and installed it I was immediately turned off. The aesthetic is barely 80's, the ships all look as if they were constructed from lego and the cartoon style texturing and shading just doesn't reflect what they were going for. Plus the music is much too modern sounding, they completely missed the mark on the whole 80's vibe. The sound design as of yet is lacklustre as well. (To be clear while I couldn't get it to even start on Fedora Linux it does run on Windows 7)Right now the game is pretty empty and there is not a whole lot to do, keep that in mind as you prepare to buy this fork of a much more complete FREE game for FIFTEEN US DOLLARS. I understand it's still in early access and I probably wouldn't have posted this, but when I told them the game would not properly initialize in Fedora Linux by opening a thread in the discussion area they said it would be fixed in the next update, but when it turned out to still not start they deleted the thread. What kind of dev deletes support threads? This is unacceptable, as a user that payed good money for this game I should not be swept under the rug. >:(			"

								Love love love this game despite its flaws. I read that the devs fixed the random game crashes surrounding going through jump space but thought I'd bring to everyones attention that my game has crashed 3 times in a row before or shortly after said jump. Like I said I really like the potential here but that one particular bug makes it damn near impossible to get any real progress going in the game.Edit: After playing longer (which is saying how amazing I really think this game is or could be) numerous bugs that where ""fixed"" continue to stay just that. It is impossible for me to load a save game 90% of the time and the same goes for hitting jump space without the game crashing. On top of that certian space stations will have me shoot past the docking process on auto pilot, bump into the back of the station taking hull damage, then reverse me to where it should have dock and then it finally works. Needless to say I can't get better equipment or ships because I'm constantly restarting. I really hope the devs can fix these problems. This is could be by far the best space sim I've played to date. Beating FTL even and I hold that game in my opinion to be the best of the best.I'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down till these unplayable crashes get resolved. I'm glad I bought it still just for the simple fact that hopefully the money will let the devs fix the game.			"

								IMPORTANT!this game is way from done, but it does have a lot to offer and while its in an insanely unfinished state, it is slowly being worked on. slowly but surely. despite all the negative press it has persevered and i admire that. if youre a fan of space sims, especially ones that are rather simple but yet complex at the same time this game is for you. like i said though it is insanely unfinished but it is still in progress by like 2 people and i would recommend picking it up just to support the dev so it can be completed.REVIEW: this game is unfinished and i feel giving it a proper review is unfair, the price tag vs what you get even in its unfinished state isnt too bad, i have seen a lot worse. what it does it does well and what it doesnt do is being worked on. it will take time before this is a game to rival that of elite, but with time it will end up like a cheaper, but more artistic elite clone. if youre looking for another game like elite but maybe dont have the serious cash for it, then this is for you.

								It is a pretty awesome game, although I would reccomend taking out the ""Docking port busy"" thing because as I am writing this review, I am currently stuck at fort glock and I've been stuck there for like 20 minutes now. "

								I bought this so that I could play Pioneer Space Sim with a Steam controller, as this is a fork of Pioneer and the original Pioneer won't work in Steam.  I've been happy to get that to work, but this game hasn't been updated in almost a year and needs some work.The devs seemed to have a good start on this, it's definitely not just a Pioneer clone and I appreciate many of the changes that have been made.  It's a shame they no longer are communicating with us or supporting the game, but here's a good review hoping that that changes and this game with huge potential gets finished.			"

								I know this game is still an Alpha but I bought it nearly a year ago and there is no improvement in the game. Tons of bug, bad design, isn't enjoyable, clunky,  unfinished, 1 update every few month with just few changes and not improvement at all, and lately the game really feels abandoned. Avoid this game. This is the first early access that I've really regretted buying.			"

								I really wanted to love this game. The concept is great, The plan seemed great, graphics seemed right on par with the theme. The devs, well they just disapeared. The pop in very rarely to claim it is still in production, but latest updates are almost a year old now. The game is not done, many many bugs still. I do hope the game gets in full production again. I will change my not recommended to a positive in a heart beat, But, I fear this will never happen.  Update: Game still not worth it. Devs still doing amazing disapearing tricks. Do not buy.			"

								This game when was borderline unplayable, the autopilot you almost need to use for docking was faulty, constantly smashing me into things and blowing me up, the mechanics were tedious and uninspired and the whole look and feel of the game was very unpolished. I feel that the devlopers used the retro feel that was their ""intent"" as an excuse to be very lazy with the basic game design.   Overall a complete waste of my money, that could have been much happily spent elsewhere.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I would like to say I do like how the game developer has reached out to me with a comment asking if I could try it again because of updates, it shows they want to see their game succeed and it shows the hard work put into the updates. With my previous review of this game, I had stated that I did not enjoy this game. Giving it another try, I still feel strongly on that as when I had attempted to launch this game I had multiple crashes which I had to manually fix by deleting saved files in my drive. Likely caused be owning paragon and the name change or something with the updates made it crash on launch. Anyways, after trying this game again with the supposed updates because I had thought it would be totally different, I saw little to no difference with how it started off, complicated and clueless on what to do in the game. I had this issue along with many other issues such as the game not supporting my 1920x1080 monitor. I had to run this game on 720p (terrible resolution to see after playing most games on 1080p) and also the game is quite laggy and seems unsupported even though I have an R9 390 and an I5 4690k which run most games on great settings but this game, even on lower settings, seems to drop quite a few frames. As I had said before, I see much potential in this concept which is why I purchased it, but I did not see that potential shine within this game. This is not a review attempting to destroy the game and idea but simply to try to help and see this game become something I would enjoy! So all in all I tried it again but I still did not feel as if I had enjoyed this game. And with No Man's Sky coming, I would love to see this game as it's strongest competitor but this game is not yet at that point. I mainly don't enjoy it because of it's starting complexity, I know I could learn it all and spend the time doing so but I don't play games to get frustrated with controls, I play games because I want to have fun!

								This is basically a mod of Pioneer Space Sim, which is a freeware remake of Elite: Frontier.  There are some nice things about the direction they've taken this (I like the art style), but ultimately it's really buggy, with ships randomly crashing into stations and saving/loading the game causes crashes 99% of the time. UPDATEGood news: The game is more stable now than it was a year ago.Bad news: That's been the only development on the game in the past year.  V A P O R W A R E    S C A MSave your money.			"

								Much more accessible than Pioneer.  Quite a bit easier to jump into and get going.  Love the new graphics.  Has great potential but is definitely EARLY alpha.  If you don't like buggy games that are in development, don't buy this and leave negative reviews.  We need all the space sims we can get!  We need the option to control the ship manually, maybe an advanced control mode that gives us full control.  The autopilot is as others have put it, suicidal.  Quite frankly it's the worst thing in the game at the moment, don't trust it to land your ship, or you'll be staring at a game over screen more often than not.  This game has a long way to go, but if it gets there, it's going to be amazing.			"

								Just bought it, understanding the game's not ready for stores just yet. However, I find an appalling lack of gameplay information about what presently DOES exist. The tutorial seems like an afterthought at best. It doesn't even guide you through your beginning at your first port. No help with knowing what you could do with your ship or crew or cargo or anything. Once you get out of port, you have no guidance towards any possible goals, including any missions you take. Apparently you need Hydrogen in your cargo bay to make a hyperspace jump. And you need to be away from the planet. And if your hyperspace button won't activate even then, if the map will let you click on your distant target but nothing else is functioning, well, that's just too bad, there's no in-game information and no out of game guides or tips or anything. Just make sure you have that hydrogen and the auto-pilot is buggy. At present I can't recommend the game. It looks nice and is probably fun to play, if you already knew what you were doing before you ever started playing. And if bugs didn't catch you. If you have already played plenty of Elite and/or Pioneer, then maybe you'll have lots more good times.			"

								I really wish that they had mentioned in the description that this is a fork of an Elite clone, even if it was just something like ""inspired by the Elite series"". I have no problem with this (I'd love an updated Elite) but it's just that I bought it expecting a game I hadn't played before... right now it plays more or less exactly like Frontier: Elite II.To be fair though, future updates may add new features and change some things to distance it from the older series. I don't have any other complaints and I'll probably play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it when it's finished.			"

								A buggy game, this one is. Despite this, the map is vast and the paths to take are plentiful. I have fun with it, but crashes are also plentiful. To buy a new ship, you have to go through a LOT of missions, and you have to remember to save often because the game lacks an autosave feature and has the tendency to crash when you haven't saved in a while. All in all, Paragon is full of potential. I have played few games like it.			"

								A little confusing. Actually I had no idea what to do. I travelled around for a while in a shuttle. Wow. Definitely alpha.A simple couple of pre-set missions or a coms channel with hints would help that. A basic education about the concepts beyond the text blurb provided. I might go so far as to suggest rescue or recovery missions to avoid violence (and the inherent ratings/classification problems in various meat jurisdictions)The physics seems to ignore newton, although at the scale set it's hard to tell... Newton was wrong but his ideas make for fun games (see Angry Birds), especially if you have all thrusters manually controllable. Imagine the awesome epicness of winning a battle with a limping ship using a gravitational slingshot.The quickish mode of transit ( forgot what it's called ) seems to only accelerate. My keys are default - W and S - and S doesn't slow me down. It would be nice if it behaved like the latest idea I was reading about from NASA - creating a space/time vacuum in front of the ship. That would give some more control over speed. Not sure how it translates to code in the game engine, but it shouldn't be hard given that it's kind of newtonian.Also, the joystick config sucks. Happy to offer my input as a joystick tester. I have a 3 axis, 4 button joystick, but the 3rd axis is physically set up as a throttle and this does not work well for this game given the current options. "

								UPDATED REVIEW (OSX): This game will not launch in OSX as of January 28, 2017. This issue has been around a while (according to others in the forum) and the developers haven't made any updates to fix it. The development team seems to be on-again-off-again, working on this project now and then rather than consistently. The Windows version is OK, but if you're on Mac, don't waste your money.OLD REVIEW: This game has made leaps and bounds since the last time I played! The developers have clearly been putting a lot of work into this, and it shows. The game loads much quicker and plays much smoother than ever before. This is a fantastic improvement!However, there are still a few minor problems. I wasn't able to get my XBox 360 controller to work with the game. The triggers don't work as buttons, so I can't map triggers to weapons and bumpers to yaw/roll. And when I tried to clear one of the joystick axis options, the game crashed  outright.These are minor bugs, though, and overall the gameplay is quite good. I was a little dissappointed that the ""fast travel"" mechanism simply blacked out the screen and showed a loading screen. I recall the autopilot actually piloting while you watched your ship travel. I miss that. But I guess I can just as easily fly by myself; the piloting controls are pretty good.Great job, everyone! I hope a few of these little bugs can be ironed out, but I'm a happy customer regardless.			"
