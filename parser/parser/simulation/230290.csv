								I decided that Pluto should take revenge on the other planets for downgrading it.I slammed Charon into Pluto, along with a couple more Kuiper objects to make it bigger.Once it was a little bigger than Mercury, I slammed it into Mercury.Then Venus.Then Mars.Then Earth.Then, I slammed a few more Earths into it to make it larger.Then I put it up against Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Pluto won every time, growing ever bigger.Something odd happened when I slammed it into Jupiter, though. The two bodies started to orbit each other very quickly, Jupiter slowly getting torn apart into little fragments, orbiting Pluto.Then, Pluto ate all of the fragments.But it didn't stop there.Pluto, even though it was leauges smaller than the sun, flew directly toward it.Upon impact, the sun exploded, creating a massive nebula. At the center of it was Pluto, unharmed.I kept slamming it into suns.Eventually, I slammed it into VY Canis Majoris.Then, lag.When the lag ended, I zoomed back into Pluto, still alive. But something was different.Instead of a supermassive planet/star thing, there was a small glowing dot.Was it a black hole? I don't know.It was no larger than the sun, and glowing a pleasant red glow, but distorted light near it like a black hole.I saved it, and put it into a stock solar system.It immediately ate the sun, and sent every other body flying out into interstellar space at 10000 km/s.I dubbed this cataclysmic object Pluto Nova.10/10 would make Pluto destroy the universe again			"

								I have privately and publicly alpha tested this game since Alpha 8.3.  I bought the original US in 2009.  The pace of development on US2 is amazing.  I personally have a fascination in space, astrophysics and any science that governs the workings of the universe from particles to galaxies... and the original US was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen...  Even in its now-considered retro theme, it was an opportunity to see all my knowledge, applied, in the universe, for the very first time, in a free sandbox.  Now we have US2, and I cant explain how great this program is.This is one of those games that cannot be matched by anything else.  I have run US2 on several computers, 4 to be precise, and it has run exceptionally on all of them, ranging from potatoes to near 6GHz monsters.  I would say 90% of US2's features have been implemented in this year alone.  This game always make me wonder, ""Imagine US2 next month!  It will be TEN times better!"".  US2 devs are open to suggestions and are quick to respond to your questions on the US2 forums.  The US2 community is like that of nowhere else.It really is amazing how many features are in this game...  I mean, most of them you will rarely use because you are too busy wrecking the universe and smashing stuff together!  The main reason I think people hesitate to buy this game (if they hesitate at all), is because it is in alpha...  Sure, there are a few bugs.  They are not game-breaking though, and the game runs flawlessly on default settings.  Thats why we alpha tested it waaaay before it came out on steam, to get the diamond of US2 as perfect as we could.This really is my lifetime favourite game.  Even in Alpha 8.3, when the devs accepted my alpha testing form, it was one of, if not the most, exciting thing ever.  I was one of just a handful of people around the world with US2.  Now in Alpha 16, you can experience that, but nearly 2x more jaw-dropping excitement and wow-factoryness! (according to the version numbers!).  Every single update they improve the game so much, I sit there, universe sandboxing, jaw dropped.  It is a truly amazing experience to play a game like this, this totally unique game, like nothing I had seen before.A really important thing I would like to mention... If you dont know, US2 developers are working hard on (at some point, soon) adding SPH.  That stands for (S)omething i forgot, (P)article (H)ydrodynamics.  Go have a look on youtube, it is a simulation of the planet in many different particles.  This means it can break up when under tidal stress, and deform awesomely in collisions!  They are going to implement this into the 3-D already complex simulation of US2.  And you thought the game was already amazing!			"

								Universe Sandbox isn’t a game per se; there are no bosses, aims or levels, merely an accurate model of astronomical bodies for you to fiddle with. It’s really more of a toy :O – the virtual equivalent of a configurable orrery, except hugely more complex than any mechanical system.  That complexity is one of the key attractions that Universe Sandbox possesses. Using the vast range of variables and tools at your disposal you can create some enormously convoluted displays of physics, bending cosmic laws to your will out of nothing more than a desire to see pretty patterns form on your screen :). You can move galaxies around so that they tear themselves apart beautifully, casting off clouds of stars into the abyss as part of their death throes.			"

Early Access Review
Introduction Universe Sandbox ² is a physics-based simulator from eight person team, Giant Army. Universe Sandbox ² is, as you’d expect, a sandbox simulation and therefore you can do pretty much whatever you want within the game’s limitations. Would you like to see what happens to our Solar System when the force of gravity is doubled? You can do that! Want to know what Earth would look like after the moon collided with it? You can find out!Full Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.Presentation Universe Sandbox ² is a good looking simulator. While the textures aren’t great if you zoom in right up to them they do generally look good. The models are all high quality and the visual effects in the game are absolutely brilliant. The developers have done a good job at making the game look as realistic as possible without making it too PC power hungry. As well as looking pretty the game’s appearance is functional. The UI is fairly basic and it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb but it manages to give the user all the information and options needed to enjoy the simulator. You’ve also got the option to have visible orbits, trails, labels etc. which when on give the user a lot of information but when off allow for some great screenshots to be taken.Gameplay I’m not sure gameplay is really the right word for Universe Sandbox ² but I’ll run with it anyway. It’s quite difficult to talk about Universe Sandbox ²’s gameplay as it’s very much what you make of it. For example, if you spend all of your time creating functioning solar systems you’re going to have a rather different experience to someone who mindlessly smashes planets into each other. Those two cover one of the main ways to enjoy the simulation, creating your own scenarios. You’re given access to all of the objects in the game and you can manipulate them however you want to. As well as choosing where to place them relative to other celestial bodies you’re also given a great deal of customisation options for each celestial body such as what materials make up most of its mass or how much mass the celestial body actually has. You can also change what kind of climate planets have through the same menu as the other options or by simply moving the celestial bodies closer or further away from other bodies which have an influence on them.The other way to enjoy Universe Sandbox ² is to simply run the scenarios which the simulator comes with such as an accurate model of our solar system or a collision between two versions of Jupiter! This is really for those, like myself, who just enjoy watching that kind of thing and of course like watching planets smash into each other. I mean, who wouldn’t enjoy watching two planets smashing into each other? There are already loads of scenarios available in the game and more are being added. Like you can when creating your own scenarios, you’re able to do whatever you want with these scenarios too such as add more planets to your scenario or edit the materials a celestial body is made of.Miscellaneous You have complete control over how fast the simulation is, you can have each real second represent anything from a millisecond to billions of years.Universe Sandbox ² has a nice, relaxing soundtrack which fits nicely with calm simulations and contrasts perfectly with huge collisions.The celestial bodies in the game range from small asteroids to supergiant stars and black holes. There are even some human sized objects in the game including the Monolith from 2001.The eight person team consists of a numerical physicist, a climate scientist and an astrophysicist as well as ‘regular’ game developers.While Universe Sandbox ² isn’t too taxing on your GPU you are going to need a pretty beefy CPU to get a good frame rate on some of the more complex simulations.Verdict Worth Purchasing. Universe Sandbox ² is a realistic and interesting physics-based sandbox from Giant Army with good graphics and a lot to do. It may not offer much to your average gamer but for those with a real fascination with space it’s a real treat. It may be a bit pricey so for those average gamers I’d suggest holding off for some kind of discount but if you’re a space nut like myself then it’s worth it.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			"

								This is a simulator, not really a game.  If you have a problem with that then please go watch some videos about this before buying it and then downvoting it.  With that being said, this is a gem worth owning, and I proudly bought it directly from the developer before it was even available on early access.-----edit: So many angry people in the comments; sorry you guys can't have a beer with the developer like me.  Keep the flame on high! I have some popcorn kernals around here somewhere! XDBy the way for those who got lost in my epic review, I don't personally know the developer...			"

								This game is a very good reminder of the precarious balance in which the universe hangs. I mean, all it takes is a red dwarf star to s̶p̶a̶w̶n̶  mysterously appear out of nowwhere and crash into the sun in order to cause a cataclysmic event that causes a b̶e̶a̶u̶t̶i̶f̶u̶l̶  truely awful explosion of the entire solar system. This game also makes you appreciate that the sun doesn't suddenly become a billion times more dense and turn into a black hole in which all life as we know it is killed most horribly. And we are most certainly glad the moon doesn't collide with an exact replica of itself and slowly destroy the Earth with pieces of debris; at least until another moon collides with the earth because the small pieces of debris were taking too long. And yet, amidst all this potential destruction, here we are. And I still can't hit Earth with golf balls fired from Mars.Edit: Though as it turns out I can hit Earth with Mars fired from Mars, and if fired with a weak enough force I can hit Mars, with Mars fired from Mars.

								EDIT: Review still remains true, although VR is pretty ok; But difficult to useEDIT 2: It's been almost half a year since I wrote this review, but it still seems true. The development on this game simply isn't fast enough. They've pushed out a few updates but nothing that significant. I'm really hoping to see somthing that allows you to view and control life on planets.Great game, it really is... But on this one I have to write a negative reviewAs I assume, your looking to see if this game is worth it. I was in that position too,  I ignored the negative reviews thinking ""This game looks amazing!"" Not saying it isn't, but there just isn't enough contentAt first it's super cool, after 30 minutes you get a bit bored, After an hour you find yourself just hopelessly creating meteors to create a universe, or smashing planets into each other and it just gets plain boring.So, do yourself a favor, don't ignore this review wait untill the game has more content, THEN and only THEN decide if you want it.I'd suggest  this	 game			"

								The universe was created in 7 days by our holy entity Megatruck, blessings upon Him, henceforth to be named God.On the first day, God pressed the 'new' button, thereby errasing the Solar system from existence. At first there was nothing, and God said,""Let there be light."" He had to rummage through the star folder. An then there was light, to be more precise a small white star that God had destined to be named, ""Cheese Ball."" And God looked upon Cheese Ball and saw that it was good, made out of Hydrogen and Helium rather than powdered cheddar. God looked upon the area surrounding Cheese Ball,  and figured it to be desolate. And lo, a small circular rock was placed by our heavenly father that circled around Cheese Ball with great vigor. It had a sad existence, useless to life, and was christened with the title, ""Maxwell the firey spacedot."" God had thought it weird to have a perfect circular orbit, so God clicked on Maxwell the firey spacedot's tab and revealed a metric forkton of settings. After twiddling with them for a few hours, and finally stopping that infernal white trail coming from Maxwell the fiery spacedot for some reason, called off the universe and saved it away in a file named, ""srgblga."" On the second day, Maxwell the fiery spacedot's orbit was appropriately ovaloid. God then demmanded, ""There should be life here!"" No one was going to do it for Him, He was God afterall, the lazy trunkbasket.And He should stop capitalizing His pronouns, it's annoying. Stop it. So, he found out Cheese Ball's Goldilocks zone, placed a nice white planet down, screwed with it's orbit, decided the pre-generated name Rxnamien didn't fit this gift of his, and called it, ""Nimrod."" And so Nimrod was, for a few seconds, and then God added water to it's makeup. He waited. Then, God bellowed, ""Why snt there life? Water is the foundation of life as I know it!"" He then accelerated time by a few millenia, slowed it down again, and gave Nimrod a moon, because habitable planets all have moons, right? And this moon, oh what a moon. it was a golden yellow, a shiny, magnificent ball, worthy to a god such as he. Honoring it with the title, ""Dorfff,"" God wondered at the beauty of a night sky adorned by Dorfff.  He then commanded, ""GROW SOME LIFE MEDAMMIT."" and overwrote srgblga and closed the game in a heaveny furor. On the third day, God's still trying to create some life in dis birch. On the fourth day, he finally got an atmosphere, but jack anything else. On the fifth day, God is trying to BALANCE THE GREENHOUSE DEAR ME TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE WHYYYY. On the sixth day, God decided it would be nice to ploomp some gas giants in the distance. And lo, Garumpf and Smorgasbord were born. They were useless, but adorned with moons, ranged from planet sized to are-you-even-trying sized. Time to get funky with their orbits, or so.  on the seventh day, God FINALLY CREATES SUM LIL' CITIES THEY ARE SO CUTE. Despite being blurry dots of white only visible on the dark side of Nimrod, God feels an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. God saves over srgblga, and watches the cosmos he has created. He then gets bored and lobs a red dwarf at Cheese Ball,thus crating a cataclysmic event starting with planets losing their orbit and ending in a supernova, obliterating everything, including the framerate. God closes the game, and eats some pizza. And thus ends the story of God. TL/DR: Read it please unless you don't like short stories about me being a malevolent being creating life and destroying it. 10/10 would cry in joy at the miracle of life and then meniacly laugh as they all burn to spacedust again.

								First off I definitely recommend this game, but like all games it has downsides.This may be a bit of a read, but where is a good review without its detail right?One of the first things I noticed, when you buy this game that's it, you have the entire game, no special objects I have to buy, if I want to throw a football with the mass of a sun at a teapot the size of our earth, then I can do it as soon as I purchase this game. Which I can tell would appeal to most people.I'll go over my favourite aspect of the game now, but to save me rambling on about every little feature I enjoy, I'll make a list after this. The thing I love most about this game, is the creativity and curiosity this game brings. As I mentioned before; but who could imagine that you can make a football our solar systems apocalypse?! One things this game does  indeed do very well, is catching the interest and curiosity of people, but also allowing quite a fair bit of creativity.As I said before I will now make a quick list of all the other things I enjoy a lot about this game:-Black Holes (you'll spend a lot of your time, if not most of it messing around with black holes).-Watching what happens when our sun evolves.-Blowing up every item in the game.-What happens if's (with the earth especially).-Trying to make another earth from scratch.-Turning a teapot into a sun.-Creating a Solar System.-Creating a very small galaxy.-Messing around with the milkyway.-Making a potential universe descructing object.-Watching the beautiful simulations, with the beautiful music playing.Those pretty much cover what I'll be doing and you'll most likely be doing in this game, but the things is, I know there are some more things in the game I haven't started to look at yet, which I will do very soon; they also keep updating this game, so I am always on the look out for any interesting additions they put in.Alright, so like with every game, it has a few downsides. Here are a few.After about three hours of playing and testing things out, I started to feel a bit bored and I felt as if I had tried everything that is worth doing (blowing up the earth a million times, and putting a black hole at the centre of our solar system). So what I would say the developers is this, perhaps for a future game, or to just make a big update for this one, think about what more content could you add into this game, or how much more detail can you go into with what happens in space, just to add those extra few hours of interesting gameplay; that being said, I could probably play this for a maximum of two amazing hours, creating my own universe, and creating several apocalyptic situations, then a minimum of a week and a bit, of a break before wanting to play and do that all again. A small suggestion for what you could add; add or make a load more options of what if situations, and perhaps more interesting or ambitious what ifs, like what if aliens were real and invaded our solar system, or what if earth advanced space travel so much they were travelling around our solar system as easy as people can get on a bus now. Maybe too ambitious but you start to see my point.A final thing, only small, and not the most important downside, but something I certainly picked up upon, and thought, hmm, would have been better with this; is the whole black holes being the most destructive force situation. In this game, all they are, are huge slingshots. Now, I know black holes do something to do with shooting objects out at incredibly high speeds, but I'm no expert. However I also know, or at least have heard from people who are meant to be experts, that under the great force of the gravity a black hole has, objects that are pulled towards it are torn to pieces by the strength of the gravitational pull; and for a lot of people interested in black holes, this is one main thing they focus on; the destructive power it brings wherever it goes. In this game, as I said before, I only see a slingshot, a bunjee jump, to me, a black hole in this game is far from being as deadly and chaotic as they are said to be by experts. I'm almost sure this is to do with the design of the game, that limits this feature, or to do with the time it might have taken to make these extra small details added in; but considering the large majority who will spend most of their time playing around with black holes; I STRONGLY suggest to the developers, that again, either in a very future version of this game, or a large update later on, that there is some sort of design that let's us all see that truly great power a black hole holds, and how merciless it can be.Those are the two main downsides in this game for me. Although, in conclusion, I certainly recommend this game, it is still fairly new, and having regular updates, (mainly the little fixtures us gamers don't notice very much), but it can give a lot, answer a lot of your curious questions about space, and it is still extremely fun to play. Definitely worth it, and quite frankly, you can never get bored of tossing the moon at earth. Oh, and Developers, if any of you read this, of course, great game, very well done, so congratulations, but also take into account what improvements that I have said could be there in the future.Thanks!

								After my gameplay of Universe Sandbox 2, I decided to write a review on one of the most fantastic games in the universe in my opinion.- Universe Sandbox 2 is a very detailed simulation. It show this in the craters that forms after you collide an object into another, in the elevation as seen by adding water onto the surface of the object, and also in the accuracy on the simulation of gravitational pulls of bodies.- Universe Sandbox 2 contains a simple, efficient design as compared to the original Universe Sandbox. ""Home"" dispays system-included simulations under ""Open"" and also displays templates under ""Create"". You also have a ""Learn"" section where you learn different interesting facts of some interesting or bizzare objects in the Universe. The Properties Menu show the basic information of an object, climate information of the object, and the materials that made up the object.- Universe Sandbox 2 controls the timestep in lagging times. If the game thinks that the frame rate is too low, it automatically controls the timestep slower in order to make your experience with the game better.- The Giant Army is a friendly group that helps your solve your technical issues in Universe Sandbox 2. If you have any problems with your experience in Universe Sandbox 2, the developers are there to help. Just make sure that you post your problem on to either the Steam discussion group or the Universe Sandbox forums and they will (usually) give you a reply within 15 hours.			"

								In my first moments with it in SteamVR, I accidentally threw a clone of Earth's moon into Earth's orbit. It audibly and visibly crashed right into the first moon. Not knowing the controls, I could only watch in horror as the exploding mass collided with Earth, decimating the entire planet and turning it into an uninhabitable fireball. Eventually I figured out how to restart the simulation and undo my mistake. Naturally, when I restarted, relieved the Earth was safe again, the first thing I did was throw seven additional moons into orbit and watch the whole thing in slow motion. 5/5 would watch Earth blow up again.

								1. Start a sim of our solar system. 2. Decide pluto is under appreciated3. Make pluto 5 times the mass of the Sun4. Cause supernova and destroy the solar system5. Decide to go even further6. Reload and make pluto 99999999 times the mass of the Milky Way7. Create huge Black Hole and destroy everything within 998,957,086,655 light years of the Milky Way                                      WHO'S THE SMALL PLANET NOW EARTH!!!                                  10/10 Would bring about planetary justice again                            The irony is that I capitalized every celestial body accept pluto... Edit 1: In this game I learned that gravity acts as photons and not as an instentanious force. I am now more educationalz!!!			"

								This program is great to satisfy ones curiosity and is THE answer to all space related ""what if...?"" questions Hey what would happen if the Moon was only 10.000 km away from Earth?Hey what would it need to make Mars habitable?Hey what would happen if our Sun had a small brother?Ahh...I wish this program had already existed when I was 10 years old...So many galactic mysteries would have been solved.The game is for you if you are generally interested in space, planets and solar systems.It is similar to Kerbal Space Program in the notion that you learn a lot while playing it.But unlike Kerbal Space Program you have to entertain yourself, because, apart from a few scenarios, the game doesn´t provide something akin to a story or ""career mode"".Don´t look at Universe Sandbox as a game but as an interactive science book and physics lab where you can play god and hurl around black holes for fun or learn something about celestial bodies by creating your own solar system from scratch.

								I don't think I've ever experienced a game that has made me cry in awe. This game changed that. This is much more than a game. I'ts an experience that shows you just how microscopic we are in the grand scale of the universe. We're nothing, everything and all else inbetween, One simple change and our whole planet ceases to exist. Hopefully this ""game"" opens your eyes to just how delicate, frigaile and unique our very existence is. The universe is a beatiful, chaotic, and violent place which we barely understand. Download this and experience just how small we are. It's humbling. And beautiful. And tragic. And undeniably an example of how a ""game"" can change your whole outlook on the very thing we call life. 10/10			"

								I would say that this game is one of the only games that has really made me think about how small we really are, and to consider how slow time really is. This game will make you experiment with Planets, Black Holes and Stars, allowing you to learn Physics the fun and easy way. 10/10 (But there are a few bug fixes that need to be addressed). Get this game right now if you are in any way interested in space, or even just want to mess around for a bit. The money is a very very small price for this Amazing Game!!

								[!DISCLAIMER!] I always talk about how great this game is in my review. However, if this simulation or space genre doesn't interest you, you shouldn't be wasting your time reading these reviews in the first place.Anyways...ONWARDS! TO MY REVIEW!<------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Wow.This Is a good game.I mean, C'mon. That's a TOTAL understatement. All 65.5 Hours (and counting) i've spent on this game have been spent doing the same exact ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. That's how good this game is. You can spend a few days straight doing the same thing, and never get tired or bored of it. Want to smash a planet into Earth? SURE! Go ahead! Jupiter's just waiting to gobble up that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Want to smash another planet into Earth? WHY NOT? Neptune's getting pretty hungry too! Hell, why not restart the simulation and throw Uranus at Earth too.Screw it. Double tap that baby and throw The Sun at Uranus just to make sure anything on Earth AND Uranus is erased.The amount of fun that can be had playing this game is endless.This game has amazing visuals and (With some of the more recent updates) a beautiful, dynamic soundtrack that really accompanies the scale and feel of space. Perhaps not on a lonely or empty sense, but on an epic and awe-inspiring sense. But i'm sure you could care less about both. Just what can you do on this game, exactly?Well.You can, as i said, smash planets together with astoundingly awesome collision physics.Watch Galaxies collide.Admire the gravitational lensing effects of blackholesTerraform entire planets. (Then crash them into another planet)Disrupt the rings around Saturn with a larger celestial bodyHell, you can even spawn in the New Horizons Space craft and throw it at pluto, if you're so inclined.. . .That only barely scratches the SURFACE of the amount of features this game provides.I'll leave the rest for you to discover when you play this gorgeous game yourself!If you like space, or physics, this game is a great way to learn a little something too. Some of the detailed and functioning laws and physics in this simulation are not only good to look at, but also surprisingly accurate and can teach you a little basics.It's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.Buy it.It's worth your money.

								A wonderfull, wonderfull game indeed. Simply smash the moon into the earth while screaming ""Someone get Link!"" or creating your own solar system was never so much fun. You want to create your own planet? Easy! Simply generate a random planet, and make it habitatable if you wish so. Or make Alderaan or Hoth. Or you make it into a messed up creation of yours which will kill every lifeform after a few seconds. Everything is possible in US²!			"

								They say Minecraft is a good ""Educational Tool"" but I think this game could help kids and many people about our Solar System and how it works. I've played the original and it was fun and interesting, but this game is far more simplified and makes it way more fun to play whilst still teaching you about the Universe... but we all know why we bought the game, right? THE ENDLESS DESTRUCTION OF PLANETS! Yes, you can destroy Earth and the other planets as well as making your own planet, it's awesome fun but there are some issues with the way a planet cools down and stuff but nothing really major.Overall, I think the game is interesting a fun in the state it's in.Yet another perfect Early Access game.

								So after many countless hours of fun i thought it is time to write a review!The game is well put together and is very instresting and enjoyable the graphics are outstanding and the game itself is very unique! the game is really worth the purchase as its a game to always come back to because you can do so much! it truly is a unqie and terrific simulationOnly downfall is that the game can get a tad tidus and as after a while! you sort of realise that it the game does not get updated that regular which i think is a sham as the game itself is terrfic! I personally think that the next steps would be to add the feature of life, even just being able to see the life created thrive and possible but smart enough to build satalites and other space mechanics! just being able to see if you made a planet that could host life and you could actually see there satilites in orbit as if it was a moon and could see what the object looked like! also being able to see there shuttles created flw towards a planet or moon and would be easy to add as the flight path could look like an object on course to crash into the planet if you know what i mean. This may sound alot to add but personal think it would be a great idea and would add 1000+ hours onto my universal sandbox experince			"

Game: Universe Sandbox ²Genre: Space SimulatorDeveloper: Giant Army Publisher: Giant Army Copy supplied by developer Universe Sandbox ² is the sequel to the 2011 space simulator, developed and published by Giant Army. GRAPHICSThe game has improved a lot graphically compared to the original: there are many more particle effects, better textures, climate changes that affect the look of each planet and also great performance that makes this game playable on basically every system there is. GAMEPLAYIn this simulator, you can move planets, change their properties, spawn supernovas or black holes and see what happens. In addition to what was already in the first game, there is a more user-friendly UI, the possibility to modify the materials and climate of the different planets and many more to be added in the future. But you have to remember that this is not really a game, so you set your own goals: maybe you want to destroy the entire galaxy with a giant black hole, maybe you want Mars to transform into a supernova that burns other planets. The possibilities are endless. SOUNDThey have just added a soundtrack to the game, which is beautiful: it makes all the science and experiments more enjoyable and helps deliver a relaxing experience. REPLAYABILITYThe possibilities are truly endless, and as soon as you get the hang of it, you will start modifying all the different planets just to see what happens. Lovers of space simulators will play this for many years to come, also because the developers are constantly updating the game. I like to think that this is more of an actual software, than it is a game. If you like everything that is related to space, than this is a must-buy. It's a great sequel, and a relaxing game.

Early Access Review
								I've wanted this game for ages, pretty much since the day it was released but I finally saved up enough money to buy it for myself. And I've got to say, having played for 3 hours, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think ""oh god I'm spending £18.99"", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent £20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other. For the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha. By full release I don't think you'll ever be bored again!Seriously impressed.			"

								""The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena"" -Carl Sagan.Universe Sandbox 2 at its core is a mere physics simulator. Simple enough but the vastness of the scale is overwhelming. While quite the fantastic computer program alone, I strongly urge that one would enjoy it with the HTC Vive.  One may spend a moment above the Solar system and marvel at the orrery precision of the paths taken by the planets revolving in the middle of your room, and then fly in on your favorite planet to scrutinize at a naturalistic scale as a true behemoth careens by at a dwarfing 1:1 perspective.  Fire a few asteroids here and there to examine the unwavering momentum of whatever hapless body pulled it out of a straight trajectory, but you will find yourself depositing stars nearby such as Rigel which consider the entire Solar System to be a mere morsel.  There are things out there that are truly and terrifyingly massive.I have always had a passion for astronomy so this game is quite the treat.  My 60-year-old father has also taken to the game with an astonishing fervor so I bought him his very own Vive so he would stop bumming around my place hogging my video games. Alas, I have shown many friends and family members this game, often as an induction into VR as I set up a gorgeous scene and put them game on pause to then have them put the headset on to blow their minds.  My favorite scenario is a few planets being vaporized as they rotate perilously close to a violent neutron star.  I find myself teaching others about ""what the ♥♥♥♥ am I looking at?"" and ""why is it doing that thing?"" and ""this stuff really exists!?"" and ""why is space so damn beautiful?"".  Dispensing moments of pure astonishment has become a past time. I've become the Carl Sagan of my living room as I take people on my Ship of the Imagination to show them what vast ocean teems beyond their small island of which they know.If you hold the beauty of the cosmos in reverence, I suggest you try this game out on VR. Nothing quite compares to having lunch in orbit around the Earth and then releasing a generous salvo of Moons at it and reveling in your wanton destruction. Then you add hydrogen gas until the Earth becomes a gas giant, then a brown dwarf, full star, neutron star, black hole, then grow that black hole until its more massive than the observable universe and then you win the game! Mwuahahaha!!  Who wants to be Space God when you can be Space Devil? The universe is your sandbox.Dad quit hogging my sandbox.			"

								Universe Sandbox 2 is one of those games whose title describes what you're about to buy.It offers you a complete freedom in creating your own little world and do with it what your heart desires. And that world is not limited to just planets or asteroids, but extends to objects as small as a pair of dice and as large as the biggest galaxy in our universe. You are essentially playing as a cosmological god, creating and destroying; terraforming and making places go extinct.This is one of the best if not the best space games available out there and although there is not true storyline or purpose in it, you will definitely be able to enjoy creating and destroying things as long as you have a bit of imagination.I've used this game as a tool to teach about astronomy, astrophysics and even history and have definitely enjoyed every moment of my time in this game.It is still not perfect and far from being the ultimate space sandbox, but it is as close to the ultimate space game as you can currently get.The team is very dedicated to making this game great and is very quick to respond to bugs, comments or concerns.Give this a go, you won't regret it.Check out my 100s of videos of this title here:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9hNFus3sjE7jgrGJYkZeTpR7lnyVAk-xHere's one of the recent examples where I recreated Skyrim universe using the game:

								This is a very interesting game, especially for those who are interested in Astrology and Physics on a Cosmic level. Despite being fairly easy on graphics and the CPU (unless you go nuts with the amount of simulated objects, time scale, or try to zoom in on a supernova), this will accurately simulate the size, position, movment, mass rotation, general appearance, temperature, magnetic fields, basic composition, and gravitational fields of known stars, planets, planetoids, asteroids, black holes etc. In addition to being packed with pre-made simulations of the Solar System (major planets only, planets and major moons, all moons, or even every known object in the solar system - there is a surprising amount of them) you can change everything that is simulated at will. Alter the positions, rotations, from the size and mass down to the composition and temperature, everthing is adjustable. You can remove and place objects at whim, either standing still or with a predetermined vector. You can even mess with their mass and composition by manually adding material to them - add enough hydrogen to the sun and it will turn into a blue star! The game also simulates collisions between all the objects to a limited degree, considering the scale of the collisions. This truly is a facinating creation that I look forward to seeing grow and develop.			"

								This is a really good physics simulator, at the same time i feel sad because it reminds me that my one true goal in life that overshados everything, is the fact that i hoplessly crave to be immortal. and being immortal is the key word that motivates my LOSER habit with no friends i live in. I don't wanna die.

								So its 11:41 during the night, and I had a fantastic day. Im thinking of so much stuff, but it's time for sleep. What better way to unwind from the day then a beautiful, stunning, relaxing game. I see this game, and look at the photos, and some of the video, and I buy it. I play it for a little while, looking at a breathtaking universe colliding simulation, and then create saturn with an astroid belt around it, and moons around it. I was finally unwinding from my day, relaxing by creating these beautiful, just amazing things, and doing things I could only dream of, and making those things a virtual reality. And the music, its so, so peaceful.I recommend this game to everyone, especaily the people who love space, this game is worth all of the money you put into it, maybe even a little extra.			"

								I have only played this game in VR, and it is truly an amazing experience. The the scale of these astronomical objects is staggering. Shrank down to 1:1 scale to marvel at the size of the earth/moon. Created a betelgeuse on either side for lighting. After about fifteen minutes, I started to notice that they were getting closer together. Looked away from my little sytstem I'd created and saw space warping around the edges. Flipped out and frantically started flying out as the two stars started to collide in slow motion behind me, walls of nuclear fire closing in from either side. Escaped just before they went supernova, leaving behind a really pretty planetary nebula. 10/10 would use betelgeuse for lighting again.That said, a *lot* of the features have not been implemented or don't work fully in VR, and the tools are really very clumsy-- or example, the dispenser doesn't work very well or very precisely at all, and scaling the view while it's locked onto a planet makes everytthing disappear into the distance for some reason. It's incredibly difficult to actually create anything stable (near-impossible really) and very, very easy to go mad with power and start bombarding everything with moons which is... cathartic, but not necessisarily productive.

								REVIEW:Rated into my favorite 'masterpieces' game category, Universe Sandbox ² is a full-fledged simulator of the universe, capable of showing the player real physics, real science, and a real universe, without asking for too much of your computer.PROS:- Beautiful physics, capable of simulating all of the aspects of the universe, without breaking any laws.- Amazing and inspiring soundtrack.- Isn't capable of frying your computer. It doesn't ask for much.CONS:- If you add too many objects, you're gonna have a bad time.- Can get pretty boring sometimes, maybe because you just don't find what to do.WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?Yes. Absolutely. Go play it. Have fun blowing up tons of planets over & over again.			"

								""I'll show you!"" you sputter in rage, spittle rolling out the corner of your mouth. ""I'll show all of you!"" You flee out of the conference hall, clutching your precious work to your chest, tears of shame and rage streaming down your face, as you storm away from the Imperial Society for Impossible Science. (Yes, the initialism is under review pending recent geopolitical developemnts.)Alone in your laboratory, in your Victorian mansion, at the top of the mountain, in the middle of a thunderstorm, and other such idioms, you try to return to your experiments, your work, but soon find yourself lost in dreams of revenge towards your former colleagues. Friends, you thought, though you now know better. Their peals of laughter still echo in your mind. Tormented as you are, you finally reach the conclusion that only the most total, complete revenge will sate you: the total destruction of the earth itself. Life. Pah. If the end product of life are apes that cannot appreciate your brilliance, clearly the whole thing was a mistake. A mistake that you are more than happy to correct.Your newly found nihilistic passions drive you towards this most ultimate solution: to what fraction of the speed of light must you accelerate a common tiny celestial body -- a comet perhaps -- so as to totally liquify the earth's crust? It seems easy enough to calculate. Ah, but how to check your calculations? Brilliant though you are, you have been known to misplace a decimal place here and there, in your excitement. And your lone companion Igor, capable manservant though he may be, and very handy with a pickaxe in a graveyard, is hardly equal to this more intellectual task.Enter Universe Sandbox. Place celestial bodies where you like. Send them where you like. Check your calculations through simulation. Get your revenge. Because wouldn't it be embarrassing if you meant to liquify the earth, but wound up causing only yet another mass extinction?Seriously, this is lots of fun. If you wind up using this program for anything other than destroying the earth over and over and over in new and exciting ways, you are made of sterner stuff than I.It's also great for teaching young kids, at least at an intuitive level, orbital mechanics, the concept of kinetic energy, and why two planetary mass objects, when they bump into each other, behave slightly differently than two small balls rolling across the living room floor.Pro tip: if, upon witnessing the total, irretrievable extinction of all life on earth, your five-year-old daughter asks, ""could this ever happen in real life,"" answer with something a bit more reassuring than ""probably not, but you never know."" That is, unless you like getting up at 2 AM every night for the better part of a month. Sigh.			"

The graphics for this iteration are superb and the physics are as good as the first version, if not better. Not for everyone, of course, and while you can smash planets together in Planetary Annihilation, the physics of this sim are certainly better. Creating your very own solar system is a rewarding activity, as is smashing a Mars-sized object into the Earth and seeing if a lunar object results. You won't find a better simulation of, well, anything. VERY highly recommended.			"

								Whether you want to understand how the universe currently functions or want to blow a lot of stuff repeatedly, this game can do both realistically at the same time.More seriously though ,this ""game"" (I'd rather call it something more special than just that, but I can't find the words.) also had a special effect on me, it made me realise how small we actually are compared to everything that is out there. It made me comprehend how fragile life really is and how special we are for being able to say that life as we know it, is precious.Thus, It has personnally enhanced my current understanding of a lot of fundemental phenomenons that I simply couldn't picture properly solely by reading texts explaining them seperately. This game is the big picture.  Just to name a few:- Picturing the Moon cycle- Seeing how the Greenhouse effect affects everything- Viewing a suprinsigly accurate explanation for the formation of the moon- Understanding how two galaxies will eventually collide - Comprehending how gravity plays a role in everything- Many many more.I wish people were as stoked to get this ""game"" as they are for the latests AAA titles. So that another slightly better version would come out each year. And I'd buy it wholeheartedly.			"

								Here's how my first sitting with this game went. I decided that Pluto was underrated so I increase its mass and shot a Jupiter at it. It then turned into a ball of fire. Then the entire rest of the solar system started orbiting around it. PLUTO IS THE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE! Pluto then went in an entirely different direction from the newly reformed solar system. I wasn't happy with that so I reloaded everything and I shot what once was Pluto directly at the sun and caused a supernova. PLUTO HAS BEEN AVENGED!In all seriousness, this game shows how cool science can be, and therefore this game is cool and definitely worth your time.			"

								In the first 10 minutes I made Jupiter 0.1 the mass of the Sun while keeping a similar diameter to the original Jupiter. The new Jupiter-star promptly ejected Saturn and captured Ceres and Vesta into a lunar orbit. Mercury got hit by a Kuiper belt object that was displaced by Saturn on her way out, Mercury then rather quickly fell into the Sun. Also the Earth entered another ice age for a reason I have not yet deciphered.10/10 Would destroy solar system again			"

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a great game for people that enjoy astronomy of any kind. It has so much within it that you will probably learn a lot from the game, whether it's new celestial bodies, or how the materials within a planet affect it's mass, water levels, etc. You get to play around with different tools that let you see what really happens when you collide certain objects together, or you can just slow down to real time and study a simulation you've created.Really, it's a great game for anyone that likes space and playing God.

								You can do so much in this game, want to throw a Black Hole at the Solar system and see what happens? You can do that. Want to send the Moon or Mars on a collision course with the Earth and watch as landmasses are consumed by the fire and lava from the explosion? You can do that.Want to make a fully functioning solar system with planets filled with life? You can do that.Basically, if it's in space and obeys the laws of physics, you can do it.10/10 would burn, freeze, and smash Earth again.			"

Before you buy the game, understand that it is a ""SANDBOX"", and that there's no objectives, only you could make it fun for yourself!I hope this was useful :)Song used in video:

Basically you are given the powers of God to play with physics and the universe at your leisure. If you have VR do yourself a favor and crank the scale to 1:1, switch a controller to fly mode and tag along with an orbiting body. 10/10, would stick face directly into the collission of two galaxies and go blind again.

Looking at Universe Sandbox 2This game is just AMAZING! Very realistic, and doesn't glitch much unless you do manual work, or pure luck. The new update is amazing, atleast alpha 19. It added shockwaves (Which look amazing), tidal forces (could make the fragments go everywhere, depending where the forces are really going, and make craters), and much much more! These people acctually work hard on this, and not make lazy updates like some other games (Not counting Valve, because its a team, not the whole company). I wouldn't be suprised if they added a update adding real landscape (I hope your working on that <3) and some other cool thing like seeing inside planets, gas giants, evo(?)planets, suns, black holes, and much much more. I would love if they could add a tool where you can see the break up of the planet via rock, mantle, core, and making the craters much more noticeable. I would also like if you can add a small detial of giant waves when a metor hits water, which I don't expect to be perfect, but nothing is ;). Another thing, can you please make binary systems more stable(?), and make it easier to make triple, quad, etc? That would be very nice, because I want to make a quad system. To end off, I recommend this game like if it was a free, no glitched game where you can do whatever you want, IF you like space, pyhsics, or explodisons.			"

								This simulator has tackled the complexity of maths and physics, put it into an engine and sells it straight to the customer. The customer may not know about inclination or Kepler's laws of planetary motion but it still somehow gets through as a sandbox to the customer and that has to be an acheivement. We all have to agree, this is a magestic simulator. Dynamics are taken into account at every opportunity and the way the simulator delivers, its breathtaking. It's not even done yet. How simple parameters can change properties from the orbital period to the planetary climate, changing as the orbit progresses or viewing Phobos orbiting Io which is orbiting Earth from the view point of Io. Would recommend this simulator if you want to spend time learning and having fun at the same time. Now, not many games do that. I have been suppporting this series since the first released and supported this one before it was even early access. Universe Sandbox was actually the first ever game I got on Steam.And I do not regret it. 10/10, already has more features than the original game. Get the game and enjoy its bugs now!			"

I've wanted this game for ages, pretty much since the day it was released but I finally saved up enough money to buy it for myself. And I've got to say, having played for only 1 hour, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think ""oh god I'm spending $19.99"", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent $20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other. 
For the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha. By full release I don't think you'll ever be bored again!

Seriously impressed. "

								I have a very deep fetish of space related things. Universe Sandbox 1 kept me very entertained for hours, and though I do not have a ton of time in US2 it is still a great platform for those who have a deep desire to learn. It's been a great tool to use while watching documentaries, reading articles online, and just general experimentation and exploration.The ONLY thing that makes me sad about this game is the complete and total dedication to JUST being a physics simulator.  Look, I know that's the point of this program, that doesn't mean however that it's the only thing it could be used for.  Everytime I've seen a great suggestion on the forums for a feature that isn't specifically space related is, ""Oh well it's a physics simulator, why would they have feature x?""The reason why they should consider features x, y, or z, is that while it's a decent physics simulator, it could be a much more powerful learning tool if they could only stop limiting theirselves with this frame of mind.This has been a retort to all manner of features such as:- Weather- A ""Human"" type feature such as ISS models, or small spaceships- Having places labeled with landmarks (Such as a text box showing Olympus Mons location on Mars)- Even people suggesting a grid system showing a bend in spacetime for the various planets showing their gravitation impactsI wish there was a competitor out that would take advantage of these great suggestions if US2 is not. And it's totally not just so I can plan the destruction of Alderaan.			"

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a masterfully done game. It's gameplay is deep and incredibly fun, and the graphics are surprisingly beautiful. I would reccomend it wholeheartedly. It does have flaws, but they are minor enough to not hamper my enjoyment.Pros --My favorite part of the game is the collisions, which look and feel amazing. It has never been this satisfying to launch the moon at Austrailia, vaporizing the continent and melting the earth's surface.-The soundtrack of the game is really nice, which is surprising considering it's not the game's main appeal at all.-There's more to do than just collisions. You can create solar systems, experiment with atmospheres, terraform barren planets, and much more. With enough imagination, you can do anything.-Lots of premade scenarios for you to play around with.-Easy to use UI.-It can even be educational, in some cases.-The developers seem to be great people, and communicate a lot with their fanbase.-It's very polished. The framerate is smooth and I haven't encountered many major glitchesCons--It isn't updated very often, but that's understandable for such a complex game.-The soundtrack, while beautiful, has very few tracks. Only about four or five.-The physics engine sometimes breaks down, but only if you push it too hard and often it breaks in hilarious ways.-You may lose intrest after a point, but only way after you've gotten your money's worth.Overall, it's a great game with one or two nitpicky flaws that aren't important at all.8.5/10			"

								The is the most violent game in the universe, literally. You can crash Mars into the earth and watch as the planet melts! So, if you like hurting people, there are suddenly much more catostrophic ways to do it, and for most people, this is just a fun way to screw with physics and see what will happen. Or watch galxies collide in real time, or see what happens when you make mercury out of nothing but hydrogen, or if you add a ton of CO2 to the earth, or when the sun goes supernova, and plenty of other odd things. If Universe Sandbox 1 was fun, this this is ~30,000 times better. If you run out of things to do, find something new, try somthing a different way, there is always going to be something to see.So, what's not to like?(Oh yeah, it's also Early Access, so give it some slack people! Not everything is here yet!)			"

								I can't say this game isn't good, that'd be a lie. It just isn't for me. I've given it multiple shots, and had fun everytime, but lack the capabilites to bring it to its full potential. Instead of having fun with my own little solar systems like I wanted, I just end up getting frustrated when I can't get things to work as desired. Not to the point of it dampening my experience, mind you. This game gives you the ability to destroy entire galaxies, but I want to use it for more specific reasons that I haven't quite figured out yet. If you feel like supporting the devs for Black Hole Simulater 2016, this game might be for you. But don't blame them when you eventually get bored of it. If you love science and especially astronomy, this game is perfect for you. It gives you enough control to make you the puppet master of your own little solar systems, once you figure out how to control them.TL;DRGood game. Destruction is fun, but not fun enough to justify a purchase unless you just want to support the devs. But it is a fantastic learning/science game for those interested.			"

								Do you like astronomy? Do you like space? Do you like smashing two planets together in a fiery explosion? If you answered yes to anything of these questions, then this game is for you! Universe Sandbox 2 is a simulator that lets you experiment on an astronomical level, spawning stars, moons, planets, and pulsars. Create solar sytems (or destroy them), explode stars and watch them go supernova. Its like a star gazing book, except much more fun and interactive. Plus, its real science-y, with accurate data to simulate our own solar system, or a random one... or anything, really. This is a gravity simulator at heart. Orbits, eccentricity, Inclination, velocity, etc. It comes with dozens of pre-made simulations. However, make no mistake, the rest is icing on the cake.Okay, so now its time for more specificity. Features of the game include stellar evolution, climate simulation, full body fragmentation, light pulses, saving/loading sims, bodies, galaxies (galaxies are WIP for right now), and objects. First is stellar evolution, which is the process of stars aging until they die. You could sit there and watch a star for a billion years in real-time until it dies, or just take the easy route and speed it up. Next is climate simulation, this works the best with earth for right now. When climate is enabled for a body in the simulation, the polar ice caps (specifically for earth), you can visaully see snow expand and recede as it obits the sun. At some point in the future, climate should become more fleshed out, but for the most part, the climate feature is a nice touch.I won't go over the whole list, as some are self-explanatory (and there's just too much to list anyway), but the stellar evolution, climate, and light pulses are the main ones, the rest just ties it together, and nicely, I may add. Anyway, light pulses can be ""pinged"" off any object you want in a simulation. Emitting a light pulse from an object will then travel through space. Watching a light pulse in real-time is probably the most amazing. It lets you visualize the speed at which light travels through space. And as far as I know, it is supposed to be accurately simulated, traveling at the speed of light. For light to travel in the ""Our Solar System"" simulation, from the sun to Neptune took 4 hours, just like in real life.  Same with sun-to-earth, 8 minutes. That's awesome!To sum up, if you're a fan of simulator games, and have an appreciation for astronomy, you'll probably enjoy this game/sim. There is no other simulator that does it quite like US2. The size and scale at which Universe Sanbox 2 simulates is in a league all its own. The game recieves regular updates (I was in the closed alpha before it hit steam), and the devs are actively engaged in making it better. They take time to make sure its right. Each update to the game only continues to add to an already amazing simulator! :DNow, only one last order of business: I deleted earth. Why are we still here?- 10/10 would delete earth again -			"

								I love this playground / simulator!You can witness a ton of beautiful and bizarre objects in scenarios Universe Sandbox 2.The Developer, Giant Army, adds new features all the time, and they're quite cool.One of my favorites is Roche Limits where orbiting bodies experiencing a lot of tidal forces break apart.The number of details for so many orbiting bodies is staggering, yet the simulation appears to run smooth on my rig up to just about any number of objects.The graphics and art are very well done, and the planets, stars, and other objects are very detailed.The game seems like it might be a little challenging at first, but I had great fun in getting suprised with many of the powers and their effects.  There's also a good tutorial, I think.If you like sandboxes, especially sciencey ones, I think you'll find none better than Universe Sandbox 2. "

								Wow, well they have really pumped this baby full of steroids. Not a game, more an experience, and a galactic sized one at that. There is just too much to mention, so let's simplify it : You are God, and the universe is your playground. Play.Now because this is jam packed with new amazing simulation features I do seem to be getting a big performance hit, but I am soon to upgrade my pretty old rig so I will ignore this for the moment. But beware, it's a heavy simulation with a lot going on at the same time and will tax your comp.An example of something you might do : Create a simple Earth and Moon in their usual orbit, and then tell the Moon to explode. And then watch about 50 molten moon fragments as they plummet headlong towards Earth. Watch as some form new moons in oribit around Earth, and some that get pulled in for a spell of Dinosaur shagging sky death.Amazing. 10/10.			"

								This is truly an incredible sequel to what is one of the best simulators on Steam! This program feels more like sophisticated simulation software than an actual game in functionality, but it's incredibly user-friendly and easy to use; I use this game as a very effective visual aid for tutoring, as well as a time killer. The developers certainly don't skimp on their research, as frequent updates reflect some of the most current events in astronomy: there was a simulation of the New Horizons encounter with Pluto as the real deal was making headlines! Explorative tutorials are informative without spewing a bunch of numbers and facts all at once; yet they provide links for further enrichment, as well as pure number-crunching horsepower for those who are curious and want to tweak the gritty details and properties that bind the universe together. It's Early Access right now, but their bugs at this point are few and very far between. Updates are very frequent, and more often than not they include newly added features and simulations.The dynamic graphics for complex events such as climate patterns and planetary collisions are getting better and more refined with each update. This program offers an incredible amount of functionality, is visually appealing, and accompanied with a beautifully ambiant soundtrack. I've never been so relaxed breaking gravity and then playing billiards with all of the planets!This title completely blows its predecessor out of the water! I would highly reccommend for all those casual gamers and science fans out there. More people need to get this title - it has limitless potential for a Steam Workshop feature. For what you get, the game is set at a remarkably reasonable price - definitely worth scooping this one up!			"

								If you like smashing things, this is a good purchase, I guess.But if you like simulating things, this can be annoying, I can't add nitrogen particles and atmospheres do not contain nitrogen. Gravity may not always work correctly, I also canot edit the orbits very easily to make things slowly collide. Similarly, it is hard to 'terraform'  mars carefully, I end up with a 2 earth mass behemoth, by accident.Admittedly, I need to spend more time in this, but in my first impressions of Universe Sanbox, I cannot help but be a little bit disapointed.

								One of my wishes for vive was games where I could just lay down and watch stuff happen while I wave my hands around as stuff happens listening to dumb music. This is one of those games you can do that with. It's pretty and interesting. It's appealing trying to get a bunch of tiny celestial bodies to orbit a large one so they smash into it as they change colour, or even use the emitters to write stuff in space and see it drift into nothingness.The optimisation is alright, runs pretty smooth until you try to spawn a bunch of stars inside of one another and they explode and everything goes white. White, as any vive user is bound to either know or find out sooner or later, is the least pleasant thing to be bombarded with in VR. It's fascinating though, there's a bunch of pre-loaded scenarios and objects to play with, will give you a few hours of fun to play with.			"

								If someone would have told me at a young age that when I grow older, I will don the HTC Vive and start throwing around planets and suns and s***. If someone had told me that, when I was like 9-10 then I most likely would go insane and do nothing but wait for that faithful day.Even now I have a hard time accepting that I am currently playing ins space in Virtual Reality.The first time I started the game I did what everyone would have done, bombarded the Earth with its own moon repeatedly, the Earth unsurprisingly exploded into a hot light show, and it was glorious. But then my ambitions grew.I picked the random planet option prepared to spawn a gas giant a couple clicks away. Anyways, my finger slipped, and I managed to spawn it right in front of the Earth which sent it crashing into the gas giant.Before I had time to react the Earth had hit the Gas giant and my computer shut down, the Vive went completely dark; there was no sound in my earplugs, and I just stood there wondering if I just killed myself and everybody on planet Earth because I miss clicked. (This only happened once mind you, haven't had a problem with it since)Anyhow here's the VR verdict:Gameplay: Fun but lacking some functions, would like to design my own planet, sun or most of all create black holes.Graphics: It's an incredibly colorful game, you stand long in awe after putting two planets on a collision course.Smoothness: With a lot happening on the screen at once you may expect some lagging in head movements even on the most powerful of computers.Bugs\glitches: I keep being unable to use one of my controllers at startup of the game, I'm unable to choose anything but the moon.

								Good game.  I would definitely reccomend it, but some of the main features dont quite add up yet.  They say ther are impact craters, but there are none.  Climate control is coming soon, and textures can be a bit pixel-ly.  Maybe just my version (alpha 16 post release update), but i think in time this will be worth the money.  Right now tho, no.			"

								While I can't get technical with it, I love space based games, (Kerbal Space Program, Stellaris, Eve Online) and I like most sandbox games (Anything from The Powder Toy, to Little Big Planet, Minecraft, and G-Mod), and have always had an interest in astronomy. Needless to say, this game is a keeper for me simply due to it's genre and execution. I highly recommend this if you are into astronomy of any sort.			"

								From the little amount of time i've actually spent using this universe simulator I can already tell you that it is one of the best sims out there to buy if you are into physics and space. You can do do realistic simulations like create your very own solar system, or just make really rediculous scenarios like a baseball bigger then Jupiter colliding with Earth. Either way it's alot of fun and interesting to see what you can create or destroy. Best part of all the developer is active and constantly fixing issues the game has so props to you for that. In conclusion due to all of this I can't see any reason why you shouldn't pick up this amazing space sim 10/10 for amazing concept and actively updating the game			"

This game is omega fun on the other side and there isn't many bad things about it other then gliches, I just like destroying the Earth then turning it into another planet :^)This game is only in Alpha 17, there are way more things that lay ahead of it, and if you see this review when it is the full version, GET THE GOD DAMN GAME ALREADY, THESE GUYS WHO MADE IT ARE A-M-A-ZING.

This game is super fun, and I'd also consider it a good way to relieve stress!I'd like to be able to make a ring system by putting an object within a larger object's Roche limit. however, at the moment the fragments eventually disappear, which is rather disappointing.

I hope everyone who gets it get to experince what I learning right now in school.####Pros#### Zoom feature with the scroll wheel and feel like your on the planet. Make the planets your own so you can make meteorite hit and the planet will shrink. Make the planets differnt elements from the periodic tablee H20 and C20####Cons#### Still in beta when will the stable version be out. Music is very annoying.

								This game is truly amazing in graphics, gravity ECT. It does need some improvements on the planets surface and the interface is a little confusing for new players. This game can also get boring if you play so much. There is sadly, not much to do. Other than this, it is an extremely good game so I give it a +1.(It's worth $20 SO BUY IT!)			"

								This game is fantastic, both as a fun means of playing with the universe and as a way of testing hypothesis in a classroom setting. I'm currently taking an introduction to Astronomy course in college and a lot of the questions that pop up (""What would happen if the sun ceased to exist?"") I can literally pop open this game and test out. For example:

								This is one of the most visually stunning sandbox (game) I have ever experienced. It really puts our solar system to scale and humanity to scale. The sheer size of some of the the objects in this simulation blows my mind.  The collision effects in this simulation are the best I have seen in any (game).There is something vunrable about tha because whn you collide an astriod into earth it shows how fragile our planet is and how just a little disturbance in the system can completely change earths orbit and its surface. The music really adds a sense of awe and wonder. It also adds a sense of scale. The simulations can teach you a lot about how the universe works and it also shows events that happened billions of years ago which is awesome.One of my favourite thngs to do in Universe Sandbox is putting a star called Betelguese next to our solar system. This star is huge and when I say huge I mean HUGE!. This thing dwarfs our sun. The supernova explosions are the most sprctacular features I have ever seen Anyone who is going to eperience this. Your perspective of humanity may vastly change.For an early access game 10/10. Looking forward for new improvements! "

								Universe sandbox is a sandbox.About the universe.I know that comes as a shocker, but wait, there's more! Alright, so, this is the sequel to the original Universe Sandbox, how you make a sequel to something with no story, well, I'm not entirely sure, in that case, I think it's just a big update. But I've been wrong before, so, I dunno'.I really am just going to focus on the things they changed, not the whole game itself. And there are things that you should be able to figure out for yourself, anyway.First!The best thing, the most important thing, the thing that everyone cares about...The climate system!The destruction engine!This is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious, I swear.Even if you hate happiness, you will love this. Even if you're like, a terrorist, and they're like the children of Mister Grinch.There is terrain deformation, fragmentation, friction, gravitational destruction, it's all there, and it's all amazing.This is destruction on a scale I can recognize, and unlike the original one where things just popped, this one, they break up, they shatter, those shards, they orbit, then they break apart, and they orbit. Speaking of which,Orbital mechanics.They improved this as well.I don't know how many of you actually played the first one, but if you guys ever tried to speed things up while something was in orbit, it wouldn't treat it as speeding up, it would treat it as high velocity, so orbits will just break up super easily so you had to actually wait for things.Yeah, well, they fixed that. It works.Like it should.And like I said before didn't get to, the climate.This is improved, again, in the old one, things wouldn't change because of climate. They would just be hot or cold. And it wouldn't do anything. But in this one, water will evaporate, superhot planets turn things like iron into liquid, all that jazz, and on that note, the planets and ♥♥♥♥.Again, old one, you couldn't make random planets, and they didn't have materials, so you had to find the texture in the game or come up with your own. Yeah, well they fixed that, as well. You can make entirely random planets, with entirely random compositions, entirely random looks, and then,you can change themYou can make all kinds of ♥♥♥♥, huge iron chunks, entirely habitable island planets, gas giants, cloudy hurricane planets (kamino!), anything you can think of.There's obviously too much ♥♥♥♥ to list in here, but just trust me when I say:You can do anything.I would definitely recommend this game to sandbox game fans, and people who are into... space, I guess?(the only thing you can't do is make a rock ♥♥♥♥ but why you would even do that is beyond me)			"

								There have been a great many attempts to try and place the universe into a perspective, however, the problem with trying to do so is that humans don't have a comparison. for example, we KNOW that the milky was galaxy is incredibly small in the eyes of the whole universe. We don't however understand it completley. knowing is only half of it, there is no reasonable way to compare our planet to any other without treading into the realms of obsertity or disbelief in the attempt to understand how big everything is. so while i was playing i compared a black hole to a sagitarius A another black hole and my zoom out was incredible. but when you see those numbers like how big it is in our human numerical systems you can't get the hole picture because the software is designed to let you see everything and sure when you go and zoom into the black hole and you see the larger one looming amously over the event horrizon you say "" hey cool that black hole is as big as 10 million of our suns."" but then you look at our son and all it is is a dot in our sky. we can never fathom how big it really is when all we see is graphs and illistrations from a human point of view rather than the real point of view of how big it is. we use numbers to measure how big things are, but we don't imagine how big things really are in the real world because we will never see these things. in conclusion, this game is very well made and extremely enjoyable  but numbers and comparisons to huge things are just not helping people understand how big it is. i give this game a 10/10 ign (sorry for the rant and boring read, these were just thoughts that were bugging me. so it might not be structured as arduosly as a regular paragraph)			"

								A much improved version of the first game, it vastly expands the previous featureset and improves the UI and general tooling. A must buy if you loved the first one.But, this game being Early Access, it has some rough edges that I hope will be corrected in the future, such as the still very incomplete planet surface composition and climate simulation. The simulator also still can't correctly simulate things such as tidal forces tearing satellites apart when they cross the Roche Limit, which was something I missed from the first version and I hoped would be implemented in this one.But overall the experience has been very good so far.

								A much improved version of the first game, it vastly expands the previous featureset and improves the UI and general tooling. A must buy if you loved the first one.But, this game being Early Access, it has some rough edges that I hope will be corrected in the future, such as the still very incomplete planet surface composition and climate simulation. The simulator also still can't correctly simulate things such as tidal forces tearing satellites apart when they cross the Roche Limit, which was something I missed from the first version and I hoped would be implemented in this one.But overall the experience has been very good so far.

								Well, I don't have much to say, I'm speechless for all the right reasons. A game like this has been my dream for years, and now it's actually happening! You can just screw around with planets' climates and gravity and throw them at stars and whatever - and the graphics are fluid, there's virtually no bugs or glitches, absolutely amazing. Hopefully there will be even more new features in future, like the addition of extra materials like uranium to simulate the heat from an internal core, and methane, magnesium, and other chemicals and compounds to simulate chemical reactions and impact the colour of planets and behaviour of their surfaces. The game is already amazing as it is though, it's a gravity and a climate and a massive epic explosion simulator! Seriously worth the price!			"

								(21/9+10 ign mlg) hitler sim 2016Before my first contact with this game, I had a life, a wife, two kids, a nice house and also a car. Then, I met Universe Sandbox. This game was exactly what I needed to be happy. I am a new guy now. My undies are always brown as I am so addicted that I can't leave my chair. My house has trash and rotten food all over the floor because I can't stop playing this. I am not sure, but looks like my wife went away with my children and my car. I am all by myself now. No time to care about this, tho. This is the most amazing sandbox game ever made. I am still looking for the sand, tho. 2,222 hours in and no sand yet. But I hope it will appear someday. I will keep looking for it.It's the best game ever made. The whole mankind needs to know about this masterpiece. It's a huge universe building tool where you can even make planets crash and bring disaster and death everywhere. This is what I call bloody. If you think that The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 are the best games ever made, go learn a bit more about games and figure out that Universe Sandbox is the ultimate masterpiece. It's better than sex.I still wonder where the sand is. 10/10 Would ruin my whole life again. No Regrets.*It's not serious, in case you are wondering*The game is pretty fun. Worth buying.			"

								I'll be honest here. I LOVE science; especially space. In fact I want to be an astronomer. This game is realy cool, and I love sandboxes, but I think there's TOO much freedom. I'm not the kind of person who screams in terror or excitment when two celestial bodies collide together. The game is good in the fact of realism. For example, I learned about a star that's 11.5 km across from playing this game. That is very interesting to me, to learn that a star can be that small, but honestly, I could've learned that anyway, without paying $25 for it. It's just hard for me to stay interested in the game, but whoever's reading this might be different.			"

								The first calculation comes from Kepler's Third Law (shown below), where 'G'  is Newton's Gravitational Constant.The period, 'P', is the orbital period of the exoplanet, and comes directly from the measured period using, for example, the transit or radial velocity detection methods (Detection Methods page). The mass of the star, 'M', was calculated above using the mass-luminosity relationship of stars. Finally, the mass of the exoplanet, 'm', in the equation can be ignored, since it is much smaller than the mass of the parent star. As an example, since the Sun is about three hundred thousand times heavier than the Earth, ignoring the mass of the Earth in this calculation woud introduce an error of less than 0.001%. The equation can be solved for the only remaining variable which is the orbital radius, 'a'. Once the orbital radius has been determined, the mass of the planet can be calculated using Newton's Law of Gravitation shown below. Here, 'G' is once again the Gravitational constant, 'm1' is the mass of the parent star, 'r' is the orbital radius (this was 'a' in the equation above), and 'Fg' is the force of gravity betwe- Oh, the game? Yeah, its fine.			"

You will be surprised how much fun it is watching your home burn.11/10 would annihilate the sun and burn the planets again.  "

								Although I only have about an hour on this game, I can tell you that this it is worth buying. It showcases the beauty of outer space, and can also show you various scenarios. You can also cause come chaos, such as by launching the Moon at the Earth and watching the effects. Overall, I'd say it's worthing purchasing, especially if you are into the study of space-related things, or just want to sit back and admire the beauty of it.			"

								I love Universal Sandbox and have had lots of fun with it through the years.  I am glad that I bought into Universal Sandbox 2 to help it's developers out.  No matter what happens with the program, it is money well spent for someone who loves astronomy.  Initially, I struggle with the interface, not that it is bad, it just doesn't feel quite right.  I look for menus at the top of the screen not the bottom (at least in the PC World) and I depend on right-clicking for guidance and fail-safe options when I get lost.  In this program, Right-Clicking does nothing, a major oversight.  There is no obvious way to set the date.  In my way of thinking, that should always be an option since my greatest interest on any given night is how the universe looks from my back yard.  I have ipad apps that do this better and I expect more from a well-developed PC program like this.  This user is not sure why it always has to start on some date in 2014 and moves forward.  The developers were quick to respond to my comments in a very positive way.  That in itself makes me put it on the recommend list.  They are aware of these issues and indicate that they will work to address the program's shortcomings.  Now that I sort of have the interface figured out, there are many fun things to do with this program.  Looking forward to using it as-is and for improvements in the future.If you love astronomy, you will enjoy this if you don't mind a few oddities and rough edges.			"

								Honestly, in my opinion, it's very hard to pin one favorite feature of this simultion down, so I'll have to settle for two. But it's easily the colliding galaxies simulation and the supernova in-real-time simulation. They're both gorgeous and immersive. This game just makes me wish I owned an occulus so I could have the illusion of seeing it from my own eyes. It's genuinely the prettiest game I've ever played. It is simulation perfection. It makes me really think about, and become highly interested in, the cosmos, and for someone who gets D grades in physics, that's a kinda big deal.... "

								The first calculation comes from Kepler's Third Law (shown below), where 'G'  is Newton's Gravitational Constant.The period, 'P', is the orbital period of the exoplanet, and comes directly from the measured period using, for example, the transit or radial velocity detection methods (Detection Methods page). The mass of the star, 'M', was calculated above using the mass-luminosity relationship of stars. Finally, the mass of the exoplanet, 'm', in the equation can be ignored, since it is much smaller than the mass of the parent star. As an example, since the Sun is about three hundred thousand times heavier than the Earth, ignoring the mass of the Earth in this calculation woud introduce an error of less than 0.001%. The equation can be solved for the only remaining variable which is the orbital radius, 'a'. Once the orbital radius has been determined, the mass of the planet can be calculated using Newton's Law of Gravitation shown below. Here, 'G' is once again the Gravitational constant, 'm1' is the mass of the parent star, 'r' is the orbital radius (this was 'a' in the equation above), and 'Fg' is the force of gravity betwe- Oh, the game? Yeah, its fine.			"

 Oh, is this amazing! I have always been fascinated by Space, and everything to do with it. The vastness, the possibilities and the interesting features it has, waiting to be found and explored...Now, while I can't exactly go into space and discover it all, this game is a great alternitive! While, not so much on the exploration side of things, it makes it possible to experience almost everything space has to offer. Want to watch the Moon crash into the Earth, go right ahead. Smash ten, smash twenty, how every many you like. Or, maybe terraform Mars. Get it to the point where it has vast oceans, ice caps and even life! See how similar you can make the planets to Earth...Or, turn Jupiter into a star...Or allow Pluto to achieve revenge by turning it into a Black Hole. It's up to you! I have played and do own the original Universe Sandbox, and I have to say: This Sequal (i guess you could call it :P) just improves and adds to the original, beyond measure. It is an absolutely beautifle game, with increadibly realistic physics and is a great game to constantly come back to. Also, the Music is just perfect. As soon as the music comes on, I am instantaneously in deep thought about what the Universe may behold...(Also, get to smash Uranus ;)  )100% recommend this amazing experience!			"

								This game is really incredible. I have often daydreamed about what it would be like to die and float through space to see, in person, the beauty that is space. This game gives you that sensation in a way only the experiene itself can dmonstrate. This must be what it would feel like to be a God.Cons: The VR version doesn't have many of the features that are available in the regular version. I presume they will eventually be added as an update. Black holes, for example, can't be added in VR mode, but within VR you can go to your desktop and add them into the scene manually and then go back into VR mode and see them. (seems like an easy fix that will hopefully be added in future updates).			"

								Probably one of the most entertaining, and easy to use simulators out on the market.You can create your own systems, planets, create rings, cause supernovas, collisons and so much more. The level of detail on each individual body is amazing. The fact that you can control the enviroment, orbit, even rotation is astounding. Not only that, but the visuals and audio is outstanding.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Astronomy in general.			"

								Do you feel like you want to create a working universe? Or maybe feel like a supervillain that destroys worlds with astroids? You are just interested about space maybe? Do you want to make a teapot orbit mars?Well this ""game"" can do that all, just figet around with values or place a new body in a galaxy and you can have hours of fun.Curently the game is still in public testing, so maybe a lot more will be added to the ""game"" and maybe YOU will have an impact on it, not as big as the impact of the moon and earth, but maybe you can have the same impact as a small astroid on pluto. Who knows? You might have noticed I put the word game in quotation marks, that is because the word ""game"" is very misleading, this is a simulator and a serious one at that.So if you want a simulator of space, then buy this game. I would reccomand waiting till the price drops a bit or if the game is on sale though, because there is not yet enough content (currently) to give you the full price back. But maybe it will eventually.			"

								I have played this game both in VR, and out.  It is great both ways.  Lots of fun to tinker around with, explore different and fun experiments in space using all of the objects we're familiar with.  The experience especially comes alive in VR, since you can witness collisions in first-person and stand on the surface of all the great gas giants and whatever else you want.  Even out of VR this provides enough fun and content to easily justify the price.The best feature about this is that there are many pre-set loadouts, from individual planets, to the solar system, to dozens of collisions.  So you don't have to spend the hours to customize and make your own arrangement of things just to see ""what if"" or start experimenting on the solar system.  This to me is what makes the game good.			"

								Universe Sandbox 2 isn't really a game as much as it is a toy. Don't let that discourage you though, because it's still one of the best interactive experiences I've ever had. In Universe Sandbox 2, you can create you own solar systems, galaxies even, using an incredibly easy to use, yet powerful interface. You can tweak any parameter of the simulation to your will; your imagination is the only limit. The game's physics model is one of the most realistic ones that I have seen in a game. It's also incredibly fun to load the default solar system and see what kinds of apocalyptic scenarios you can enact.9/10- This game made me realize why I'm not God. "

Beautiful with mindblowing variability - there are so many objects, so many alterable parameters that no two simulations are ever the same.

Do note that the system requirements to run really complex simulations can easily reach beyond the minimum... but such is the cost of having a hundred moons attack the earth.			"

								Universe Sandbox is simply amazing. Unlike other games in the space genre, Universe Sandbox lets you metaphorically become god. The attention to detail is absolutely stunning. For example, increasing the sun's gravitational pull will draw earth towards it. As it gets closer you can see the oceans evaporating and the temperature of the planet increasing until it burns up and is destroyed. When earth isn't being consumed by suns, black holes, or teapots (yes teapots), you can see further detail in its rotation such as how all the lights of the cities turn on when facing away from the sun. It gives you a sense of life... before you cause a second ice age. I've just gone on about earth. There's so much more to this game. Want to decrease the suns mass? Go for it. Want to cause a supernova? Do it. Want to collide galaxies in real time? Well if you have the time why not. The game is one of my favorites. If you like space or generally just being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a cosmic level, do yourself a favor and get this game. It's well worth the money. As a side note, if you have a modern laptop, this game runs well on those too due to the superb optimization. My laptop is 7 years old and it still runs well. Alright, I'm going to stop rambling now, but don't leave just yet. Scroll up and click buy right now. Even if you don't have a credit card. If you're a kid tell your parents RobBop demanded you to buy it. In fact bring them here. Parents? If you're here, little Timmy promised to do twice the amount of housework if you buy this game.

I have a really bad laptop, but the game runs amazingly well, so they're doing an amazing job at keeping the game lag-free.10/10 would launch earth into a giant teapot again.But, i have to get a little critical here.. I understand that it's an alpha, and I love the game and all, but the replay value is poor. I can't just launch the moon into venus 1400 times, and be just as amused as the first time i did it. Sure, ill play the ♥♥♥♥ out if the game when it's the full version, but for now, it's just a fun side-game. :pI've marked the ""Recommended"" as yes, but you should take it as a ""yea, kinda maybe... Buy it when theres a sale and its the full version"" kinda yes.			"

								I have played this game both in VR, and out.  It is great both ways.  Lots of fun to tinker around with, explore different and fun experiments in space using all of the objects we're familiar with.  The experience especially comes alive in VR, since you can witness collisions in first-person and stand on the surface of all the great gas giants and whatever else you want.  Even out of VR this provides enough fun and content to easily justify the price.The best feature about this is that there are many pre-set loadouts, from individual planets, to the solar system, to dozens of collisions.  So you don't have to spend the hours to customize and make your own arrangement of things just to see ""what if"" or start experimenting on the solar system.  This to me is what makes the game good.			"

If MS Paint had a Z-Axis, a Real time universal physics simulator, realistic gravity symulator, the ability to destroy and create planets, basketballs the size of the milkyway, milkyways the size of basketballs, the ability to make a quasar black hole out of something that was originally the size of Texas, the ability to run a REAL TIME simulation of our solar system (I once timed it for 3 hours to see if it was accuarate with the time on earth), and a f*ck-load of other scientific and math that would take to long to write about.

								Universe Sandbox is simply amazing. Unlike other games in the space genre, Universe Sandbox lets you metaphorically become god. The attention to detail is absolutely stunning. For example, increasing the sun's gravitational pull will draw earth towards it. As it gets closer you can see the oceans evaporating and the temperature of the planet increasing until it burns up and is destroyed. When earth isn't being consumed by suns, black holes, or teapots (yes teapots), you can see further detail in its rotation such as how all the lights of the cities turn on when facing away from the sun. It gives you a sense of life... before you cause a second ice age. I've just gone on about earth. There's so much more to this game. Want to decrease the suns mass? Go for it. Want to cause a supernova? Do it. Want to collide galaxies in real time? Well if you have the time why not. The game is one of my favorites. If you like space or generally just being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a cosmic level, do yourself a favor and get this game. It's well worth the money. As a side note, if you have a modern laptop, this game runs well on those too due to the superb optimization. My laptop is 7 years old and it still runs well. Alright, I'm going to stop rambling now, but don't leave just yet. Scroll up and click buy right now. Even if you don't have a credit card. If you're a kid tell your parents RobBop demanded you to buy it. In fact bring them here. Parents? If you're here, little Timmy promised to do twice the amount of housework if you buy this game. Do it, you won't regret it.			"

								Loaded the game for the first time. Saw the Earth, the moon orbiting in the distance. The sense of scale was awesome. The globe sat in front of me and I really felt like I could reach out and touch it. I tried. I did not know I was holding another moon in my hand. I did not know that pulling the trigger would spawn it. The newly created satellite slammed into the surface of the Earth which quickly took on the boiling, reddish, molten hue of Hell. Every living thing was presumably killed instantly. I hope they were. I hope they didn't suffer. I hope no survivor is able to make a record of my Great Sin for whatever future life evolves after the Earth cools in hundreds of millions of years.The Silence of the Void is already more condemnation than I can bear.10/10 Would accidentally genocide again.

								I haven't spent too long with Universe Sandbox 2, but I can tell you from the precious time I have spent with it that this is an absolute must-buy if your brain capacity can support games of a grander scale than ""kill the things.""It's a masterpiece. Visually stunning, the planets and stars are beautifully detailed. I particularly enjoy gazing at the Earth, admiring the textures and shadows: it really is that good looking.The physics are both accurate and fun to play around with, I've had endless fun setting up my own solar systems only to make the star go supernova and spawn a supermassive black hole at the centre for the sheer hell of it. It really is a universe sandbox, boot it up and mould space to your liking.The scientific depth of this game is almost ludicrous. Every single aspect of anything in the universe can be observed or changed, and I mean EVERY ASPECT. There's stuff here I've never even heard of, let alone understood. The attention to detail here is astounding.Overall? Wonderful. Looks good, plays well, scientifically accurate and overall just plain fun. It's fun both for casuals who just want to play with the galaxy and explore astrophysics, and it's also fun for hardcore physics buffs who understand every single variable. Congrats devs, you hit the nail on the head in my opinion. I look forward to spending many more hours in this wonderful game :)			"

								This game was a lot more complicated, and involved then I had expected. I LOVE the dynamic sound track, to me that made this game. Also, I suggest to anyone playing to go to the largest scale, set two rocky bodies on a collision course, zoom in to one of the planets surfaces, and in the final aproach, set the time to scale. Watching worlds collide from a first person perspective is awe inspiring.There are something things that could be improved or added. Like the ability to snap to objects and name or lable them. I had a hard time trying to set up a star/ planet combination. I'd ran into a couple of glitches that sent me across the universe, never to see my planet again. Also, it would be nice to be able to reverse time. Also this game would probably consume ALL of my free time if there was a way to set up or follow an ecosystem. Or have the ability to create life and watch it evolve maybe had a stats bar with the type of life and its progress or something to that effect. Overall; As is, the game is fun. But I can see great potenial in this. I'm excited to see where this goes. That and who ever wrote the music score for this game should get a pat on the back			"

								This sandbox is a pure scientific game. I would not recommend the game to those gamers who think that science is boring. For others I want to say - the game is incredible. You can use various planets, stars, novas, comets etc. to build the Universe you like. You can also modify different parameters of objects, such as mass, density, angular velocity and many more. I was amuzed when I changed the mass, and it was automatically recalculated into a mass of a bigger object (e.g. mass of the Earth into mass of Jupiter). A challenging aspect of this game - you have to learn physics and astrophysics otherwise you will crash a model in seconds. My respect to devs, you've made a great job.			"

								Interested in astronomy? Buy Universe Sandbox ^2. You can do pretty much everything you've ever wanted to do with SPACE!!! WHO DOESN'T LIKE SPACE? PEOPLE WHO AREN'T NERDS, THAT'S WHO. Anyway, You can summon, modify, and make systems out of everything from the size of dice to the galaxy Andromida (Yes, you can make dice the size of Andromida and Andromida the size of dice). You can even launch material or change how fast or slow time goes by anywhere from milliseconds to whatever the hell a G year is.			"

								This sandbox is a pure scientific game. I would not recommend the game to those gamers who think that science is boring. For others I want to say - the game is incredible. You can use various planets, stars, novas, comets etc. to build the Universe you like. You can also modify different parameters of objects, such as mass, density, angular velocity and many more. I was amuzed when I changed the mass, and it was automatically recalculated into a mass of a bigger object (e.g. mass of the Earth into mass of Jupiter). A challenging aspect of this game - you have to learn physics and astrophysics otherwise you will crash a model in seconds. My respect to devs, you've made a great job.			"

								So I've been playing around in Universe sandbox making my own life-filled solar system, and theres a little thing that bugs me. If I create a planet with a nice constant temperature, it'll have a effective temperature of like -270 degrees. Now this Isn't a problem while in game, but if I leave the simulation and reload it, the planet will be completely frozen, even if it's really close to the sun. I've sorta come to the conclusion that effective temperatures mean nothing, and if they actually mean something, I don't know what it is. It's just a little annoying that I have to set the temperature of each planet back to what it was every time I load the simulation. The weird thing is though, is that for the remainder of time im in the simulation, it'll stay at the nice life-supporting temperature, until of course I reload the simulation, to which It'll reset to absurdly cold temperatures. To be honest, I;m not even entirely sure if this even is a bug or not, but if it is a feature of the game, It'd be nice to know why it happens. Other than that, I don't really have any more complaints about Universe Sandbox, it's a great game, and I would definately recomend it.			"

								The fun you can have with this game is boundless, the game looks gorgeous and it also teaches you something instead of gunning people down and driving fast cars. The simulations are great and the music that plays in the background is brilliant, it's very relaxing to sit back and create your own solar system. But if you feel like causing some mayhem you can always collide galaxies into one another, or launch the moon into the planet (my personal favourite). If your into space and astronomey and even physics based games then you really should pick this up, totally worth it.			"

								This is an excellent simulation on the universe. You can set up your own simulation and see what happens or just use one of the many pre made situations. Go for an educational experience as you look at the planet as the temperature increases, as you tilt the axis, or even look at one of 50,000 celestial bodies.Or, say hang it and chuck the moon and the Earth and laugh manically at the destruction!It runs really smoothly has some nice sound design. However they could implement a way to increase the UI size for higher resolutions, running it in 4K and the UI become nigh on unreadable. However this is in the grand scheme of things is minor, I've only played it for about 2 hours today and I had so much fum. Here's a video showing my first impressions:

								Do you have a terrible imagination and little to no curiosity as to how physics works? Do you hate the laws of gravitation and show disdain for the wonders of the universe? Then this game isn't for you. Don't get it.If, on the other hand, you love space, or just really want to make pluto devour the universe: Buy it. This game is wonderful and a fantastic sequel to the first game. The developers know what they're doing and have done a lot of research in order to make this game as accurate as it is. It's a sandbox game, so it's only as fun as you can make it. There's no plot, no main theme, no goal (although the music is pretty great) so go ahead and make the earth plunge into a state of warmth that would surely wipe out all life, or replace the sun with a black hole. You could even terraform mars if you wanted.Best game 10/10 IGN			"

(<0.3hr/$)(130 hours, $25)Universe Sandbox is a game where you smash Earth into Mars, the sun into a black hole, or galaxies together. You can learn how orbits and collisions work because Universe Sandbox lets you play around with various things, giving you dozens of built in simulations and freedom to make and share your own. You play as a god, creating planets or other objects and experimenting: What happens when I throw Mars at Earth? What if I do it at half the speed of light? What if I bomb Jupiter with hundreds of Earths? What if I gave Venus rings? All of these questions can be answered in Universe Sandbox.I recommend Universe Sandbox to anyone who wants a relaxing game about throwing planets at eachother.			"

								I love the freedom and flexibility of the game. I love how you can hop between planets and learn about their composition and mass. I also love how you can change their properties and see the effects (to a certain extent. hope to see this improve soon). Good job!Delve more into the depths of terraforming planets; effects of global warming, core composition and introduction of organics. It would also be brilliant if storms were to be seen on planets and moons with the correct atmospheres and surface composition. As well as this it would be interesting to see Earth change as the years move on, such as seeing the cities grow and seeing man made satellites around the planet - maybe you could introduce the eventual colonisation on other planets as time progresses, as a small, automatic event. Hey, maybe you could even include nuclear war occuring in some intances or ships disappearing as they enter lightspeed travel - that would be a brilliant little touch!Overall, I love this game, and will be seeing myself spending hundreds of hours with it in the future!

								Oh wow... I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said. It is just epic, and it is very good at showing how minuscule us humans are in relation to the universe.There are a LOT of pre-made simulations for you to try out. Each planet, star, asteriod, etc, etc, can be clicked on and further information can be obtained. Sometimes it is just in the form of data... but sometimes you are presented with boxes of text, and the text even contains links to web pages to allow you to go and perform further reading.There are also a LOT of tutorials to show you how to go about making your own simulations.This is a game, teaching tool, curiosity-satisfier, and a research tool... all rolled into one. Whatever reason you have for purchasing this product, your money will be VERY well spent.I have only encountered one glitch so far (not a bug, per se)... the music that plays seems to ""crackle"" sometimes. I don't have the issue with any other games. However, this does not detract from how amazing this application is.As a developer myself, I can relate to the amount of research and effort; blood and sweat; time that has gone into making this application so that we may all enjoy it.Thank you Giant Army! And thanks again for restoring my faith in Early Access. For me, you are up there with Grim Dawn and Dirt Rally for quality Early Access releases. :)The icing on the cake for me........ Oculus Rift support. My eyes will be peeled for further information... :D			"

								After playing for a short while, I sat down in my living room grinning from ear to ear, my wife asked me how US2 was, I said ""Oh man, I've never felt so close to feeling like an actual god""She replies ""Not even when we are having sex?""I said ""Would you describe us having sex as...? a Nuclear explosion?""""Yes"" she replied.I paused, looked up at her and said ""Yeah, I just threw Suns at each other""Words cannot describe this experience, you just have to try it.Although as some have said, not all features work in VR and the controls are a bit clunky.WARNING: This game runs fairly easy until it gets busy, once things start getting full and busy your PC might tank and lock up causing you to have to End Process, but that was expected.My specs:i7 6700k16GB RAMR9 390 Nitro 8GBSSD drive.

								Universe Sandbox is fun. I created a miniature universe in a few hours, then destroyed it in a few minutes. You can collide stuff into each other, and even create stars by colliding gas planets. And then you can play god and suddenly collapse the stars into black holes and watch as the tidal forces rip everything apart. It's cool and this is definitely the best game i've ever played.			"

								Do you love space? Yes! Well then this is the game for you! When you buy this game, you will be able to: Destroy Earth as you know using whatever methods you want. Create your own solar system if you want to be a god. And if you read the ABOUT THIS GAME section, it explains more points on why you should buy this game.Still not impressed? Do you have no soul? If you are impressed and you want to go buy this game, then go do it. Just don't create too many supernovas or you will destroy your computer along with the universe. If not, I don't what I can do for you, you are a lost cause on this magical journey.Universe Sandbox 2, make your god fantasies come to life today.			"

 What I like I really like how you can customize most of the settings on...well stuff, such as the materials it has. And also you can just turn Pluto into a black hole just outta nowhere. What i dislike I dislike how you can't customize the life...  whatever  and just simply give the Sun life. What don't dislike nor like I'm rather netural about that changing the gravity effects  EVERYTHING   and maybe blowin' everything up...and i really truly don't think i should have this in spoilers...  causing you to be unable to just simply customize the gravity of a black hole. What i would rather say about the game I would say that this game is  VERY  good and that probally everyone should buy it, like as if it was already on its final update. What i've been doing mainly I've mainly been messin' around with Pluto by making it a black hole   Or shall I say, turning pluto into a PLUTO hole...yet i don't think this should be in spoilers.  and just having planets and stars and exoplanets (and maybe some dice) orbit it like as if Pluto was always a black hole... ""But how?"" if you are wondering Mainly by making Pluto's mass 1 milky way and most oftenly-after that-making Pluto's mass 2.6E+10 milky ways. My enemy/what I dislike the most What I dislike that most about the game is that when you've got SUPER LARGE objects you can't zoom in on the smaller objects.			"

								Are you interested in space and physics? Do you enjoy watching the beauty of natural dynamics at work? Then I cannot recommend this game enough. It's physical simulation is very accurate and keeps getting better. You can tweak almost every variable you can think of and see how the simulation changes - or you can just smash things together.Pros +- Super immersive- Visually stunning- Large collection of actual celestial objects we have data on- Collide objects for explosions and amusement or watch incredibly precise and fragile systems do their thing- Actively developed with additions of newfound celestial objects and physical phenomenaCons -- Higher speeds decrease the accuracy of the simulation (which is understandable)- Some visual effects might glitch or not appear correctly			"

								Might have bought this as a knee jerk decision. ""Ooooo physics, I want it!""Unfortunately I was a little bummed out with what I could do in this game. After checking out every scenario that came with the game there was a disappointing moment when I realized I didn't want to just fling stuff at Earth and watch the same Micheal Bay movie each time.Adding mass to planets was fun. Turning Jupiter into a star was super cool. Watching moons corkscrew around an orbiting planet was fascinating.Its not that I didn't enjoy this game at all, but I was just a little blind sided by the price considering how little there was to do. Looks pretty though. Maybe its more of a UniverseScreensaver.Will re-review as this game is early access! Maybe I will learn to love it.6/10 would watch Julian moons orbit Jupiter again "

								I like this, I just think it would be better if it had things like the creation of our solar system, or how a star changes/formed. Seeing two galaxy's collide is really cool. Just seems a bit shallow on history or creation. Physics are good, besides two large bodies colliding. Is that really what would happen? I suppose know one really knows. Worth a buy, I suppose			"

								Absolutely fascinating and a fantastic educational tool for kids.This is a program EVERY science school in the country should have access to.It is really good that you can change things to see different energy releases etc, really fascinating to watch, and if you have a beefy PC like I do, its just sickly awesome.I totally recommend everyone buy this and try this, no you wont get hundreds of playing hours out of it unless your an astrologist with OCD issues, but what you do get is a facinating look at the universe/solar system from a completely different perspective.Watch it on a 71 inch super high def screen.Its like taking the NASA supercomputer and slapping it in your lounge !Cheap and fun and great for teaching kids how things work off our planet, buy it.

								I came to the realisation that Pluto was mad because he was downgraded from a planet to basically a non-existent rock. Pluto wanted revenge.I increased Plutos mass to the size of Jupiter. Pluto grew suddenly.It wasn't enough. I increased Plutos surface tempreture to 3000c. I again, increased his mass, to the mass of the sun. Pluto glowed an angry red, whilst throwing off the orbit of nearby planets. It still wasn't enough.I decided to completely let loose, and I increased Plutos mass to 1000 the times of the sun. Not-so-little Pluto grew massive, consuming everything in his path, and completely ruining the orbits of other planets. Pluto stared at the sun. Pluto drifted towards the sun, in a red ball of anger. Pluto hit the sun, and then...Silence.Suddenly, the sun went supernova, and consumed the entire solar system. All at the hands of little Pluto. 11\10 would destroy our solar system again			"

								this game some how reminds me how small i am... every sins i've done, every mistake, it just silly that i am is still shame less human being i mean just look at it, for example open the game and try to simulate the making of galaxy like nebula theories, twin star, big bang etc. this game can simulated it smoothly.  if that wouldnt make you think small enough compare universe, try to move the earth orbit slightly, just couple notch and wait what will happen to earth, what will happen to us. we are so fragile. beside this game goods for hit em up, educational, i found that this game has a spiritual functionality. VY Canis Majoris, google it, for those still wont believe how small we are, and act still like fraud to other people and nature. sorry for being emotional while writing this review, great game btw.

You can manage to turn Earth into a sun,SEE COLLISIONS,and put black holes wherever you please. This game taught me a lot about space and trust they are not your average school facts you can learn about how gravity can change everything and learn new planets,galaxies,and learn how sun novas are created. Im gonna be honest the price is way to high for a game like this but...ITS TOTALY WORTH IT!!! And if you don't watch Markiplier you probably don't know the song space is cool where he says cool like every five seconds.

You can manage to turn Earth into a sun,SEE COLLISIONS,and put black holes wherever you please. This game taught me a lot about space and trust they are not your average school facts you can learn about how gravity can change everything and learn new planets,galaxies,and learn how sun novas are created. Im gonna be honest the price is way to high for a game like this but...ITS TOTALY WORTH IT!!! And if you don't watch Markiplier you probably don't know the song space is cool where he says cool like every five seconds.

								The music. The lack of music is what made me hate playing the first game. Its presence makes the game for me. If you've had a passion for space *cough cough...markiplier...cough cough*** then you'll love this game.My only problem is that something about the way I control time seems...hard, but I think it's just me.Also remember that the game is in a Early Access state so the game has some time before its finished.

								As someone who loves sandboxes, I can say that this game is amazings. Build planets. Destroy them. Build Solar systems. Destroy them. BUILD FREAKING GALAXIES! DESTROY IT WITH A JACK-O-LATERN!!!! I love the ""Do what ever you want"" genre of sandboxes, and this game is definately at the core of it. With that, let's get into pros and cons.Pros:Music is very nice to listen to while you playBuild planets, solar systems, galaxies, pulsar, and so much moreChuck moons into planets, planets into the sun. Planets also become deformed and if it has water on it... THE WATER FILLS IN THE CRATER!!!!Very nice turorial and extra tutorials.Much more, but you'll have to find out more on your own.Cons:Some room for optomization. I have a $2000 CPU and I seem to stress the program fairly easy. It is early access though so I'm not worried about optomization right now.Sometimes physics bugs out but for the most part its really solid.And thats really all for the cons. It's a great game, so if you love universal sandboxes, this is a game for you. I would just recommend a powerful cpu or low graphics.			"

								Soooo...I started ♥♥♥♥ing around with our solar system and turned the sun into a star that was about a million times it's mass. Comets and planetoids from the Oort Cloud came hurtling into it with a speed of more than a third of light speed (all planets where already gobbled up because of the sheer massiveness of the sun).I then tried to compare my monstrous creation with VY Majoris, Betelgeuse and UY Scuti (at the same time). Ofcourse I forgot to pause the simulation, which ended in all three stars simultaneously plunging right into the Sun, causing four synchronised supernovae which left four black holes fighting for the title of 'biggest and baddest in the solar system'.I'd like to conclude this review with a quite remarkable discovery:Simulated supernovae are able to fry your graphics card.10/10 for realism.

								Universe Sandbox 2 is an awesome planetary simulation game.  Want to see what happens if the sun becomes a black hole?  No problem.  What happens if the earth stops rotating?  Try it.  Want to shove Mars up Uranus?  Bobs your uncle.Seriously though, awesome game.  Will appeal to anyone who enjoys simulations, space, or pretty colors.Check out about an hour of gameplay on YouTube:

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a place where you can modify, simulate, or even make a new solar system all together. The game had many features to keep you occupied for hours on end. The thing I would like to see in this game is a multiplayer option so you could play with your friends. At the moment, I rate the game a 9/10. Go try it out if you are into the stuff I listed. Also, I played the game before it was on Steam :P			"

								This is just a alpha version and still pretty good. And I firmly believe that the developers will give their best so one day, we will be able to play god and create our own universe where real and conscious human beens will live in. So invest in new hardware cuz you are gonna need it+directx 12. If you do that, then you will be able to do anything you want, just like the ♥♥♥♥ers who simulate our own universe. Imagine, 2 or 3 year from now you can watch the virtual muslims praise you as some kind of almighty being while in real life you are just some fat ♥♥♥♥ who gets off watching simulated people acting the same way as us. And when we finally get our based vr from oculust rift, we will be able to create our own harem within our simualted universe and don't even have to buy those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Japanese dating sims anymore.10/10			"

								I loved this game. Emphasis on the past tense. I was excited to play it and when I was able to it was a ton of fun. But now there's an issue where the initial load screen will pop up and at the bottom it'll read ""starting the sandbox"" and then it'll just stop. No error message. It'll just sit there like that until I click and windows says it's not responding. I don't know if it's because my computer is a piece of crap or what but I looked up solutions and tried most and nothing worked. I don't know what to do now but just warn others that this can happen by writing a review. I bought and now can't play this game. I really hope that this issue is eventually fixed because I want to recommend this to everyone who loves space and physics and such but when there is an issue like this that literally makes the game unplayable I just can't recommend this to anyone.

								Definitely worth the money. It is a great game if you love learning about space like I do. Physics are awesome and the simulations are AMAZING.

								This game really shines as a VR tech demo. As a sort of ""launch title"" for the Vive, it fits perfectly. You can just tool around with solar systems and planets and the like, and it's pretty amazing to watch. It's not really a game though, so if that's what you're after then you should probably not get this. If you want to watch / destroy planets then this is the game for you			"

								I want to love this. I really do. But the VR is basic and underwhelming to the extreme. And since the program otherwise is pretty much the same thing as a dumbed down Universe Sandbox 1 you sort of feel ripped off. Some things could probably be fixed in the future: Scale issues (probably IPD/AA issues in the engine) as well as terrible graphical performances from time to time. This is a title where scale should really be awe inspiring. Instead they added footballs and crap like that. Useless, annoying, childish and all the ""scientificy"" stuff were thrown out of the window. This is now, officially, a ""throw balls at other balls using artificial gravity and shoot lasers (!) on the Earth""-game. Complete with terrible textures.Unfortunately it doesn't really feel like the stuttering and issues are warranted since the graphics is pretty basic and underwhelming. Think: white blob moving slowly towards huge yellow blob with some orbital lines in the distance. It's nowhere near any Hollywood style effects. And STILL it stutters if you spew hydrogen blobs randomly around you. That the tools on the controllers reset to ""Spawn Moon"" is both incredibly annoying (let me set the default tool!) and descriptive of what the devs think you should do in VR: Throw tiny marbles at pool balls and go ""oooo"" at the rather terrible effects. The controls are also counter-intuitive and unnecessarliy hard to change.No. Give us a room scale planetarium with interesting scenarios. Fix the scale issues and maybe add more backgrounds and better textures.If you have Universe Sandbox 1 just keep it. It's better. Lacks VR but US2 lack meaningful VR too...US1 had a modicum of scientific intent and purpose. US2 has footballs.One word summary: Boring. "

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a game where you mess around with the universe. It mainly focuses on solar systems and you can make your own and such using random presets. The game is in early access and hopefully the devs will work on it over the next several months. Should you buy this game?I loved to watch videos of this game but was put off it by one particular comment. ""The game gets boring quickly."" I got the game 4 months later as one of my family members said I could buy something as long as it is either educational or physical.The game was not boring. It was incredibly fun and time flies when I play it. The only issue I have is it's a game you play before you go to work/bed. Game sessions are usually over 1 hour for me but that is due to me owning the game for a small time. So it all comes down to this...Buy this game if you love space, explosions, astronomy or just science in general. Avoid if you are looking for a big game with lots of content you can binge on. Do pick this game up sometime though as it is a huge improvement from the first game (which I hated).I don't like to give anything a score as scores are translated differently. I will however give this game one word that I think it deserves. Success.			"

								Ok bought this to pass time as i recently got fired from work and aint got nothing to fill my days with. I suppose you can have a bit of fun with it, its quite pleasurable to wreak havoc in the solarsystem with massive black holes and bombarding earth with comets and watching the world end. It gets old very very fast though. 30 minutes playtime and i doubt i will be spending much more with this. This is the kind of thing that would be very much worth it if it was free but with this pricetag it is impossible to recomend it.			"

								Universe Sandbox is a beautiful game which offers numerous simulations of things like our solar system, black holes, and binary pulsars. However, the simulations are (relatively) small scale, as in, you can't navigate our known universe. For example, I expected to be able to zoom out from the solar system and see celestial bodies which surround ours in the Milky Way, then zoom out even further to see what's around the Milky Way. As of now, this isn't possible, though it may be added since the game is in open alpha.Unfortunately, in its present state, this isn't much of a ""universe"" sandbox as it is just a space sandbox. Very disappointed!			"

This game would be perfect if they use it to create documentaries (or maybe allow people to create theirs and share it?), I would buy it for sure.

								A glorified n-body physics simulator that's as dull as dishwater and pointless.It's interesting for a few minutes, until you start noticing the limitations of the ""simulation"".Smash Earth with the moon? It's okay--it'll cool back down to clement temperatues a year after turning into a molten ball of fire, and all the continents will still be in place--even with city lights in the night time!Change Jupiter's tilt somehow? Its cloud system will not change or shift with the new tilt.So you're basically buying a simulator where the planets are just textured balls. There's some crude climate simulation for Earth that is just wrong--even with 2C over current global temperatures, we have Europe looking like it did 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age.The collisions are vaguely entertaining for a while, until you notice that the larger colliding body essentially never changes--it just gets more massive with the same textures remaining.And to add to my bitterness, a refund was refused--so screw you too, Valve. Way to encourage software piracy.			"

								-The solar simulation is lacking, a star will always be 100% hydrogen. Even if it has a thousand years until supernova, even if it is already a stellar remnant - neither a neutron star nor a white dwarf is 100% hydrogen.-There are only 6 ""elements"", or rather things bodies can consist of: hydrogen, water, silicate, iron, organic and dark matter.-Any object can easily be accelerated above light speed.-Any planet or star can rotate as fast as it wants, they never break apart-There is no mass transfer in a binary star system. Red giant and a white dwarf, which are just way too close? No mass transfer, no accretion disk, nothing.-The collision system is glitchy.Right now, these are the reasons why I'm somewhat disappointed in this.			"

								(VR REVIEW)Ok, so I have had this game for a while and decided to try it out with the Vive. I am not sure how much I payed for the game when I first purchased it but here is my honest opinion. The game is amazing in VR, you can see all of the planets like never before and get a real life scale if you would like. It feels like I am litteraly exploring space but, I played it for about 10 - 20 minutes and soon found myself bored. It is not like their are aliens and you can explore other galaxeies so after a while of playing around you get bored. Overall it is an amazing VR experience but I do not think it is worth the price.			"

THIS IS NOT A GAMEIn the strictest sense, this is not a game.  It is a toy, something for you to sit down with for a few hours and just see what it is like to destroy Earth, or the Sun, or the Milky Way.This is not something that would appeal to many people.  You have to be extremely interested in astrophysics to even want to buy this title, and those that are educated in astrophysics, you start to notice some issues with this right away such as the lack of space-time distortion near massive objects such as black holes or super-massive stars.  This game is very rhudementary at the simulation of basic physics and does not apply any theorethical rules that we have found to be true in the past decade which is disappointing.Orbits are innacurate, showing loss of velocity on each revolution just by having an abnormal or eliptical orbit.  While unstable orbits can maraculiously become stable (there is a reason they're called unstable, because there is a collision trajectory). This is not true to life and violates the laws of thermal dynamics. The show stopper, was having objects that can move as fast as the speed of light.  The current school of thought says that the more massive an object is, the expodentially harder it is to achieve speeds remotely close to the speed of light.  In essence, the fatter you are, the harder it is to run fast.  The universe has the same laws, which are violated in this ""toy"".Again, this is a TOY, not even a simulator, if this was listed on steam as such I would have gave it a glowing recommendation.  However, this is no game, and is decietful to market it as such because there is no playing field, no objective, no goal.  It is a sandbox with sand -- which is a toy, again, not a game.			"

								There's a similar space simulator called Space Engine (FREE TO PLAY!). I don't recommend this until it's finished and this has been in early access (what ever that means anymore)Edit. How are you guys thumbing down this ""review""? Don't deny this has way less things to do than in space engine c'mon. Also notice how long this has been in early access including the time before this hit Steam. Steam's ""early access"" is supposed to give us consumers a chance to have an early look and feel at the game with low price and knowing that there are bugs in the game about a month before released fully and bug free.

								Tutorial says ""Choose random asteroid"" but highlights wrong places, and I can't proceed with the tutorial. (I'm using LG 21:9 monitor that might be the issue.)As I tried to close the game, it requires me to rate the experience. However, after leaving some honest comments and suggestions and checked ""dis-satisfied"", the game won't close, not even when I used task manager. After I changed rating to ""Very satisfied"", the game shuts down with no problem.I hope this is a design issue and the Dev can fix those two bugs. Really looking forward to how the game plays.==========================Edit:For the record, I'm usingi-7 6700K @ 4.00 GHz8GB RAMGTX 960 2GBWin 10 64bitThere shouldn't be any problem running this game.

								**I'm going to stress that this is a review for the current Alpha of this ""game"" (toy?). I fully expect to change my review to positive when it releases.**Right now, its fairly limited. Setting up your own systems is much harder than it should be -for me at least- and usually ends in lots of explosions, getting objects where you want them just isn't very intuitive.I wouldn't say the game runs poorly, but it could run a lot better. However, After playing it again recently, I definitely noticed improvement, so I imagine the game will run quite smoothly by release.The number of objects you get to play around with feels a bit lackluster, but that should also be improved. They are also planning to add Steam Workshop integration, which would be more than enough.The game does let you edit a metric ton of attributes for every object in real time, as well as gravity and other such things, which is pretty sweet. If you want to run a simulation with 1,000x normal gravity and an Earth the size of 1,000,000,000 suns, you can do that.In its current state, I wouldn't recommend this unless you're really into astronomy, or just have a thing for blowing up planets. But it definitely has potential to be great later on. I definitely expect to come back to this one later on.(If you like my reviews, I'm posting them all on this hideous Wordpress site now! https://probablysanny.wordpress.com/) "

I would love to get a refund, but as a warning to (EVERYONE WHO BUYS THIS GAME) you should play up to the 1 hour and 45 minute mark because it gets repetitive. I couldn't get a refund because this game is basically worth 3 hours of gameplay before you start disliking it. The price is waaay to high for a game like this, even with all the work the game studio put into it. I know there are different scenarios and if you do really enjoy these types of games, go ahead.

								Slightly disappointed. Seems to me that the main focus is for ramming planets into other planets (or stars, moons, asteroids, etc.) I watched the Jupiter/Jupiter collision. One is stationary one comes in from the left and rams into the other. Nice graphics. The final object is the same size and for some reason is moving to the left. (???) That doesn't seem right.  I don't see any way to set up a solar system with custom orbits. Sure, I made one system, but all orbits were round and in the same plane. That's not very natural. I don't see how to customize that. I went right through all the tutorials. I can make a pulsar! Ooh. big deal. I see a computer graphic of a magnetized white dwarf. Is that what they really look like? Maybe a bit.I'm quite an astronomy fanatic, but I don't feel I got $30 worth. Of course, it is an early access release and so it could still get better yet. Let's hope it gets a lot better. I don't understand all these thumbs up recommendations, seriously.			"
