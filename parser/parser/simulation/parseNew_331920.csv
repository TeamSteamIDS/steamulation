												One of the best tycoons related to airlines is on steam at last . It is kinda strange to see the first game release after the second game. So going to divide my Review on the game into 3 simple parts A) The game Airline tycoon This game was released during 1998,deluxe[2003] during the time there was thirst for tycoon games so this made out pretty good , Breaking down everything complex . This is a tycoon game where you are one of the owners of a airline company , you get to choose one among 4 companies and do missions where the airport manager sets a specific task as the mission goal.Unlike most tycoon games that tend to get serious with max info and mechanics AT1 takes a simple humorous approach.- Initial missions are setup so that you can learn the various aspects of the game- There is more than one way to win a mission, if you want you can take down your competitors and become sole survivor.- From reading newspaper in the airport to sabotage it has everything you can imagine.- Sweet musicOverall its a fun tycoon game that can satisfy anyone playing it there is also the freeform mode where you can play without any goals, multiplayer if you can get it work. The graphics presentation hides the complexity of the game so its easier for new players to play the game B) Airline Tycoon Deluxe VS Airline Tycoon 2 Gold Now on the steam store you will find there are two game with the name airline tycoon , The second is the sequel to the first game released by kalypso. It makes me extremely sad to talk about this sequel because it is a terrible experience, Instead of Improving the first game this sequel got everything wrong and made it worst and terrible. Needless to say airline tycoon deluxe is the final iteration of the game vs airline tycoon 2 gold which is the final version of the sequel.I have ripped upon the second game more than once  but will post why the first game is better- AT 1 has a better presentation and ui compared to the jumbled basic terrible stuff AT2 has.- The planes used in AT1 have real names aka Boeing , airbus etc so you know what is good and what is bad. AT2 features computer generated random names 486 dx 2 is a plane name////- AT 1 Despite being released in 1998 looks nice and plays better (if compatibility is set properly) AT2 runs like garbage on any system and looks terrible. - AT deluxe has a lot of features content wise , AT 2 gold just added the features in AT 1 as dlc.So yeah Airline Tycoon 2 was a disaster of a sequel none of us AT 1 fans wanted to see but at least we have the first game back. C. Game compatibility with modern systems -Unfortunately No doubt that Airline Tycoon deluxe is a awesome game but , The game is over 10 years old so no doubt there will be issues with it running on modern systems and newer os. Sadly The game engine itself has a certain limits of the time as in it runs in around 20-30fps an can slowdown when there is too much on screen. Aka a lot people in the airport etc. -Also Frequent multiple saving is recommended the game itself will save at the end of each day but sometimes the game will crash for no reason , The instances where i have seen it happen are a)music change b) sometimes the game will crash no matter what you do it could be due to a specific even but event if you restore save it will crash again at the same time aka lets say game crashed at Monday 16.20 , if you restore again it will crash at the same time. hence multiple saves is recommended.- The game original developers are long gone so fixes and patches are hard to come by.If you can get this game to work , Its one of cult classic tycoon games that will kill time quickly.  Click on the Fire Extinguisher when you see it for some fun	  "

												Fun and different style of managemnt gameThis game does not take itself seriously which is a good thing. From the sterotypical characterisation of the tycoons around nationality (The Russian guy wears red and has caviar in his office) to the 'Shady' PetrolAir backroom, this game focuses on what alot of people seem to be missing form games - HAVING FUNDo not get me wrong, there is some fairly good airline simulation here from aircraft types ranging in distances, seats and fuel consumption - to the managing of the fuel market and personel. Its not massivly involved, but more than enough to keep you interested. As mentioned the graphics are not current standard - because this game was released in 1998. Its fairly cartoony but it has a very distinct style to it which - personally - I really like. Again, take any graphics reviews with a pinch of salt, this is an old game. Overall I would really recomend this game. There is alot to keep you interested in the airline management but nothing hugely daunting with a very nice tutorial to guide you. A game with alot of charm and style			"

												A great classic, now available to grab not only for Windows, but also for Mac and Linux! This game was basically my childhood and for the whole primary school was teaching me maths and geography in a very entertaining way - managing my own airline! This is not any boring, usual tycoon because it is not limited in any way to reading tons of reports, here you have to walk around the airport by yourself and iteract with NPCs to take care of your business, taking part in funny dialogues and other forms of first class humour! In contrary to other reviewers I think the graphics did not get old at all because Airline Tycoon was all drawn in kind of comic book/caricature style. The music, originally composed for midi format is kinda pleasant as well (but for non-nostalgy driven ♥♥♥♥♥♥s like me it might start to annoy after some time). Overall, if you wonder if you should get it - trust me, you should!			"

												I really wish I could say it was awesome to play this game again, but the game lags to an unplayable pace while your charater is in the main hall. The devs have acknowledge the issue but have not provided any support to fix it. Other users have suggested fixes, I have not had any luck with these fixes. Some say they have it working just fine while many continue having lag issues.It's the same great game you fell in love with long ago, it just has trouble running on many users' current setups. I bought this game the day it was released here on Steam and still have not been able to enjoy it.I would not recommend buying this game until they fix the game's lag/compatibility issues.			"

												I remember playing this when I was young and it was impossible for me to make any profit because I didn't understand the game but I had fun anyway. Now many years later I felt nostalgic and bought the game and suprisingly it's very good and I enjoy it a lot. The game seems quite polished although it does have the occasional stutter. The difficulty is extremely low, the only way i ever went bankrupt was because I didn't know how the game mechanic worked. Overall it's definitely worth several hours of play. "

												The original and best.  I played a LOT of this game when it was only available via Home of the Underdogs, and bought this copy to absolve my guilt.  The core mechanic is scheduling your flights, which is an interesting and unusual puzzle, played out it real time as you run from one place in the airport to another.  One of the very rare games where paying money to an AI advisor is seriously worthwhile.			"

												When I was younger I played the hell out of this game on my old Dell Latidude with windows XP, the game ran smoothly with no problems, it was very forgiving on outdated systems back thenFirst impressions:You will no doubt be charmed by the groovy soundtrack this game has to offer, I like each and every song and I can appreciate a good soundtrack to play to, the ambience in the airport is also so immersive, hearing the flight announcements, chattering and bustling of people going on holiday and returning from holiday, and the game is rather easy to start playing thanks to the advisor that acts as a tutorial whenever you do something new for the first timeGameplay:It's simple, you control your airline CEO (I like Phoenix/Falcon Lines because of where their offices are placed) - and you go your day to day business of taking flights and ordering your planes to carry out orders, you need to make sure your security is in check (security office is on the top floor on the airport, look for a window that looks out of place). You need to buy a filofax and a cellphone so you dont have to keep going back to your office, once you unlock your laptop you can carry out orders from anywhere and make some changes to your planes. You can even hire a saboteur to make life hard for your opponents, from placing heavily salted food on board, to giving them a computer virus, or even planting a bomb in their office or causing a plane crash! Of course the airport manager will eventually find out it's you and a hefty fine will come your way.Like any good CEO, you need to keep the cash coming in and the expenses low, for this you have to hire and fire staff, your friendly personnel team will help you out with this, and you can hire advisors to give you a little edge over the competition. You can buy and sell shares of the other 3 airlines, as well as buy and sell planes. You have so much to work with and at first it can be a struggle to juggle it all, but as I said, your lovely advisor will chip in whenever you feel clueless, she is a button click away.Sound:As said above, the soundtrack is very charming and upbeat, definitely a good choice to have this kind of music. The ambience is top notch and makes you feel like you are in the airport. Unfortunately you can't seem to change the music but why would you want to, and the music settings are a little hard to balance because some sound effects are rather loud to begin with, so spend some time balancing ambience, music and sound effectsVisuals:It's a 2003 game so don't expect anything fancy, but the cartoon style graphics and smooth frame rate make this game very very enjoyable to play, the game will only lag if you use the cheat to bring a massive crowd to the airport (i think this is just cosmetic). Multiplayer:Unfortunately I never managed to play this game on multiplayer so I can't comment on this, but I'm sure your imagination will tell you it's rather fun, the AI in the game is so predictable that I can remember exactly who drops first, second and third to leave me as the sole CEO, because of what they do (issuing more shares, overzealous sabotage leading to excessive fines from the airport managerOverall:I give this game a 9, it's hard to flaw given that it was a very very good game at the time, I seem to remember that in the early 2000s to 2005 there was an influx of rather good tycoon and simulation games, for example Monopoly Tycoon, Mall Tycoon, Rollercoaster Tycoon (who can forget that), Hotel Giant and The Sims, I'll have no problems in admitting Airline Tycoon should also be on that list.Get this game, it's £7 and you'll have lots of fun with it, just make sure to get your security up to scratch first!

												Loved this game when it came out and it provided me hours of fun again when I discovered it on steam. It has challenging gameplay and is quite humorous. The free game mode can get a bit boring once you're able to afford a new plane every day, though.Like others described there is currently an issue with very low framerate which results in laggy gameplay. I was able to play the game when I chose to run it with the dedicated graphics card of my notebook until the developer provides a fix.			"

												I love this game. I've been playing it for 12 years. I would proudly recommend.But now this...The franchise have switched hands from one company to another, with a haul of disappointment and problems to follow.Should the devs manage to pull out and do this great game some honour, I might reconsider my review.PROS:Should the game happen to run smoothly someday, this airport manager is excellent and a classic.CONS:As it is now, this new release isn't worth a penny. With a game from 1998 you should expect oldschool graphics, but that just add to the charm. In this version though, the graphics have gone ""pixelized"" and ""edgy"". Looks awful and not at all like in Airline Tycoon Evolution.The game lags every few seconds and a lot of text such as subtitles and ingame messages doesn't show up.Unfinished and unsatisfying.			"

												The enjoyability of this game is pretty much ruined by the absence of support for it. Some of the controls aren't easy to figure out and you're pretty much required to know up front about collectible items, advisors, routes, etc. Meanwhile, there is no useful website or manual to be found anywhere, nor is there an active community. So basically, unless you already know how to play the game from back in the day, don't bother.			"

												The first few hours are a game of short-term memory. You go to the travel agency, and it lists six or so trips you can assign to your planes. Now you have to remember which plane is going to be in which city at which time - if you pick up a ticket that you can't fly, you pay a fairly-hefty penalty. If you don't pick up enough tickets, you won't be able to beat your competitors.Now you've picked up your tickets, it's time to assign them to your planes! The new short-term memory game is to remember which airports have which abbreviations in their schedules (London is LHR, for instance) - the airline-schedule side of the screen uses the airport-abbreviation codes, and the ticket side of the screen uses the city name. Then assign the tickets to the planes in the most efficient way so you aren't flying the planes empty too often - using a bit of trial an error, since you haven't memorized the airport abbreviations yet.And the short-term memory game is made harder because your guy has to actually WALK between the travel agencies and your office. Repeatedly. Picking up no more than six tickets at a time. (And really, no more than three tickets, because the profitability of about half of the tickets is abysmal.) While you try to remember which plane has a capacity of 180 passengers, and which plane has a capacity of 90 passengers, and which city it's in so it can get to the ticket's starting city in time, and when it's available, and dangit, this much memorization just isn't fun. I found myself wondering whether the game should do this scheduling automatically, only to realize that this short-term memory thing is supposed to *be* the game.Also, don't work for Honey Airlines. Their office is the one furthest away from the travel agencies, so your guy spends even longer walking.			"

												Have loved this game for year on the PC, esspecially when playing multiplayer with my brother. However back then the multiplayer had many issues and crash moments, such as when the seasons changed from sunny to winter... I was hoping they would have fixed those bugs with this release on steam and I haven't encountered any just yet (only played for 2 hours). But I do miss the multiplayer option though.... that was what made the game more fun!			"

												Nice to see another classic on Steam! The game seems to have aged pretty well in term of playablity, though the graphics are what you'd expect from a game thats over 5 years old now. Like other players I'm having some issue with lag- it seems a pitty that the developer has seen fit to re-release the game, but not optimise it for modern machines.Luckily, for me the lag issue hasn't made the game completely unplayable, and I'm happy enough to revisit a game I used to spend far too many hours on.

												Brought back some good memories from playing this game when I was young. The same great game I fell in love with along side games like theme hospital and theme park world.The controls and playstyle are confusing a first but once you know what your doing its a piece of cake. And as for the people getting lagg, I have none. :)			"

												Not bad, but why is it so slow? The graphics are not good in this game but yet is very slow? Its a good time passer. I would recomend this game to people who are interested in the business aspect of aviation, and who have a general interest in routing flight paths.			"

												This game is awesome! Has a learning curve though. Not everyone will get it at first as it takes a few tries on how to actually make a profit in the game.Basically you can play the Campaign mode in which the manager of the airport gives the airlines specific tasks and each of you have to race to complete this objectives (Earn 5,000,000, Fly 2500 passangers etc.)There's also a free game mode in which there are no specific tasks, just you organizing flights and stuffMostly you'll be planning flights which are the most profitable, or carries to most passangers depending on what your objectives are.Other stuff include sabotaging fellow airliners and buying them out and liquidating their companies so you can have more space in the airport.tl;drIt's awesome if you dedicate your time on learning the mechanics of the game. Not recommended for players who don't like analyzing too much.			"

												I used to play this game a lot when I was twelve years old. Already a rabid simulator, god, and tycoon game player at that age, this game brings back memories of arranging flights and watching the money pouring in. Taking care of oil supplies, maintenance, staff, and the company image makes this game feel like you are taking care of an airline company in this quirky version of our world. Parsed from spreadsheets like other sim games, this game harkens back to the era simpler simulated games. Already complex with the element of distance, plane range, maintenance, etc., this is still a fantastic simulator worth playin0g, even with its age.However, that doesn't detract the fact that the game's age is showing. The crashes happening at the 4 hour mark reminds me of my youthful frustration of time sunk into the game and the real need of a more adjustable frequency of autosaves. The causes of the crash ranges from the music changing to just plain old, old coding that seems to be unfixable. Even with saves, you need to save multiple files and at various junctures to avoid creating cariables that ed to the crash in the first place. It is unfortunate that this game with it being almost two decades old does not have the developer support, but the undying love from the fans. (And this is with the advent of Airline Tycoon 2 which I will review at a later time, grouses and all.)In conclusion, this is a fantastic game I would highly recommend even with my low playtime exhibited here. My childhood was this game. Almost became an airline pilot because of it. However, I prefer the cockpit than the mudpit during basic training leading to this inevitable review of me reliving a life of piloting the air.			"

												This game was great when it came out, and it still is today.  There's something fun about trying to build your airline while 3 ruthless AI oppenents try to sabotage your every move....with a smile on their face.  Can someone tell me what the spider is for?  The postcard?  I want to get the laxadives....			"

												I like this game a lot. Oldie but Goldie. No trouble running it on Win 10, low-end computer. It´s good for hours of fun, for all ages. I hate writing reviews, but I saw that the game received so many negative reviews recently.			"
