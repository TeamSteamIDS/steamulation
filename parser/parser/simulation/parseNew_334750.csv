At least MP was patched in today one month after release(non steam). I was starting to think the developers abandoned this game. No signs of upcomming patches or at least stating something like ""We are working to fix the gamebreaking bugs(stated in the forums)"". Well... Im sure this game has some nice features and of course it will be fun to play (if u can play it properly) but at the current stage it feels more like an early access game. Bless the new steam refund system (to bad it doesnt support 3rd party purchases...)			"

												I am going to admit at first the game didnt work well at release and I was mad..  But since the recent patches that have come out worked lots of issues out and now this game has really grown on me...   I really like the field work its much more refined than Farming Simulator .. even with mods.I also love the tire tracks.I am looking forward to building up my farm and it seems tractors can break down we will see??If you are a farming game fan you should give this one a go I just warn you its not great with a xbox controller IMO just didnt suit me how it was set up..   Keyboard and mouse work great though so no harm no foul..Great job on the patch Silden keep up the good work "

												I kan not advice this game to anyone, maybe in the future.At this point it has to many small bugs witch lead to annoying gameplay. But it had potantial!pro's: plowing helps you can see progress on each field orchards different animals the fields really feel like you've worked on the, traktor slides in the mudCon's: textures seems to pop in and out of sync tractors slide of hills and can't back up on hills progress resets sometimes while working on field so you have to restart animals textures belong in a game 10years ago no info what so ever in the store so you have to guess what the equepment is for(EG fruit harvesters)It's has good potential. Exelling FS15 in a few areaw but falling short in the total picture! "

												Has promise and glimpses of glory, but in the end it falls short.Compared to Farming Simulator 15, it has some wonderful bright spots that were enough to keep me playing it for awhile.  The brightest spots were that you start off as a small farm, with minimal buildings that you can upgrade.  For example, you cannot start off storing just all the grain you want of any type, you start off with wheat storage, and have to build bins for the rest and can upgrade them to hold more capacity.  The rest of the buildings work in a similar fashion.  The other biggest selling point is you start off as a novice farmer with poor skills.  There is a category for just about everything, and as you perform each skill, such as harvesting, you become better at harvesting making your combine perform with less grain loss.  You get similar bonuses for each other category.Farm Expert has a few other minor improvements over Farming Simulator.  It feels like a bit more of a simulation.  It actually shows you climbing up your tractor instead of magically appearing inside it as you do with Farming Simulator.  In Farm Expert, you also cannot jump out of your tractor when it is moving.  There are other little things too, like you actually have to go to a store to buy seed/fertilizer for your farm storage instead of always having an endless supply at your farm.  Also, in Farm Expert you can actually miss the wagon and dump your entire combine load on the ground.  Farming Simulator 15 will not let you make this mistake.  Another nice feature is when plowing, it actually shows furrows in the field, and you can actually plow with a wheel in the furrow and it tilts the tractor at an angle as it would in real life.  It also has realistic detection for the ground you are working in a field.  In Farm Simulator, even if you drive in a crazy curvy circle around the field, the ground you work shows up behind you in either a straight line across the field, perpendicular, or a 45 degree angle in between.  With Farm Expert, it actually shows the curves while working the ground and that made me giddy.At this point, it actually sounds like an amazing game, and it would be, but then you start to notice the problems.  Like when I go to put down my cultivator at the main farm on the concrete pad, as I lower it before detaching, I see the blades disappear under the concrete.  Then I look over at my plow, and it is also slightly sitting below the concrete.  There are some other physics problems too.  Like when I parked my tractor at the edge of the field while harvest, parallel to the field, it slid sideways very slowly and ended up in the middle of the field by the time I was done harvesting.  There was barely any slope at all to the field.  I actually thought it was flat until this started to happen and then I noticed the slight grade.  It is more than just that mistake too.  While plowing slightly downhill, if you stop with the plow still in the ground, the tractor still rolls forward at a noticeable speed.  This is very troubling because in real life, it would have to be a very, very steep slope for this to happen, probably something like a black or double black diamond ski slope.  Maybe even steeper.  It does this for all equipment, not just a plow.  There is something very wrong with the physics engine in this game.Another minus for this game is the lack of major equipment brands, but this might not bother you so much.  They do have some minor brands, but for some, like the base combine you can buy, it is generic green with no brand name on it at all.  I was so happy about the other features of this game that I overlooked this aspect of the game until other problems started to show.Overall, it is a good game, and if they continue to make improvements and possible fix the physics, it would be an amazing game.  However Farming Simulator 15 is already a better game, and without the wonderful community of mod support that Farming Simulator 15 has, I just cannot recommend Farm Expert 2016. "

												Farm Expert 2016 is another sim trying to go up against FS 15 with vast goals but only half vast implementation.The lack of tool tips and general explanation  of farm equipment fuctionality will leave most players frustrated from the very early game stages.The tutorial is long. . . really really long ,yet only shows the simpelest of tasks and so does not prepare you for what comes in Freeplay mode. This brings us to the game modes.They are listed as Campaign and Freeplay.In fact there is no Campaign ,that is the tutorial. The Freeplay mode offers two maps and if you bought ""Day 1 DLC"" you also get a map called Fruit Company which introduces a new farming style involving orchard work.There are no tutorials or explanations as such for this part of the game at all. Gameplay: The physics are  , well ,odd.Some rather strange bugs that need worked out here.Perhaps the only thing buggier than the physics are the texture/lighting effects.The bugs and oddities here are too numerous to mention. Playing the game is actually quite engrossing.If you can figure out all the unexplained functions/mechanics that are never explained.There are also balance issues between outlay for gear etc. and payout. You may find a years work will do little more than cover the interest on your loan. So after all that why do I give the game a reccomendation? Once again we see a game that has the potential to be real competition to the only farm sim game out there worth playing.If the developers add the needed tool tips etc. and actually care enough to work out the many many bugs and as they have stated they would,add modding support, this game might also break the type of simulator sales records held by Farm Simulator 2015 and ETS 2. If however the support dries up yet again ,then this possibly great game will find it's way to the bargain bins reserved for shovelware simulators and THAT would be a real shame.			"

												Played it for a short bit, and I did enjoy it. I just play farming games when I am bored, and this game has entertained me. I can list the few things that annoyed me in the game:- Screen flashes after the entering/exiting a vehicle animation.- The graphics are a bit sharp, and can be a bit uncomfortable (had no other way of explaining it).- After exiting a vehicle, you suddendly active superpowers that allows you to push every vehicle for several metres.- Low framerate, but I do not really notice it in this game. To be honest, you could play this game in 30fps without trouble.- A few glitches that are less annoying, because they do not affect gameplay (too much)That was it. I would also like to include what makes this game good:- The groundwork. Plowing has been made awesome.- Rear cam in every vehicle. This is awesome even though I play in third person.- Lost of activities, like fruit harvesting.- Exciting music.- Fruit harvesting.- Improved a lot since the previous game (same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine though).- More animals, even though they just make the game lag.- You have to go to a store to buy wheat, and come back when you are empty.- The lvl and repairing stuff. I like that.My conclusion is: The game is not quite finished yet, and it still needs a lot of work. It has some better bits than Farming Simulator, and some worse. It is definitely not worth the cash, but if you have some money that you don't know what to use for, and you enjoy farming simulators, I would go for it. It's very glitchy, but it does not affect gameplay too much. I wouldn't say that the game is better than Farming Simulator, but it has some better parts. Thanks for reading, and remember:If you aren't able to play the game because it won't start or your pc is too weak, don't post a negative review. That is like posting a negative review of a book that you are unable to read. Thanks for your attention! *flies away*			"

												Similar to Professional Farmer? Yes. Very... but not identical. Feels more developed, but that said, this needs more lovin' from the Devs.  I bought it because I'm desparate for an alternative to Farming Simulator's repetitive cycle of shiny, cleanly built, solidly-performing anual copy of Farming Simulator 1.  Something with a sense of player/farm progression (getting better at farming, building new structures that actually have a function, etc).  Something with at least a reasonable amount of physics...Farming Simulator is shiny, but flat. Its devs don't seem to want to try anything new, and I get really tired of paying $50 +DLC every year or two for essentially the same game with a slightly higher polygon count.Farm Expert has the things I'm looking for, but not the level of development and polish that FS's higher budget affords.  Bias out in the open- I WANT THIS GAME TO SUCCEED.  That said, performance is choppy at times, even on high-end hardware. The physics feel like the devs had higher hopes than funding (or higher profiteering?) Still...Given an under-developed game abandoned(?) to the market before its proper time, or a shinier farming game that suffers from KSP-like syndrome of needing dozens of mods to make it what it should be...I'll stick with FE2016 for a while. It's cheaper.			"

												Reading the reviews from others clearly proves that some people will never be satisfied with anything. Yeah it isn't Farming Simulator 15 so what?Yes it has quite the Pro Farming 2014 feel to it but it still has more stuff added that makes it worth it. For example, the whole fruit farming and the DLCs. It is something extra to keep you busy and give the farming feel to it.The negative side however, is that it still needs more work to make it better.It has the potential to be an amazing farming game.  All in all, it really isn't THAT bad of a game! Don't always take the negative reviews as a done deal. Give the game a try, you can always get a refund.Also, One of the Devs is actually interacting with us in the community and have reassured us of ongoing support and free DLCs now and then.  They take notice and give feedback. So before you jump on the ''I want my money back!'' bandwagon, make sure you actually take the time to check it out and not just review  after 5 minutes of playing the game. And as a female gamer with family history of farming, this is fun! No it aint the real deal or it isn't that accurate, it still gives the farming aspect and it can keep you busy.Definitely recommend checking it out.			"

												Its an Interesting game with a few nice concepts and details, But thats about it.If you are a true fan of simulators and realisum, this is not for you. all the tractors are weird, they look more like cartoon tractors than the real thing. The loaders are terrible, being unable to rotate the loader tool/bucket or simply changing tools makes moving bales difficult or anything else for that matter and unrealistic. The graphics are very good at giving you a headace and the sounds are in your face and the annoying. Nothing feels right in this game. Buy farming simualtor instead. I must a played FS for more than a 1000 hours and its a much better game.  "

												I must say that I'm quite disappointed with this game.  I was one of the first to jump on the band wagon and get this on the initial release, only to find a game that wasn't even half completed, and with no documentation to explain how things are supposed to work.  To the developers credit, they had/have tremendous potential for a blockbuster in this game, if only they'd complete it.  Sadly, I gave up on it after a few months of it's release last year, and simply watched the forums to see if they were improving it.  They're not.  I can only conclude that this is now 'abandonware'.  I cannot recommend this title.			"

Tractor sliding slowly on the ground like if it was sitting on pure ice with a strong wind even when stopped, game crashing for no reason, UI lacks a bit of intuitiveness also.I would not recommend this game as it sits. 3/10.I would like to revisit down the road if the game ever gets patched, but I'd do it with a provided review license			"

												This game needs some work on the backend to increase performance.  Expecially if you adjust settings and nothing effects your framerate. If this company is going to keep rehashing the same engine for this game they really need to focus on getting the performance fixed that is a major game breaker for most people.  I felt that with the missions, some what story line, skills that increase, and many other things.  This could be a FARM SIMULATOR continder but with performance  being a major issue I will always fall on its face.  Anyways  I would recommend trying this game but be warned of the possible problems with it.			"

												The features in this game is great! Better than farming simulator because you can lvl up and the career has more progression. But the game wont go over 24 fps for me eaven with everything on the lowest. If the game was running well i would play it!			"

												it's good but not great because it still has many bugs that need fixing but hey for $10 it's worth trying but i'd recommend 2017 over 2016 and in any case fs is much better so thumbs down for me			"

												this has to be one of the worst farming games i have ever played, i have just started and the tutorial can NOT be skipped. for those that have played other farm games and know what to do. and to add insult onto injury, the game only gives you useless hints like you are cultivating a area that has not been plowed, for better crops plow and then cultivate. and the same thing for sowing. and i bet it will be the same thing for when its time to harvest. my guess at what the hint will say "" you are harvesting a unsowed area for better crops try sowing and then harvest"".  the tutorial does not let you choose what to do. you start by plowing the field then cultivating it and then sowing it. so the hints for better crops are completely useless.
