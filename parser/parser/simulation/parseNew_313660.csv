												Total War: Rome II is fine for the plebeian masses, but for the true Romanophile there is Alea Jacta Est.  Not only does it include some of the more popular conflicts such as Caesar's civil war and the slave revolt of Spartacus (DLC), but also has some of lesser known internal struggles like Marius vs. Sulla, and the year of the four emperors (my personal fav). For those who have never played an AGEOD game before the learning curve may be a little steep, though not nearly as bad as some of the more complicated grand strategy games out there (I'm looking at you HoI3!)So, if you're a fan of Roman history like I am, and are looking for something with a little more depth than, 'march army here, capture city,' this is the game for you!

												Simply a beautiful game. At its heart it is very simple and the age engine itself is Imo much easier to learn than some of the Clausewitz games e.g. HOI3. True the tutorial does not explain enough and formulating strategy is the main difficulty and can be very complex in the generally bigger original scenarios. Some of these are quite formidable multi-front affairs  (for these its best to look at the AARs on the ageod forum/youtube). Hence I would advice to get most of the dlc, especially BOR, Spartacus and Parthia. These are smaller, easier to manage affairs generally. (Hannibal is great too, but 2nd Punic war is quite big) (Cantabrian wars is hard). The AI can make mistakes e.g. placing its main army in cities that can fall at a stroke to a successfull siege, and other supply stuff, but overall it is pretty capable and can be a worthy adversary/ and can win sometimes. But what I really enjoy about these strategy games is how much history I have learned from them. Like whether Pompey was right to go to the East and the pros/cons of adapting the corvus boarding devise to the Quinqereme ship. I also love the alternative history (but based on facts) Caesar's revenge scenario against Parthia (easy Roman whitewash :) ). I cannot emphasise how much it has taught me and makes me want to read more. In summary a true Roman game for true Romans :)			"

												Sooner or later, when playing Rome Total War, you start getting this uncomfortable feeling that what you're doing on the strategic map is just a stage prop for pixel soldiers to run around in pretty period costumes.Alea Jacta Est, though very nice to look at, is not about eye candy.Instead, it gives you a very detailed strategic and operational view of what the opposing sides were dealing with.  When battles or skirmishes take place they are resolved abstractly, though the abstraction gives a pretty detailed depiction of the tactical characteristics that were likely to be in play.This game is part of a series that includes Birth of Rome (the later phases of Rome's conquest of Italy, including the confrontation with Pyrrhus and the first Punic War), Hannibal (the second Punic War), and the Parthian Wars (Rome's Eastern Front).  These three games aren't on Steam yet, which is unfortunate, because watching the Third Samnite War scenario unfold feels a lot like reading Livy.This is probably the best ancient history simulator on the market.  Learning how to play it can be a bit confusing at first until you realize that there aren't actually a lot of different kind of actions to master: most of what gets discussed in the manual is just a description of what's going on under the hood.

ENG:Alea Jacta Est(AJE) was my first AGEod game, and which brought me to the world of AGEod strategy games.Don't check my Steam play time - game just release at Steam Store, while was selling at Matrix Games Store since 2012.As I have said multiple times: It's incredible - how AGEod engine can simulate Ancient Roman Wars, American Revolution, American Civil War and finally Great War, despite such a large spread in time frame, each game is unique, - I have never had a feeling that I'm buying same game.AJE is a good start for new AGEod players, since it provides lots of different scenarios differs at scale and time frame - from ""Sulla's First Civil War"" till ""Year of Four Emperors"".Different scenarios and sides provide unique experience in every aspect of  Roman life at picked scenario period.And that gives you tons of enjoyment playing AJE.Nicely drawn unit pictures, detailed map and nice music provides incredible experience of the Rome.If you're interested in Roman Civil Wars or Rome itself(Doesn't matter if it's Republic or Empire)  and/or you enjoyed other AGEod titles, pick Alea Jacta Est.Especially with this dirty cheap price tag(60% discount).RUS:Alea Jacta Est (AJE) была моя первая игра от AGEod, которая и привела меня в мир стратегий AGEod. Не смотрите на моё время игры в Стиме - игра только что появилась в Steam, хотя продавалась в магазине Matrix Games с 2012 года. Как я уже говорил в других ревью AGEod игр: Это невероятно - как движок AGEod  может симулировать Римские Войны, Американскую Революцию, Гражданскую Войну в США и, наконец, Первую мировую войну - несмотря на такой большой разброс во времени, каждая игра является уникальной, у меня никогда не возникало ощущения, что мне продают что-то второй раз. AJE это хорошее начало для новых игроков AGEod, так как она предоставляет много различных сценариев отличающиехся в масштабах и временных рамках - от ""Первой гражданской войны Суллы"" до ""Года Четырех Императоров"". Различные сценарии и стороны конфликта дают уникальный опыт в каждом аспекте  жизни Рима. И это приносит кучу удовольствия, играя AJE. Красиво нарисованные юниты, подробная карта и музыкальное сопровождение даёт возможность погрузится в эпоху Рима. Если вы заинтересованы в римских гражданских войнах или в истории самого Рима(Будь то Республика или Империя) или вам нравятся (если нет - вам понравятся :)) и другие игры серии AGEod, - берите Alea Jacta Est. Особенно за такую цену (60% дисконт).			"

												In case its not obvious - I have played this game for a long time before its Steam release.This is a brilliant strategic wargame available at a ridiculously low price. I have lost many a glorious hour in the maps and stat screens and menus of this game, now its finally on Steam.If the strategic aspects of Roman warfare, such as logistics, army movement, stances and numbers appeal to you; if you were disappointed by the lack of strategic depth and authenticity in Total War Rome 2 or the shallow military aspects of EU Rome; you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. Actually at this price... any strategy gamer should give this game a try.AGEOD veterans will be right at home. Others may need to look at a few Youtube tutorials and playthroughs. You can also look at some AARs for learning all the epic things you can do in this game -http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?549151-AGEOD-AAR-s-Index&p=12638919&viewfull=1#post12638919http://www.ageod-forum.com/forumdisplay.php?316-AJE-Alea-Jacta-Est-AARs&s=212e1b7c016ec2c8ff956162479afd10&sort=replycount&order=descCheers!

												Read the manual. It is excellent. If you can't be bothered reading the manual, this type of game is not for you.I had some initial problems, but I watched Exxar and Charles Cummings on youtube and read through the manual and now I love playing this game. I can spend 20 minutes planning a turn which is why I am not bothered by long end turns because the tension really builds.If you have some issues with jerkiness at full zoom out just check the forum because you fix it by changing one setting.This is a fantastic strategy game for this era. The DLCs and the support that AJE will get means this is game that you will be playing for the next two or three years.			"

												This game is a true gem in multiplayer, but the AI is not worth a dime. I would say, it is the best game of the Roman period  on a strategic and operational scale.  The standalone titles are pretty nice, especially BoR and PAR.  Supply routes and weather conditions are substantial part of the the game, the command chain is well done and leader abilities can change the course of war.Where light is , there is shadow. The worst on this game is the unstable engine, especially, if you run other programms in the backround. Furthermore you can search a long time for opponents, if you don't register in Ageod's Forum, which can be difficult, because there are constantly error messages, when I have tried to register and wrote four damn  letters to them, but they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it, so I would suggest, you better try to register BEFORE you buy this game, because once you learned it, the AI  will be no challenge and no fun at all and if you don't know anyone, who play it, you find yourself in a ugly situation.What is the final score? I would give the game 8/10 ( 10-2 points because of stability issues) and 0/10 for Ageod Forum. Since it is concerning the game, because there is no pbem server, I would take it in the multiplayer part and my final rating is 8/20.  "

												Alea Jacta Est is an absolutely wonderful game. Focusing on any Roman time period of signficant importance from the times of the dictator ""Sulla""  to Julius Caesars glorious rise to power, and even the war of control by his heir Octavian. I won't lie, like many AGEODS titles this game requires patience to learn, but the tooltips soon become your friends and you are playing without a doubt the most detailed game focusing on the period. Nothing is left out, even Senators of the time can often be spotted commanding entire legions. I try a Sulla Campaign here, I hope it gives you an idea of what to expect. Ave and good luck!

												You love Grand Strategy Games?You love historical Settings?You are willing to read a manual?You love a challenge?You are not afraid of your wife? You know how to handle the ""Just one more turn"" syndrom?Graphics and visual presentation is not more important for you than gameplay?If you can answer all these question with ""Yes, Sir, Yes!"", you should really consider to buy one of the AGEOD Grand Strategy Games. (The one with the historical setting you are interested in!)To be honest, I avoided AGEOD games in the past, because I was always too lazy to read another manual besides the one from GG´s War in the East and the long turn processing times from Pride of Nations... ... now I know this was a huge mistake.The depth of these games (I am talking about all AGEOD Games, not only this one) is awesome, and the rules and mechanics running in the background are incredible deep, so complex that you have to read the manual if you want to master the game. Moving around your units is easy. To know why your units are out of supply, exhausted, lost half of their manpower is a step to master these games.In my play time in Alea Jacta Est, I played only 1 Scenario, ""The Civil War between Ceasar and Pompeius"" and I have to admit, at first it was frustrating, because I played the tutorial first, but reading the manual changed everything and the game became a blast. Sure, the older AGE games are missing the ability to set up battle tactics (like The Thirty Years War) but I am simply in love with the historical setting and so far, this is the BEST Grand Strategy Game I was able to play for this setting. What do you get?Turn based battles? No!You can´t directly influence the battles, they are automaticly resolved.The task and challenge is to pick the right time, the right place, the right composition of troopsthe right commander in chargeand the right enemy to attackSome more R´s can be added, but I guess I will cover them later.Micromanagement?Compared with games, like Hearts of Iron, or War in the East/West, the micromanagement level is low.The only real micromanagement I encountered so far, is keeping your supply chain in shape, this requires to move several supply wagons every turn, at least if you really want to be as efficent as possible with your troops.Building troops, Diplomacy, building province improvements are simple and easy.Alternate History?Compared to Paradox Grand Strategy Games = No!Is this bad = No!First of all, you can win the Civil War as Pompeius, but many decisions and diplomatic options are only available if you reach a specific turn, not all, but many. But, it´s still up to you to decide if you use the diplomatic option or how you decide. Empire building?No, the games are ALL about WAR Scenarios, not about building an Empire or a Dynasty.Your job is to win a war with a limited amount of ressources and this can only be achieved by using everything  with the highest efficency! Is this fun?If you like board games and you can enjoy ""the mind game"" part = spending a lot of time in front of your monitor with thinking and listening to music or an audiobook, yes it´s fun. "

												It is very fun, and very well done. No doubt one of Ageod's flagship games. Alea Jacta Est is very friendly for new players. Any new players to AJE who learn to play this game, will learn to play all of Ageod's game. The battles feel so 'contained' and the map and regions are not overwhelming. Overall, a good beginning point, and a whole lot of fun for veterans. The focus of the base game alone is on the Roman civil war, thus the little excerp under the title ""Roman Civil Wars"". The game is very realistic and accurately represents the scenario with extreme realism. Ammo, weather, terrain, food, are all accounted for, as well as the rating of historical generals and the troop compositions and available resources to the factions in the game respectively. There is many events to read, and hisotircal choices to choose from to either follow the historic route of said general or nation, or simply choose a hypothetical one that will or will not help you change history, or simply re-live it. One of the huge upsides of Alea Jacta Est is that this is a very good beginning point for new player of such wargames that offer this kind of realism, and also those new to Ageod games. Reading the manual is indeed required, and mistakes are going to happen before you really start to know what you are doing. But once you leap that hurdle that will only take maybe an hour or two to finally get a grip on this game, you'll soon realize how much flexibility that Alea jacta Est has to offer in terms of realism and how to handle the scenarios in question. You'll really feel like a true armchair general, and get a kick out of managing armies, logistics, and challenges that are presented in all the scenarios this game has to offer. If you want a realistic simulation of ancient warfare, and learn about the battles and challenges the Roman Republic faced, knowing that everything will be historically sound, then this game is for you. If you are a Roman history fan, and want an immersive game that will simulate a lot of the content you'll normally read in a textbook, and finally want a game that offers realism, and historical accuracy, then this game is for you. But if you are a Roman history fan, but don't have the patience to read a manual once in a while, or can't be bothered with realistic details or restrictions based on real historical factors affecting the various campaigns and scenarios presented in this game, then this game may not be for you. This is a wargame, and requires patience, reading the manual, and experimenting and spending time with the game, as well as making the best use of the historical situation of the various scenarios and campaigns. Alea Jacta Est is NOT a sandbox game, the map is 2-d using sprite counters because it is a wargame, and very realistic, and compared to other wargames, ALea Jacta Est is gorgeous, which means, do not expect some fantastic 3-d special effects from this game, as that is not the focus. This genre of strategies are NOT for everyone, which is why it is considered a 'niche' genre, and that is for a reason. Buy at your own risk, but have fun, and happy gaming.			"

												Verdict: This is one of the best strategy games in which you're commanding armies of antiquity. Pros:1. Units are quite detailed and seem to be about as effective as their historical counterparts.2. There is some logistics which prevents you from ahistorical winter fighting - it is really hard to get supplies most of the time, although is possible and might catch your opponent with his pants down.3. Quite a few nations and different time settings which means a lot of diversity.4. Many historical characters to command your armies or to fight against.5. Different events to explore what-ifs, forge alliances or declare wars. 6. Map is actually quite nice and cities are different for each period. Cons:1. You're not able to command you men in the field.2. Graphics are somewhat dated, as is the game's engine in my opinion. Overall - I do recommend it if you're a history buff, who enjoys a good strategy game.			"

												7 hours into the game and I have.....72 errors and 17 CTDs reported...Do I have a good PC Rig? Well, I can play the Witcher 3 on Ultra in 4k at 60fps so I guess that's not the problem. It's even more annoying that the error logs are mostly in French so I have absolutely no idea what is going on. However, being able to be Clodius Albinus and kicking D. Julianus and S. Severus in the rear was pure satisfaction.A shame considering I am such a huge fan of every Roman period (especially civil wars) and yet I am unable to progress in this game without having to re-launch it after every 2 turns because of a CTD or bug or whatever. I was looking at buying the expansion packs if the base game was playable (which it somewhat isn't) but there is no way I am going to do that after 7 hours of bug after bug.3/10. (The 3 is for alternate history playability, the interface agrees with me, and the turn loading times are quicker than any other AGEOD game I have played....Unless it CTDs...)			"

												One of the best war strategy games that has a great deal of focus on realism over the otehr arcadey stuff. Tough to get into. I myself played it and abandoned it lots of times (been playing a non steam version for the past 3 years). Howver, the developers dont really support the old games when the new AGEOD titles come out. Thus, dont expect paradox/taleworlds kind of mod support or dev support. This is the only dissapointement. THe developers actually make no attempts to make it more enjoyable for th community. They probably believe that people who're hooked into strategy wargaming to this level of realism (I havent found anything more ""real"" till date) have no option but to eat out of their hands.			"

												Alea Jacta Est as an idea for a game is a good oneIn execution it needs a lot of workThe game suffers from slow run time and an annoying habit of crashing and at times the game simply doesn't register my commands and i have to click multiple times before it gets the message (although this cold just be the slow runtime)The gameplay could be interesting if I knew what was going on as the tutorial does a very poor job of explaining how battles work and tells you nothing at all about the units (ie what there stats mean, what different units are good for etc)from what i can gather it seems that armies have a power score based on their units and health (possibly morale too) and this combined with the general and terran will determine the outcome of a battle it feels like a more complex and interesting version of the battle system in crusader kings or EU (which is good cause both those games need a better system for battles) and I feel that if I could just figure out what to do (and have the game run well enough to have the chance to do it) It would be very deep and challenging and a lot of fun.As it stands now I wont recommend this game, give it a few months to sort itself out and wait for another steam sale by then hopefully it will be running well enough to be some real fun.

												This is one of the more polished of Ageod games and my recommendation for newcomers to this game engine and it's plethora of historical strategy based programs.  Alea Jacta Est.  The Die is Cast. It is challenging with a diabolical AI, that may seem like it cheats, but there is always something to factor in all the complexities. For instance, each leader has their bonuses during certain circumstances which when in play goes unoticed until closer inspection. The gameplay will have you using your judgement often times the main dependent upon victory or defeat relies on attrition and supply points. Outsmarting the AI is based heavily on not only predicting their next move but taking the chance to act upon what you have worked up to and making sure everything is aligned perfectly, even then the elements such as weather and drought can afflict as much damage as the enemy. I admire the art work of individual units, and there is enough here to fill an encyclopedia with knowledge of the lands and historical accuracy, although there is no ingame database per se. This among all the other  games in its genre captures the mystique best of the era by not divulging the eccentricities of the ancient world, but by displaying the bareboned technologies and warlike culture and not meandering far from that, all held together by the natural episodic musical pieces. There is a Play By Email Multiplayer utility that seems rather ancient, I feel this could be streamlined better, and in some of Ageod's newer games I hear it is.			"

												Sorry guys, I wanted to like this game.  If I ever learn it, I may even still.  However, the game is not for me.  Overly complicated management systems are fine when they are less obfuscated.  The tutorial teaches you the very basics, and then you are thrown into a set up limited turn scenario where you cannot waste turns figuring things out.  I cannot figure out how the economy works.  Some of that may just be that I am currently playing multiple games and don't want to spend the hours trying to learn it.  There are only a couple lets plays, and they move pretty quickly and either don't explain, or spend 15 minutes explaining the history of a feature in Roman civilization rather than how it functions in game.  I get it, some REALLY love Rome. I enjoy but not on that level.  Basically, I learned the paradox games no problem, but this one remains vague.To top it off, the game engine is a pig.  You resolve a turn, and the game basically freezes until you get to a battle screen.  Turns take 30 seconds to a minute depending.  I hear that the game this engine is from ""Pride of Nations"" was much worse.  I really want to try the Civil War 2 game based on the engine, I am just afraid at that price that I won't be able to learn it.  I have limited gaming time these days with kids/wife etc, and don't want to spend a week of gaming time learning a system.  The game looks nice, although I have to play in in a crappy low res because the ffonts are so small I couldn't read it.  The game is all about reading text and figures, and I couldn't.  Not only size, but the particular font didn't blend well with the backgrounds thru my tv.  I play paradox games at 1080 with no problem, so I'm not exactly blind.  I applaud the developers, and I'm sure there is a really nice game here.  For me, as a moderate wargame tactical fan, it is just too much when coupled with the bad UI and long turns that you cant even scroll the map during.  If I ever find the impetus to learn the game and put some time into it, I may change my vote.  Not bad, but not for everyone.  Romanophiles and serious warsim people may enjoy a bit more, or if you have some experience with the engine, which I do not.			"

												I am a fan of historical wargames and obtuse strategic simulations, so I picked this up on sale. Generally speaking it has all of the necessary components for a historical wargame. The battles themselves are quite hands off, the game focuses on the logistics leading up to a battle and then the calculations are made. It seems reasonably well researched, though it's more of a spreadsheet than an immersive experience as a Roman general/politician/powerbroker.However, what leads me to caution others about the game is the extremely poor optimization. The load times are bad, things get kind of choppy and unresponsive, and it just makes the whole experience a drag. You know this game is going to be a time investment to learn, and that poor optimization is going to drag the whole experience down as it aggregates. In this day and age, the discerning wargamer doesn't mind playing a game that could have been made in 1994, but it is expected to run fast and stable. As such, I cannot reccomend this game, unless you are an absolute fanatic of either Roman History or historical wargames.I will happily change my review to a reccommend if they improve the optimization. Until then, stay away, especially at retail price.			"

												Bought the game, played for three hours and despite an i7 processor and SSD this game ran at a 'steady' 5 FPS making it an unforgettably horrific experience. A pity... because this is a great game with a lot to offer strategy fans. Hopefully will be fixed in the future in which case I'll gladly buy it again, but in this state it's unplayable.			"

												Great game if you enjoy obtuse grand strategy kind of like Paradoxs main games. But it is kind of choppy even on a high end system and crashes within an hour every time. If that ever gets fixed get it but it has been forever. Consider their WW1 game  intead.			"

												I can't really recommend this because a) it's not historically accurate, which would presumably be one of ageod's strengths by this point, and b) it's a return to the buggy, broken pre-pride of nations engine that runs terribly. This is a mystifying decision! Strictly speaking, though, it's identical to every other ageod title. I guess if you like those, you'll maybe like this one, but it's not a very good entry in their series of games. If you want to play an AGEOD game then go with To End All Wars.			"

												BUYER BEWARE!!!! : I love grand strategy games, so I was excited to dive into the depths of this game and love it for everything it was or was not. I was never able to get the game to play in an acceptable resolution. Everytime I tried to change the resolution via the config file found in the games root directory it completly crashed my computer all the way to a cold boot. Out of the 509 games I currently have on steam it is the ONLY one that crashes my computer EVERYTIME I try to change my resolution. After the 2nd hour and 5th complete crash I opted for a refund, that was not an option, so it is now the only game that I have vindictively removed from my computer. I hope these devs go bankrupt, releasing such flawed software in todays market with updates and patches an accepted norm, is a gross oversight and only deserves oustanding contempt from those who bought the product. Dont waste your money here. Paradox makes a whole slew of fantastic grand strategy games that also work as intended.			"

												First and probably last review for a long time. I only comment on this title as I think I paid way too much money for it.As much as I would like to dive into this game and its elaborate back stories,the engine they use is so bloated and unefficient, that on my office PC it is unplayable.Turns take minutes, scrolling is a pain, and using the interface is lagged as hell.Running it from an SSD helps a little, but still unplayable. This on a machine that runs Deus EX HRand Mass Effect 3 just fine. And I think even Arma 3 ran smoother than AJE. Waiting for my Teraflop rig to arrive...			"

												None of its games are playable. I mean, none. All of Ageod's games are the same: buggy, UI  confusing, runs slowly, crashes time to time. Even they can not make a good tutorial! Learn some modern techniques to build a game, Ageod!			"

												I spent very little time with this game. But as a gamer who has spent a ridiculous amount of time with games like Europa Universallis, Victoria 2, and many others like it. I was dissapointed at the steepness of the learning curve and the complexity and difficulty of performing simple tasks. The incredible shoehorning of forcing the player into roughly 5 or 6 scenarios with set turn limits was extremely limiting and dissapointing.			"

												Outstanding level of details and historical accuracy, as usual for a AGEOD game I am tempted to say, but ex nihilo nihil fit, this deep and complex game has a steep learning curve if you are not familiar with the AGE games. The reward is to play the greatest roman era strategy game that is currently available.			"

												Nice simulation of ancient Rome.  Reminds me of the board game Imperium Romanum II, without the poor rule book.			"
