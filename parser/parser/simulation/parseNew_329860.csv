												[This review is VR specific*]This is extremely interesting and a far better prospect that this game's screen based counterpart. We're basically going for more ""funny"" and a bit less ""ridicule"" here by adding motion controls in this physics sandbox game.  The VR experience was mesmerizing enough to land me nearly an hour of gameplay in my first two tries.My only complaint would be, having an extremely substandard amount of space to play in (to the point where Room Scale setup in SteamVR won't let me finish the config) that the teleport feature likes to land you too far away from objects, resulting in a few accidental *real* object battings :-) It might make the game slightly easier to allow us to land right next to stuff, but it'll also be more fun that way.I'll try to give this a good shot in a larger space at one point. I just WISH I had the room to go nuts and unleash the fury.* Thanks to every anti VR shill who indiscriminately downvote VR based reviews. <3			"

Catlateral Damage is a game that is great for resting your brain after playing too many other games or having a rough day. A bit of destruction, a bit of cats and you are in a good mood again. Purrfect. If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are a cat, which is pretty obvious. This game is an advanced simulator of most frequent feline behavoiur: you get to throw things from shelves, closets, tables, chairs, out of wardrobes, fridges and knocking down plants. In other words, you do what cats do best.There are a few different game modes to prevent the game from getting boring.Pros: A perfect relaxation. You can play sandbox mode is you want some stress to get relieved or normal mode for time-limited destruction for skill sharpening. Apartments that you are ordered to put in mess are procedurally generated. They consist of several rooms (bedroom, living room, kitchen ...) There are a lot of different big objects (bunk beds, wardrobes, tables) to push smaller object (pillows, coffee cups, plates, chlothes) from. There are powerups that makes you jump, run and punch better Random events like disco lights You can unlock different cats (like skins) by knocking down cat pictures from the wall Achievements for improved and a bit more meaningful gameplay You can punch from left and right using two separate buttons You can meow (F button)Cons: Apart from knocking things down, there's not really anything else you can do. Not that this game advertised that it can do anything else. Yes, there are different game modes, but they're not that different. This game is fun, yeah, but not $10 fun. Wait for at least 50% discount.Suggestions:Lower the price, that's pretty much all that can be done. This game is great when it comes to messing up an apartment and nobody expects it to do anything else. But it's really not worth that money.The final verdict:Great game, great relaxation, great fun. Not very many different things to do, but the game is made well and you don't easily get bored of it. It's fun, but the price is high.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Catlateral Damage is accurate to what it says it does on it's Steam store page, and honestly, is a good stress reliever. There's something to just knocking everything all and about as a cat and causing massive chaos all over the place, even if the games variety doesn't stand up over a period of time. It's the perfect game in my mind to pick up on sale: or if you need a stress reliever right now, or ever really wanted to be a cat persay. There's some interesting elements for the genre like being able to open areas and the extra type levels like the super market, even if some of the areas are really really hard to get to. Overall, solid game that's worth taking a look at as a destresser tool. +: Lots of cat pictures. I mean, that's what you're here for in the end, right?  Good physics for what you want out of a game like this (not necessarily realistic, but goes to the side of fun) Objectives add variety that the game desperately needed. Love the findable missions like the supermarkat.  Randomly Generated Events keep things fresh and interesting. Particularly a fan of Moon Gravity  Like the openable cabinets and various items.  Great destresser.  Upgrades worth something. -: Some Strange jumping angles in particular with multi-layered overhead cabinets that can be frustrating to get to.  While it has procedurally generated levels, they start to feel the same rather quickly in terms of basic layout. Really wish that one of the unlockable cats was a sabertooth tiger. Not really much more then knocking♥♥♥♥♥♥over simulator. Some reasonable bugs at times, like not being able to jump.For Gameplay footage and more verbal first impressions:

												Playing in VR mode is an absolute blast. Everyone has so much fun having the cute little paws in front of you and just knocking things over. I have a 5 and 7 year old daughter who love going in and knocking things over while making their own cat noises!Only issue is the teleportation frequently places you too close to a wall so that you clip and it can be a bit disorienting. Need to make sure you leave yourself a bit of extra space near objects.			"

Catlateral Damage ReviewThis game is a masterpiece. Nothing else comes close to it. In Catlateral Damage, one plays as a cat, with the sole task of doing exactly what cats do best: knocking stuff on the floor.GameplayThe gameplay is well done, with everything working as it should. It's a simple idea, literally all you do is walk and jump and swat. But the developers have done a fantastic job with this, the only problem is getting used to the jump height. Now, I don't know much about cats, but being able to jump more than half a metre off the ground seems like a lot to me. This means that you'll often mess up your jumps and fail to get onto ledges and tables. The way everything falls seems very real and is wholly satisfying. The upgrades and power-ups are useful, but really only a minor thing in the game, and the developers have avoided making the aim of the game to be getting all the upgrades, something that just wouldn't seem right in a game like this. The events are an extremely fun thing that just happen every so often, randomly. Things like moon gravity, or killing the little red lights, or a disco. They just make you laugh when they happen.Aim of the GameThe aim of the game is to knock everything on the floor, and to unlock cat photos. And boy, are there a lot of cat photos. The game is collection based, where you build a collection of items to drop on the floor. They are divided into multiple categories, such as appliances, clothes, etc.GamemodesThere are two gamemodes; Objective mode and Litterbox mode. In Objective mode, you are placed into a randomly generated location, and you have to knock a set amount of items onto the floor within a time limit. In Litterbox mode, you go to that location again, without the time limit. The aim is to knock every single item in the location onto the floor. There is no time limit, but that doesn't mean it's easy, especially in the Supermarket and Mewseum, which have several thousand objects each!Level DesignThe levels are randomly generated, with the exceptions of the Supermarket and Mewseum. These two are the same every time, but are so big and awesome that you wouldn't notice.The levels are well made, and you can always find some totally cat-like way of climbing up to every shelf or wardrobe. The feeling you get from succesfully parcour-ing up to the highest shelf in a room is immensly satisfactory. Graphics/VisualsThe graphics are not great. They are simplistic and there are no fancy lighting effects. That is not to say it doesn't look nice, because it still does. It has it's own unique style, and I personally find that it is still aesthetically pleasing. The texturing and modelling on the objects is very basic, just boxes with coloured rectangles, but you can always tell what the objects are meant to be. PerformanceThe game runs surprisingly well. I have two copies of it on two separate computers; one for myself and one for my sister. I play on a 2010 MacBook Pro with 4GB of RAM, a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo and an NVidia GeForce 320M. The game runs smoothly at the highest graphics settings (called Purrfect). For my other copy, I'm using a 2007 Intel iMac, with 2GB of RAM, a 2.8 GHz single-core processor and an integrated Intel graphics card. It lags on anything other than the lowest graphics setting, but runs them extremely smoothly, at roughly 35 FPS, solidly. The game will lag on occasion, but only when you're knocking around ten items into the air simultaneously (this usually only happens on bookshelfs).Misc.There are many random things about this which I like, but do not, however, fit into any of the main categories. Trading Cards - everyone loves Steam Trading Cards, right? Achievments - a way to show how far you've come The 'f' key - pressing it can do three different things:   On large objects, you bite them  On smaller objects, you pick them up in your mouth  Without an object, you just meow There are Atari 2600s - everyone's favourite games consoleTHE CONCLUSIONThis games is fantastic for just messing around in, good for stress relief or if you're having a bad day and just can't quite complete that mission in Jedi Academy. The price of £6.99 is a bit much for what it is, though, so wait untill it's on sale to purchase it, but when it is on sale, purchase it immediately! "

Litter mode- Swipe and terrorize at your own pace.""Catlateral Damage"" speaks for itself. Roam, climb, jump, search, destroy. -swipe swipe-  SO ONCE I STARTED REMEMBERING- Instead of cleaning up, I can make a disaster :DStraight to the point: First-Person Cat view, 2 paws of fury, meows here and there. You swipe/ ""dust"" the surface tops with your almighty paws. Go rampage while meowing :3Meow~ meow~Unlike my cat, I DO enjoy knocking things down.

												I played through everything, only missing one achievment so far - so it's time to write a little review.The color palette and style is very nice, kind of reminds me of the old game XIII, pastel style - I like that.As soon as I started the game, the music casted a smile on my face, very nice and fitting; happy little music.The events are sometimes weird and not really useful and just visuals, but it's mixing it up overall.What I'd like to see is another location to unlock or two plus more events, maybe more cats in some future patches and adjustable FOV, because in tighter corners or in the kitchen shelves you lose the overview for a moment.So far it's nice and I enjoyed it - being a cat lover myself. Give it a try!			"

												Got this game on a whim. Was expecting this to be a semi boring game with a few puns that would get my laughter going...But a weird thing happened.. Time went by, I found myself running around tossing things on the floor. Pros: - Tons of cats to unlock, if you have a cat at home your bound to find it's semi-twin in the game.- Weirdly addicting game, even if its abit repetative.- Good level design.- Weird perspective(given that your as high as a cat), but one gets used to it fast, witch is kinda cool.- Supreme controls, they feel responsive and intuitive.- A light RPG element. 3 skills to upgrade :DCons:- To few maps, need more. TO much reusage of the maps.- Add moar cats, plx can never get enough.- I dream of multiplayer, competative. Or just a list that compares scores with friends :D			"

												My paw swipes a dinner plate off the table and I peek over the edge to watch it shatter to pieces on the floor below. The humans will pay for keeping me cooped up all day! Catlateral Damage is a new game where you play as a bored cat wreaking havoc on the everyday objects inside the house. We all know kitten thinks of nothing but murder all day so this game is a realistic simulation of what it's like to be a cat running around the house making mischief and taking care of cat business - knocking down items on shelves and tables, opening doors, hiding in boxes and tunnels, crawling above and behind everything and making a huge mess while you're at it.Greeting you at the main menu is a cheery jazz trio soundtrack which evolves to include some chip tune melodies and trumpets. There are two modes of play - Litterbox Mode and Objective Mode. Litterbox takes you to a level where there is no countdown timer, just tons of no-pressure fun. The objective mode has time and object objectives. The game begins with a cool camera flyaround to show off your kitty avatar and enter the first person view. The cel-shaded 3D graphics represent an array of common household items awaiting your destruction.Use a keyboard and mouse or a game controller to look, swipe at objects, run and jump around the house. There is also a nifty meow action that can also be used to bite and pick up objects when they are close to your mouth. The tutorial shows the controls onscreen which is handy as you get your bearings. After making your first mess, in true cat fashion, you hop in a box and take a nap. At the end of the quick tutorial, you know all you need to know and are given a summary of items you have successfully toppled as well as a breakdown as to which object you favored and what types of objects you went after most.Aside from the Cat Training tutorial, each level is a procedurally generated house so you never know what you're going to get! On my first level, a timer runs while suggesting a total of objects and a couple specific objects to find and destroy. I found it hard to focus my attack on certain objects because it was just too much fun to knock everything down! While running around a random Event popped up and gave me a Force Field. This was fun because I gave my paw a rest and just ran into objects to send them flying. When an alert showed up for a New Upgrade, I had to hunt through the house to find the right room but was again distracted when I came across a Spinner Cat toy with a ball in it. I was mesmerized as I sat there swatting at the ball than spun around in circles. This is the life! When I got back on track and found my powerup, it was a box that took a couple of smacks then revealed a Jump Increase upgrade. When time was running out, the music increased tempo and the clock started flashing. I was having so much fun I'm not sure what my objectives were. Maybe I should go back to Litterbox Mode. Time to play again!Whether you need to vent your frustrations, assuage your OCD or just change your perspective, take some time out to attend to your cat business and play Catlateral Damage.			"

												Catlateral Damage is the kind of game you dip into and then out of. Start it, play it for a few minutes, quit. That's it.There isn't much to sink your teeth into, but nor is there much to complain about. You play as a cat. As that cat, you smack stuff with your paws and reduce a room to rubble. As said above, that's it. That's all there is.But. If you're the kind of person who takes time off from their cat-related subreddit to post on their cat-related tumblr while pushing their actual cat off their keyboard, you might find this game more enchanting. There are many cats to choose from. You get to do cat-ish things like being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to your owner's possessions. You can sit in a box.Thrilling stuff.To conclude: if you range from contemptuous to ambivalent about cats, you'll find some vague amusement from this game. Buy it when it's cheap. If you've got an unironic cat-themed sweater and a mug that says, ""Cats are purrrfect,"" you're gonna♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself.			"

												Catlateral Damage is in essence about FPS platforming, and then knocking things off shelves, beds, dressers and more, and getting things on the floor (knocking a book from the shelf to a table doesn't count, it must be on the ground). There is an option to pick things up with your mouth (X on the controller), which also doubles as your meow button, you can simply push things with your nose (i.e. walk into them) or bat at them to the side (left and right trigger) or push them forward (LB/RB) with your paws, as well as crouch (B button). Knocking a new object to the ground adds it to your ""collection"". You can also knock cat photos to the ground to collect them as well. Sparkling items (scratching posts, toilet paper rolls, potted plants on the ground, etc) can be batted about a few times in return for upgrades, though the upgrades do not seem permanent for each cat, sadly (future update, maybe?).The two game modes are Objective (knock X amount of points worth of objects to the ground in Y amount of time; bonus if you knock certain objects over) and Litterbox mode (a freestyle, relaxing mode). There are also secret areas to find, such as the Supermarkat (Go ""shopping"" within the time limit) and Meowseum (Break a certain dollar amount of priceless artifacts and displays within a time limit).Certain objectives (knocking over a certain amount of objects in certain modes, knocking over cat pictures, completing an objective with just your nose, playing on a ""Caturday"", etc) unlock new cats to play as.All in all, a fun time, if a bit silly. Since there's no real end-state (no set story or stages) it's more of a fun time-waster, and also where the Katamari comparison breaks down. Also, you don't save progress in your Objective or Litterbox mode (it does remember how many houses you've trashed in Objective mode) so you restart at the beginning houses each time and work your way up to new random ones as you go.Overall, lots of fun, but maybe not worth the 10 bucks it currently is priced at (dependent on your penchant for wanting to be a cat, of course).Final note: my wife calls it ""A-hole Cat Simulator"", if that makes any difference.

												I reviewed this for DieHard GameFAN. Here's the short attention span summary of my review: Catlateral Damage is a game with a simple premise: as a cat, wreck your owner’s house while they aren’t home. It’s fun to run around and knock things off of ledges and shelves and sinks, though only in fairly short bursts. Additionally, until the developer fixes some of the issues within the game, I might recommend getting it on sale, but if you’re a cat fan and love the idea of goofing off, knocking crap off of tables and bookshelves as a cat, this game is probably for you. It’s a gimmick, but it’s pretty fun for what it is. I know I got a kick out of it.			"

												I dig this game. It's not overly complex, it's just what it says on the tin. An arcade-ish destruction simulator. Objective mode isn't terribly hard, but the time crunch does add a gentle challenge.  Litterbox mode is just a nice relaxing 'I'm gonna break stuff' game. No pressure, just smashing crap and blowing off steam.The cartoony look is a good choice; between your slightly odd perspective and quick movement, any complicated textures could induce motion sickness, IMO. I will warn you, though, if you have any epilepsy//seizure issues, this game has a couple of visual modes that will be super rough. Disco+Catnip is particularly brutal. "

												Once you play this game, you will understand why cats are such jerks.It is unbearably fun to run about and wreck up everything those dumb humans have spent all their time organizing.The graphics are simple and effective, with an artistic design similar to the Katamari Damacy series. Controls are fairly intuitive, and really give the feel of being a cat up to no good.Level design can occasionally feel crowded *or* sparse, but being a kitty offers enough mobility to make up for it.Overall a very fun game, and an excellent insight into the world of Cat.

												Catlateral Damage is a disgruntled cat simulator.You are a cat. and things are not on the floor. So of course you have to use your paws to swat them all to the floor!CD is a great stress reliever. You just rush through the levels smashing as much as you can before the (relaxed) time limit passes. Throughout you gather upgrades that can make you faster, jump higher, or swat better -- and you collect photos of cats (and a few evil non-cats).There is not much depth to this, but what is there, is really fun.YOU GET TO DESTROY A T-REX.

												The game that finally fulfills your dream and inner desires of being a curmudgeonly house cat with the need to destroy your human's prized posessions because they moved your litter box and bought you that cheap food instead of the fancy wet food that makes its own gravy. How dare they! I might just leave a hair ball on your pillow while I'm at it!While you're giving a bookshelf one of these and the fresh laundry one of those, take your paws on a exploration of your surroundings to ruin everything. Because you can.Because you're a cat.Use your mouse and keyboard to make a mess. Collect power-ups to stay in the game and rack up points so you can unlock new cats and secret levels. Sounds easy enough in theory. In practice, you're going to be starting over multiple times until you can master the feeling of being a cat in your surroundings. Once you find yourself in a groove and get the general idea of what you're doing, you'll be racking up points (and messes), and enjoying your new life as a new cuddly demonic furball that everyone can't help but love. You know, even if you busted that tablet for some points.Personally, I've been using this game to help with some physical therapy. Remembering to use left or right paw became a little irritating on my behalf because it did matter and sometimes picking the wrong paw to bat and swat with would make my life very difficult. Sometimes, going straight was the best choice. You do have to pay attention (sometimes) rather than make a haphazard mess. Sure it really is fun just to let everything fly, but when you need certain individual items, it actually matters. Mouse and keyboard aren't too exhausting to learn, but if you have any sort of disability or condition that flares up in your hand, reconsider or give yourself frequent breaks.This game also includes a lot of flashing light segments. There is a disco power up as well as a catnip high. This can be disabled via the pause menu if you are sensitive to flashing lights due to epilepsy, seizures, or migraines. Having the option to turn it off is amazing. Sure, I'm a person who does have this health risk so I'm already a fan. However, even a ""normal"" person can have a day where lights are a bit more bothersome and while we can handle a video game, the intense flashing is pushing it. Turning it off until we feel better is that great option to have. For this, I'm not only thankful, but I'm singing my praises about.Catlateral Damage is an incredibly lighthearted game. You don't have to be completely serious to make a game good. Your objective doesn't have to be serious, either. It's a cat making a mess. You really don't have to improve much on that. With the various backdrops you explored, I was starting to wonder if poor kitty was being rehomed to unknowing owners who weren't prepared for the master mess-maker. You can fill in your own storyline this way, but it really doesn't matter. Perhaps it's funny. Maybe it's a little ""trendy"" because the internet was created for two things and one of them was certainly cat pictures. You may leave the second option up to your imagination because I'm certain you're all smart folks.An almost $10 seems a bit steep to just wreck a house, I'll admit, but if it's your type of game, it's very much worth it. You'll get replayability out of it and then some. Great and safe for your junior spawnling gamers, safe (with adjustments) for those of us with some handicaps, and a good way to blow off some steam if your usual games are making you ragequit. This is my current go-to game.			"

												The ultimate first person cat-simulator! You play as a badass cat and in this game you go on a rampage around in different houses/stages. The goal is simple, break objects by knocking them down to the floor a.k.a. trash the place, in two different modes.Has a wide selection of cats and even ""Fart Cat"", which farts instead of meowing.It's a purrrrfect cat game and it's fun, with enjoyable music. If you like cute cats and always wanted to be a cat that's breaking things, then you might like this :3!			"

												Playing this game for the first 30 minutes made me aww in how cute the visual look and feel of the game was, it's simply the cutest game I've ever played, and practically the first time I've ever awwed at a video game in general. This game drives you to be the super hyper 'destroy all belongings' cat, that my cat will never be, as he is a super fat and lazy cat and I nickname him Garfield because of his resembalence to Garfield. But this game as mentioned by plenty others gets repetitive somewhat quickly, so I wouldn't play just to complete the game in one sitting, as the game is  purrfectly  suited to play for short 30 minute-2 hour intervals depending on how long you can handle being a cat without the urge for milk. It's a good relief from other animal type simulators as it's goal isn't to make a buggy game that isn't actually buggy but those events are suppose to happen, but it's a polished game with tons of enjoyment to be had, and I would recommend this game for all lazy cats who wish to be active, or just regular people who just think this game looks like fun.

												Just like the animal it is named after. Catlateral Damage is simple but has its subtle nuances and charm to it. The goal is simple, knock stuff down and make a huge mess. This is something just about anybody with an inner child can relate to. There is something satisfying about swatting a pile of dishes and watching them smash against the floor and giving you an even more satisfying sound effect to go along with it. There is a sense of glee when you end up in a Meowseum and take down a 15 foot T-rex with just one swat of your paw. Is this a deeply complicated game? No. Is it a fun game? Yes. Last I looked that is what gaming is all about. Fun. With procedurally generated levels, the designs, and layouts aren't always the same. With random events and secret levels it adds an even more satisfying reason to play this game over and over again. While the game seems easy enough at first. As you get deeper the timer gets smaller and the challenges become more specific. Hunting down one specific item in large supermarket. These are the things I enjoyed most about the game. Aside from the wanton carnage. Now there is ways to improve this game. Multiplayer would've sent this games appeal through the roof for me. I own 2 cats after all and 2 cats are always better then one. Adding more kinds of random events and even more crazy scenarios to put a cat in. Perhaps a level editor or platforming challenges. These are just some ideas. Nonetheless as a game. Catlateral Damage is fun, family friendly, and full of cats!I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												First of all, I wanted to thank the developers for creating such an amazing game, and now let's get into it!If you REALLY love cats then look no further! Catlateral Damage is the perfect game for you, my dear cat lover friend!The game's been created by Chris Chung in honour of his cat Nippy (1997-2014), and thanks to him we, you can now play as one of those furious cats whose owners made the mistake of leaving them home alone.And as I said, they're no normal cats! They were just waiting for the right moment to go on a rampage and knock everything they can knock onto the floor, that meaning all they can find, leaving nothing but a huge mess behind them... and imagine when the owner comes back home and finds his house completely messed up, everything's on the floor, something's even broken and his cat's quietly spleeping in his box... that would drive each and everyone of us crazy, wouldn't it?And that's exactly what YOU have to do! In this awesome first-person cat simulator you play as a cute kitten whose objective is to knock as much as possible right onto the floor, leaving a mess your owner is then supposed to clean up. Forget you're a human! You're cat now! You'll see the world from the perspective of a cat, you'll walk, jump, crouch, think and act like an annoying (but cute!) little kitten whose weapons are his paws, his little mouth and his furry soft body. Aside the main task you'll have to complete to complete the level, under the quest are shown two objects: the one on the left gives extra points when knocked onto the ground, while the right one will give you a free upgrade when a certain amount of it will be destroyed by your little paws.In the levels there are games you can play with to obtain a perk for one of the three categories, which are jump, speed and swat. There are also events, such as free upgrades, glowing red dots, mice, disco, moon gravity, force shield and power outage. Oh, and don't forget about those 267 (have fun ^.^) photos you can find while running through the levels, remember to knock them off the walls or the shelves in order to unlock them. Those photos portrait cats, dogs, and a few other house pets.There are two game modes you can play: Objective Mode and Litterbox Mode:-In Objective mode you're given an amount of time and a definite number of things (such as 190 objects in 5 minutes) you'll have to knock onto the ground before the time runs out. Every game is composed of five levels during which you'll be given different tasks and optional objectives and.. don't tell anyone, but you can also find a christmas tree that will lead you to a special christmas-themed level, a tyrannosaurus that will lead you to the Mewseum where you'll have to destroy objects worth a certain amount of dollars, a shopping cart that will lead you to the Supermarkat where you'll have to destroy a couple of specific products, some kind of cat boxes that will lead you to the Cardboard Box Paradise and finally an object I haven't manage to unlock yet that will lead you straight to the Furightful Lab.- Litterbox Mode is quite different, you don't have time nor an amount of things to destroy, your box is already open, what you're supposed to do here is to knock onto the floor what you want to and then leave whenever you want. In this mode you can select the level you want to play and there'll be no events (I'm an idiot, there ARE events!), you can take all the time you want, no one's telling you to hurry, just: relax, take it eeeaaasy! (I love Mika ^.^)You may be concerned there aren't a lot of levels and it's true, but! they change every time due to the procedural generation of the levels. You surely will play the same level multiple times but it will always have something different since last time you played it. Anyway what I liked the most about this game is the soundtrack. That has to be said, it's just f*cking awesome! You have to love it! It is at your side for all the time you'll be playing, it never bores you and what about those meows you can hear by pressing F? Ahhh so sweet, as soon as I'm done I'm going to pet my little Kitten. The cartoon-based graphic? Lovely, it really fits the game, you don't need anything too sophisticated to make a wonderful game and Catlateral Damage IS a wonderful game!Ok.. I'm tired.. I've been writing for more than an hour.. you know what? I'm almost done, and I also believe you're tired of me already... ok let's end this.Just buy and enjoy this awesome game.End of the story.

												(2/25/2016) after some thinking...Steam really needs a ~ (mixed) button for these reviews. I like this game, a lot, I really do, but in its current state and at its current price I just can't fully recommend it. I bought it because I saw JoshJepson play it on YouTube, and it looked like fun... and it is! It really is! But it's just not enough fun and it's definitely not with $10! Thankfully I got it on a 50% off sale... but I still even hesitate to say it's worth $5. With the small amount of content and replayability it has now it's maybe worth $3.What would make it better, and push me to fully recommend it, is if it had more levels, with more objects and special elements, and more cats and maybe if the cats had different special abilities. Most of the varying events that happen and achievements things that you can unlock have little effect on the gameplay and are not very rewarding. Also, another big thing it's missing for me is multiplayer. I would love to be able to play in a map with friends playing other cats helping me knock stuff over, or in a race to see who can destroy the most stuff or whatever.So in short -+ fun-sounding music+ fun idea+ fun to be a cat+ fun!- the fun gets old fast- not enough content to be worth the price- different cats have no special abilities- not much variation in gameplay- no multiplayerIf you really want it, get it on a sale. If the developer ever gives it a big update with more stuff, I might update this review.			"

												I think the value proposition for this 'game' is pretty simple... If you like the idea of just teleporting around the room and breaking things with goofy little cat paws, you will probbaly have fun with this.I tried playing it on my own, and was totally bored by it - but when I brought it out at a party, I think eveyrone watching on the TV was enjoying the show more than the person playing it.The whole thing felt awkward to me - constantly getting my head stuck in world geometry, or having trouble getting into the right position. It's not something that I enjoyed at all, but I could see how the novelty would be appealing to some people.			"

												I got this game 50% with a coupon (for VR), so thanks to whomever that was. Bouncey, fluffy soundtrack, and a buoyant time overall. I liked to paws and look at the pictures of cats on the wall before resuming my feline emulation. I would have loved to be able to change those pictures, but you cannot. I was good enough at this game, but I reckon my cat would get a much higher score. Why must you knock over water glasses!? You cannot drink it when it soaks into the rug! Hiss!

												Now I'm not saying this is an awful game, but it sure isn't a good game.  Don't get me wrong, I usually enjoy strange / humorous games like this, but after the short time I have playing this, I was over it.  Not to mention is has a fairly steep $9.99 price tag for what this game offers.From what I understand you can unlock many cats, but the gameplay remains the same.  For me the controls were slippery and the accuracy/hitbox of items was not well done.  The camera angles were bad, and I felt like I was miss timing jumps because of it.  There are a good amount of achievements for those interested in that stuff.Also, before someone thinks I didnt play the game long enough to make a review... I would usually agree with you on most games, but this one truly didnt need anymore play time.*I did not play with VR so I do not know how that works, but for standard PC play I wasn't impressed..I do not recommend this unless you really, really, like cats and frustration.

												Run around as a cat, knocking items off shelves to annoy your owner. Cute premise, but the game is just not much fun. When you jump on a shelf, it's hard to see where you are, so you fall off a LOT, you overshoot jumps frequently, fall under stools or chairs (but you don't know you are under one unless you try to jump) and worst of all, all items must be knocked to the FLOOR to count. So you know them off a high shelf but they fall to a lower shelf, so no score until you knock them down off that lower shelf, plus you should get higher points for knocking around bigger items. Break a monitor or push over an envelope, it still only counts as one item.More of a CATastrophe than being PURRfect, give it a miss (even if you are a cat lover)			"

												In this game you are a cat. You rule over the domestic household but not without resistance. Your human subordinates seek to deny your power and claim the highest parts of your domain with their worthless trinkets. It is your sworn duty to break that which may be broken and topple these symbols of independance!On a more serious note. Precision with the controls can be a little difficult and you aren't likely to play this game for very long per session. That said, the game is good fun and the touchy controls add to the chaos the game promotes. The gameplay and overall feel of the game are very nearly exactly what I expected. It is a game where you are an adorable cat and you break things. For no other reason than that you can. What's not to like?			"

												Absolutly love this game! it's not completly purrfect however, for instance very short amount of times to complete a level with so many objects to topple, another downside is only if objects land on floor do they count as being knocked over, so if you knock stuff off a shelf and it lands on a chair/table or bed it doesn't count.Extreme button basher game it seems lol i have seen negative reviews saying about motion sickness which is strange, i have motion sickness issues however not with this game, also i the music does get annoying so just play your own xD whoever thought a small cheap game would have so much fun and replay value.I could see some more things being fixed and updated, i have seen some of the achievements which seem to be somewhat impossible for instance the complete 50 objective levels i have done 10 in a row but afterwards it instantly puts me back at the main menu without letting me try for it, another achievement being the max all levels to full even in what i call cat heaven mode which has all the boxs, plants and scratchng posts etc i cant seem to get the levels more than half full and of course everytime you start litterbox mode or campaigne mode your levels are reset to 0I know i do sound like i have said alot of negative however i'm still rating the game positive as i'm having fun even if there is some stress with trying to get everything on the floor in the time frame!

												While this game seems interesting, and as a cat lover and owner I was absolutely thrilled and excited when I purchased it, I don't think I will ever play it again. I am aware that the game has an epilepsy warning (I'm not epileptic, nor have I ever had a seizure), but upon playing the game for a mere thirty minutes, I became incredibly nauseous to the point of vomiting. The premise is cute, and I'm sure the game is lovely, but it made me unbearably sick.			"

Based on a true story, take on the role of a average house cat trying to save their owners from becoming hoarders the only way they can.  Knocking stuff onto the floor.While smartly avoiding the worn out 'Simulator' name, this game is basically the comical version of 'Cat Simulator' that focuses on the 4 hours a day cats aren't asleep.  The gameplay is simple and the physics objects don't always react as expected but the theme and style carries the game very well.			"

												Published by: Chris ChungDeveloped by: Chris Chung, Fire Hose Games Genre: Simulator, Indie, CasualRelease Date: 27 May, 2015Time to complete: 10+ hoursIntroductionSwipe and push all your human’s belongings to the floor in this first-person cat destruction simulator.GameplayHave you ever aspired to be a troublemaking cat? Well now you can fulfil your desires! Catlateral Damage is a casual first-person cat simulator in which your sole purpose is to cause mass destruction to your owner’s home. Swipe books off shelves, plates out of cupboards and saucepans off stove tops! You are also able to swipe at portraits which, when knocked down, unlocks the image to view in the collections folder in the menu. You’re able to unlock over 230 strange and wonderful varieties of animal photos, including (and my personal favourite thus far) a very solemn looking black dog wearing a cat birthday hat (what more could you want, right?)!There are two game modes; Objective and Litterbox. In Objective mode, you have to knock down a certain number of objects within a time limit in a procedurally-generated house. Litterbox mode is slightly more relaxed; You have to knock down every object in the map that you get to choose (you can unlock more as you go along), but there is no time limit. My personal favourite is what I like to call ‘Bah Humbug mode’, where you get to rip open and destroy presents, knock over festive decorations and swipe all the ornaments off the Christmas tree! Wooh!The game has unlockables, events and power-ups, including increased swipe, increased jump and increased speed. There is also a catnip unlockable which slightly distorts your vision and effortlessly enables you to swipe entire plates off a shelf with one brisk movement!Some of the events include moon gravity (did someone say floating cat?!) and disco, which turns the house into the ultimate par-tay destination!You are also able to chase mice and lasers, which is oddly satisfying!Replay ValueThere are many different levels to play in Litterbox mode, providing hours of fun and destruction! Even after you’ve completed them all, it’s still a game I think you would easily open up again once in a while, as it really does provide plenty of amusement and entertainment.SoundtrackThe music throughout the game is very upbeat, but is very repetitive and can get pretty annoying after a while. Audio controls are your friend.Overall VerdictCatlateral Damage is a very amusing game, and I can’t help but get the urge to play it every now and again. It’s also very decently priced considering the amount of gameplay available.Seriously, you don’t know how much fun breaking things can be until you’ve played this game. I now finally understand my cats.Overall Score: 7/10 "

												Do you find yourself wishing you could knock everything you see onto the ground but don't because social norms require you to act like a person that does NOT knock everything they see onto the ground?Fret no longer. Catlateral Damage not only lets you throw worldy possessions hurtling to their demise at the hands of hardwood, but you get to be a cat. It's the best of both of your wet dreams.			"

												I have found this game to be simple, but very addicting. You cause destruction as one of several different cats, most of which you have to unlock through gameplay. You can play in two modes, objective mode and ""litterbox"" mode. Objective mode is where you are given a set of objectives to complete. You do this by knocking down or destroying the indicated items. You have a time limit in which to complete the objectives. You get bonuses for certain items, as indicated in your objectives.  If you complete your objectives, you get to move on to another level, up to four levels. There are special items you can knock down to unlock bonus levels which are added in to your four basic levels. ""Litterbox"" mode is an untimed mode with no objectives. You get to take your time and explore. You get one point per item destroyed or knocked to the floor. You can level up your cat's abilities (Speed, Jump, Swipe) by finding upgrades. These consist of sparkling items that cats use or play with and by pawing at them, you can trigger an upgrade drop.  In objective mode, you have to decide whether or not you want to use your precious time to gather more upgrades while the clock is ticking. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it isn't, and you'll eventually start to figure that out.There are collectibles and achievements, including secret achievements. I've played for over 17 hours and I still don't have everything.It is reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. You are rushing around, causing chaos, knocking things down, and you have to get a certain number of items. It doesn't match up to Katamari in sheer variety of items and locales, or with an amazing soundtrack, but this is a much smaller scale game. It's still quite fun.I haven't had much issue with the camera angle, and I'm pretty picky with that sort of thing. I've seen a few minor graphics glitches, but that's it. It feels fairly well polished.I wish there was more variety in the soundtrack, but I can always turn down the music in the options and put on my own if I get tired of it.I hope the developer releases more content for this game down the line. I'd be interested in it.			"

												TLDR: Cat-Amari Damage-y.I backed this game on Kickstarter and a couple of my cats are in it, so I'm biased.But I loved the game when it was just a web demo of one room.  I spent a couple hours playing it last night and really like the improvements.  More cats, more levels (proceed or randomized?), lots of items, and better controls.  Left and right swipe and pokes AND can pick things up with your mouth.  Plus a meow (sometimes fart) button!The music is jaunty and uplifting.  It was pleasant but after a couple hours I did throw on my own music instead. "

												Catlateral Damage is a first person cat simulator. (Cat's are fur people). I first got wind of this game before last year's Boston Festival of Indie Games and tried the Beta (alpha?) and thought it had a lot of potential. It turned out to be a solid game well worth the $9.99 price tag. I love the cell shaded graphics and solid controls as well as knocking crap off of every surface you can think of.Video review below.

												IF YOU ARE PRONE TO MOTION SICKNESS BEWARE. I'm not one to get sick from games, but this actually made me become really sick to my stomach after 30 minutes of play, even after fussing with the control settings. Jumping and controls are a bit buggy and not what would be expected from a game like this. Jumping into cabnets and shelves are rather hard to accomplish with the current physics engine. Which is really sad cause the game seemed promising. It's fun, but not for the current pricetag, maybe if something to lighten the camera jarring effect and add some additional gameplay features, then I might change my review later down the line.			"

												10/10 would unroll toilet paper again.In all seriousness, this game was just one big bundle of joy. It really improved upon the alpha and I didn't see anything added that was bad. The only problem is, I wish there was stuff that WAS added. One of these things is workshop. You could make levels, cats, or other things (don't know. It's up to you, creator). Another thing is scratching curtains and peeing. I was really disappointed that I couldn't pee on anything or scratch any curtains. I also wish you could bite things like the flip flops. I also wish the tutorial would've mentioned how to pick items up (F while looking at it) because I got really confused on the level with all the boxes and the shop level.One final thing I wish was available was to save progress on litterbox levels. I left my computer on over night so that I wouldn't have to start the shopping level all over again. All in all, this game was a very fun game, and I would highly recommend buying it full price to further support the devs.			"

												Catlateral damage is a short, sweet, and to-the-point game - you're a cat with two paws and a mouth with which to wreak havoc around your absentee owner's dwelling. Your motives for doing this are announced in the beginning of each level, and are appropriately catty, including such gems as ""My wet food tastes terrible! Those humans will pay!""You're offered two modes of play - Objective and Litterbox. Objective Mode throws you a timer and a certain amount of objects to topple; a single campaign requiring a player to complete 5 objectives - or 5 houses - successfully before the time runs out. You can additionally play with ""cat toys"" (put in quotes because some of these include scratching posts and litterboxes; others are houseplants and toilet paper, which many people do not consider conventional toys for their feline) to earn power-ups that can make you jump higher, move faster, and swipe at objects harder. You're also encouraged to collect cat photos, as doing so unlocks new cats to play as and two achievements! Litterbox Mode, meanwhile, sets you loose in any house you desire to destroy stuff at your leisure. Both modes are subject to randomized ""events"" that occur; these vary vastly, from ""Moon Gravity"" and ""Disco"" to ""Kill the red dots"" and ""Catch the mouse"". Every house is also proceedurally-generated, so there are different objects to wreck every time you play, although the layout of the furniture, as far as I can tell, stays the same. My only beef with the game is that there isn't more of it; there're only a handful of houses to run amok in currently, with four or so interesting add-ons, like the Mewseum and Supermarcat. The game is fun, but since it's so small, that can only go so far; if you're not very bored and very into cats and/or pure destruction, this probably isn't the game for you. TL;DR: This game is so good; the purest cat game you will ever get your hands on. Would probably wait for it to go on sale, though. 9/10			"

It was within that 40 minutes that I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore.  I need help.Edit:  I didn't know it was meant for VR until after I played.

It's been lovely to watch this grow since it's early days; the game has just been getting better and better with each update. Don't let its basicness be offputting. Soon your mind will assimilate with one of a cat and you too will realise this game is what you needed to fill a hole in your soul.Nyan.P.S (Update): The game really starts to chug when you get to the supermarket and knock half the store down. Not a huge issue, but still annoying. I can't really fault anything else.			"

												A quirky little game that has you playing as a destructive cat trying to knock as many things on to the ground as possible. Where are the humans? No idea. The gameplay is simple but for some reason, very satisfying and Therapudic. It has VR support that I unfortunatly didn't get to try cause Im canadian and VR headset prices are riduclous here, however from what I've heard from others is that it is still fun and satisfying. Many different cats to play as and different settings to destroy from a regular old house to a Dinosaur museum and even a mad science lab. Price seems reasonable for what you get.Game Showcase-

												First off, I like Goat Simulator, but that being said: this isn't Goat Simulator. Simple graphics and slightly idiosyncratic physics (crouch+jump doesn't work as well as look up+jump), but the gameplay is well-balanced and addictive.  Catlateral Damage has a cartoony art style but it's not a gimmick--it's clearly crafted with care and attention to feedback.  This is a game that has a Disco Mode... and also has an option on the menu to entirely disable Disco mode forever.The main, timed game is cleverly self-limiting--four timed trials with potential unlock of a special level--so you have a good stopping point and might not end up swatting things off shelves all day.As an extremely casual gamer, one of my criteria is whether a game lets you unlock photos of the devs' kitties. This one does, as well as real cat-based alternate skins.  Sadly, there is no 3rd person view at this time, but otherwise there is excellent cat content throughout.			"

												As gamers we tend to gravitate towards games that engage and entertain but every so often we stumble across one that we can connect with on an emotional level. Chris Chung and Fire Hose Games have done all three of these things in the magnum opus that is Catlateral Damage. For centuries scholars have pondered over our feline friends ""What do they think about while we are away"" ""How do they keep themselves entertained"" and ""Why do they hate me"". Mr Chung has dug deep into the mind of the Felis Catus in search of such answers and revealed them to us throughout each unique handcrafted level ""because they hate us"". Perhaps it was stale water or tasteless food or maybe it was our poor choice in household furnishings, all questions become clear as you play as a simple household feline overcoming overwhelming odds... by wrecking everything in the house With tight controls and an amazing soundtrack the immersion is so ""life like"" you yourself will put off by stale water or a sudden change of diet. In the end you will find that these fuzzy jerks are justified when it comes to venting their rage and in many ways Catlateral Damage is more akin to ""Hatred"" than say Katamari Damacy. In the end what an incredible gift we have been given, the simple but complex life of a cat. 10/10 Would Cat Again.			"

												I just want to say, this game is pawsome! I was waiting for a game to come out that I could finally sink my teeth into. And even though I've only scratched the surface, I have to say this game is the cats pajamas. I may even have to throw out all of my old games, but I really hate to litter. This will make the purrfect addition to anyone's gaming library, And trust me, I'm not one to tell tall tails. The action is very fast and furrious, with challenges that are sure to make you twist your whiskers. Now if you don't mind I will have to get back to playing this right meow. "

												(VR review) This game is basically a VR training simulator that teaches you how to be a total jerk just like a cat! Took me a few minutes to figure out the Vive motion controls. It's more a case of you just slowly push things around off shelves, and swatting does absolutely nothing. My floor was assaulted numerous times while learning this process. I do have a 5ft x 6.5ft play space, but it doesn't feel like enough. I only played in litterbox (sandbox) mode for about 20 minutes as is writing this. That being said, I think it's worth the sale price of $5 that I paid, Though I think I had a bit more fun being a total jerk in Job Simulator.			"

												This game lets me live out my dreams of both being a cat and knocking♥♥♥♥♥♥over with no repercussions whatsoever. It's perfect.Catlateral Damage is kind of reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. Like rolling a katamari, the gameplay is simple but fun- it's oddly satisfying to swat things with your paw and watch them fall to the ground. There's a lot of different environments to play in, and the layouts never seem to be the same twice, though a lot of the same items are used. You can also play as one of about 20 different cats. I don't think your choice of cat affects your playing experience, but it's a nice choice.You can collect power-ups to increase your speed, jump and swat power, participate in special events in the game's world for powerups or points, and collect special items to teleport you to event levels where the gameplay ranges from collecting items in a supermarket to destroying things in a museum. The low-poly aesthetic and chill soundtrack help make the game a relaxing experience.Also, one of the collectibles is just pictures of people's cats. Which you collect by knocking over.Best $9 I've ever spent.			"

I tested this game out and it was wonderful or should I say punderful because of all the puns that they make in this game. I recommend to anyone from ages 1-100 to play this game because anyone any age can get an enjoyment from this game!! I defenitly rate this 9.5/10			"

												A fun little game where you get to be a cat and run around a house and knock things over. That's pretty much the whole game. You can also unlock pictures of cats and more cats to play as, although they don't make much of a difference to jumping or swatting or bashing things off shelves. It can be difficult to smash enough things to be able to move on to the next level, especially with the time limit, and if you knock a stack of objects over, like plates or towels, if they're still in a stack and only one touches the floor it counts as one item, you have to make the rest of the objects touch the floor too. Although a little annoying being close but not being able to move on, it's still fun. One thing about this game is that I find the graphics make me feel a bit sick (maybe motion sick), especially as you have to spin around a lot to be able to knock everything over and rush around to do it all in the time limit. If it wasn't for that I would probably be playing this game more, but for now, I can only seem to handle one level worth of time without feeling too unwell. I do however like the fact the insides of the levels, although have the same general layout, have randomised items in them, and some things are in different locations, so you're not playing the exact same thing over and over, I found more rooms on one play through and in others there were less things to smash. I can remember areas and maps quite well and can get bored if games have the same paths and places to go if they're not big games, and although there's the same basic layout of the building every time, having different objects to knock over and a different colour pallet each time helps give it a little more variety.It's probably a good thing each level is only a few minutes, I admit if a level was longer I could see the music start to get annoying, but in short doses it's fun and catchy and adds a playful mood to the game which goes nicely with its style and colours.Would I recommend this game? I kinda wish there was a more neutral option sometimes, I'd want to say yes and no. If you've ever wanted to knock tons of things over, look at cat pictures and be a little fluffball of  destruction  fun, I'd say play the game. However, if you have problems processing things visually, can get motion sick or get dizzy easily, and want to try the game, I'd say wait for a sale first, just in case.			"

												It's very difficult to find simple, quick loading, relaxing, yet stimulating immersive games on the market.  This one here reminds me of how fun it must be to be a cat.  Even after completing objectives, I find myself just wanting to knock stuff over or mess with how the physics of items would be.  It's odd.  This game has this silly Japanese style gaming from Dreamcast or PS1 era.  A game I can compare this to is Katamari Damacy.  I really want more support/DLC/updates from the devs.  Without any additional content, this game is solid and entertaining.  You get right into the action and there's no real consequence for anything really.  It's fun down to the letter.  Purchase this!  They even have sweet easter eggs for anyone into indie games :>			"

That is the question.""- Your cat moves about by following the mouse's movements. Think about it.- *insert another cat pun here*It's just purr-fect for all you cat-loving gamers/fans of terrible jokes. 10/10 would cat again and again and again.			"

												Run around as a cat, knocking items off shelves to annoy your owner. Cute premise, but the game is just not much fun. When you jump on a shelf, it's hard to see where you are, so you fall off a LOT, you overshoot jumps frequently, fall under stools or chairs (but you don't know you are under one unless you try to jump) and worst of all, all items must be knocked to the FLOOR to count. So you know them off a high shelf but they fall to a lower shelf, so no score until you knock them down off that lower shelf, plus you should get higher points for knocking around bigger items. Break a monitor or push over an envelope, it still only counts as one item.More of a CATastrophe than being PURRfect, give it a miss (even if you are a cat lover)			"

												This is honestly one of my favorite games to come out in 2015. It's simple, it's fun, it's replayable, and best of all? It just feels good. Even if I've got a dozen other games to play where I'm shooting/stabbing/exploding enemies and watching all this bombastic action, sometimes I come home after a long day and think...""Nuts to it, I'm gonna play a cat and make a mess.""There's just something so satisfying about it. Especially when you've fully upgraded your cat to maximum destruction levels. It's a cute and harmless little game about playing a disgruntled cat. I really look forward to seeing if they make a few new special levels and events for the game. The bonus stages are really amusing and some of the random events just make me smile. (""kill the red dots!"" for example.)I say it's worth the price, certainly worth it on sale.			"

												I absolutely love the idea behind this game! Unfortunately, I can't recommend it. I play a lot of video games and I can't think of another game that has given me motion sickness, but Catlateral Damage makes me nauseous. I tried adjusting the video settings, but it didn't help. Also, the giant-headed cat models in this game are ugly. How hard is it to make a cute cat? Great concept, poor execution.			"

												Ironic physics simulation and rogue-likes -- a dime a dozen, rarely made with any real love or polish; to combine the two would be a disaster in the making at best.Exceptions, however, do exist.In truth, I expected very little from Catlateral Damage, sold almost entirely on the concept and cute factor alone; that it somehow manages to successfully blend two tired genres into one saccharinely sweet, odds-defying blend intrigues me as much as it baffles.This may very well be the most pleasant, short-burst time waster I've played in a very, very long time.

												I like to play this game when I listen to podcasts or audiobooks. It's just mindless enough that I don't get distracted from whatever it is I'm listening to, and just engaging enough to keep my mind from wandering back to real life. It's just something to play and unwind while I'm listening to something.			"

												Heyyo, lol you go around trying to break as much as you can in a given time limit... for a time killer? It's pretty darn good like that. It's nothing more than that though... there's definitely no storyline each session only lasts a handful of minutes if that...There is some decent maps and randomly generated ones too so there's some replayability I guess but you're just doing the same breaking stuff thing... so... yeah... not really much to say about that I guess lol.The cartoonish art is nicely executed though and the game runs smooth so there's no worries about performance issues... just smack all that stuff that humans love to collect and then move on to a more fullfilling game later until you get that random urge to break things again and come back to Catlateral Damage.

The motion sickness is the only bad thing about it though, and very few games give me nausea like that. I'd give it a 4/5.tl;dr: Great game, just don't play it after eating or you'll get nauseous.

												(This game was a Christmas Gift from Ashen Foxxe.  Thanks, Ashen.)If you ever wondered what it was like to be a cat or why cats made messes, this game is for you.  Play as a cat who has some random excuses to make a mess (every time you start an adventure campaign)...only thing it doesn't mention as an excuse is being spayed or neutered. (""Where are my balls?  Those humans will pay.""  ""My balls are gone.  Time to make a mess."")The moment I booted this game I fell in love with making a mess.  A simple game with a simple objective, you get points for knocking stuff onto the floor.  Starting out, it was difficult to find a way to get all the items on the floor in time.  The secret, though, is to know what the high-items are and where they're normally located.  If all else fails, just make a big mess.  That works too.PROS:Be a catMake a messCameo referencesMeowLevels randomly generate objects for you to make a mess withCONS:Can get old (You'll find yourself busy for 15-20 minutes)Not much variety in terms of levels (last I recall there were a total of 8-9 maps)It's great to see that maps aren't COMPLETELY identical as the layout can change upon each boot (along with certain spawned items).  The game is currently priced at $10, which it does not feel like it's worth.  Wait for a sale before getting this one if you want your money to feel well-spent.  After a while, it will feel old.  I feel like it's run it's course at 18 hours.

												What a pawesome game! While it's not a purrfect game, (resolution was terrible when the game first booted and remained so until I fixed it, and items would fall on top of me, making me feel clawstrophobic and unable to move.) it's still enjoyable and even addicting. It felt great knocking things all over the place. In the end, this game is totally the cat's meow. 10/10			"

												Way more fun (and cheaper) than therapy and/or antidepressants. While I assume this game was designed for people with a very specific fetish, it's great fun for anyone with a normal sexual appetite or other perversions.Don't expect the smoothest gameplay or any sort of story but what other game will allow you to be a housecat on the rampage. The joy you get from knocking things of shelves will help you forget how complicated modern life is and will inspire you to go daydream while laying in the path of a sunbeam, something you should probably be doing more of anyway.

												I love living life as a cat. See a shelf full of books? Knock 'em all on the floor. Big, expensive TV perched precariously on the edge of a table? Floor. A bunch of supermarket aisles filled with hundreds and hundreds of premium buyables? Yep, eeeeevery one of them, right on the floor. It's like I'm playing as Michael Douglas in Falling Down if he was a cat and the movie ended with him falling asleep in a cardboard box. I'm just really disappointed there were no toddlers perched up on highchairs in the game. Oh well.In Catlateral Damage you'll play as a cat with the sole aim of knocking down a target number of items in a small handful of rooms within a certain amount of time. To begin with, your feeble, fuzzy paws will only be able to bat items ever so slightly (left or right click will do a left or right swipe while Q, E or middle mouse will jab), and you'll move kinda slowly and won't be able to jump very high, but playing with cat toys will reward you with an upgrade for one of those three attributes. And if you're particularly lucky, a random event such as catching a mouse, swatting a glowing red dot, or ""moon gravity"" will grant you a limited increase in abilities. By the end you'll be running at lightning speed, jumping almost the full height of a room and swatting away big, heavy objects with ease. That end actually comes pretty quickly, though, given the structure of the game.By default there's only four stages to play through; what looks like a standard apartment, a log cabin (or possibly a summer camp?), umm, a slightly different apartment, and, uh... a really fancy apartment. There isn't really a massive amount of variety in the settings, I guess, and no additional floors to move up and down through, just a small handful of rooms where the collection of items you'll be knocking over are largely the same. But at least the actual layout of the rooms are procedurally generated so you'll never have exactly the same setup of rooms twice, for what that's worth. There's a chance that each stage may hide a collectible which will unlock an additional bonus stage (a museum, a box fort, a spooky lab or a single room decorated for Christmas) making for up to eight stages you could potentially play through in a single run. Failing to hit the target within the time limit on the default stages will end your run, while succeeding will allow you to continue to the next stage, with the overall goal being to score as many points as you can during a run. There isn't really a huge amount to it, and if I'm being honest the whole thing is pretty quick and shallow, but, damn, if I didn't have a whole lotta fun playing it.I enjoyed the simplicity of it, and there's something incredibly cathartic (no pun intended!) about leaping around and thrashing the sh*t out of a place and not having to care about it or feel the least bit guilty. It's a sense of contented joy that comes second only to exposing yourself to random joggers in the park. But just as with waiting in the bushes for the right moment, leaping out, helicoptering a bit, then running away and finishing yourself off, by the end, I still wanted more. I'd love to see a greater sense of meaningful, permanent progression. Like... for some reason I keep thinking of Crackdown as I play this - that itch you constantly have to scratch of seeing an orb, trying to get it, not being able to jump or climb high enough, then coming back later to get it when you've become more powerful. I'd really loved to have played something like that here... but with cats.I can imagine having an entire mansion to play with, where you start off only being able to jump small distances or knock over light objects, but as you gain more XP you grow stronger and gain new abilities. Maybe you can eventually see in the dark to explore the basement (and attic, once you can jump high enough to get in), or longer claws to scratch and damage items that were previously untouchable, as well as being able to climb special surfaces with them. Gain enough speed to eventually outrun the chain chomp-like dog guarding the tool shed, or enough height to jump up to the vents to reach other locked rooms... and so on. I know it's the easiest thing in the world to play backseat developer and say how great something would be, but that the reality is it's incredibly difficult to actually make an even remotely competent game, which is especially true if it's only a small team working with modest resources and budget. But, y'know... a guy can dream. To quote the girl in the trailer, I just want to cat, dammit![Steam is being weird again and won't let me post the review properly.

												When I backed this game on Kickstarter, I did it because I, too, have wanted to experience the pure joy of a cat knocking things down with no repercussions. To feel the pleasure of being a living force of entropy, existing only to destroy (and occasionally emit a meow). To see the primal majesty of a book ejected from a high shelf by the stern swat of a paw, arcing gently through the air to crash to the ground far below.This game has made that dream a reality.			"

												It's a fodder game for let's players, but its easily also one of the best. It's also pretty easy, which is a bonus. Would recommend absolutely if you have VR, but even without it's a good game.			"

												I remember this game awile ago when it was just a first person cat game and I bet I saw it on gamejolt but I forgot, I didn't bother with it, but now I see it doing so well and its so fun to play. Get this game if you can, its really good, especially if you like cats. They did a good job! Its so strange how the graphics work so well on low GPU like mine, I really like how the graphics are not competing with my FPS.My rating: 10/10			"

												Better story than Undertale and The Witcher 3 Combined.  11 Cat puns out of 10.- SERIOUS REVIEW-This was the first product I had ever supported on Kickstarter, and I was delivered exactly what was promised. Cats and smacking stuff. Despite the trailer seeming to be childlike and silly, the game is largely expansive and has many collectibles. The soundtrack is extremely joyful and exciting, as well. There are many nods to other indie games, such as Guacamelee, The Binding of Issac, and Goat Simulator. If 10 dollars is too expensive for virtual reality kittens, you might need to check your financial status.			"

Posted: August 10, 2016
												I've got to be honest, this game can be fun. The concept is fairly well done and the game has a nice simplistic style to it, although this game is far from perfect and has so much missing potential.For example: enemies, yes this game has no enemies. the lack of threat really gives you no danger, rush or challenge, while the ""time trials"" are giving a real challenge, it's not really fun and doesn't give off a true challenge. Please, devolopers, if you're reading this PLEASE add enemies or at least npcs, this game is in such dire need of them.Another thing this game lacks is multiplayer, which really sucks, while multiplayer may seem like it adds to the game a lot, it doesn't need it too much. Those two flaws makes it -after a while of playing- a truely loney game, i get having no humans because, well, theres no humans because you have to mess up the house when your owners gone. But theres not even dogs/other pets. (I just remembered now that theres a mouse in the game in an event to get extra points, but to be honest I don't really think it counts)But I've been saying the games main flaws, it is a good review after all, I'm gonna have to bring up positives:First of all: the litterbox mode, the litterbox mode is a randomly generated house for you to ruin, you type in the text to randomly generate it or it just randomly does one. This is the games best part, it prevents the game from getting stale and it rarely ever gets old. Theres also different unlockables that make it also less repetitive, but the unlockable items (based on what you knock down) (I think they're unlocks :\ ) don't give you any real perks, kitten unlocks just look nice.Also the game has VR mode, I'm a bit tempted to get a VR just to play it in VR mode, but I think I'd vomit like hell from VR mode alone. Seriously, while this isn't the games fault, it's nausating as hell, seriously if you have motion sickness or something, play it like an hour a day, I've played more sickening games (in the litteral sense) but this is still kind of nausating.I'd give it around a 7.5/10 I'd give it way higher if the devs updated it to include multiplayer and npcs/enemies.Although it really is worth it to buy it, I think the game is worth the money.

It is not a game with a massive plot or anything but it is a fun game to mess around in & make a mess of things in multiple locations.

												Motion-sickness motion-sickness motion-sickness oh my god the motion-sickness is unbearable in this game. I have NEVER experienced motion-sickness in a game before, but this game really did it for me. It's fine to play for 5-10 minutes at a time, but if I play any longer than that I feel extremely nauseous to the point to where I feel like vomiting, and that feeling would stick with me for a good half an hour. Now, since I've never experienced motion-sickness before playing this game I would've let it slide if the devs would've at least MENTIONED the possibility of motion-sickness, but it seems like they haven't done so. Apparently many people experienced this problem, but the devs never acknowledged this issue and it's not likely they ever will..It's such a shame too because this game is cute and a great time-killer, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to play for more than 10 minutes at a time, and the achievements are relatively easy to get so I've been willing to do just that, but it is extremely annoying. PLEASE fix this if this is an issue that can be fixed or at least mention it somewhere before purchasing so that those who are prone to motion-sickness, or those who don't know yet, at least acknowledge what they're getting themselves into.Again, it is an okay game, but a nice warning before purchasing the game would've been nice. :/			"

			Today we become one with our inner feline in Catlateral Damage. We run around and destroy literally everything that isn't nailed down. This just goes to show you, you should nail everything down.		

What do I have to say about Catlateral Damage? It's an amazing time wasting game. You have twenty minutes that you don't know what to do with? Knock some stuff on the floor!But seriously, Catlateral Damage is a lot of fun. It's suprisingly (and a bit disturbingly) cathartic to to run around and throw stuff on the ground. The art is simplistic and pleasing to the eye. There are random events to make your levels a bit mroe interesting as well.If you want an enjoyable game that won't be too taxing to play, check out this game.			"

												My expectations going into this game were low. Still did not meet my expectations. Graphics are awful; the cats look kind of mutant, fortunately, being first person, you only look at them in the select screen. Controls seem kind of clunky. Gameplay is repetitive. I got a kick out of it for about 5 minutes. Semi enjoyed it for what it's worth for about 15 minutes. Tried to persevere, could not handle more than an hour of gameplay.+ I oddly enjoyed playing with the ball in the track toy.I would recommend Goat Simulator over this in a heart beat if you're just looking to cause some destruction and kill some time.

												(Review of the VR Version) On paper it sounded hillarious, but after 10 minutes it just left me wondering what I was doing with my life and I requested a refund.Among other things, the scale just doesn't work in VR - your cat paws are massive, but in a 2.5 x 2 meter real world room you will teleport next to an object you want to hit and STILL run out of room to hit it - at one point I whacked my desk in the real world because of how far I had to move to hit anything.

												It's a cute idea but unfortunately it's a little too sandbox to work.  Also the physics and jumping are pretty bad for a game that's entirely about jumping around.  It'd be great if the levels were designed to be more of a puzzle but instead they're bland and obvious, and the jumping takes no skill (except when the jump key does nothing and you have to try again.)  All in all it might be worth it for say.. 50% off?  Definitely not worth full price, and after only 20 minutes I'll definitely be seeking a refund if possible.  I just wish it had been made in unreal or something with better jumping.  A cute idea isn't enough to carry a game for more than a few minutes.  The gimmick wore off after the tutorial.			"

												Have you or a loved one ever wanted to be cat? Do you want to make a mess without a care in the purrr-orld? If you answered yes, no or maybe to those questions then this is the game for you. There is not a thrill in the world greater than knocking over that flat screen TV.

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comCatlateral Damage is not what I was expecting when I booted it up. In all honesty, I wasn’t sure what I was expecting. Their video was pretty funny and definitely grabbed my attention. Ever wanted to be a cat and knock junk off of… well everywhere before your humans get home? Well, now there’s a simulator for that! It’s not a plain cat simulator, but it’s a cat carnage simulator for sure.There is not much to Catlateral Damage. It’s simple premise of being a cat and knocking things off shelves pretty much describes the entirety of the game. There is an easy enough time-limit which does get a little hairy in the Museum (or Mewseum), but all things in time eh? That’s Objective Mode in a nutshell where as Litterbox Mode removes the time-limit on your destruction and lets you run rampant throughout the rooms knocking things over at your leisure. Remember to pick up the power-ups to help you knock things over with more ease!There are also a lot of unlocks to … unlock (for lack of a better word there) if that’s your thing. You can get more cats to play as which basically gives you a different color paw to swat things with. There didn’t seem to be a stat difference so I guess it’s all up to color preference (I prefered Kratos I believe). Also, the pictures hanging off the walls are there for you to knock off and collect to keep in the out-of-game collection of funny cat pictures. It’s nice to be able to go back to and giggle at them.Score: Meh...Did you want a cat simulator in which you knock things off the shelves? This game will deliver. It’s a solid carnage simulator and seems to be created to just let the player have fun as a cat without breaking items in his/her own house. It’s not overly challenging and has smooth controls so it could be pretty good for kids to better their hand/eye coordination. There’s a lot of stuff to collect so if you’re a fan of collect-a-thons, you may also find a home here. Maybe it’s that it’s too simple or that I just don’t get it in its totality. Maybe I’m just looking too deep for something that the game wasn’t intended for, but I wasn’t 100% sold on this.  Catlateral Damage is well made, but I didn’t have that much fun playing it. In the end, I would say this is more niche that I would have thought and I don’t think I fit into this particular niche.			"

												Knock pastel, untextured polygons onto the ground! Knock stuff onto non-ground environments and don't get points! Press Q or E to stick your paws out to no effect! Knock open ovens and washing machines, only to find nothing inside! Climb in and pretend to die in a tragic accident when the timer runs out! Experience the horror of total indifference when you get a ~wacky random disco event~ that does not change the music or make your character dance or anything! Knock pictures of cats off the walls and shelves and laugh at the awful names that Kickstarter nerds give their cats! Seriously one of them is named XOR, like the binary operation! Jesus christ!Boring as hell. Pick up for >$5 if you really want to. Just buy a Katamari game if you want to futz around with random objects.			"

												Have you ever dreamed about being a cat? Pushing things off shelves, tables and other places? Jumping into tall things to feel superior and mighty? Following red dots and chasing mice around the house?Then why aren't you playing this game?!Catlateral damage is not only a tasteful pun, it's an awesome game! Delightfully simple and easy to get a hang on, yet challenging and addictive! The score goal levels or the time trials will get you jumping and swatting at things non stop to make combos and finding the best routes to get the most points in the fewest seconds, or you can relax (like a cat should!) in the sandbox mode and just explore and bop things off for the heck of it.Recommended for cat lovers and casual gamers, you won't regret it!

												Cats. An acquired taste, to be sure, but for those of us who have owned cats before, we understand there is a underlying naturalistic beauty in an animal so seemingly driven by carnal spite. Right? Lol no. Just... no. Cats are generally the worst, and if you like them, you're dead on the inside. Thankfully, that's not true if you like Catlateral Damage: that target of admiration, I could understand.Catlateral Damage hones in on the spiteful behaviour of felines and celebrates it by creating a fun little sandbox that harkens back to the likes of Katamari Damacy. The game takes a simple idea of knocking stuff over as a cat for points and executes it well. I found it to be a surprisingly fun distraction. This is the perfect game for when you've had a hard day at work, and you just want to get the rage out of your system by funking up your owners' house for no good reason.It's not super deep, and it's likely not one of longevity, but the game is fun while it lasts. Highly recommended if you see it on sale.			"

I don't know what it is but I hate jumping.... which is a big deal. You're a cat, so you're gonna do lots of jumping.-The cats could be way cuter.Bad:-Might make you motion sick.-Kinda reptative if you're not into this sort of thing.-Were you expecting an actual story from this?

												If you like cats, like to wreck things, like Katamari Damacy, or enjoy silly games, this really is the game for you. I backed the game on Kickstarter (unfortunately not high enough to get my own cats put in the game), but this has been one of the best games I've ever backed. There are two main modes of play: objective (knock over a certain number of items within a timeframe) or litterbox (take as much time as you want to knock over every item in the zone). The controls are pretty easy (I recommend using a mouse vs a computer touchpad) and it's fun to unlock new cats, new zones, & collect cat pictures.			"

												This game is plain and simply awesome. I cannot think of a better way to spend my money, especially since I bought it on release day and the relaxing nature of the game helped me through finals week during the 2nd semester of my Junior year. All of those people who say it is not worth the money obviously don't fit into the right genre or mindset for this game... Check out my review on YouTube for more!

												I'm a man who enjoys cats and cat-related things (to the annoyance of my wife who prefers dogs and dog-related things), so when I caught wind of this game, I couldn't wait until the day and time the ""Add to Cart"" button became available.At it's core, it's a silly game with a silly premise, but it works. You're essentially a jerk cat out to destroy everything you come across. It's like a funny cat video that metamorphosized into a (worth every penny) $10 PC game. It's simple to pick up and play (I prefer using a controller despite the first-person view), cute and family-friendly (my son gets a kick out of it, only hoping he doesn't emulate jerk cat's behavior). I recommend playing the game in spurts as playing more than 30 minutes at a time can get rather repetitive unless you're out to unlock some of the achievements that require longer play time. However, there's plenty of replayability as there are many collectables and cat characters to unlock.Highly recommended game, especially for those who love cats. Also, get an extra copy to gift to annoy that dog-loving spouse or friend of yours. "

												I played this game for nearly an hr. It isn't the best game in the world but when you want to cat and break things...this is the game to get...I recommend this to any other YouTuber looking for a silly game to enjoy...It's really fun to play...You see that plate? Knock it on the floor! you see that vase? Knock it on the floor! You see that crazy cat lady across the street...uhhh maybe you should keep your distance....now for the cons to the game...some people know that if you play a game too long it can get boring, some people will still like a game even after playing it for too long...even us YouTubers can get sick of a game even if fans want it...the game is closely at least 1-2hrs long to beat...It's easy and simple. Don't get me wrong breaking things is really fun but if you play the same levels over & over to a game that doesn't get updated too much,,,It can get extremely boring to even touch the game afterwards...I highly recommend catching this game on discount not full price...Meanwhile, searching the game for...Cat Puns...even the other reviews have them in it...you'll even find yourself making cat puns by the end of the day...But for me, I enjoyed the game greatly I may just cat my way through another level...because this game is purrfect...

												In this game, you play as a cat whose goal is to take revenge on his humans for whatever reason is relevant at the time. The game is very fast and controls very well, and the gameplay is very true to how cats act. You can press a button to meow, and if you look up before you jump, you can jump higher, much like cats do in real life. The game has really good replay value if you enjoy going for high scores and unlocking more cats to play as. This game is perfect for anyone who loves cats.			"

												The motivations and actions of cats had been the primary study of ancient dynastic Egypt for thousands of years. In the end they did not succeed however and their civilization fell to dust. Fast forward to present day and in all this time, what have we learned? Absolutely nothing, if you think about it. Schroedinger knew this. Clearly it impacted him personally, since his musings on cats was his greatest legacy. He proposed that nothing can be certain when a cat is put into a box, yet if you put a cat in a box (hardly needed for a cat will seek out a box on his own) he will simply stare at you, smugly, as though asking why you as a human have such a hard time understanding quantum theory and the nature of reality. Perhaps the cat has mastered it?Up until now the motives of the common feline have been shrouded in mystery, but thanks to some brilliant computer programmers there might be the first advance in understanding mankind has had since before written history.Be the cat. This simple philisophical proposition combined with modern computing power has given everyone the chance to take a first person glimpse into the every day life of the common house cat. It's taken thousands upon thousands of years to bring technology to the point where this is possible but now the riddle that escaped ancient Egypt might now be within OUR reach to be stroked between the ears or scratched under the chin. It is by no means a complete picture but a breakthrough nonetheless.If you ever wanted to get insight into the engimatic creature known as a house cat, play this game.			"

												I originally backed Catlateral Damage on Kickstarter and helped Greenlight it for Steam and it has not disappointed me. I remember some kinks in the early portion of the beta but it has come quite a bit of way now that we're getting closer to release  (beta until Sept. 1st as of the latest email from creator Chris Chung!). I periodically play in to see new development on the game and it has smoother swatting motions, fun challenges, and a lot more ease of movement than before. In the beginning, the motion aspect was the biggest target and then later came in meowing, additional achievements, mini challenges, litterbox mode, and the Kickstarter stretch goal levels such as the museum and grocery store. Thus far, I have played Objective mode, Litterbox mode, and the bonus museum level. I don't have any complaints about the game because it is certainly satisfying to swat objects onto the ground, watching some of them shatter (like dishes & vases!), getting upgrades, and the disappointed feeling that comes when you jump and fail epicly. Objective mode features a timer and a goal to destroy a number of items within a timeframe while Litterbox mode allows you to destroy items at your leisure. After each level is completed whether through timer in Objective mode or casually through Litterbox mode, you can simply click continue to be taken to a whole new house/level. I really like how each house has a different design to keep things fresh. As I've gotten older, I have become more of a casual gamer so I mostly play in Litterbox mode. I'd rather take my time destroying my owners' precious items than being rushed to do the job. I'm a cat, right? I'm gonna take my sassy♥♥♥♥♥time then. The only problem I could see other people having, is the graphics, but what you see above is what you're getting. It is a simple, sometimes slightly stressful (Objective mode) game. Catlateral Damage is a fun distraction simulator essentially and I love it. And yes, you can chase a red dot when the challenge comes up.			"

Don't come here expecting a story or anything, but this is some of the most relaxing, most fun gameplay I've ever come across, and the graphics are simple but very appealing. There are more than enough cats/levels/surprises to keep you entertained for a good amount of time. I played 30 seconds of this game and instantly bought 2 more copies of it as gifts, so yeah it's worth the money. If you want a game to just kick back and have a little fun with, you should definitely give this a look.I would give this a 10/10 if there was multiplayer (co-op or versus.) I'd even pay extra for it. Please.			"

												I love this game.  As soon as I played it I was able to understand why my cat loves knocking stuff down.   It's a great game to just load up and play for 10 minutes.I also love seeing the posters of other people's pets.  It's really cute.More content is being added all the time and the game is continuing to get polished.Unfortunately the game isn't purrfect, yet.  The music gets a bit monotonous and while there are some variations on the goals you need to achieve,  it really comes down to just destroying everything.   I'd love to see other modes in this game, but knowing that it's basically made by one person,  I can understand that they only have so much time.  Though if possible, multiplayer bouts to see who can get the highest score or something could be really fun.  Or things like a race where you can knock obstacles onto other cats paths.  Netcode is hard though. "

Delightfully simple and easy to get a hang on, yet challenging and addictive! The score goal levels or the time trials will get you jumping and swatting at things non stop to make combos and finding the best routes to get the most points in the fewest seconds, or you can relax (like a cat should!) in the sandbox mode and just explore and bop things off for the heck of it.Recommended for cat lovers and casual gamers, you won't regret it!

												This game... I can't believe the fun I had playing it. The music is pleasant, the levels are interesting, the cats are adorable, and I think I understand my cat's logic more now. There's even a few character models that resemble him, so I can kind of play AS him.I think this will be my go-to for relaxation; just choose a cat, and destroy a house out of playful pettiness.			"

												I've wanted this game since I saw it at Boston FIG and met the developer. I love kitties! I like that there are unlockable cats and I'm really impressed by the variety of objects in the game. The soundtack is cute and very approprite. Thank you, Chris for making this game! You did a great job!			"

												Cats. An acquired taste, to be sure, but for those of us who have owned cats before, we understand there is a underlying naturalistic beauty in an animal so seemingly driven by carnal spite. Right? Lol no. Just... no. Cats are generally the worst, and if you like them, you're dead on the inside. Thankfully, that's not true if you like Catlateral Damage: that target of admiration, I could understand.Catlateral Damage hones in on the spiteful behaviour of felines and celebrates it by creating a fun little sandbox that harkens back to the likes of Katamari Damacy. The game takes a simple idea of knocking stuff over as a cat for points and executes it well. I found it to be a surprisingly fun distraction. This is the perfect game for when you've had a hard day at work, and you just want to get the rage out of your system by funking up your owners' house for no good reason.It's not super deep, and it's likely not one of longevity, but the game is fun while it lasts. Highly recommended if you see it on sale.			"

												Did you like Goat Simulator? Have you wanted to be a furry creature with zero regard for the feelings of others?Do you like cats?This might be the game for you!Good:-Huge varity of things to knock over.-Levels are randomly generated.-Sandbox AND Goal Oriented Modes.-Lots of things to unlock.-Has actual controller support.Meh:-Controls do what they need to do, but the platforming feels bad. I don't know what it is but I hate jumping.... which is a big deal. You're a cat, so you're gonna do lots of jumping.-The cats could be way cuter.Bad:-Might make you motion sick.-Kinda reptative if you're not into this sort of thing.-Were you expecting an actual story from this? There isn't any. Sorry.-No on-line or local co-op. For a novelty game like this, it really needs it.			"

The achievements were fun to collect, and the level variety kept things from becoming more monotonous than they could have been.

												Play as a cat and destroy everything!-Have you ever wanted to be a cat or do cat-like things such as making a mess without having to actually clean that mess or be judged by people for doing so? Then look no further! Catlateral Damage is a first-person destruction simulator where you play as a cat and knock as much objects to the floor as possible. Along with that, you can get powerups by using cat objects such as the litterbox, scratching post, cat tunnels, and more that help you knock objects faster and farther with one flick of the paw! But if you're not a fan of having a clear objective, try litterbox mode! In litterbox mode, you can freely knock down objects like its none of your buisness with as much time as you like. But if you think thats all, there is many more than just knocking down objects and collecting power ups. You can collect cats by unlocking achievements or doing other things or collect over 200+ real life cat photos for your own personal enjoyment. And so the game doesnt get repetitive, the houses are never the same and are always randomly generated so you wont get bored so easily! But the most cool thing that you can find in the game are the secret areas you can unlock such as the ""Mewseum"" or the ""Supermarkat."" What you do in these places are a suprise... :3The graphics in this game are not that bad in my opinion. They give off a cartoon-ish feel that really doesn't distract from the gameplay unless you are one about realistic graphics.-Overall: A great game to spend your money on if you love cats or ever wanted to be a cat and make a mess.

												So after wasteing a few hours here and there, i can say that while basic this game is pretty fun. It doesn't take a lot of thought, good for unwinding after work. And while the graphics are simple, there is some sastification with knocking everything on the floor.PROS:- Easy to play- Lots of achievements if that's your thing- Fun 'hidden' levels keep things interestingCONS:- I wish there were more levels to play. To only have 4 maps is a little boring.- Graphics are pretty basic and simple, which works for this game, but if you are looking for something as pretty as Fallout 4, this isn't itI'd still recommend this though, just for the fun of it.

												Very cute and silly first person exploration game!Catlateral Damage offers two modes.In 'Objective mode' you will face a time limit within which you have to beat a certain objective. 'Litterbox mode' allows you to choose from all the maps and just play as long as you want without any specific targets.This mode is especially good if you want to relax a little and just feel like a cat.The game has a cute minimalistic art style which goes very well with the varied map environments.Unlocking playable cats and collecting pictures is providing many hours of fun and relaxing gameplay besides knocking objects on the ground.

												If you've ever wanted to have the destructive powers of a cat, here's your chance! It's so much fun unlocking new cats to play with and  new levels to destroy, increasing your disastrous powers as you go! This game is quite entertaining and I found it to be quite a stress reliever.			"

												Cat Simulator - yes - mindlessly destroy your owner\'s home - just like a real cat ! :-D  Actually fun... I guess this is why cats pull open sock drawers, toss socks all over the room and generally knock everything off the table - just to watch them fall... :-)PLEASE add sock drawer mode - pull open sock drawer, pull out all socks, sneak inside and sleep.  Also - same thing for kitchen cabnets - knock all the cans out of the cabnet - and sleep inside.  Why Not ?  Purrfectly logical activity to a cat ! I have installed many CDDs in my home:  Cat Deflection Devices - heavy and/or large objects too big for kitty to knock down.  The Cat Deflection Devices protect smaller objects and areas kitty should not get into... like Fine China dishware! :-O !  g.g. buy it.			"

												This game is the best cat simulator ever in my opinion! The two game modes are great for people who are over achievers or just want full blown destruction. If you have OCD, watch out, because every little neat thing placed about will be on the floor, especially in the Supermarket level. All of the levels are unique and full of interesting items to knock over, even power ups to make you a better cat! And the cat choices to choose from are great too, different in size, shape, and fur design.			"

  Catlateral Damage  Well. You play as a cat. obviously.What can I say about this game?Well for starters it's for cat people/cat lovers. And or people who are cat-curious.Ever wanted to ""DISRESPECT YOUR SURROUNDINGS"" ?  but not having to suffer of facing the consequences of your actions? Well then this is for you. Take the roll of being a cat and navigate your way to  Fǘĉḵįṋǥ shįt up Oh is that a glass cup? *swat* oh look. Nicely stucked clothes *swat* get that weak shnit out of here.Find secerts (which are kinda easy to find) to unlock new places and cats. (plus photo's of both cats and dogs)Not to mention meowing is also an option. Yeah just meow at everything. Be a real cat.  There is also a secert cat that does something else than meowing All and all. This game is just something to relax to.Getting bored of some games that are just ---> guns blazing, car difting, fists flying, etc?Give catalateral Damage a try.Best played with a controller.I find it easier and faster.Happy gaming mother meower.  /r/equesting   Devs. I hope you see this. Make online play with other players.From most wrecking room to races and just free roaming.Please.			"

												I don't think this game is worth full price, but I do recommend it as a ""mess around on a bored day"" type of game.It's certainly a bit of fun, and I do see why some people find themselves getting bored of it quickly, but I think it's worth having for those days where you just don't want to play any big-titles in your library.also 10/10 would chase a red dot whilst going ""MEOW"" vocally, confusing my cat again.

												This game is exactly what you think it is. If the idea of playing as a cat and knocking things on the floor doesn't appeal to you, don't expect anything more here. Sure, there are things to unlock, half a dozen levels, and a get-the-laser minigame, but at the end of the day you're just a cat pushing cel-shaded objects on the floor.The game's Objective mode can be frustrating but is almost always fair, where you knock down a certain number of objects in either way too little or way too much time; the different time limts set a good overall pace where you don't have to be entirely frantic or bored the whole time. Sandbox mode is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, although perfectionists ought to be careful here as it can be difficult if not impossible to ""complete"" certain levels as there is zero leeway regarding object count and sometimes an object that has fallen on another object will not count toward your total. Although you can collect power-ups in both modes, they are not persistent except immediately between levels in the objective mode, so consider yourself starting from scratch in each session.I really like the collectibles aspect, where a list of everything you've encountered is archived and separated by item type. It would have been nice if you could interact with the objects in this list to view their models, or at least if they were named, but it gives a little more depth to an otherwise simple game.			"

												Reviewing the VR content specifically, but it's fairly fun. I wouldn't call it world-changing, but to get it free with the standard game is nice. It would be nice to have some type of jump so that you could feel a little more into the experience, but it was still great fun and it runs well.			"

												Why no power ups in VR?  In desktop, you smack toys or toilet paper roll, get a power up.  In VR... nothing.No swat power ups make it damn near impossible to knock enough off before time runs out.But... Besides the no power ups in VR(or am I just not hitting it enough?) I loved it!  I've done a couple room scale games and this one takes the cake!It's on sale now so grab it now!			"

												Have you ever wished you could break everything with no consequences? Then this game is for you! There isn't really a whole lot to do other than break as much stuff as you can and knock everything over, and I can never seem to find the mouse when it tells me there is one (I guess I wouldn't make a very good cat), but it is amusing and a nice way to kill some time and relax a little bit.
