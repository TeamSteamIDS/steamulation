												TL;DR: Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is a light, zombie themed 4X game. It's fantastic and you should buy it.I am a huge fan of Civ. I love the exploration, the gradual expansion, the sense of progress and increasing power.As a Civ player I tend to turtle, that is, I like to build a solid and impenetrable perimeter before I expand further. Eventually, I'll push out to nab a bit of territory here, a strategic resource there. Over time, I'll get bigger and bigger, with every gain hard fought and locked down. Rebuild 3 might be my perfect game.Another thing about Civ is that it is not intended to be a realistic government or historical simulator, I like the fact that Chairman Mao is fighting with Abraham Lincoln. I like the bright colours and the slightly irreverent tone. I don't need the game to include 'realistic' details like racism and slavery, and I don't mind the fact that swordsmen can occasionally kill a tank.Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is not a realistic zombie simulator, it contains cartoonish graphics, cannibalism, and over the top stereotypes. You can convert a field of rubble into a tower apartment block with a single builder. It's fun. Obviously, however, if what you're after is something dark, brooding and 'realistic', this game is not for you.One more thing. The prequel, Rebuild 2 (AKA Rebuild Mobile, or just ""Rebuild""), was a popular game on iOS and Android and Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville has also now been released on the same platforms. The mobile version is identical in every way to the PC version, and the game plays really well on the mobile. If you want your mobile games to stay on mobile then feel free to buy it there. But I'm mostly a PC player and I like my big screen and mouse control.Regardless, Rebuild doesn't feel like a mobile game in that it's not particularly 'clicky', menus work like PC menus and the interface works like a PC interface. Still, it doesn't have infinite tech trees or massive worlds or complex animation and that's a huge part of its appeal.Basically, if you're after a light 4X game with a very strong sense that you're always making progress, that doesn't become overwhelming towards the end game, that doesn't have dead time following an initial expansion/exploration rush, that strips out a lot of tedious micromanagement, and if you like your 4X games to completely play out in a couple of hours each, then this is your game.

Early Access Review
								This stems from the creator getting a ton of love for their Rebuild and Rebuild 2 flash games. She finally struck out to create a full game of the series and here it is!This is a turn Turn based or Real time strategy game. You start out with a few blocks of the city under your control and useing your survivors attempt to reclaim the entire city while trying to survive the zombies and other factions. There are different types of buildings, different types of survivors, and a variety of items to equip them with. Additionally there is research and a tech tree to go up unlocking new buildings and such. The survivors will also gain experience as you send them out on different jobs and you can choose new skills with that experience.I have had a ton of fun even in the earliest stages of the alpha (Woo for being a backer) and will certainly have tons more in this game before and after release. Hope this tells you about the game!Edit: Someone asked if there are new things from Rebuild 2? Yes!From Comments: Yes, most of the game is either expanded with new parts to it (such as survivors can now gain skills after gaining experience, new buildings, new items) to entire new things such as other factions to deal with, survivor traits, and new jobs for them to do. Most of the cooler ones are still in development but you can check the Coming Soon list on the store page to see what's planned. Hope that answers it!			"

												At first glance, it's a fun game. There's something rather addicting about slowly but steadily expanding a town and leveling survivors. However, eventually you realize that's all there is to it. The ""tech tree"" is just minor upgrades, reactivating power and water are just happiness bonuses, maxing characters in a stat just makes them slightly better, and fighting/diplomacy with other gangs is tedious at best.I got it on sale and I don't regret it, but $15 dollars feels a little steep. Campaign will keep you around 30 hours, but you'll probably be bored before then.There just isn't enough content to keep me coming back. Perhaps if each of the in-game factions was playable with different playstyles... but they aren't.			"

												There's one review that states that «there isn't anything that really differentiates or improves this game from it's free flash predecessors» — obviously, it wasn't written when the game was still an Early Access title, so it is totally misleading.This game is really addictive, and it is much more complex than it's free flash predecessor. It has many advanced features.For instance, you can manage your city's policies when you build a city hall, and it even gives your government a proper name when you adopt these policies (mine was called «Capitalist Dictatorship» :) ). There are quests, many random events, lots of items to find, use and craft.It's like Civilization meets Sim City, State of Decay (not in aspect of graphics, of course) and even Project Zomboid (with just a small difference: there are NPCs in Rebuild 3 :) ).Great game with a good price (got it with -15% off, but wouldn't mind paying full price, it is worth it).

												As someone who played the games on Newground years ago, this game fulfills all hopes I had for a sequel.The plot involves your character as the apocalypse begins. Within the first week of the apocalypse you have been bit and killed an innocent soldier. You sit around waiting to die from the bite, and never do. 2 Years later, you're still alive and meet a woman named Diane, who has plans to build a settlement to help keep people alive and bring them together.Along with all the things the original games had, Northway games added many things that I felt were needed in the originals. Character Creation, Opposing Factions, and much more. (couldnt remember any more, but knew there were more)Also, HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THE STORY MODE!Seriously, I love it.Along with the story mode, there is Free Play. With free play, you can choose anything you want for the game, and make it. So, with this advancement, you can make the most difficult apocalypse ever. So... Giant City with Insane Mode.Anyway, Just play the damn game. I'm serious. Play the damn game.9.75/10Love It.			"

Early Access Review
								So I've been a huge fan of the Rebuild series - 1 and 2 - since I stumbled upon it on Kongregate. I loved the all the little touches, the artwork, the little jokes here and there, the mechanics of the game - I loved it all, it just kept getting better and better. So when I finally got my hands on this I was so excited.I'm not disappointed, don't get me wrong, but some things don't feel quite right, it wasn't as simple mechanics anymore and there is a lot more faffing around to do.For example, the one that gets me the most is probably the characters backstories. I loved the idea of unique backstories to a character and getting a respective perk for backstory was great - but ultimately it became tedious to go through over and over again, searching for the people who needed an upgrade was a drag and I ended up either not doing it or not really immersing myself in the story. The interactions between characters are also... well, not that interesting. It's nice to see people get married and stuff but there seems to be very little indicators leading up to that event, some mini bonus events that help you watch the love between couples grow before marriage would be quite nice.On the other hand, interactions between people who hate each other are very frequent, and an absolute pain to sort out, because they tell you the names of the two people (and to be honest, with 40+ survivors, I don't learn names!) and nothing else - it doesn't show you where they are working on the map - I think a little icon saying 'there is conflict here' on the map would make everything a little easier to sort out. Maybe if you put people who like each other together you'll get bonuses on missions (less time to complete, more safety etc.) and it will show you on the map with a little smiley face or something - and vice versa for people who don't get on, so you can get a fair warning of when conflict will happen and manage your forces accordingly, it will pay to put those who like each other on the same team, or it will force you to spread your forces thinner so missions will get done.Another thing... I adore the different factions idea, but I don't think they should be able to expand that easily. See, the game is supposed to be about zombie invasion, but really after 15 minutes of nitty gritty survival, the factions take over and its 'plop a survivor into leadership school so I don't go to war' - the zombies become non existant and you just fight factions for territory, it feels like thats a greater part of the game than the actual zombies are.Also it seems like all the factions get along even though they are completely opposed, they only seem to have trouble with me - the technophobes and the technophiles get on fine, as do the rowdy rebel schoolboys and the oppressive government, but not my kinda neutral faction, I'm the only one who does wrong. Getting rival factions to hate each other and working that to your advantage or, it being your downfall as you have to take on two or more at once if they are allies, would add a new layer of depth to the game. You choices of friends and foes becomes more important.The factions you befriend don't really have any special perks too, besides getting a few free resources (which is useful I guess, when materials become hard to find and you have a steady supply) - it would be nice if when you befriended a faction, say the Government, it provides a strength boost, or with the Pharmacists, death rate falls and injuries are quicker to heal. I absolutely love this game, don't get me wrong, but I just feel like so much more could be done with it! You can never stop improving a game, no game is perfect, I think it's fun to watch the game grow and develop in complexity, and for all my grumbles I'll still keep up to date with the game, and I'll still keep playing. Just needs more layers for me to sink my teeth into! "

												As a bit of a zombie game nut, I was glad to spot that the Rebuild series was coming on Kickstarter, so it didn't take much convincing for me to back this one.Having finished the game's campaign, here's a quick summary of what I thought:PROS:+ Interesting setting with a humorous twist, clever writing+ Solid, yet simple city management and tactical gameplay to counter the threat of the ever-growing undead horde, starvation, disease, hostile factions and crazy loners.+ Multitude of random events with various outcomes+ Loads and loads of characters to rebuild your post-apocalyptic utopia. Nice little personal touches with random background stories, perks and familial ties, feuds and friendships that form during gameplay.+ Persistent retinue in the campaign. You can usually take 3 followers with you to the next map.+ Factions are nicely unique from each other and sport different goals and motivations, which can be used to your advantage or depending on your gameplay, stir trouble with them and make them hate your guts.+ Long campaign with various subplots+ Research tree+ Personal equipment to every character to customize them.+ Nice illustrated graphics and clear interface and UI.+ Replayability with the random map gen function.CONS:- Some game functions are not necessarily instantly apparent or even explained to the player. For example, the loss of stats on your retinue members for balancing reasons between maps in the campaign.- The soundtrack gets a bit repetitive after a few hours.- After every map, you have to research everything again and again and again...- Turn-Based gameplay seems to work much better as opposed to the RTS timer, in which you have no idea when anybody is going to make a move and when.- The factions have no memory of your previous engagements with them, be it in alliance, indifference or bloody warfare- The last mission of the campaign can be a bit unrewarding storywise, considering the difficulty spike.Overall, I'd say the game is definitely worth a look for anybody who enjoys city management and zombie games, a dash of humour and reliance on your judgement to make best out of all the resources you have at your disposal. I also found the persistent retinue feature and survivor micromanagement very satisfying, although after the number of survivors climbs to dozens, it becomes quite hard to track the right people you're looking for without organizing the survivors into work gangs.However dissatisfied I may have been by the outcome of the story, it was still a good journey, eventful and at times lots of fun, despite the ever-looming aspect of dying of starvation, zombie bites or having your neighbouring gang turn you into a link of sausages. The side quests and writing made it certainly worthwhile- fresh in memory is one event in my early campaigning, when I lost my treasured top hat of office to domestic intrique. Good times.			"

Early Access Review
								It is fantastic to see Rebuild return to my screen, now in the form of a full browser title as opposed to a flash game. I had always been a fan of the series and I was delighted to see its triumphant return.I had not been a backer for the game, having only discovered its existance about three days before it's official Steam debut. I was however immediately excited, so I eagerly awaited the game and had it purchased within an hour or so of its release. I spent a short time playing it, just to get the gist of how everything worked, what had been changed, what was the same and all that stuff.First thing I noticed which I was mildly disappointed about was the graphics. Whilst they are pleasant to look at, that proves to be its downfall in my eyes. The first and second games were ultimately horror games with a lot of grim aspects which the graphics complimented. The people shown always looked ragged and realistic, which I felt sucked me into the experience. While it's still too early to say if the game's dark tone has changed, it currently appears to have become slightly more cartoonish and less gritty. Now, this doesn't ruin the game in any way, but it does kind of disappoint me.The music also disappointed me slightly, being less dark in tone than the original. Of course this is personal preference and it in no way spoils the experience, but it does still warrant mentioning. It grows mildly repetitive, so it may be nice if future updates were to perhaps add multiple tracks or an extended version, just to keep up variety. As for general audio, there isn't any major emphasis which I understand and appreciate. The audio isn't where the heart of the game lies.The gameplay itself is interesting. I switched the game to turn-based because that's how I had become familiar with the series. It is nice to see a game which gives the option between real time and turn based. When I got into the game, I could see that many mechanics had been made far more complex. In the originals, you were to click on a building, select a task which you wished to perform on that building, you would select the number of people you wished to perform that task and as you added more, the estimated time to completion got smaller. Now we have a combination of a variant of that and a click-and-drag system, in which icons of the characters are clicked and dragged to areas on the map. While it does work quite effectively, there was occassionally mild confusion when I for example, sent several people out on a single mission and was unsure of how to select them individually again. I don't know if I missed something, disabled something or if the tutorial simply needs a little tweaking. For the most part, things can be sorted through trial and error.As can be seen immediately, many features of the game are still locked. Zombie attacks are only implimented in the sense that you are given an alert and then told that the feature has yet to be implimented. Character customisation is still extremely limited, which I hope will be changed with proceeding updates as it became slightly awkward as many characters looked nearly alike.Construction now requires materials, which is a new aspect to gameplay. Buildings can be demolished to scavenge for new materials which can then be used to create new buildings which are of more use. I suspect that there are more ways to gather materials, but unfortunately my play session was not very long.Overall, I consider this to be a very good addition to the series which is let down purely by the fact that it is beta, which can hardly be claimed as the fault of anyone. I shall reccomend it on the basis of future updates. Fans of the original should pick up this title immediately, whilst those unfamiliar should perhaps wait a while until the game has been updated a little more.			"

												This is my first review, so be gentle.Rebuild 3 is a very simple game with enduring playability.  It takes little time to work out the mechanics the rest is mastering them.  I have an insane amount of time into this game already, and still continue to play it over and over.  It would be easy to see this as a quick sit down and play a game, but there isn't anything quick about trying to complete a full game.  You can easily find yourself spending an afternoon when you intended to only spend an hour.  You have little to regret. The game is a real-time strategy where you start with you and three other survivors and you try to expand your territory and deal with zombies.  You can play with factions and they offer some interesting methods to play through.  Your goal is to ally yourself with the other factions or to eliminate them, or ally with one and eliminate the other.  This completes the current game, allows you to leave and start a new city.This is about making the best choices to make your survivors the most productive to advance your game.  Your survivors level and increase in skills, eventually getting storyline bonuses.  You can find stuff to help your skills and scavenge for materials to help build your city bigger and bigger.  Zombies have a few surprises and can be a bit to handle, but they are fairly predictable and slow giving you time to react.  Factions can either help you with trading or you can raid and war on them and  they are typically harder to deal with than zombies.The best part of the game is it's great artwork, and its homage's to other zombie horror both films and games.The worst parts can be some of the bugs but nothing making the game unplayable.  I've only ran into two cases where a game simply broke (would not finish properly) but as this game gets patched regularily they soon are no problem.  Of course this is still alpha/beta status so its silly not to expect bugs.  Still this is quite a polished effort and will provide hours of simple yet not boring gameplay.Post Release Update:This game certainly is much much more than the early beta, and with even more variation and story there is so much to accomplish.  I don't play as often because I lose entire days when I do and its hard to get them back.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is good, especially if you haven't played any of the others in the series. The user interface is a lot cleaner and easily navigatable, and having played this, I struggle to go back to Rebuild 1 on my ipad.Having said that, here are some of my complaints.Buildings - There is no need to have more than one type of building beyond apartments and farms. It would be nice if we could have some building options that aren't just more food or more space.  I could build more bars or churchs, but they are kinda pointless if I dont have more leaders to stick in them (And leaders are generally the type of character I dont want more than one or two of). Some buildings that add to your overall base defense (as long as its on the border of your land) would be cool.Gangs - I love the introduction of factions, and making allies is done really well. Fighting them, however, is kind of boring. You have to go through and take every property the enemy has, simply taking out the hedquarters doesn't suffice. This has lead to me allying with every single faction I can because going to war just takes far too long (and is probably harder too.  Maybe.  Niether option is particularly difficult).Aside from those gripes, if this is your first foray into rebuild, I absolutely 100% recommend it. If you've played any of the previous ones and were indifferent, give it a miss for now, as there isn't really anything new.			"

												It's an addicting game, but I can't recommend it. The game is near completion and there isn't anything that really differentiates or improves this game from it's free flash predecessors. If you want to play Rebuild, find it on Kongregate - they're more serious, less cartoony, more realistic, and free.*8/31/15 Update - Revisiting the game and doubling my game time*I put 20 hours in the game in the past two weeks, doubling my game time, as the game has been fully completed. The core of the gameplay is still the same, and if you liked the first two Rebuilds, you'll enjoy this one. That being said, the reason why Rebuild 3 is so addicting because it plays exactly the same as the first two Rebuilds. Building a strong community of survivors while reclaiming buildings for your base was the reason why the first two Rebuilds were addicting and it is the same for Rebuild 3. The new faction addition doesn't add much to the enjoyability of the game because it's repetitive and the novelty fades away faster than you'd like. This game introduces factions, which you have to befriend or destroy, and the premise is exciting. Learning how to befriend these factions for trading and security bonuses for your base is very satisfying. However, forging alliances is formulaic - as long as you have a high level leader, craftable trading goods, and agree to all the demands of the faction leaders - you'll have an alliance before long. There are meaningful interactions with the faction leaders which make the faction system unique and interesting, but there aren't nearly enough of these. Each map in story mode is the same as the one before it and there isn't much variation to the gameplay. The result is an alliance system doesn't really add much to the game and Rebuild 3 falls short as a paid sequel. In conclusion, Rebuild 3 is an addicting game that is a polished version of its predecessors. For what it is, Rebuild 3 is a fun game - a fantasy zombie survival. However I ask that you try the free prequels on Kongregate before you purchase, because the fun part of Rebuild 3 hasn't been changed since the first Rebuild. Had I known what I know now, I probably would've skipped this title.			"

												While somewhat fun, the game rapidly grows repetitive.My main complaint would be the lack of felt progression. While new technologies are unlocked in every city you travel to, your group apparently forgets all of the technologies along the way. Basically every new city you travel to is a completely new game, save for a couple of survivors and their gear. This constant need to build from the ground up, rather than being able to start somewhere in the middle quickly grows wearying.The other complaint is the lack of differentiation. What I mean is (And has been mentioned by others) the buildings are rather boring. Apart from farms and apartments, you only need one of every other building. I get to the point where half my fortress is filled with parking lots and office towers, because until I need the space for something there's no point in coverting themConclusion: While an enjoyable game for a few hours, it rapidly grows old. It's not worth the $15 they're asking for it, but if you can get it for $5, go for it.			"

								I've played Rebuild 1 and 2. They were nice, fun flash games with tons of great ideas. Currently, Rebuild 3 is only in alpha and looks very promising. You can play by turn or real time management and have to reclaim a city full of zombies while surviving. There are many aspect to the game: Food management, happiness management, relationships, combats, diplomacy with other factions...Overall, even if it is still in alpha, I'm glad I backed it. If you like flash games, zombie games, management games, you'll probably like it. You can also try rebuild 1 and 2 for free on the internet, you'll get a glimpse of the third game. The third is just more complex and has many other gameplay options.			"

												Fun at first but gets tedious rather quickly as you're just doing the same things over and over.The game is too easy (even on hard - it just takes longer), and there is not much strategy required.There is not enough info displayed on the main view (because it's a mobile port I guess).Sometimes it asks if you want to kick/kill/date a person but it just references them by their name - no picture etc and you can't leave the pop-up without making a decision.Also there are no info overlays which is criminal for a strategy game.With the scavenger selected you should be able to see all locations already scavenged for example, but you can't - you need to click each one to see if it's scavengable. And moving him to a different tile every turn gets tedious as well - this is why games like Civ have auto-explore.And each time he finishes scavenging a tile he runs away so you have no idea where he was then you need to click on all the tiles again to find out which ones have been scaveneged and which have not.A simple overlay when you select the scav, or different overlay options that you can toggle on and off or even little icon on each tile would fix this problem.Most of the other problems stem from this same lack of info and needing to perform multiple actions over and over just to complete simple tasks.It's a fun little game and worth getting on sale for $5 or less but lack of onscreen info and tedious gameplay will annoy more than anything.EDIT:I finally found the overlay options (they're not in the menu but actually an icon on the main game screen next to the settings icon - a grey diamond with an x on it). They improve the game a ton by showing whether a tile has been scouted, scavenged, and what the level of zombie danger is from 0 up.They make the game 100 times more playable so it seems bizarre that they're not mentioned on the tutorial or on by default.With these additions I'll go with a good neutral rating (which is still not a recommended rating unfortunately, but not a 'bad' rating as such).The game is still about moving characters to tiles.Move a character to a tile to scout.Move a character to a tile to scavenge.Move a character to a tile to kill zombies.Move a character to a tile to claim it.Move a character to a tile to build there.Move a character to a tile to research something (even when research finishes you need to drag the character off and on again to research something new as they automatically go into guard mode after researching 1 item).After moving a character to a tile for the 1000th time it gets a bit tedious.Especially since there's no strategy to take your mind off all the moving.The game is just a sequence of clicking until you reach the end without much thinking required. And while some may like this, I just don't find it enjoyable.			"

												Having been a fan of teh browser games, I was interested in seeing what a full-game in the series could offer. After spending plenty of time with the game, I came away with some very mixed feelings, because the core of what I enjoyed from the original games is still there, but I don't think it benefits from longer play-sessions or a sprawling campaign.Good:1. Storyline - I rather enjoyed the story that was threaded through the campaign, and there were a lot of great little touches of humor that went well with the game's cartoony style. I also enjoyed the attempt to make each character into a character (even if it was based on procedural elements).2. Gameplay - I rather liked the light-management aspects of the game, struggling to build up a self-sufficient colony while under assault from zombies.3. Art - I like the colorful and cartoony styleBad:1. Progression - The campaign doesn't feature a very engaging progression system. Yes, research upgrades are gated during the first few levels and you can bring a few survivors along with your main from town to town, but those reached a peak midway through the campaign. With each new level you're also forced to climb back up the tech tree (granted, subsequent levels would be much easier if this wasn't the case).2. Repetition - Most of the levels play out in similar ways and they all kind of blurred together. You have your initial struggle for survival, followed by slow growth until finally you're rolling out acros the whole map. Levels mostly vary by size rather than by the kind of challenges they present to the player. All of this makes the game feel a little bloaty and the campaign overlong.			"

												""Wow I'm bored.""This is not a thought you should have while playing a game. I had it while playing Rebuild 3.The first two games were neat little timewasters. Rebuild 3 is more complicated and just a bit more engaging. That just a bit means you actually need to pay attention to the game, you can't easily multitask like you could with previous titles. And with that demand for attention you realize just how little you're actually doing. The game's pacing is slow, even glacial. You'll be in a secure position long before you get near a victory condition and everything after that is just a grind. Story mode doesn't add nearly enough variety to combat that grind; it'll just be more of the same.			"

								I didn't know a lot about this game and honestly had low expectations when I bought it on a whim.But once the game actually started, that all started to change.I kept going and going trying to grow out my little town with more survivors, eventually building a community.I wanted to keep my own people save and help whoever I could.Some bikers showed up and demanded our stuff but we showed them not to mess with us...This game is addicting in the sense that it's hard to stop once you start.I definatly suggest giving it a try. I did and I'm glad I did			"

												A decent 4x-esque zombie apocalyspe simulator, where you travel from city to city looking for the cure. Suffers from a some major flaws, though.+Captures the ""just one more turn feeling"" very well.+More backstory, items, and equipment than the first two games.+Amusing cartoony graphics.-+An attempt at a story, though rather half-heartedly.-Game lacks polish: spelling errors, incorrect character portraits, characters don't stay married from town to town, etc.-Hard to find a happy medium in difficulty. It's is either too hard early on or far too easy late game.-Characters must specialize. You can't just put people where they're best anymore.-Campaign mode is far too long. It takes 10-12 cities to tell a story that could be done in 5. And you won't even learn the story if you choose to fight the other factions, rather than ally with them.-The optional cities are sometimes not skippable due to glitches.-Goals never change. The only way to win is to either destroy everyone, ally with everyone, or fix the plane. -Surprise twist ending!!1! in the last level is so awful it made me quit playing.			"

								This game is a fantastic take on the post-apocalyptic zombie survival genre. If you are wondering whether or not this will be worth your time, go lookup Rebuild 1 & 2, the free internet flash games. The developers have only built upon the foundation of those two, and as a player of the alpha and beta, I highly recommend this game to strategy lovers. There is high replayability for the multiple endings and ways to win, and the witty journal entries make you interested in the daily lives of your survivors.			"

												I spent more hours than I should've playing the flash games on kongregate and was very excited to see a full game come out of it, so first a few pros:-The style and attention to detail in the game is great, the level of small information nuggets makes the game feel very full-Addition of little events giving your characters unique modifiers is great, and the randomness of some of the events keeps it interesting-Pretty addictive, you get stuck in very quickly and end up getting gutted when your favorite dog dies-The addition of research adds another fun layer to the game with more stuff to aim forOk, a few cons:-Each level is very similar. Once you've played through a few levels you'll find yourself getting irritated having to start at the bottom of the research tree every time and basically just repeating what you did in the last area-Limited gameplay. Mostly this is due to the above reason, so you'll put a tonne of hours into it when you first start but you'll prob find yourself grinding to a halt after a while-The amounts of little bits of information almost feels like there were a few ideas the developer had that weren't followed through.Overall - a great game that would really benefit from some DLC expanding on what's already there. Feels like there's a lot of potential not fully exploited.			"

												Fantastic Little Strategy GameI have spent FAR too much playing this game already.  I played it back on the HTML version and it was addictive then, and moreso now.Don't let the mobile feel fool you -- Rebuild's been around for awhile.  A strategy game where you take the world back from the zombie apocalypse instead of just running away and hoping for a rescue.  Each version added more depth and this time is no different.Take heed -- Rebuild is TOUGH and you can easily screw yourself over if you get careless or overconfident.  The difficulty is not to be messed with, and even strong starts can take a sudden downward spiral.  Thankfully the easier difficulties are quite doable and will ease you into the basic mechanics.On the negative:Rebuild 3 suffers from a little too much RNG where it could have used a skill check, and a few irritating mechanics (Cultists always infect one random survior except the protag) and the inabilty to finish off any faction for good is less than satisfying.  Plus getting the ""Golden Ending"" is truly ridiculous.			"

								TL;DR (seriously?): I don't know if I'm angry or happy it abandoned the gory art of Rebuild 2.I've been playing the Rebuild series for a few years after it came on Flash. This is the newest rendition, now paid-for and downloadable. The game is a complete rewrite of the original and it felt really unfamiliar for me, especially with the new real-time system.The titular new feature is ""gangs"", or factions, groups of other survivors. You conduct diplomacy with them through the familiar event-based system. There's a lot more to do in this game compared to its predecessors, but if you're not sure about the $15 price tag play the original two for free on a website!			"

												I didn't think I would spend as much time as I did on the game. Though the game play gets pretty repetetive, the new missions still keep it relatively fun. Some tasks should be automated though. Scouting becomes a real pain for large maps. Also we should be able to auto set our soldier stacks to keep attacking nearby tiles. All in all a good buy.			"

												I want to recommend this, there's a lot to like about it but I just can'ttl;dr I liked the game at first, it's just that there's not a lot of depth too it and the mechanics at the start of the game don't show any real progression later on apart from ""throw more at you"" to make it more ""challenging.""I'll start with a few small gripes and move onto a personal account.Part of the mechanics are about building a relationship and back story with your fellow survivors. You can even get into a relationship and marry another member of your group. At the end of the scenario you escape to the next town with a handful of the group you were with before. The thing about this, the people you take are randomised after the first couple of towns. So you have a partner and you've grown some people into high stats with some good gear who will be very useful in the next town, especially early on. As you enter the new town you find out that you've left them all behind and brought with you three level one leaders instead.The research tree just becomes frustrating later on. Every time you enter a new town you seem to just forget everything you've learnt from the previous one, even if one of the scientists randomly starts with you. Personally, a research system that takes weeks instead of days but stays with you through the course of the scenarios would have sat a lot better with me. Even if it took months, if it was a life long lesson learnt it would be more of a slog but more satisfying.While each map is randomly generated, sadly the gameplay has little variation. The objectives to win are the same for each level, a couple of maps have an alternate way out. The first of the alternative way can turn out to be a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move if you're not prepared for it, you can still progress through the normal manner but it's a bit of a zombie hell which makes the normal way a lot more difficult.Personal accountI'm around three quarters through the main campaign and the mechanics of throwing zombies en masse is becoming tiring. You have two main dangers from the undead, ""Massed zombies"" which are zombies at the border who have grown in number and are close to breaching the walls. Simple enough mechanic and easy to deal with at first. There's also ways to reduce this threat. Let's get too the late game scenario, with the handful of survivors you start with I had one pop up within minutes. Easily dealt with, immediately after that another popped straight up followed by a second one. Expansion was a little slow but any progression is good. While dealing with this the other main threat popped up.""Mobbed zombies"" which are a group of zombies placed randomly on the map who charge straight for your nearest fort space. Nothing will stop them as they will even barrel through other factions squares, doesn't matter if there's a faction squad on the square, they will just blink the square away into neutral ground and keep coming making it your threat to deal with. Early on these are pretty easy to deal with, let's get back to late game.Now at this point I'm not that far into the scenario, I only have half the squares I need to build a special building which permits interacting with other factions. I'm already dealing with a trio of constantly spawning massed zombies, now dealing with mobbed zombies. Progression slows as I'm trying to keep the ground I've covered. Ten seconds after the mobbed zombies have been dealt with another popped up. In the space of ten minutes progression is pretty much halted as I'm now dealing with five massed zombies and constant mobbed zombie attacks. Not to mention a faction is sending a raiding party to my fort every minute or so, oh wait, they just sabotaged my laboratory now I'm losing ground.ConclusionNow I didn't expect the late game stages to be a cake walk, I was just hoping it would be more of a challenge than just throwing ridiculous amounts at you. There are ways to reduce threats, but with not even a couple of dozen survivors having to stave off dangers from seven different sides all at once... I think I'm going to leave it here, this isn't a bad game. I just can't recommend it as being a good game either though.			"

												I played the prequels too & there is parts about it that I really like, but if I compare it to other games out there I lost interest quicker with rebuild 3. If you like a more casual take on games, you probably like it better than me.Also I think it is too easy on challenging difficulty & becomes very repetitive after you played like 2 or 3 towns in the campaign. Arriving at the 5th town on challenging diff, I haven´t lost anyone of the ~150 people I was commanding until then in different towns and setups - this should speak for itself. Always the same procedure, secure food supply. Create surplus, buy anything you want from factions. No challenge & no suprises in that. If zombies ever get through a weak spot in your wall they just take away 1 field which is irrelevant because you own something like 30 anyway and retake it within 45 seconds. Always liked the start better than mid to late game like in most games where the survival challenge prevails...The towns and characters are RND generated but that doesnt help much as you quickly learn the components they consist of by heart.The story writing is pretty good & heavily inspired by the walking dead. The humor is the best thing about this game but you won´t read the same stories over and over again so you just click them away and the grinding (assigning tasks) remains. Actually the writing was the reason why I kept playing since I wanted to explore some quest lines and because I´m an hopeless addict to vid games in general.The weakest part IMO is, when you expanded a big fort in a city and are just waiting to finish quest lines parts with your leaders - being just a matter of time - and when you start hating the timer for not allowing you to talk to a faction again while there is nothing other left to do..

												Just as addicting and fun as the previous app titles. This time around, you've got more features, more story and it's undoubtedly more difficult (sometimes annoyingly frustratingly so). If you play the campaign, you will follow the story of a man/woman thrown into a unwelcome Zombie Apocalypse world full of difficult choices, unexpected results and game mechanics that inspire that ""one more turn"" philosophy. There is a real-time component but I prefer the, move ahead one day of the classic games. This is one of the few iOS games I would actually recommend and find worth playing.

												*1.1 release edit - Blimey! I recently reinstalled the game after not playing it since near when this review first was posted and the game has come a long way. Spoiler, if you were on the fence over buying it whilst it was in early access, you shouldn't be anymore. The game has furfilled what it promised and I'm glad to see it has been updated a fair amount since my last playthrough.*:Early Access Review:I finished it yesterday on normal and so far its improved on every aspect of the original 2. The new graphic style is very pleasing. The new way it handles time is much better in my opinion. Being able to be more precise for how long you send out survivors gives the game much more depth. The faction system is good, although they seem very predictable when at war. The only issue that i have with it at the moment is just an event put into the game where survivors will hate eachother. Sometimes you will be finally reclaiming the building you've needed for ages and suddenly a survivor is injured for 3 days because they didnt get along with someone and had a fight. In a zombie apocolypse, i doubt people are going to fall out and beat eachother up instead of fighting for survival. All the other issues are bugs that should be fixed later on and thats fine. The skrimish mode (the only mode available at the moment) repeats itself however e.g. same events happen in every new game. I hope this isn't the case for other modes as after the first playthough, it can get quite boring getting the same ""should we save the bunnies or eat the bunnies"" event.Overall, zombie defence fans are fine to buy it in its current state. I have no doubts that it will be even better upon full release			"

The biggest problem I have is that once you manage to clear out a corner for yourself that doesnt have too big a border and enough food it gets too easy. Feels like a reverse difficulty curve. Managing survivors is a bit tedious in the end game.I think the game is solid enough for one campaign playthrough.			"

At the start it's all well and fine, but as your population grows big, it becomes sort of menial and boring to manage every single citizen. But the many options in what to manage, from food production to research is a very big plus.A lot of varied events and paths to take which makes the game very interesting. Sometimes it's all about luck, sometimes things demand careful planing.The game becomes easy after a while so be sure to try on harder difficulties.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing except for one thing; the religious aspect of this game. Now, I'm not bashing on religion here, but I really wish that this game could have offered what was offered in Rebuild 2 with the Cultists. (The ability to destroy any and all Cultist crap) I had a selection of 5 people gathered from the start, it went down from 5 to 4 by default, and then one of my builders (One soldier, one builder, myself, scavenger, and a scientist) had a kid, and we couldn't take that child on further missions. Left him behind in the 2nd city. We continued on, and when we got the world of the Cultists, my whole population turned. I had no idea how to battle this, and I had even attempt to send the cultists into suicide missions early on. (90% Danger) They lived. Every. Single. Time.If it weren't for this element, this game would be 100% perfect. Been with Rebuild since 2009 (I think) and loved it ever since. Just wish they could add something either in the constitution about religion. Maybe ""freedom of religion with conditions"" or ""Athiest State"". Anything like that.But, other than that feature element where your own populace will kill themselves, it's a great game!			"

												-Start expanding base.-Random event: Go on a date.-Go on a date with survivor.-Random event: Get married.-Get married.-Nothing happens for a while.-Random event: Baby is born.-""Whoohoo! I'm a parent!""-Father gets killed on a mission.10/10 would be a single mother again.But in all seriousness, this game is a blast. If any of you know about the first two Rebuild games (which are free, go try them), and you enjoyed them you'll love this. The game has a cartoon-y style to it, so it isn't as creepy as Rebuild 2. There are so many random events in this game, it keeps the game from ever getting bland. And when you DO eventually get married, you'll find yourself becoming attached to your spouse, and you'll try to put your character and your husband/wife on missions together all the time. Even other survivors can get married, which you'll also try to keep on the same mission at all times. Basically, to win, you must:1.-Choose a building.  -Recruit survivors if there are any.  -Realize you have neither the housing or food supply for them.  -Come back later.    -Get your best builder to make a new farm and an apartment.  -You can now recruit a survivor.  -Kill Zombies in the building.  -Expand your base by assimilating the building once it's clear.2.-Destroy or ally factions.3.-Expand enough, so you can move to the next city.4.-Back to step one.

								Passive-aggresive is the word that best describes this game. It borrows the principles of tower-defense, but the goal is not to outlast the horde. Rather, you have to dig into it and reclaim the territory. The gameplay is fun, elegant and original.Rebuild tries to tell a story too. The stories are well-written and mostly interesting. That is somewhat ruined by the fact that, too often, it assumes that I care about my survivlings on a personal level. I don't. I really don't know who ""Liz Chambel"" is. She came with a bunch of unskilled recruits and she's going to die before the end of the game (I play on higher difficulties). Working her randomized name into a story only serves to confuse me. Maybe if the game's technology allowed me to see her do stuff in the fort then I would notice. But now she's just a portait I move around.I would rather the dev had polished the way events are presented. Right now, the game steals your camera and slides a popup in your face for almost everything. At the height of the game, it happens every few seconds. When playing in fast-forward, you don't have time to even issue commands between popups.			"

												(With no great enthusiasm....)Yeah it's ok. Its an iPhone app on PC. Extremely casual super basic stategy game where you liberate and slightly redevelop a series of towns where the challenge of other factions and zombie hordes grows a little more difficult with each town.It's repetitive but somehow calmly addictive - well, a bit anyway. Minimal survivor community building aspects, graphics you either hate or tolerate, very few resources and items to craft, rudimentary character generation, sketchy storyline - you get the idea, it's not exactly state of the art in-depth open world RPG.....it's an app. Recommend it for a lazy saturday afternoon while you're waiting for your favourite game to be updated...if you can get it on sale.

												WARNING: This game is like Heroin. You will blink and entire days of your life will pass you by, but yet you will want more. Your pets will miss you, your house plants will shrivel and die, and your friends will all forget about you, yet you will continue to move town to town introducing your unique brand of order to a cliched team of Zombie Apocalypse survivors.The game is very fun, and offers a few different strategic tacks (though most will probably trend towards militaristic ends). There's enough options and items to make a lot of different characters uniquely useful, which means you care about them (even if you start skipping through back stories). The time system proves to be both effective for the gameplay, and for making time fly by faster than ""Just One More Turn"" 4x games (which this is basically one of).I highly recommend the game for anyone who wants a fresh take on a somewhat simpler 4x citybuilding game.

Early Access Review
								I've played and replayed Rebuild 2 a dozen times. So glad to have actually found this after a mere google search. It's certainly worth the initial 15$ (Hopefully the upgrade option will stick around) if you enjoy this sort of thing.I still don't really know what has me stick to this 'franchise' as much as it does. From the variancy to the charming characters, this is a welcome expansion on Rebuild 2's systems. While I still play on easy, I found it more difficult to manage happiness this time around. All the more irritating when everyone and their mother were pining over being welcome on the plane I just found but took forever to rebuild.I never took much stock in the endgame scoring systems. I noticed I took a massive point hit for 'taking so long'. But I enjoy this game because I am a careful player. I scout, I wipe out zombies, and I clear the map because I enjoy doing so. Yet I'm penalized for taking my time and making sure my defenses are secure and not getting ransacked by angry factions. Okay then, sure. I'm not looking to be on any scoreboards, just looking to have fun.Regardless, I do imagine this game being very specific to the player. Replayability with this series is at all time high with every save game being fully customizeable from the number of factions you have to deal with, to the size of the city.I recommend playing Rebuild 2 first (If you haven't) and after a couple (Or a few) hours, you find yourself desiring more... Then absolutely drop some dollars on this.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Strategy survival  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a music slidebar available.There is a sound slidebar available.There are mods available.There is color blind mode.You are able to play the game fullscreen or windowed mode.There is no resolution size available however.There is a story mode available.About the game.I strongly recommend to play the first version and the second version of rebuild on newgrounds first before purchasing this one. They are both full versions on there aswell, but ofcourse there is still a difference in this game. Gameplay however is still the same. You have to secure area's, looting resources, recruiting new survivors, holding off zombies and eventually beat the game. Whenever you are in the game you have to rebuild and capture the zones. Turn for turn. You can scavenge, recruit people and even kill zombies. Before you are able to capture a zone, all zombies in that zone has to be killed before claiming it. Each character has a role. This role can be changed and leveled up too. The higher the level. The higher the effectiveness. There is some character customisation available.You can choose their own perk.Different perks available.Level up system.Interesting story.Small mini tutorial and hints.Able to speed up the time.Has random events.Has a happy meter.Pause and unpause button.There is a 5 difficulty levels settings available.Other things.Game is pretty fun and you really should give this a try on newgrounds aswell. Just to get the hang of it.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

Surprisingly Challenging StrategyRebuild 3 is an addictive point and click strategy game that can be played in real time, turn based, or a combination of both, as you can control the speed and change to turn based by playing on pause. You are a survivor of the zombie apocalypse, rebuilding the city around you. This can be in standalone quick play, or in multiple cities as you progress through a storyline in campaign mode, attempting to find a cure and save the world (of course!) You do this by recruiting people and setting them on tasks. Each person has different skills and perks, and the tasks involve expanding your territory whilst ensuring that you are well defended, have food, building supplies and that your populace is happy (harder than it sounds especially with a larger group to manage). On Easy, there is very little you can do wrong, but you can set the difficulty level up and on hard, it's very difficult indeed. Every single move you make you'll need to look at all the angles. As your city expands, you have more people to manage, and more threats to come in, from zombie attacks, as well as multiple factions. You'll need to decide whether to go for diplomacy or fight; and you then need to manage your political manifest that will affect your populace city-wide.  There's also a skill tree that you research at, a workshop with some crafting items, and a variety of buildings you can choose to build with their own advantages.You'll get random events that pop up, ranging from the predictable to the very odd, with some tongue-in-cheek silly humour, quirkiness, and also some quite touching backstories to the characters. Your citizens will periodically want to chat to you about their past, which unlocks perks for them, as well as random events with them, where the decisions you make will have permanent affects. On the surface it seems like a fairly shallow amount of moves you can make each turn, but at higher difficulty levels, as your city progresses, the amount of strategy is actually quite complex. It's shockingly easy to make a mistake on the hardest difficulty setting that will send you into a spiral of doom and gloom. Citizens rioting, Z hordes amassing and factions baying for your blood. Send help, please! However; the one major downside it has is that it is reptitive. Playing through the campaign offers multiple cities, and gameplay in each city starts out the same, although there are different objectives. Because of this the first part of every city felt like I was simply doing stuff I'd done before to expand my base and set the city up. It only becomes more exciting once the random events start rolling in and since these are pooled from a set of scripted events you will eventually experience them all, and some of them seem to occur quite frequently. Once you've completed the campaign, you can always play it again on a harder difficulty, or play random maps through the quickplay function, but I can definitely see this getting a bit samey and monotonous.Value is obviously entirely subjective and if you're not sure if this game is worth whatever the current asking price is - simpler javascript versions of Rebuild 1 and Rebuild 2 are available on Kongregate.com. Rebuild 3 has considerable more depth and a full length campaign, but if you just want to try the gameplay out and get a feel for the game, head over to Kongregate and try out the previous completely free iterations first so you can experience the style. A definite recommendation for me - an addictive game that offers a ton of strategy and challenge beneath the surface. "

It's an incredibly simple game but yet... I find it's the first thing I want to do when I get home, boot it up and watch as my characters spread out and rebuild their little city.The little mini stories, the character development, the background story, all just makes for a strangely enjoyable game that has sucked up more of my time in the past few days than Civ6 has.

												If you're a fan of the first and second, the third is something you'll probably enjoy. If not, then I strongly recommend that you play them online (they're free! -- just search up ""rebuild"" and ""rebuild 2"" game on kongregate) and see if this is something you want to sink your teeth into.In all honesty, I didn't like it in my first impression. It was confusing and it was different (though still similar) to the style of the previous games, but then I quickly liked it after playing the game for half an hour and familiarized myself with what you're supposed to do. I like the cartoon-y style, the higher customzation, story, features and changes to the game. However, please keep note that this game is still in early access, there are bugs, the game isn't fully complete yet, so I advise you to buy this game only if you are certain, or if you enjoy strategic simulation games or have a fair understanding of the games past background.But, I do enjoy it, I can see myself playing it as much as I did in the other games. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a fun game with a high replaybility value which is something I really needed in my library.			"

												Rebuild 3 is an entertaining game but ultimately shows its Flash/mobile heritage with a lack of depth. It gets a 7 out of 10 from me.The premise is simple - you're one of the survivors after the zombie apocalypse and you go from town to town, creating a safe zone in any given city. The game has some complexity to it - there are 5 different skills (combat, scouting, engineering, building and leadership) but NPCs can only have one of these. Their skill improves the more they use it. You, however, can use all the skills and you'll slowly build up where you want your character to focus. There's equipment, from simple guns to swords to hammers to walkie-talkies, and you can assign this equipment to your survivors to make them more effective. In any given city, you start off with a very small territory and you slowly claim other buildings and recruit survivors. You'll meet other factions - none of whom are all that interesting - and you'll constantly balance all the needs of your colony. When you need to pull back, where you should expand, how you should react to certain situations...it's all up to you, grand leader.And it's fun, frankly for longer than it probably should be. You'll probably have a good time expanding your base, launching attacks into zombie hordes, keeping your fingers crossed as they storm the barricades, etc. The sound and cartoony visuals work pretty well here and the whole package feels fairly complete. It's a good game design that will keep you enterained and that's why it's getting the thumbs up.However, this is a 7/10 game for a few reasons.(1) A couple of the early scenarios throw in a few curve balls. They're interesting and it really helps the game. Except less than halfway through the game has run out of tricks and every single scenario is pretty much the same thing. Thus the approach, the tactics and the game become exceptionally formulaic and you'll probably sleepwalk through pretty much the last half of the scenarios (until perhaps the last one, which has a new curveball). I had to stop playing multiple times due to falling asleep at the keyboard due to boredom because the game had nothing new to offer.(2) The story, sparse to begin with, is basically hidden. To succeed you'll have to look up the Wiki and follow the step-by-step instructions. The game itself does an exceptionally poor job - actually, it doesn't do the job at all - of leading you towards a victory. It's a really poor oversight and if you're not reading the Wiki the only way you'd stumble towards any kind of positive ending would be 100% due to blind luck. There were plot threads that never, ever happened during my time in the game and thus any chance of a positive ending was denied due to bugs, RNG or whatever was supposed to trigger an event and didn't. That's just exceptionally poor execution by the dev - don't hide your plot or the threads that lead to a good or bad ending and expect people will just do the play-by-play from a Wiki because you can't be bothered to code it.(3) It's not that challenging. I started the first map on Easy to get the hang of it. The next one was Normal. The next one was Hard (and the achievement never triggered). You get the point. And with the exception of one early scenario I was never put back on my heels or afraid for my colony. I used the same gang tactics over and over again. Have one builder. Make your own character a combination of a scout/leader/soldier. Build up an engineer. Make almost everyone else a defender. Wash, rinse and repeat. That's the game, folks. I played the game all the way through but frankly the last 1/3rd of it was me forcing myself to get to the last city (Vancouver). But given what I paid (on sale) and the time I got out of it, I figure it was money well spent.			"

Early Access Review
								It would be dishonest of me to refuse to recomend this game just because I have some gripes about how it compares to the previous Rebuild game, because in all honesty, bias aside, this game is still pretty great aside from being unfinished.If you have not played Rebuild: 2, I suggest you do so. The flash version can be found all over the web for free and I believe the full version of Rebuild 2 is playable on steam through a package offer with the third one. If not, I apologize for constantly referencing this game.Usually, I would start my review with an explanation on what the game is. However I honestly want to get my issues with it off of my chest first.My main gripe about this game is how far it strays from the second version. On pen and paper, it seems like the second game with obvious improvements, however that is just not the case. The general art and atmosphere in the game is different. The pace of the game is different, for sure. The turn-based timing is gone and a continuous real-time thing is introduced. Sure, turn-based is an option that you can put it back to in the settings, but you can obviously tell how much the game doesn't encourage it as it messes with the values of things in the game in order to work. I personally would have rathered the developers that the ""3"" out of the title and just make it Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville.My secondary gripe is simply the fact that there is a lot of cosmetic and flow issues that the game has. And not to mention, these flaws were in the previous game as well. For starters, there is almost no coordination with how characters are designed and how the city is laid out. You can have 5 farms side by side in the smack middle of the city and seemingly bipolar generation of basic infrastructure. And with characters, the character may sport a police uniform and vest, but his backstory will say how he was a hick pig farmer that despised the urban setting. Oh, and for frankly a lack of reason the game will set his job as ""engineer"". You can get all kinds of wacky combinations. With everything. Have you seen a city laid out with five police stations within the same small section of the city? Well, you are probably about to.My third gripe, is how the game does not seem to care about the second gripe. It just doesn't matter or affect the game at all that there is a lack of organization for anything. The backstories seem randomly assigned with little influence, and combined with the fact that the game makes you choose how their character's trait list develops AFTER you develop their skills and equipment is annoying. (Oh, you didn't have your backstory unlocked yet, so I decided that you will become a fighter, and have this assault rifle to take with. Oh wait, you want to become a pacifist who refuses to use weapons and would rather handle negotiations with other enclaves? Too late.)Honestly, this game is great and was hard to put down. But asthetically the game is a rough block of wood that is yet to be shaped and sanded. The fact that the majority of the characters wear some kind of biker leather is annoying as well, as the spikes that they have are just simply not smart and overly cartoonish.Other than all of those things, the game is simply a must have. Although if I was told to recomend a defense game with concentration on development as apposed to combat, I would still tell people to play Rebuild 2. "

												As a long-time fan of the Rebuild series, I was pretty excited to have contributed $20 to the kickstarter page back in late 2013. I felt like I was truly helping with fun developers make something new and improved in a series they've been using as a juggernaut.However, perhaps I overestimated how in-depth the game would be. As a few other people have mentioned, the gameplay becomes extremely repetitive once you play through at least 3 or 4 cities. It's still fun to play, and at least a decent way to think about how you use resources, but outside of the plot, there's not much else to it.Earlier, I mentioned I put $20 to the kickstarter. According to the kickstarter page, I would have access to the alpha (which I did) and later the Deluxe Edition when the game finally came out. I've received no notification to this day of such a thing, meaning I essentially paid $5 more for the final product than the average player. Doing some research, I found others experienced this problem and tried inquiring, only to get handwaved away. In short, I find that's a bit of a backhanded move on the devs' parts. Whether they deliberately held back on their end or simply bungled the situation, it really makes it difficult to want to put faith in any future titles they put out.And speaking of the price, $15 is a bit steep for a game that has a total of maybe 20 hours outside of free-play mode. I get that you need to put food on the table and make sure to have enough for travelling, but the simple fact of the matter is at $15, it's not worth it.Sorry, Ms. Northway, but I'm gonna have to give a Thumbs-Down for this. :\ The quality of the game and the price you're demanding for it could be overlooked if you had at least delivered for the kickstarters.

												You might be scared because this game is part of a series that you probably never heard of, and it looks and feels like a mobile game ported to pc. But that's not fair, because it's actually surprisingly a good pc game. The gamestyle is casual, but has just enough RPG elements to make it interesting while not overburdening with complexity. Rebuild3 is centered around managing a gang of survivors within a city. You control their equipment and assign them to missions. Each has five skills (combat, building, scavenging, leadership and engineering). Each member has an specific skill they are good at and can improve with the corresponding related mission. For example, you send fighters to attack zombies or builders to claim an empty buildings. Adding additional crew to a mission improves the rate of success. Over time, crew assigned to missions together may become friends or enemies (influencing happiness).Throughout the game, you are presented with decisions how to lead people (e.g. help strangers vs being cautious). Once you succeed in a city, you learn a little more of the story and move on to the next city, leaving behind most of your gang. There are different endings based on your decisions.Cons:There are too many cities and the campaign takes too long time to complete.Wish it had a higher difficulty setting (impossible is very possible).Overall, I would recommend Rebuild 3 if you want to play something slightly casual or if you like management sims. If you prefer action, this game is probably not for you.  "

Early Access Review
								Rebuild is back! I was playing Rebuild II again a couple days back when I realised Rebuild III was out. I bought it the very same day. I have to admit the game seems a tad harder than previous installments, love the added functionality though. I decided to start a new city, with a couple of my home boys. We were doing well, expanding to twice our size and the zombies came. We pushed them back easily, with the 2 new lads from the nearby apartment. I decided to send a group of these young punks to clear out the zombies and ya know gain some much needed experience in zombie killing. Well, one of them screwed up real bad and got lost in the mall, we never heard of him again. Then my 2IC went and got himself bitten, I thought, ""hey, he should be big enough to know what to do"", and left him be. He became a zombie the next day, injuring the builder midway through his rampage and we had to put him down. Then a couple days later, a young man came along, and asked to join us if we could feed him. I acceded to his request and decided to send him a couple blocks down to bring some more survivors in. He brought no one back, and managed to get killed in the process. I realise things were pretty dire, considering that we had 3 men guarding 8 blocks of our territory, We couldn't keep the zombies out, and now our territory looks like a jigsaw puzzle. Oh wait did I mention that the boys get hospitalised for depression? It's Day 102 in Farmsville, we are going to take our own lives. To anyone out there, zombies are just one of you many worries in a post-apocalyptic world.			"

Early Access Review
Components+ The graphics of Rebuild 3 is amazing and I love how it is given a comical rather than realistic look, it is quite a change from its predecessors but it was a good move. There were a lot of additions in the new rebuild, the idea is old but what they have done with it is remarkable. They didn’t just make the game prettier, but more customizable and more of a story.+ The story of Rebuild is rather simple; zombie apocalypse, rebuild humanity, the end. But it is what you do to rebuild the city, your friends will die along the way, you will meet enemies or allies, an occasional visitor at your base, which might waste away your food, medicine or ammunition. They constantly give you circumstances which make you question yourself, ‘who should do the job?’ or ‘should you do it at all?’ Even the characters are given stories that you can choose which affect their specialties.+ There are a lot more things to do in the new rebuild, if you are near the coast, go fishing instead of farming, or if you have a plain, do some steady hunting. With more variety, you treat things differently.- The sound doesn’t need to be criticized, as this is a strategic game where music isn’t a big part; personally I play with the music off, as it is slightly distracting. But the sound effects sound great, the zombies sound proper but the game does lack sound, because the game is rather quiet and the music it provides feels out of place. I do not know how to recommend an improvement but maybe just add something to hear.+ Gameplay is quite smooth but you have to consider so many things the deeper you get through the game, because you have to face so many things and you have to choose the right people, or probably you have so many citizens but keep forgetting to use them. If you want a fast paced strategy game, this game isn’t for you, as it requires some thought. You can change the pace of the game, but when you set to the slowest speed for the game, the game feels so dull.OverallSince the game is in early access, and I am a fan of the Rebuild Series and have played it so many times on Kongregate, I think they are making well progress with the game and I expect great things to come with it, although I feel that there shouldn’t be a deluxe edition personally, because you don’t really receive much from it.And since it is still being improved, there are a few suggestions that I have been wanting for Rebuild since the second instalment, multiplayer mode. Much like Civilization, I want to see two random players go head-to-head as who can win and be the leader of the city, because a single gamemode can be rather dull. Also I think the title needs some work, “Gangs of Deadsville”…I think the developers can do better than that. I don’t know what else can be added but if they continuously add great content, I feel this game would be an amazing standalone game well worth the price. I strongly recommend following and possibly getting this game, even at early access if you love strategy games, zombies, and the rebuild series.			"

								Excellent sequel already very entertaining at this stage of the alpha. The core gameplay is still as addicting as ever, and has a very strategic board game feel. Each map is different, a new puzzle that you need to break down. Resource and personnel management is a satisfying push and pull. If the dev continues fleshing out all these interesting bits coming soon like factions and government, there's some real potential here for a great game.Check out my gameplay video here for a more in depth look:

Now for the review part;PROS-Amazing art-Hours of fun-Different stratigies -Characters are randomly generated (they're not the same)CONS-Gustav appears in each city, but doen't remeber the main character?? At least make different traders...-Some factions appear in diffrent cities, and also don't remeber you, which i find is kinda stupid, there should be at least be a bit of a boost or decrease in respect depending on your (the players) past decision of allying them or attacking them...Overall, this game is amazing and I love it, i recommend it to everyone that likes zombie survival and turn based games, like myself.

												A series that takes an inventive twist on the zombie apocalypse setting, Rebuild takes the ""man versus man versus nature"" struggle present in most games pertaining to zombies and reframes the gameplay from the more common action/shooter elements and turns it into a 4X game of conquest. The world of Rebuild is one in which the survivors are all fairly competent people. Nobody here is an idiot that is going to stand there and quiver in fear while the zombies take a bite out of their neck. The primary struggle is maintaining the flow of your resources and zombies are only really a threat when you spread your people thin. Fortunately the game manages to balance this well so that you're generally never too comfortable that you don't have to worry. Each map tends to follow the same flow of scrambling your survivors frantically so you can find food to eat that night to having a slight bit of breathing room so that you can begin to, as the title suggests, Rebuild and then challenge the AI factions present. Zombies ramp up their difficulty as time goes on as well. There are a few strategies that generally guarantee victory as long as you execute them well but I'll leave you to figure out what those are. It has clever nooks and crannies and like any other good 4X you've played it'll keep you up all night as you have multiple goals planned out at once, one of which can always be achieved in Just One More Turn. The ebb and flow guarantees that you've always got something to do.One of the primary strengths of the game that makes it special both as 4X strategy games as well as a zombie apocalypse title is the writing. Most 4X games don't have too much in the way of writing. Units tend to be completely disposable, your faction usually has no personality whatsoever except for what exists in your headcanon and the game itself tends to feel very sterile. While I wouldn't call Rebuild 3 the peak of 4X writing it still has gone further than I've seen most games do with the genre and I welcome the day that this sort of thing is standard fare. Every survivor has a backstory, personality traits and an appearance and appearance based on randomly generation of a pool of clothing, body types and faces that are mixed and matched and unlike something like XCOM you cannot remake them in your image nor can you just buy more of them. Survivors are hard to come across, hard to train and you tend to become attached to them, especially as character events occur, such as somebody having their crowbar stolen and going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the rest of the fort until they find it. The loss of survivors, whether to zombies, enemy factions accident or because they lost hope and hit the road or took the easy way out is felt more than any cheap disposable unit in a 4X title like Civilization. While its somewhat more limited than it could've been there are a lot of fort policies that decide what kind of place it is to live. It could be a military dictatorship, socialist theocracy, a prosperous merchant republic among other configurations. While they all have their pros and cons in regards to pure gameplay and they're not perfectly balanced (some exist more as a handicap for unexperienced players than end-game strategy) they're all seen as viable within the writing. Furthermore the game has quite a personality that can be found in its writing. While it can get politicized it generally tries to present them with a sense of neutrality and recognize that even viewpoints you disagree with would have some legitimacy to them. On top of all of this all the game has a campaign that can be best described as a map rush, where you play map after map with some random generation and story events unfolding. The story writing isn't revolutionary but it ties everything together in a satisfying way and there's enough ways for things to play out that your choices feel meaningful. There's even some stuff you wouldn't find on a second or even third playthrough. You even get to roleplay your main survivor throughout the campaign, possibly even build a family and bring them along with you on the road to the next destination.The game's interface is clearly geared towards gameplay on a touch screen. There aren't any hotkeys or mappable commands, one of the most glaring issues with the game. Scrolling all the time with a mouse can be a real pain too. Its playable on PC but if you use an iOS platform routinely I recommend you check out one of those platforms instead. The game's controls and mechanics in general aren't too complicated but in a way thats a major benefit to it. This is the rare sort of strategy game where you don't have to constantly juggle dozens of things at once even on the hardest difficulty settings. You still have to think but you don't stress out over things, making this a rare strategy game where the player can sit back and relax while playing if they so choose. Playing on the PC doesn't have to take up your whole system either. The game has no voice acting and the sound effects are minimal. The soundtrack is decent enough and helps set the mood but its just not large enough to avoid repitition, even while on the same map. As a result this is a game that you can play while you listen to music or a podcast. The game's window can be changed in a great number of ways as well and the game will stretch to compensate so you can even watch a Youtube video while playing. The game's visuals, which is colourful, handdrawn art, doesn't get muddied or compressed when you stretch the window either so the game looks nice at any size.Rebuild 3 is not perfect. I've played enough that I know the game inside out and know a lot of its flaws. Most of them couldn't be fixed without massive, financially untenable changes. Unfortunately Northway Games is a small operation and the concept doesn't quite reach what it could if it had more at its fingertips. That said, its still a very enjoyable game that has carved out its own niche in both the 4X strategy genre and the zombie apocalypse aesthetic that serves it well and manages to keep a lot of the positives of both of those. It is as addictive as Civilization, arguably even moreso because it doesn't use ""turns"" in a traditional sense, its writing has moments of laughter as well as points that are poignant and the game brings something entirely fresh to the table in gaming. In a day with so many indie games that are love letters to something from the developer's youth and takes the basic blueprint and makes some tweaks this feels new and inspired, hopefully something that the industry takes notice of learns lessons from. The game is worth the $15, unquestionably, and if you're hesitant despite the reccomendation there's no shame in waiting for a Steam sale.			"

												After playing the first two games on Kongregate, I was really annoyed the third game you'd have to pay for. Happily someone brought me this for Christmas and it's good. Better than the first two games combined. It can get a little predictable to the point where you know what will happen depending what option you choose, and the game doesn't seem that long in my opinion. I don't reccommend that you pay full price for this game though, wait for a sale. If you're not sure if this is worth buying, play the first two games. If you enjoy them, you will enjoy this.			"

								I have played the flash games and liked them a lot for a good variety of depth and complexity. Which is why I bought thisNow, the game is still in Early access, this still has some bumps, edges and corners, such as placeholder images for some resources in menus (still, they are kinda cute)and this is where I want to start, this game adds a new layer of depth - Resources. While in the flash games you only had to wach happiness and Food here youll have to watch Ammo , Medicine and fuel. Used in Defense events and for crafting useables. as well as Materials, which you need to build building, build add-ons and reclaim new areas.While base resources can be crafted with the right know-how, you'll still have to scarvenge for them.Next change - where in the old games Materials not scarvenged were lost after reclaiming you can safely scarvenge reclaimed areas.And the next big change, which adds a lot more planning to the game - There are other cites in the making. Fractions that will either be happy to see you and to trade with you or they could hate you with a burning intensity and want to see your society destroyed.There is still some work to do, but it is already playable, and WELL playable. A definite Simulation must-play			"

												It's a pretty decent game. But it's primary drawback is that there's no level between ""face roll easy"" and ""why the hell can I not kill even a single zombie! come on!""But basically: It's a slight expansion upon the Rebuild series found on most online game websites. If you liked those, and wanted more (which is what I did), it will scratch that itch. Taken objectively, there's nothing particularly special about it. It does what it does decently well, but there's absolutely nothing that's impressive, even if you are just looking for another Rebuild title. You kill zombies. You slowly push out and expand your borders. Rinse repeat. Then you find factions. And kill them or act as their lacky, and win the game.			"

												Like Rebuild 1 and 2? You'll like this. It's the same game, same developer, now with a story mode, new features and a better interface. Children, trade, diplomacy, research, missions and relationships are all added. Charming artwork, simple interface, and well written. It works well.Rebuild's basic attraction is to take the survival genre and merge it with city management. It's a juggling match between getting enough food, expanding your city, and keeping it defended. At times it becomes malthusian as you must send people on riskier and riskier missions just to stay alive. Sometimes you have to make some really hard choices.While the mid-game can turn into a grind, stick around for the ending! The final mission is one of the most imaginative I've seen in a game.			"

								This is a great game. I can not wait to see it when it is finally finished. As for my review I am just gonna put a list of suggestions to the game and problems I have had.1) I believe I was on typical size map had almost everything conquered working on the 2 factions and all of a sudden pop up comes that says i ran out of memory and had to restart.2) I'm sure you guys probably working on this, but would like to see better things in equip mode. Binoculars are not a dog :P3)Fix the save and auto-save features. Tried keeping a save game going while starting a new except the new one auto-saves over the old one automatically.4)Unless I havent found a use for it maybe make the radio station do something..I would like to see actually some of these buildings get like missions you can do to help you or something around those lines5) I am not sure cause havent seen it happened, but maybe even have factions dislike each other/attack each other.6)I seen a subway but couldnt reclaim it was an opening to a faction?! This intrigues me.			"

								The game is good. It will be better when it is completed. Though more cartoony than the last game, it still can carry the a serious tone. The addition of Factions make this game amazing. Instead of just worrying about the zombies of the area, you have to worry if you can handle the faction that you are next to.  The fact that each facion has these quirks, like the Luddites trading you mannuer for medicine or the Government claiming one of your guns as their own, just gives them this personality that is really cool. I will admit that there are some bugs but this is an EARLY ACCESS. I would be amazed if it didn't. If you don't want to suffer through the proccess of watching the game grow and develop, than get it when it is realised. If you want to be part of an ever growing community where your oppinion is heard, then get it now. Thanks to anyone reading this comment.

I definitely reccomend this game, especially if you're one for turn based strategy, city building or zombie games in general. The art direction and character building is simple but still gives an amazing and unique feel to this game making it one of a kind. Although it's obvious that there are some incomplete features in this version at this time, there haven't been too many bugs that I've seen while I've played this game. After all of that, including the different factions and the way you can affect your enviorment around you based on the way you play, I definitely recomend you buy this game!			"

								From small two flash games offering huge amount of fun into full indie game giving even more. At first I wasn't sure if Rebuild can still grow into a bigger game but when it came to KickStarter and didn't hesitate any minute. And the result is more then I was hoping for. In Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville you are a leader of a surviving group of people in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Trying to forge them into a growing community you give each of the member tasks to scavenge, build, guard, fight, research and much more. The game offers more content than it looks.

While each member of your group can [and will] increase there skills in vairous areas, the are normally focused on a core skillset.Skill Focus of your people breakdown as follows:Soldier [bonus to combat]Builder [allows you to more quickly reclaim territory in the city]Scavenger [faster at and 'better' are recovering food, items and so on]Politician [faster success rates at recruting new people, better options when dealing with local trades people]The Objective?To reclaim the number of listed territory requirements [based on map size] to trigger events to allow your people to leave / secure the city and 'win' the game.This is a fun game you can sit down, play for 30 minutes and come back to a few weeks later to pick right back up where you left off. I like that this is more on the casual end of the scale, most 'zombie survival' games are a bit too dark and this game has a lighter, airy feel to it.If you enjoyed the game Rebuild (on the mobile platform) you are likely to feel at home here, with enough new elements to make the game challenging and fresh. A serious setting without taking itself too seriously. The interface is simple and effective. The artwork for the game trends towards the cartoony side, which in this case looks good and serves the game well.Here is a more in-depth look at the game here on my YouTube Channel:

Early Access Review
								With the new updates of the early access I must say I'm greatly impressed with the art work and new style for both genders.There's so many new events that can take place in the game, It's really exciting!I've played the first game and second countless times and enjoyed it through and through, I'm really excited for some of the upcoming features and how the game will progressivly get more challenging as it goes on.Although it's really fantastic and I want to be on the hype wagon all the way, I'm kind of cross with a few things.  And they may just be my opinion considering it's still in an early stage..I'll just keep my mouth shut, we all know opinions can be extremely dangerous on the internet ^-^Overall I highly recommend this game for people who love to rack their brains out hours on end coming up with strategies and keeping their survivors safe as can be!

												Been playing this game for a while, really enjoyed it but this game sure need some improvement imo:- no story mission, every city you only have one mission which is ally or eliminate other faction. Other than that there is no other campaign mission. Though there's some kind of other side quest (electricity, water, etc), overall there's only one mission and it gets boring after couple of city;- factions won't carry relationship status, let's say I eliminate certain faction during the campaign, then when I reach a new city and that faction is already in the city, the should carry that relationship status over to the new city.

												The game is only mediocre, after playing it for about 4 hours I feel like I did all I could do, build all there is to build and researched all there is to research. Now the game leaves me with endless micro managing every single NPC while spamming me with more and more zombies. Those are sadly 0 challenge at that stage, just gotta do it. And yes, that is it, the character development of each individual NPC is just tedious, the diplomacy not challenging at all and thanks to an abundance of resources I can also have everything I want.Got it for 8 EUR, for that price it wasn't a total loss, killed some hours and since voting ""meh"" isnt an option I can only NOT recommend this game.

												Like others, I first played Rebuild and Rebuild 2. I completely missed the memo that there was a 3 on Steam until the Winter sell happened. Oh boy did I get my immediate moneys worth. I'll start with the things I am not impressed with. The music. It's just not that fantastic in my opinion. I muted it and played my own music, which might have helped to increase the overall experience for me. I played this game in two four hour sittings already and I can say my own music helped immerse me far more than the games soundtrack.Now for the good.If you ever played Rebuild 1 or 2, you can say good bye to the 'normal' flash graphics and welcome the same style, but more refined. The controls are super simple, and the ease of use between the GUI and the map is fantastic. I can quickly and simply execute any command I want without to much hassle. The only hiccup would be with quickly checking my survivors happiness. This minor annoyance is saved due to the fact all the menus open and close instantly, so I don't feel like I am bogged down waiting for things to load or transition.The gameplay for the uninvolved is easy. You have 5 trades. Builder, Scavanger, Guard, Engineer and Leader. They all can do each others jobs, but whatever role they specialize in will yield faster and better results. You want your builders to improve buildings, reclaim territory, hunt or chop wood. You want Scavengers to scout, collect goods and farm. Guards to protect your settlement from hoards or mobs, or to clear zombie nests faster. Engineers to do your research or fix key buildings on the map. Leaders for trade, recruitment and negotiations.You start with 5 'squares'. Your goal is to reclaim more squares to build up your settlement. You'll find survivors, supplies, zombies, and other factions along the way. Each square has a property to it that helps you in some way, or at least has some flavor to (like a movie theater. It serves no purpose, but you can rebuild it to be a farm or church). The balancing act is deciding what to reclaim first. What to rebuild. Who to assign to what. What items during your hunts do you equip to who?One of the main driving factors of the game (besides the zombies) is the random events. You'll get prompts. Ranging from 2 or more options. Depending on the action, or skill of your character affected. You may get only 1 due to unfortunate events, or 5 with a great chance of rewards. Do you give food to that random stranger who showed up at your gates and let them stay the night? Will the rob you? Give you a chainsaw? Join your struggling community? Let the zed in? The game can be as fast or as slow as you want it. The default speed makes the time bo by 15 minutes. I play an hour a second for my speed and I enjoy how fast paced the game can be when your settlment grows large. Of course you can pause at any time during your micromanagment. You can play at any pace you desire and should find enjoyment all the same.If I were to really get you to take a chance with this game, then I feel you would havve made the right choice. Even if you waste 3 hours of fun with it before you give it up, I believe your money would be well spent. The personal stories of your survivors (new to the series) helps give it more life. The story mode is fun, if not rather normal for this genre. Customization is not stellar, but satisfying. Here. Consider this your free demo for the game. Rebuild 2. If you enjoy it, just imagine it with more options and fluditiy!http://www.kongregate.com/games/sarahnorthway/rebuild-2 "

								I loved the first and second Rebuild and this one is no different. It has strategy with you also managing human lives. You become attached to the characters and this one makes it even better with personality traits, backstories, and personal pop ups for the characters. The only thing that I think isn't as good is the graphics. I loved the grittiness of the 2nd one and in this the graphics are pretty cartoony. It is the direction that the developer wanted to go in but I loved the look of Rebuild 2 and the great creepy sound track.			"

												It gets reppettetive pretty quickly, and it doesn't seem like the challenges becomes bigger, just longer. There's a lot of obvious, but small, ways they could have added variation but which could make each level very different. The leveling system could also use some tweaks.The game has a solid gameplay, and the story might even be interesting, but it feels like it was the bare minimum was added, so I can't recommend it.

												Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville went awry and while I've played the 1rst and 2nd which were free flash games multiple times just several playthrough of campaigns in this game made me dispise it. the art style is wierd, the factions system doesn't add anything to the game and the endings are literally acheived in just the same way as 1 and 2. it tries to change the game up by adding more but by doing so only manages to create shoes that it just can't possibly fill by showing the lack of depth in the new content			"

												I've played this for a little while now, along with the other 2 that were online. I can say with strong confidence that this was money well spent. This has more of a story than the other two had, and a lot more choices that make you think ""Hmm.. What are the actual consequences of my actions?"" It has a silly style that really works well with the gruesome themes that you see throughout the 3 games.Even though I think there should be more choices/policies, and actual devestating/drastic alterations that should come from these choices, it is a pretty decent game overall, and I have tons of fun playing it.-IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE OTHER TWO AND AREN'T SURE IT WILL BE THE SAME GAME YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH-It is, it really does stick to the same concepts that the other games had, but with even more features. Tons of things are different, but it all has the same basic mechanics that need your attention constantly. They also have a better save system and menu, which would be obvious since this is a steam game and not a typical online game.			"

												I have followed this game for some time during its early development stage and I think the final product is very fun and entertaining. Parts of the game that I really enjoy are: character creation, character management, character releationships and going to war with other factions trying to survive the zombie apocolypse. Some reviewers have claimed that they think the graphics would be a better fit on a phone or tablet; that is their opinion but not mine I think the art is does an excellent job of flushing out the characters and the deadly world they struggle to overcome. Overall I think this game is a great deal at the asking price.			"

Early Access Review
								A fun little strategy/simulation zombie survival game that has just enough flavor to hold your interest.Pros- Lost of fun events to keep the story colorful while you're trying to rebuild civilization- Randomly generated maps mean you'll never play the same game twice- Lots of cool survivor skill combination that can appear in your city- Tons of fun weapons and items that can be scavenged or traded for to equip your survivors with- Four characters can travel from city to city keeping your most powerful survivors alive- Random survivors can get married, have kids, and participate in tons of random events that can lead to profit or disaster- The skill system along with the background benefits can lead to strange min-maxed charactersCons- There aren't a lot of strong gameplay factors in this game, it's more about simulating the experience- Movement is instant, so there's not much strategy in positioning survivors who aren't actually engaged in attack or defense (at least when it comes to combat)- Fighting other human factions is dull at best and flat out boring at worst.  The human enemies aren't much different from the zombies, and fighting them seems easy but pointless (It's much easier to befriend them than to slowly but surely take all their land)- The game is won or lost in the first few weeks.  Once you have enough survivors and secured land, it's fairly impossible to lose as long as you keep defending, researching, trading, and upgrading  (All things that are very easy to do, regardless of difficulty)- The other factions are fairly uninspired, they don't do much other than trade with you and slowly expand- Interesting ideas and good simulation elements, but the overall gameplay is sometimes uninspired and even boring.Overall:I have a lot of complaints about this game, mostly because I see a lot of potential untapped in this formula.  I would recommend the game to anyone who likes simulation type games and RPG/Strategy elements.  If simulation-type games bore you and you're more into action, this may not be the game for you.Update:  So I played again after the release, and I am impressed with the final product.  Fighting human factions has increased in difficulty and does have a bit of a unique feel to it.  There's also been a lot of cool artwork added and many more options for character customization.  The game is still won or lost in the first few weeks and the instant-movement still leads to a bit of uninspiring gameplay.  Still, the final product is good and those who are fans of zombie/simulation games will have fun with this one.  Just be warned, the actual gameplay leaves a bit to be desired, but the simulation aspects are very well done.			"

								Like most of Romero's work or Shaun of the dead, the best zombi flicks have something to say about people and society. While some games try to forcefeed u the rotten bananas of their misanthropic and self absorbed obsessions with human cruelty and inherent violence(and I would include here the Walking Dead series, though it lacks a force feeding mechanic from what i know), Rebuild takes a more honest and optimystic aproach, thus making for a genuinly involved and immersive experience. U can actually care about the characters in a game when their not all necessarely, u know, psychopatic maniacs that respond to crises by stabbing, betraying and generally trying to make the same boring point of the dev that humanity is crap.  This is definitely the best game in the series, it already has the most content and I would have bought it as a final release in its current state - without the place holder arts it is already more playable than many other finished releases ; the text is nice and sometimes actually funny without seeming like its trying too hard; there s lods to do and the pace is beautifull;  u can literally learn to play it in 2 min but winning is quite tricky, all from a trust worthy dev and more is coming ?! c'mon..10/10  would adopt bunnies again			"

								I loved the series since Sarah Northway released Rebuld 1 and this is by far the best in the series. The factions idea is terriffic, though it has some bad things in it. For example, if the player's strength is much stronger than the AI, they should accept an alliance without requesting materials. However, no matter what, you must give materials for an alliance.

								Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville is a superb game. Combining both zombie survival and strategy, the player is put in charge of a small group of people who have fenced off a small part of a city, and must make their way to reclaiming it from the zombies. A great upgrade from the old flash games too, there are many new features that will help the player dive into the world, and try to protect their people. Whether you play as a kind person who will live harmoniously with the other factions, or a power hungry person who won't share with anyone, Rebuild will cater to your playstyle, and meet you with new challenges along the way. I definitely recommend this game for everyone, but definitely to those who love a good strategy based game.			"

I commend Ms. Northway on her outstanding achievement in taking one of my favorite games and turning into not just a better version, but a better experience with many more layers of depth and discovery.

												A fun game, though some elements, such as research and random events, can get a bit repetitive as the campaign wears on.  Everything is handled from a leader perspective - equip your people, choose who and how many to send, wait and see what happens.  If you're looking for detailed tactical combat, this isn't the game for you.There are entertaining comical possibilities such as giving your soldier Rambo Jones ( yes you can rename your citizens ) a pomeranian to snuggle with on his down time.Engaging without overly taxing your brain, well worth the money- especially if you can pick it up on sale.

												The Rebuild series is a very good series. The first two games can be played for free, as they were browser games, but you can buy them on Steam in the deluxe edition of Rebuild 3. Rebuild 3 is a zombie game where you are the leader and you have to rebuild a city that has been overrun by zombies. The third Rebuild game is very different from the first two, a lot has improved in it. The game is generally good though for a few reasons: It's backstory/story, the characters, and the gameplay. Although it does have flaws.The game has a story that you were bitten by a zombie and are immune, you then go and try and rebuild a number of cities. Your aim is to discover the origins of the virus, cure it and rebuild civilization. There is quite a lot of reading involved in the game, but it sometimes repeats, so reading everything isn't essential, generally you don't need to read anything that doesn't relate to the storyline, unless you want more immersion. The story is not exceptionally unique (DISCLAIMER: I haven't gotten all endings), but it has it's moments and can be quite intense. Each NPC has a backstory, there are a limited number of backstories, so not every character has a unique one, which comprises of a few pages worth of writing. The backstories even include characters who are transgender, intersex, and gay. Your character doesn't have a backstory presented like this, so your character's backstory is unique. The game allows your character to date and marry what ever gender you want, and allows the NPCs to randomly marry other people as well.The gameplay in Rebuild 3 can be played in a few different ways. You can play turn based, or in real time, depending on how you want to, you can also pause at any time you want, so there is no stress to do everything quickly. And if the game is too slow, you can speed up the time. The game involves looking for more people in zombie ridden buildings, scavenging for food and materials in buildings, killing all the zombies in the buildings, and reclaiming the building. The game is played from a bird's eye view. You have to maintain the food you have and the happiness of the fort, which can be quite a challenge. The gameplay can be quite difficult, and takes a bit of time to be able to get to a good point where your fort is stable.Although this game is quite a lot of fun, it does have some problems. The game can go very slowly, and it can be quite repetitive, as you are doing very much the same thing, and it takes a long time to complete a city. The game also can be quite annoying, as there are always zombies trying to break into your fort, so you have to defend constantly, sometimes you will end up with all your people guarding, and nothing else is being done, just in Limbo, waiting for something to happen so you can take them off of guard duty. The deaths of people can be quite annoying as well, especially when your people become cultists, they start commiting suicide, so sometimes one of your favourite characters just dies and now you have to get over it. (MY ONLY BLOODY ZOMBIE CHARACTER DIED! GOD! I'LL NEVER GET HIM BACK!) It's more annoying than sad.Overall, the game is quite good, but you probably won't like it if you don't like the previous Rebuild games, so if you don't know whether or not you should get this game, play the previous games and decide if you like it (do note that there is a massive improvement from the 2nd to the 3rd game though). You don't need to play the previous games to understand the third one though, as each game has a different backstory, all unrelated.			"

												I've always wanted a zombie apocalypse game where you actually rebuild instead of just survive. This game is the beginning of my hopes for that game. The structure is basic: you start out with a few buildings and a couple of survivors and you have to slowly conquer back the zombie wastelands and build a new start for humanity. The survivors have specializations which allow them to do different things for your settlement and as it grows people end up in relationships, end up in fights, or end up dead. Your leadership determines how well your settlement does. I never played the first two Rebuild games, but I was very satisfied with this one. My only gripe is that 3 missions into the campaign and I'm already getting swarmed with 2 or 3 zombie hordes every couple of minutes, which makes trying to establish a settlement near impossible since you have to keep sending all of your people off to fight the horde or guard your turf. There's also no real way to tell where a zombie horde or enemy faction group is going until they're already there (or if you just keep placing guards at every building in the vicinity until the danger meter changes color). It's also fairly basic with only a few building types to construct, a few technologies to research, and a few specialties for the survivors. I really kind of hope the devs (who I think are a husband/wife team) get bigger and make an expanded version of this game with 3-D graphics and expanded mechanics. If this is the quality of their games at a small level, I would only wonder what they could accomplish with EA's resources.			"

												I heartily reccomend this game for anyone who likes zombie apocalypse games. It's inexpensive, challenging and most of all fun. There are several roads to victory and you can play it on the clock or turn by turn (great feature that!). There are enough surprises to keep you guessing but the basic strategy is learned by the end of the first scenario.One thing: If you're playing for a high score, don't loiter around as each day it takes you to reach your goal means negative scoring. I took my time with one scenario just to be complete and wound up with negative points.All in all a very good game.			"

												It's a casual strategy game about Zombie Apocalypse. You control several characters with different specializations: fighters, builders, scavengers, researchers and leaders. With these guys you restore a town building by building, fighting hordes of zombies, dealing with other human factions and occasionally making a moral choice.The game is simple - it doesn't demand much of your effort to be played and, at least, several first hours of it are entertaining. Sometimes even tense. But I remind you that it's a CASUAL game. It has casual challenges that very soon become repetitive and lose all intrigue. It has casual story, somewhat spiced with the short personal stories of your team, that cannot make any big difference. I started to feel bored already in the third town (out of a dozen towns available).Buy it if you like games with shallow ideas and simplistic mechanics. I mean, it's really one of the most interesting games among the casual ones I've seen before. But for me it's clearly not enough to enjoy it for long.			"

												Surprisingly addictive.  Yes the graphics are cartoonish and is a lot like any freebie flash game, and yeah it clearly evolved out of a smartphone game.  But the key phrase here is ""evolved out of"" - this is an actual PC game, even if it doesn't look like one on the surface.The mechanics are simple & straightforward, and the learning curve is deceptive.  It seems childishly simple at first but once you've sunk an hour or two into you start to see the much deeper strategy game hidden just behind that ""casual"" image.  Running side-by-side with your Strategy game element of juggling food, materials, ammo, fuel and (most importantly) time, all while playing the risk-management game alongside when choosing missions... there is also an above-average RPG riding sidecar with it as well.  People have relationships - friends, enemies, lovers, spouses and children.  Those relationship are dynamic, and true mastery of this game means not just tossing the people with the best skill stats at a problem but also making sure that your team actually functions as such.Another nice, yet simple, feature that the game gets right is the difficulty scale.  Put it on Easy and yeah, a chimp can beat it, but put it on Impossible and you better have a jar of lube ready.  Maps can be anywhere from tiny hamlets to a city so large & vast it would make Judge Dredd do a double-take.  While you can't customize the map generation per se, it is seed based.  So if you've got a map that you really like you can duplicate it for replay simply by jotting down that number for later use.This game would be complete as it is even if all you had to do was deal with zombies, but of course you can - at your own discretion - crank it up another notch by adding a dozen different factions into the game.  They can become allies, trade partners, or (most likely) enemies to further assail your little fort on a daily basis.Now don't let this praise fool you - it's still got bugs, and it does have it's flaws.  I'd rate the ""price-to-entertainment"" ratio of this game as Good.  Meaning it's got the quality level of a $20 to $25 game but only costs $15.  And as of this writing it's on sale, so even better.			"

												I can't not recommend this game,although it got great fusion of topics(zombie and 4x strategy).The reason is that the game is way too shallow in depth.Here is my thought.1. characters classification is annoying, different functions of characters does not show big differences.2. characters upgrade through talks is annoying, especially that when u have to talk to A LOT OF people.3. Java-mini-game-looking and ugly looking font.4. NO atmosphere at all.5. Repetitive micro management.I hope some one could make a new game with zombie and 4x elements in the future.			"

												This was such an embarrassing step backwards for the dev team. Rebuild 2 was phenomenal, simple, easy to pick up and FUN! Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is an embarrassment to the Rebuild trilogy. The gameplay has simply been trampled all over in favour of even more resources you have to juggle. It feels like a chore to be ""playing this game"", dragging survivors literally all over the city instead of having more options with the tiny patch of land you can barely maintain in the first place. Zombie attacks are so frequent that you'll spent pretty much all of your time waiting patiently for the zeds to attack you. That is not gaming. That's boring. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. In Rebuild 2, there were so many strategies and options for how to end the game. Here, it's just like playing chess.			"

								This game is so fun! -- being a long time supporter of Rebuild 2.  This game has everything you'd want in a survival game:- Zombies are tough to defeat- You will lose buildings you've tried to reclaim- You'll have trouble getting all of the essential buildings you need- Survivors will die- There are communal pop-ups that actually matter- You can actually make a permanent shelter with regenerating materials- You can't win the game in just a few hours- You can lose the game in just a few hours- It's everything other zombie survival title tried to do, and someBut I cant seem to get past the ""Super Zombies"" feature.  It's a good idea, and is a tough mob to fight, but... you can't kill it without bombs (which destroys that building).  If you do try to attack them, you'll get 5/6 of the way done, and then they'll move to a different square.  They are naturally drawn to noise, also, so, if you're trying to reclaim a building, or scavenge somewhere, then they will one shot you.  Literally one shot you.  So at the moment, the game breaks if you have a super zombie problem.  I really hope that they fix this problem so I can actually play the game, but once it does get a fix, I reccomend you get the game.  It has a lot of potential;  it probably has more than most early access games.  And they make updates persistently which is even more of a reason to buy it.I think it's worth the high price tag of 14.99 since it's basically a finished game, with few bugs, and very few exploits -- if any.

								As of this review this is still a work in progress, release 0.69.  It's definitely going to be better than the previous Rebuild 1 & 2, but still needs some work balancing.  I really enjoy playing.  They have some great stories in the characters, but to be honest they really need to hire an editor to remove the grammar and spelling errors.  They distract you from the really creative character backgrounds.  Also, in the long game it gets a little unsatisfying.  There is not the balance yet between the large and small games to keep the mood going.  It's really fun to start the large games and get established, but while the ""gangs"" are difficult to beat back, there is not much story to that part yet, so it is not very satisfying to keep playing against the rival gangs.  It's much more satisfying to just bribe them into being friendly then end the game and start a new one.  There should be some more chaos to the way the opposing gangs behave.  With that fix, and probably a little better explanation and functionality for the 'leader' class, it's pretty solid.I enjoy this game and am glad to have purchased the Survivalist Edition.  However, unless you are willing to deal with a few ""in progress"" pieces, hold off for a little while.  Keep this on your Steam Wishlist until they are a little closer to official release, like a 0.8 release.			"

Spoiler: I really wish there was a way to play as the zombies after you turn and go back and retake all the colonies you established, basically playing the prologue for the bad ending you get if you capture the nuke and surrender. Also getting that stupid vial of monkey blood is super time consuming I officially give up on it, anyone know if it was because of Gustav?			"

												Finished the game at a casual pace in 30 hours. It was an enjoyable if addictive experience. There's enough of a story in there to make a little bit of a difference as the campaign goes on, but perhaps not quite enough. There are a few UI changes I think would be nice, such as the talent/perk system for survivors - too many clicks, especially when you have several dozen of them... The sound design gets repetitive pretty quickly too.			"

												Straight-forward...Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville I give it a 6.2/ 10. This game gets reptitive and tedious. The first few cities were fun and fine until you realized the cities don't change much. Add more factions, harder zombies, scarce resources. It could been fun but it becomes a hand sore at clicking.I like the concepts of how its like an Indie version of Sim City (though on a more limited capacity) with all the buildings and situations you face but there so limited that the 100 buildings u have are made of 8 buildings built over and over.Pros: Its got ...-Zombies-some selection of weapons and equipment-variety of storylines and options to lead you down your own path. (though a con is some storylines are overplayed from city to city)Cons:-There are bugs still, where characters become non-selectable and you have to reload (BUT the game autosaves a ton so that not too bad) -When you adopt, you lose your equipment hand (even if the child like 12 yrs old).-If an allied faction separates you and an enemy, (so far) impossible to get around and conquer the enemy territory.-Zombies herds becomes a tedious action-Alliances are BS. they can attack you. but if you raid once they are all out war with them... VALID? NO!!!-No ability to stop mass suicides (or none I found). Aka my own daughter seppuku herself for no reason!!!! =_____=#......-The MOST IMPORTANT ONE CON....is a question. Is this game going to get fun?THINGS TO IMPROVE:More equipment.More buildings.More buildings that your community can build. More storylines and better missions to complete.			"

												A simple zombie post-apocaliptic management game that is surprisingly good.The gameplay is not complex but it is really good because everything works really well.Also the campaign has a really well done story that can be replayed for different outcomes. That, togheter with the sandbox mode, gives, what could be a short lived gam,e quite a lot of replayability. You will get at least a good 20 hours of fun out of this one, and more if you really like the setting and mechanics.Highly recommended for sim/management lovers.			"

												Hi everyone, I've been a big fan of Rebuild for quite some time now and have played the latest game Rebuild 3 which in my opinion is a fantastic strategy game. I've played other strategy games in the past and so far this has been one of my top favorites. The discussion board and the community are really helpful as well as the game developers. Playing on a personal computer can be a little more tricky than a game console and so during a gameplay I may run into glitches. My latest game glitch happened here during game play on Rebuild 3 and I was a little concerned because with other game downloads or upgrades I've tried troubleshooting and with no success lost my money. I posted a request for help and saranorthway got back to me right away, its not always the game or the graphics that catches my attention but also too the game developer(s) and how they look after their customers, with that being said I'm very happy  with the quality of service from Northway Games and I give them 5 out of 5 stars.Keep up the good work.

												I feel bad writing a negative review for this game, like I'm criticizing a child's macaroni artwork.  That's not fair to the game or to the developer, but I just didn't have fun with it.  Zombie survival games are incredibly difficult to get right, because what people want out of them is different for each person.One of the problems I had is that I feel like I didn't understand the mechanics very well.  What should I be doing?  Clearing zombies?  Recruiting followers?  What do my different supplies do?  Why can't I reinforce my walls to make my settlement safer?  Maybe it's the limitations of the story campaign that I didn't like.  Another problem is that if you don't get lucky with finding the right survivors the game is much harder than it should be.  Even on easy it's tough.			"

												Ok i guess...Well, this game is good, but there are some flaws. Here are a few:1. Mobs and hordes spawining is too often2 .Churches and Bars dont have that much effect on Happiness.3. you get crowded with loot and you have too little survivors.Well, they aren't that big of a deal so i guess  i'll have to give  it a high score. 8.5/10What are you doing?It's the end of the review!

												The first two maps of the game were nice, but then i realized it´s everything again , again , again....it takes forever to complete a map when it is obvious that you already won.The game is not bad , i like it , but after 4,5 h i was bored to death..Attack zombies , fences , defend from zombies ,attack , fence, defence , attack faction........ 6/10 maybe a 6.5/10 as the first two maps were cool.But again , not a bad game			"

								Wish I could mod this but I'm too lazy, and I couldn't find the right buttons to press.Also pretty nice, but there's some difference between this and its completely free counterparts Rebuild's 1 and 2:1. Big campaign, at least 30 hours.2. Factions, diplomacy, trading etc.3. Perks and personalities.4. Definitlely has a lighter, more relaxing art style than the nightmare fuel called Rebuild 2.5. You generally win by building a city hall and allying/evicting all other factions instead of the different variation victories in Rebuild 1 and 2, such as Killing the Last Judgement Gang in Rebuild 2 and Closing the evil portal of zombies (whatever that was.).6. Modding support.7. More references to movies etc.Apart from these points mentioned, it's very similar to previous rebuild games, but has enough new stuff that I could definitely recommend it, especially if you have not played the other rebuild games.If you can't afford this game, just go play rebuild 1 or 2, that would give them some nice cash monies anyway.-IGN 80 Cultists out of... Oh got they're killing themselves again, oh jesus no please stop...			"

								If you ask me, this game is better than both walking deads. This game is one of those games that give you full control over your fort. This game is already a fantastic game. It has everything. I love the 150+ Events. From selling ""Bath salts"" to gustav, to deciding what to do when 70 zombies invading my hospital. And when it is complete? It will blow up the market. I am in the mood for this game everyday. Every turn counts. Do or die. I highly recommend this to anyone.			"

												A fun successor to what used to be a mobile-only game, Rebuild 3 starts off fairly easy to manage and claim your territory and survivors, but as you progress and unlock the survivor management research, it can get fairly overwhelming to start keeping track of each individuals happiness and their friends/enemies that should be taken into account before sending them on any mission, or even just letting them relax somewhere.The event system is just as interesting as it was in the mobile games I had played previously, with a need to carefully figure out if the risk is worth potential rewards, as the same event could end with either good or bad results. The need for some buildings that you would think are unimportant, due to having no visible benefits to them, such as a 8-12 Mart, or a fire station, can sometimes save your proverbial bacon or give you extra options for events, or quests to improve relations with the other factions. When I first found a fire station, I initally built a farm over it, due to assuming it was one of the numerous useless buildings. This was shortly realized to be a mistake when a event happened shortly after that caused one of my more important buildings (a hospital, in this case) to burn to the ground. This could have been avoided, obviously, if I had kept my fire station intact.The factions are all fairly amusing stereotypes for the most part, and some you can figure out things about them just by the dialogue. *cough*PigFarmers*cough* And depending on the map seed, it might be more beneficial to form an alliance or trade frequently with a few of them to obtain resources you might be sorely lacking in, due to location and luck of the draw, so to speak.The writing for the game itself is fantastic, in my opinion. Although after a little while, reading the survivors stories gets tedious and repetetive. And really, the only other thing that seemed to be in need of addressing was that explosives only worked on zombies, and zombie infested tiles. Upon trying to use some upon some invading Government faction soldiers, I was perplexed that it was not allowed by the game, which makes no sense whatsoever.Other then that minor issue though, the game as a whole is overall a very fun and engaging game, and I would certainly recommend it to people who enjoy strategy games.

												Best zombie crysis management game out there. Though I prefer to play the tablet version, they are basically identical. Every campaign is different. Every decision you make is a heavy one and it really gives you the feeling that you are guiding a bunch of people through the apocalypse. You grow attached to the people as they grow under your supervision and their backstory is revealed. This is the best ""Walking Dead game"" you can get, and it's a shame AMC didn't fund a game like this instead of some half baked story on rails.			"

												Sarah really did a great job on this one.For a 4X game it has a great psicological aspect and the story im umpecable.It can be boring if you don't like reading or micromanaging, but if you don't like those things a 4X story-based strategy game is just not for you.If you want to compare Rebuilds 1 and 2 to this one, it is like comparing Doom to Call of Duty: the feel is the same, but the gameplay is far more complex.With 200+ hours of gameplay I have yet to see some of the aspects of the plotlines and the last stage of the campain is simply a work of art.Worth every cent.

												Honestly, I have love this game series more than any other, I remember when I was on kongregate playing the very first one, then after forgetting about it (mostly because I played it on the hardest diffictulty and got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the second one came out and I was more hyped than I have ever been, played the hell out of the second one by the way. Then Sarah decided to release then forum (discussion page really), about what the features of what the game should be, I was late to the party but my ideas were still incorporated even though she probably never read them. Then when it was released, I found out that I needed steam in order to get it, so I got my steam account and decided to buy it, even in early access. So I bought the game and, well... I loved it, even without all the features incorporated into it. But then I decided to tell my friend about it, like a year later, which I let him play on my account so he didn't have to buy it, which also accounts for more than half of the hours spent on this game. He played until dawn (not the game, I mean the time) or until he passed out. I think he had more fun on this game than I did. But the reason why I am so appaled of how good this game is because, he gave up WoW for like a month, he loves WoW by the way, he never stops talking about it, never. But just reach the end of this review, 9.5/10 would maybe play again.			"

												Very few video games make me feel like I'm actually 1- playing 2-a video game nowadays. Rebuilt 3 manages to do that. I feel like I'm playing an HD version of an amiga 500 video game. And this feels gooooood. You can feel the love put into this game, it has character and it is very refreshing. All these details and little jokes and witty comments everywhere, and that impressive amount of backstories written for no reason. You can feel that it wasn't made by 200 persons. (Well, it's Sarah Norway's Rebuilt 3 so, I suppose she mostly made it on her own.) It's the kind of game that is endearing and which makes you overlook its flaw and focus on all the things that are actually great.I love the musics, even if I turned them off after 50 hours of playing. And the writing style is really cool. I have this female voice in my head, because this couldn't have been written by a guy. I love the tone of this game.			"

												If you like simple sim-city 4X like strategies, you will love this.  Its easy to learn but not so easy to master, and I would say has a ton of replay value. I know this isnt too too much of a step up from rebuild 2, but I still love this game.  I loved 1 and 2 as well, so for me buying this game was a no brainer.  Plus, buying this game was a thank you to the creator for giving me and all of us 1 and 2 for free, and for making 3.  Srsly, thank you for this great series creator, and you people out there should just buy it right now. DO IT.			"

												I liked 1 and 2 so I thought at the very least the devs deserve 15 bucks for the time I played them. While this game adds some nice improvements they ended making the game a huge slog. The biggest problem is that they added a second kind of horde that just sits there and attacks your fort randomly, you can attack them but they eventually spawn non-stop turning the game into a bitter slog of attrition; its boring as hell. While at this point I'll get my fun with it through some quick matches I just suggest playing 2 on the flash game site of your choice.			"

												This game is very similar to Zafehouse diaries, but not as good. I think this may have been made for touch devices such as tablets, and if you got it for that I could see it being a good timewaster. However, if you are on PC, Zafehouse is the more enjoyable and better optimised game in this genre.			"

												I bought this game because it looked fun, and what better than a strategy game about zombies right? For thirty minutes, it was a blast. My beautiful town named ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ became (slowly) less and less of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I would cry at the beauty of a reclaimed building. Then, the game became ""no market dude, I don't want your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!"" ""fine, let's train the only guy who isn't a soldier into a soldier, because the approaching zombie waves are abundant, and food is overated."" I never died, it just became boring. I never played it again. This is the only game of this type I have ever owned, so maybe I just don't like this genre. But, for those of you who have never played a game like this before, procced with caution. 10/10, would play GTA Online again			"

												I really liked the flash games. This is basically the same as the flash games, except it costs money. Honestly, it's kind of repetitive and boring after a while. Imo it's worth at most €5. I regret paying more for it. It doesn't offer enough new stuff on top of the flash games for it to justify the price. You can just play the flash games for free and get pretty much the same experience. And the game is EXTREMELY repetitive. The amount of pointless clicking involved is dire. Like - why can't I place multiple traps at once? Why do I have to go back to the menu for each individual trap? And there are no keyboard shortcuts at all.			"

												Entertaining for a while, but it gets repetetive quickly. While it looks ok, it feels and essentially is a cheap flash game. I just get the feeling I paid too much for what it really is, but if you enjoy zombie apocalypse survival games, you may like it.Still, I would wait for a promo/sale.Maps are random generated, but it all still feels the same to me. Kill zombies/mobs, reclaim ground, turn half the buildings to farms, get each of the remaining ones, do occasional quest (kill zombies again?), make alliances or not with trader and factions... There are few hours here, but you essentially do 2 things repetitively all the time.Do I recommend this game? Yes, but not for it's full price. I don't think I will ever want to start it up again.

												Okay, I HAVE to brake up this rewiew into two different parts. First part is mechanically the game (completely spoiler free), devoid of any story, and then the story (major spoiler). Because the story....1) The game starts out with a handful of survivors, four, to be exact, on each new map. Each survivor has Defense, Leadership, Engineering, Building and Scavenging skill, ranging from 0 (utter noob) to 10+ (peak of humanity). With traits (gained as you level up the survivors and research Survivor Management) and equipment you can raise it above ten, and it does increase efficiency and decrease mission time. The top I've managed to pull off was about 21 building skill on a survivor. Not all traits raise skills, some give different bonuses, like immunity to the disease, reduced danger during far away mission.The map contains several different types of blocks, ranging from one, two and four blocks, on a sqare grid. Each different block gives you different bonuses. Farms produce food based on size, apartments and suburbs give living space also based on size, hospitals accelerate healing, laboratories allow research missions to be completed, workshops provide crafting of Ammo, Medicine, and other one-time used items, pastures allow hunting for food, forests also allow hunting AND woodcutting, which provides building materials. Forests are one of the most valuable tiles, since those provide a steady supply of building materials, and while some maps edge is also forest, not all of them, and sometimes the starting position is in the middle of the map, essentially cutting off that until late game.The resources are Food, provided by farms and hunting on pastures or forests, Building Materials, provided by woodcutting, Ammunition used in rare events and in case the defenders/attackers of the player has firearms or similar ammo consuming item on them (like crossbows) gained from crafting in workshops, Medicine, used in rare event, gained also from crafting in the workshop (yes, autocraft for infinite number is in the game for it, and these does not seem to consume any materials), and finally, Fuel, used in powering a maps powerplant and crafting. There are craftable consumables also, Explosives made from Fuel, Medkits made from Medicine, Traps made from Building Materials.The game can be played in an RTS style, or in turn based style, depending on your preferrence, it can be changed anytime during the game.The zombies on the map indicated by four colouration of a tile (after scouting). No colour is no zombies, green is few, yellow are mediocre, red is swarming. A tile can be reclaimed once all zombies are destroyed on the tile through an eradication mission option. Periodically zombie mobs actively attack the player.2)The story...SPOILERS. Stop Reading if you want to experience the utter HERESY Ms Norway calls a story.So, you start out as a survivor, who is immune. You set out to rebuild the world. You encounter many different friends and foes (mostly foes) in the form of the various other survivor groups. You eventually learn of a possible cure, and you set out to research it, either forcing others to help you or befriending them. It would be pretty basic stuff (I'm only leaving out some ultimately meaningless pseudo-characterdevelopment parts) until you get to the ending. Turns out one of the villains (yes, the guy is a Tolkien level retard villain. Evil 'cos evil. Well, technically wants to destroy humanity because he had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses and coworkers and customers. Didn't get the memo that there is a bloody zombie apocalypse. Despite being an intelligent zombie himself. Don't ask.) SOMEHOW snuck into the hearth of your compound, and SOMEHOW managed to turn 100 syringes of the cure into 100 syringes of superzombie virus that acts slower and bypasses immunity. Where did he pull the superzombie virus out of? His rotting♥♥♥♥♥♥of course. At this point you can either A) surround to one of your adversaries and become a mindless zombie soldier, or just proceed to have everyone eaten anyway, including said adversary (not the same who spoilt the syringes), or just blow yourself up with a nuke. The final happy ending can be unblocked not by skill or knowhow, but pure bloody luck. There are hypothesises about how to exactly unlock it, I'm not sure which one is legit, because I can't be ♥♥♥♥ed into replaying this atrocity of a story. Supposedly in this ending you produce the supercure to cure your turbozombieism. My problem is not that there are separate endings, that's great. The problem is that the good ending is tied to random events (in all of the hypothesises so I assume at least one of them is correct). Also, the guy who spoils the syringes literally just comes out of nowhere and pulls the turbovirus out of thin air with not even in the slightests hint of it being possible (no, his ""smart"" zombies do not count. he stated that he can just simply train them at a time when it was neither convenient or believeable for him to lie).Final verdict:Get it on sale for the gameplay, if you can tolerate the atrocity of the story.

(even though the 2 factions that ""survived"" were the ones i infected so would be nice if that got fixed...) oh, also my characters baby grew up and travelled town between town with the mother and i with a body guard only for him to get gunned down by the government :( (I hate those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... but irl they are pretty cool it's rly just like cia etc that are the classified people...)

								Like the music (except for one song I had to remove from the playlist)Fun and a bit strategic for the first 50% of a city/mission.Overall not bad.However once you reach a certain point (basically the other 50% of a mission), the risk is no longer there and it kinda becomes tireseome and just a matter of waiting out the rest.If you really want to enjoy this game, I would play it on hard or higher. Any other setting are really just too easy and offer little challenge...making it kinda boring.			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

I paid for it and it was great for the first couple of hours, I mean zombies, uncasual, Rebuild, casual! But after some time it just became dull, the game itself became freaking boring! Hi AI, BANG BANG. Every AI's government down. So repetetive, if you want Rebuild go to Kongregate. Its where 'Rebuild' lives, not a game trying to be Rebuild.

												Just didn't like this game. Felt clunky and the information they overwhelm you with from the start is so abundant that it's hard to read through it all. The game feeds you information page upon page. The sad thing is, this is not an entertaining novel, it's just garbled information. It gets tedious reading all the text boxes that pop up trying to figure out what happened. The game put me to sleep after an hour of reading overly descriptive, yet suprisingly predictable notifications. If your looking for a poorly written choose your own adventure novel with pseudo-turn based gameplay, you might enjoy this game.If you are looking for a post-apocalyptic 4x game, save your money and look elsewhere.Edit: Someone asked my why I call it ""pseudo turn-based."" - The game is real time with the ability to slow time, speed up, pause, etc... It is not a traditional turn-based game.			"

Early Access Review
								There's not much I can say about this game, other than that it's one of the few reasons I still support Early Access after all the crap that's come up.I've already beaten both Rebuild 1[www.kongregate.com] and Rebuild 2[www.kongregate.com] on Kongregate, with this game being the big transition into a real full-price indie game.  Removing that godawful ""realism"" style the second one tried and going a little back to its first title's cartoonish graphics style, this one introduces new elements such as rivers and rival factions.Let me explain gameplay to you... it's a turn-based strategy sim (or, was turn-based, but now allows either turns or pausable real time) where you attempt to take back a city during the zombie apocalypse.  With randomized cities and events, this game still has a lot to find in it.  You will find that your survivors have various skills, meaning they'll be better at certain missions (using the school can help you improve said skills, or even help them develop more skills).  By assigning your survivors to missions just outside the fort, you manage your city and attempt to run it while facing off against the occasional zombie attack and in this latest installment, other factions that can be either completely friendly, or absolutely want everyone in your fort to die.Overall, the $15 tag isn't bad, even through all the bugs that haven't quite been solved yet.  The developer definitely isn't giving out a dead game, as it already got 2 massive updates just before I got the game, and another afterwards.EDIT: The updates are still coming, and the bugs are being squashed.  I'm still having some semi-rare issues, such as the backstory not loading occasionally for a survivor

By: Moss




but other than that, the game works well and it's fully loaded with content.It's definitely one of the best purchases I've made on Steam, but you should probably buy it from the official site[www.rebuildgame.com] so that you can also get a standalone and Android edition.			"

												I had enjoyed the flash games and had been anticpating the release of this game.Where the flash games were light and easy to play, Rebuild 3 feels like a chore.Having to stop and pause time is tedious, and moving people around is awkward.I end up grouping people by accident and have a hard time ungrouping them.Updated graphics, larger maps and new buildings would have sufficed for Rebuild 3.It would also have been nice if they had mini scenarios that you had to win.Would have liked in game upgrades and ulockables.

Thank God I did not pay full price for this game and got it on sale. If this game was free it would not be worth the time to download it much less play it. I want to type a whole lot more but the other things I want to type about this game goes against the steam community rules.			"

								In its current state I wouldn't recommend this game to people unless they have felt a great longing for another Rebuild. There are some balance issues, the optional nature of the story leads to it making little to no difference in the playthroughs (most obvious in character backgrounds which I now compleatly skip) and the end-game storytelling is still to be added.Once the finalized game is released this review propably won't be accurate anymore.

Early Access Review
								Wow what a rip off.  it just looks a tad more touched up then the 2nd and free game.  Here I'm gonna just compare it to the second one which you can play and get a grand idea for.  In the third the only difference I can recall is before you were only fighting the zombies and not other clans, and if there was even a 1% risk you sometimes had a choice to use some items to better defend yourself while the attack is underway.  Also they give you the option to do real time strategy, however I went to turn based right away.Pros+Just as fun to play though as the 2nd+Going to war with clans can be fun and stressful in the good way(most of the time, look at the cons to see what I mean)+You get more choices on who you are+The clans all have some personalty to them.+New lands and new uses for some of the lands in game.Cons-This game is glitched to hell and back still.  My game is now unwinnable because I can't talk peace with a clan that I have destroyed, but the game refuses to admit they are dead when there are no zombies or that clan's color left.-The names and pictures do not match up with the style of speech half the time.  It may be a little nit pick but when the thing your using to keep me invested are story events you must make sure your he and she is right.-Everyone wants materials in order for an alliance.  This is a double con as it takes away from the personallty of the clans and also is that most annoying good to try and horde.  Even with five level 10+ builders going to work for materials you'll be lucky to see three a day, each clan wants 100.-Long in the worst way.  I love long games as they normally mean I'll get my money's worth and will find something I like in it.  The bad news is the thing that makes this game so long is fighting to crush the other clans or make peace with them, which in some cases is either actively fight the clans which is more fun but takes more time and goods, or wait to be buddy buddy with them, shorter but ten times as boring.  -The cost of the game.  When I play this I was looking for something more than the 2nd which I can play for free.  Right now your just buying a better looking version of the game.-Religion vs drinking.  I don't personally care for either of these at all, less so the fact that they picked an actual religion over something like fallout 3's church of atom.  This one isn't something game breaking but if it's my city shouldn't I be able to at least pick our religion or make one up?*Other fact.*I'm not listing this as a pro or con just saying it's in the game.  In my play file I've had guys marry guys, guys marry girls and it may just be the luck of the draw, but no women wedding each other.  You can pick to deny them of course but your sure to take a hit in happiness.  I'd list this a tad more as a con as later in the game it should be something you pick to address when making your own declaration of human rights in the game.  Again I'm not saying it's good or bad, just not properly worked in, or if never intended, out.Final score 33% Room for lots of improvement.With the game breaking bugs, guys being called girls and vise versa, small number of events I'd say pass on this game.  It may be early access at the moment but if you want to jump on this game wait till it's under five dollars.			"

Early Access Review
								Discussion is based on the Impossible-difficulty.Rebuild is not a new game in the sense that it is a new idea. Indeed, the developer has produced two earlier Rebuild games that  are floating on the Internet as a free flashgame and as a nominal fee mobile game. Those who have played either one of those games will be very familiar with this incarnation of Rebuild.However, dismissing this Rebuild because of that would be a mistake. Already in this stage of it's Early Access cycle it has way more to it than those earlier versions.Graphically, Rebuild is colorful and cartoony but does not venture beyond a pseudo isometric map on which icons relay the bulk of the information, supported by textboxes that in their information provide much of the immersion and feel of trying to survive in a zedpocalypse. Rebuild will not dazzle you with next-gen graphics, or offer you outlandish options and resolutions for which you need two Titans in SLI and several monitors.Due to this, Rebuild can be enjoyed by most anyone with a computer bought anywhere in the last five years.The tone of the game is lighthearted, which does hide the fact that the game is actively trying to kill you. The tone of the game and it's graphical presentation makes it easy to underestimate the efficiency it can display in giving the player a false sense of security, leading to the player taking risks which appear to be calculated but will prove to be anything but.The player has many option to taylor the gameplay. First and foremost there is the map, which comes in a slew of basic dimensions from tiny to gigantic. All of those basic dimension are however procced so no map is ever the same and no specific strategy will play out the same from map to map. In itself, the basic size of the map is somewhat of a difficulty adjuster in and on itself, as the number of zeds on the map increase dramatically the larger the map chosen is.Then the composition of your team will differ each time, though there will always a soldier, a builder and a scavenger in it. The Soldier, obviously, is your go-to survivor for combat duty. Nothing out of the ordinary with this survivor. The soldier kills zeds...The builder is quite a talented survivor. Not only can a builder demolish buildings to provide you with the materials resource, the builder is also the survivor to turn to when you need to transform a cityblock into something else.The scavenger.., well, apart from his/her obvious task of gathering food and resources from blocks not yet reclaimed, he/she is also the survivor to turn to to scout out blocks you haven't been to yet. You have to careful with your scavengers, they're not soldiers, though they can defend themselves if need be.The scientist is your survivor who can act as a doctor and as a researcher, provided you can present the scientist with the buildings he needs to ply his trade.The leader is your diplomat. Through him, you can recruit more survivors into your fort and conduct other charismatic things, like preaching in the church (if you build or reclaimed one) to bolster party-morale.All survivors can do all tasks described, but using the right person for the job will see it done quicker or with more success.As your survivors do the things they do best, they acquire perks. These perks buff their main talent. As of now, the player is not notified of this and the player has to scan the roster frequently to see if a survivor can activate a perk.The player starts on the map in a five-block 'Fort'. From the very start, zeds are massing at the gates and the player can set the soldier to work as soon as turn1 is underway. The food-situation is dire and decisions about farming have to be made immedeately. Scavengers will have start risking body and limbs scrounging for food right from the get-go.This pressure will not relent, yet your survivors will go mental if they can't rest up. So the player will constantly juggle a lot of factors that become increasingly harder to juggle. In order to remain functional, new survivors have to be recruited. More survivors means needing more farms, but also more apartments. That means that the player is forced to expand by reclaiming blocks. Getting bigger means a larger perimeter, which needs soldiers to defend... But next to the constant zed-attacks, the zeds can also mass into a herd which will be harder to defeat, forcing the player to make decisions on where to focus the defence. Next to that... ammunition is finite and needs to be fabricated.After a few turns the factions surface of which the subtitle of Rebuild hints at. If you thought that defending yourself from the zombies is a handful... prepare to deal with gangs that all have their own agendas which do not necessarily include being nice to you...But in all this chaos there is you. You, the player, is represented in the game through a customizable avatar (limited customization right now) and you're special. Unlike the survivors who have one talent only, your avatar has all five and can level up in all of them. This versatality means that you can jump in and help out where you're needed the most, though that in itself brings with it a new set of decisions. Will you go and recruit that survivor holed up in the suburbs or will you lend a hand in transforming an officebuilding into a farm?It's all up to you.Will you like Rebuild? Rebuild is a x4 RTS. It offers nothing out of the ordinary right down to the tried and tested zedpocalypse trope. Lopsided commentary in-game is there, the zeds are there, gruesome deaths are accounted for and decisions between a rock and hard place are thick as flies. There's even a research function and a tech-tree to explore.The 'impossible' difficulty on which my review is based is suitably hard, but in my opinion still fair. That is, all my defeats left me with something I feel I can do different the next time.Should you buy it?No.You shouldn't buy Rebuild because it is an Early Access title. You have no guarantee that the developer will ever finish producing Rebuild to release-candidate status. You have no guarantee that the developer will make good on the development-list. There's a good chance that you buy a game that for all you know is abandoned already. The fact the developer is active on the forums means little, as there are examples enough where 'active developers' suddenly fell off the face the earth taking the money with them and leaving the players with an unfinished heap of alpha-code.Buying Early Access is a gamble I do not wish for people to make on my saying so.So that leaves me in the weird position that I'm very positive about Rebuild. I like it very much and in it's current state it is most certainly perfectly playable and enjoyable. But I can't recommend it because it is Early Access and therefore is completely devoid of any guarantee to the buyer that Rebuild will ever be developed through and finished.-Merdakah			"

								I love this series seriously check out kongregate for 2 other titles Rebuild and Rebuild 2 they are true master pieces. This however is an incredible let down as of yet there is nothing new compared to the free falsh games. The music (in my opinion) is ear piercingly bad. Then comes the biggest thing most people check for in alpha reviews is it playable and the answer is yes with a few♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself bugs. For example 2 of my men overlapped I went to separate them in a currently awkward fashion and the game crashed. No probs its a alpha then I reloaded the game and the save was corrupt I had just spent the bulk of my time playing on that save and yes I tried the autosave and my manual save both were broke. I woke up the next day ready to start again and in disbelief I tried loading the save and it worked. Overall the game is not worth $15 maybe 10 with alot of updates but it is really only worth 5.

								Been a fan of Northway since the original Flash game. Detailed management allows you to hand-pick your survivors and adjust their skill preferences, while events in the game will shape them into seasoned veterans, a potential ""supersoldier"" (that can single-handedly destroy an entire zombie horde) or a charming merchant that trades away ten apples and get thirteen back. Once you get the basics done, you can research policy system to fine-tune your city, make contact with other factions, and (in the future, just like the original game) fight back for humanity.			"

								Overall a good game that surely will only increase in quality as it is developed further. The increased role of factions is a fun, tactical addition and as always it's nice to see Gustav and his ♥♥♥♥♥s again. However the price is perhaps too expensive, seeing as the previous games were in fact free, I would think the game would sell better later on with a price tag of maybe $10.00. While people such as I who have enjoyed the previous games of the serious are more than willing to pay this, a lower price could help pull in more customers. Thanks again Sarah!			"

												If you haven't played the first two games in the series, Rebuild's predecessors are available for free on several different websites. I would recommend starting with the second one of the series to get an idea of what you're getting into before you decide to buy the game or not.The story in Rebuild 3 is much deeper than either of the first two games and is a more entertaining experience than the sandbox gameplay option even though the way you play in both are exactly the same.It's a fun game to play and you can drop it at any time and come back to it knowing exactly what you were doing. If you forget what you were doing, the interface will give you a good idea of what's going on when you reload it just by looking at the screen, once you are familiar with the game.It does get boring after playing for a long period of time so I would recommend taking a break every once in awhile.

												A decent casual sim marred by very repetitive gameplay, and some design decisions that make sense from a balance perspective, but not from a logic perspective (e.g., you can learn how to build hospitals and labs, but not warehouses?)  It also suffers from a slavish devotion to random generation, which leads to some nonsensical characters and events.  The campaign is too episodic for my tastes.That said, it's an ambitious design that's ultimately fun enough to be worth the price.  7/10.			"

												Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is a light-hearted zombie apocalypse game in which you find yourself starting off in a humble encampment. Your goal at first is quite simple - rebuild - but there are also other matters that require your attention. You'll find out soon enough that your beginning supplies are only going to last you a short time and that, in order to survive, you will need to send scavengers out into the city to bring back precious resources such as medicine, food, ammunition, and building materials. However, time does not idly wait (unless you play turn-based mode) and there are still more things to be done during the day. You will need to research various technologies to improve your people's lives as well as constructing new homes for them to live in. Of course, you will also need to provide buildings to boost their happiness such as bars and churches but this extends to things such as pets too. Eventually, you will find that your survivors begin anew and form relationships with one another ranging from enemy all the way to husband/wife. So what are the qualities of the game that make it something everyone should try?  Easy to learn Easy to interact with the various elements of the game May initially seem uninteresting, but becomes very addictive. ReplayableThe campaign itself can be either fairly short or long depending on the difficulty, as well as how many of the side objectives you decide to pursue. The story itself is, for the most part, your standard zombie apocalypse drama. However, humour has been sprinkled generously throughout the writing in order to cast a slightly happier light on the situation. Many of the survivors also have their own stories which they reveal in bite-sized portions throughout the game after you've researched survivor management. These also come with the opportunity to select a new perk for your survivor which can include things such as Firearms Training, or being Stinky.The graphics are a massive improvement over the previous two games, and quite interesting to look at although there is a little inconsistency between the faction leaders in terms of their graphical style. An example would be comparing Senator Davis to Farmer Bucket, although it should be noted that such a thing is negligible. The sound effects are probably the weakest point of the game as there aren't very many of them at all. It doesn't detract too much from the experience, but it definitely would have been a boost to the atmosphere to have more sounds going on throughout the day.The music of the game is fairly good and some of the tracks add to the atmosphere of the game quite nicely. It should be noted that there are several 'ambience' tracks which play in addition to the main ones which is an interesting design choice. However, it does pad out the time between each of the tracks playing so that the music doesn't become annoying too quickly. Overall, the music fits very well with the light-hearted atmosphere of the game.Overall, Rebuild 3 is a great game and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a light-hearted strategy game snack. The game is interesting enough that you will get a fair amount of playtime out of it, and it is one that you will find yourself coming back to every so often.

												Capture blocks in a city from the Zombies and other factions. Whilst it's RTS, it can be played as turn base. I found the story to be enjoyable. It's city building, character development with zombies. Extremely addictive as you can tell by the hours I've played. Certainly worth picking it up if you like to play some casual that doesn't requires hours of learning how to play a game. Good fun.			"

												A surprisingly decent zombie game despite being ported from a phone app.The game has all all the ingredients of a typical zombie game, survival, scavenging for items, research, crafting, building, survival, other factions of survivors, and obviously lots of zombies.However unlike most zombie games where bands of people are struggling to even live, this game has one outlandish concept. You can actually reclaim an entire city, and form your own government with its own constitution on what your civilization represents. Despite this outlandish feature the game plays well with all the ingredients of a zombie game.The game also has a decent story campaign for you to progress.It isn't game of the year material, but it is a good game to buy if it is on discount and when you have nothing better to play.

												This is a wonderfully addictive game. You do gain favorites among your characters, and the tendency of the game to make you think of The Walking Dead all the time is very cool. The first city kicked my butt because I didn't realize how food worked -- you build or liberate farms even if you don't have anyone to farm them. (They make food by themselves.) I love the variety of events that come to play -- I don't know whether the game will suffer from sameness over time, butt I'm gonna make it show me. Two cities into it I'm still loving it.I just got a character that looks for all the world like Scary Carol from TWD, and she got all the deadliest bonuses without my trying (or cheating). I love her. I'm definitely taking her to the next city! (You get to take three with you, and that's cool!)It's amazing how serious a loss can feel when it's done in cartoons: I had a great leader in a cowboy hat, my Southern preacher. Leadership skill was up to 12 and he tried to talk some recruits into joining. They killed him. Wow. Yep. <sigh> Hit me very much by surprise. I can remember staring at the screen in shock decyphering it. Yep. The game has got me!Enjoy it. It's one of the ""just one more turn"" things that'll keep you engaged four hours after you shoulda gone to bed.			"

												How have I not given this game a positive review yet?Its a fun 4x game about rebuilding after a zombie apocalypse.  Its a little lite with some of the factions, and the story doesn't work perfectly with dealing with factions after you wiped them out, but the game is great and some minor issues can be easily overlooked for a very fun experience.  More than worth the 15 dollar price tag!			"

												Okay... now that I finished the game and am aware of the entire plot...I have to say I still recommend it, but... the game pulls a about face twist at the end which really annoys me.MOreover, after doing research into the ""good"" ending of the game, I found out that I'd basically have to play from the start.Yeah. I really hate the fact that while I love the game, finding the good ending is... next to impossible unless you were actually aware of its existence in the first place.			"

												I absolutely love this game. I played the first 2 as Flash games and would lose entire days to them. This one is no different. I bought this when it was still in early access and it has come a long way during development. I've been playing the finished version recently and really enjoying it. It's a 4x game (like the Civ Series) set in the zombie apocalypse. You have to maintain supplies, survivor happiness and manage relationships with other factions in your current city.  (I usually just kill them.) If you'd like to see a preview before buying here's my most recent play through:

												Got the game. After the first city, I was very confused as to why I had to build city hall then leave. I thought that was the end and I was going to be pretty aggravated that it ended there. But there's progression, and things unlock with the progression. Definitely awesome game, I'd recommend.Only downside I see right now, is that I may have a bug on one of my saves. Under all of the character bubbles, there are 3 dots, instead of their level. It looks like they're deeply judging me, and it makes me uncomfortable.http://imgur.com/1rUNMXN "

												Accidentally ate some people, bruned some cultists, intentionally ate some people, Bought enough heavy weapons, pitbulls, and armored trusk from the trader to outfit a small army, took over the world.All in all? Great way to spend a day.On a more serrious note, if you've played the previous two flash games at first glace this looks like a paid third version. If you leave it at that and enjoyed the previous two flash games you're going to be missing out on a suprisingly good game. While /a lot/ of the mechanics from the flash games are in this, they've more or less been improved on. The apperance of your survivors gets a little repeditive after awhile, but that's my only complaint. (Well, that and some of the games can run pretty long, but that's my own fault.)Serriously though, if you're on the fence about paying $15 bucks for it wait for it to go on sale but personally I'd say it's worth the $15 they're asking. If you want a ""demo"" just go to any major free-flash games site and give the first or second a try, most of the mechanics are fuctionally the same and it'll give you a good idea of what your basic goal is.

												so many hilarious and epic generated combinations of things can happen, it's unreal. Here was pretty much my first game:after a few days, I gathered a top hat and a whip so I dressed someone up as the spitting image of a lion tamer.A moronic performer stuck his head into a zombies mouth to impress my group... we saved his♥♥♥♥♥and he somehow lived. Throughout the rest of the game, his character model looked like he was permanently ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself. coincidence? technically yes due to random generation, but it's still funny as hell.one of my soldiers life stories involved him criticizing magicians, religions, and supernatural phenomenon as a TV career until the apocalypse happened... two days after he told me this, he became devoted to Christianity...my best man Doyle took on an armada by himself... the battle stated that he snipped all of them with precise accuracy from far off... If that's not badass enough, he was equipped with a shot gun.I decided to raise a democracy, but because everyone was paranoid for some reason, they called to heavily ration bullets and food, despite us already having five metric ♥♥♥♥-tons stored away. after loosing 3 blocks in the same day, they changed their bloody minds and called another council meeting to un-♥♥♥♥ the things they ♥♥♥♥-edI have a freaking armor clad ninja... who's also a freaking bar tender.AND I HAVN'T EVEN BEAT THE TUTORIAL YET!!!I like rebuild, I loved rebuild 2, and I have zero regrets so far over buying the third installment.10/10 Five star 100% and others ♥♥♥♥s I'm giving it.

												I played the original games on kongregate and they facinated me. Not just killing zombies in a dumb shooter and just surviving but taking charge as a leader and rebuilding the city in your image. Then I found a kickstarter for rebuild 3 and I was so happy. Got early access to it as soon as I could and remember playing it when there were barely any models in. It is truely unique as no other game captures the nature of manging survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Truely fearing random events and hordes. Losing your ultra badass soldier on a routine mission and trying to cope as your defences faulter. The campaign is suprisingly good for an indie title, especially an RTS. The last mission, I'll try to avoid spoilers, is still one of the best build ups of tension I've played, and it was a strategy game. This game is a masterpiece and even after 200+ hours I still encounter new things every time I play. Furthermore if you do play I would recommend listerning to hollywood undead while you play. It just blends perfectly.			"

												Lite rpg-elements combined with an addictive ""just one more city block"" - the zombie setting is just the background. The technology research and items found significantly impact the course of a map, which is a plus. The faction system adds an aspect of questing, if you don't feel like just trading to ally or wiping the other factions off the map. A large, though not huge, amount of random events keeps gameplay reasonably fresh. I don't think experienced players will have any difficulty on the normal or challenging settings once they have mastered the basics, but I find impossible challenging and fun. The dev is currently active and reachable, and the game went though a long EA process. I haven't encountered any bugs (that I could tell, anyway) in the release version of the game. A solid game if this type of hybrid game appeals to you.			"

The price of the game might make you a little wary since you've spent so long playing the Rebuild series for free, but you'll certainly get your money's worth, especially if you are patient enough to wait for it to go on sale.  Besides, think of it this way, you're also paying the game makers back for the hours of time that you've spent playing the prior 2 Rebuilds.			"

Early Access Review
								A board/simulation/turn-based 4x style game that gets better with each iteration. I thoroughly enjoyed the original Rebuild and Rebuild 2 on my cheap smartphone, and am loving all the new stuff in Rebuild 3.The developer took Rebuild 2 and expanded on it in just about every aspect. More intricate survivor-survivor mechanics (you don't want to do missions with your nemesis), a neat set of perks and abilities you can put on your survivors as they gain levels in their ability of choice to make them better, and the addition of NPC factions that will also be trying to survive and thrive in the zombie apocalypse of NW America/SW Canada. There's also a pretty nifty Campaign that is still being worked on, but adds an awesome mode to the otherwise random map/random size of the first 1.The game is almost 100% stable, I have had 1 or 2 crashes during Beta testing, and the amount of bugs/glitches reduces with every patch (monthly at the minimum, sometimes faster). A lot of these are cosmetic: him instead of her, using the wrong character name for an event, rather than gamebreaking.A couple minor issues I have (opinions only, nothing majorly wrong):The UI can be a bit cumbersome, especially lategame when playing on an Epic map.Not a big fan of the music. I just mute and kick in a playlist sometimes. It's okay, but it can get a bit repetitive.Playing on larger maps, there is a lot of micromanaging. It comes with the territory though. If you're controlling 30-50 survivors it's simple. When you have 100+ on 30-40 missions at one time, the message feedback and need to scroll continuously can get wearying..... that's really all the negatives I have for it.If you played 1 and 2, GET 3. GET IT NOW! It's that awesome.If you are new to the series, I'm not sure what to compare it to in order for you to get a good idea of what it's like. There's a mixture of a dozen different games/genres, all wrapped up in these pretty neat graphics and some dry humor thrown into the bowl. You might try Rebuild 2 on your phone/pad, it's pretty cheap in the various app stores, and see if you like it. If you do, then get this game!My Score: 9/10 (might go higher once the game is officially out and complete)			"

								Been a fan of Northway since the original Flash game. Detailed management allows you to hand-pick your survivors and adjust their skill preferences, while events in the game will shape them into seasoned veterans, a potential ""supersoldier"" (that can single-handedly destroy an entire zombie horde) or a charming merchant that trades away ten apples and get thirteen back. Once you get the basics done, you can research policy system to fine-tune your city, make contact with other factions, and (in the future, just like the original game) fight back for humanity.			"

It's just in beta at the moment, but it's very playable and VERY addictive, and I've already noticed good things in the updates. The game has pretty much everything I love: mini-events, some dialogue choices, RPG elements like gaining experience and leveling up skills, Oregon Trail-esque choice of camp leader profession (and chances to lose your survivors horribly), backstories and specialties for all of your survivors, interesting enemy factions, cute flavour text (""I didn't think plants were that effective against zombies...""), trading, Sim City-esque building... it's a great strategy sim with zombies, and I highly recommend it.Also, my playtime is longer than advertised, since I was playing offline for a while; it probably took maybe ~5 hours to beat on normal.

								Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville is a great improvement on the past three entries in the series (counting Rebuild Mobile). GoD has tons of new events, survivors, and mechanics that make the game a familiar experience but at the same time, brand new. One such new mechanic is the factions. When you start a non-campaign game, you can tweak the scenario to your liking, including how many other factions are in the city, and if you have the max number of factions in a small town, gameplay gets pretty hectic pretty quickly, as you all scramble to take over as many spaces as you can.There is a campaign mode, a bunch of different cities with some restrictions and few options to tweak linked together with a nice bit of story in between the levels. Of course, in-game events also offer story opportunities, and some events link together nicely as well. I very much like this game, as someone who plays for a rich story experience, and the gameplay is entertaining as well. I'd say pick this up, or at least try the previous two flash games to get a feel for the Rebuild style.			"

								A very incomplete game, but still superior to the first two installments which I played avidly on ArmorGames. While I am not sure I should have paid 25 for the deluxe edition, I do highly recommend this game at the 15 dollar price tag. Northway Games has yet to disappoint me when it comes to finishing a game, which I know is a real trouble spot for Early Access games. At current, on a scale of 10, I would give this game a fairly solid 7 rating.			"

												I really recommend this. It's a fun and addictive game about survival in a zombie infested world. It's more strategic than action, but it is not slow and boring.  You are the leader for a group  of people in this post apocalyptic  world and your decisions and your rules will set your groups destiny. You will have to make  hard choices, often between survival and moral. You not only have to fight against zombies or ""Zed"" as they are called in the game but other (NPC) groups of survivors.The game is far from spotless, and there is still some problems. You will always have to do all missions from start when you get to a new town, and research things all over again. Some missions also tends to be quite tedious. Especially ""Eliminate or ally all opposite factions"". Many factions are almost impossible to ally, and eliminating them takes for ever.So if you like strategic games, I really think you should give this one a try.			"

												Very recommendable strategy game, even more considering it only cost 10 euros. It's strangely addictive so far, with- A storyline that keeps your main character moving to new cities, challenges and rival factions. - Research and crafting options.- Survivor management. Equipment that improve skills. Training and ""personal stories""- Basemanagement. Capturing new areas. Defending it from attacks. Upgradable and rebuildable buildings. - Trade and diplomacy with other factions. Though I have not done much of that so far.Again, at the price it's absolutely worth it.			"

												This is a fun game that is great for casual players, and anyone looking for a change of pace from more challenging games.  The tongue in cheek graphics and game play make it a welcome alternative to the usual run-n-gun zombie and post-apocalypse games.  Although I enjoy the challenge of playing 7 Days to Die and looking for different ways to deal with zombies, scarce resources, and various environmental zones, Rebuild 3 is a fun alternative to play.

It's actually a town-building sim game all about building, growing, and defending a small community in the face of the zombie hordes.

												One of the most original concepts I've ever seen for a zombie game.  I played the first two when there were on Kongregate, and was absolutely blown away by the depth and strategy required to effectively navigate the game. This game takes everything that made the first two great and just makes it even better.  The inclusion of a story mode adds a narrative depth to the game that I honestly didn't even realize was needed, but now that it's here makes the story of the survivors even more engaging.  I bought this in Beta because I was so excited when I heard it was coming out.  By no means did it disapoint.  Bottom Line:  If you enjoy strategy games or zombie games, you'll love this game.			"

								This is a simple yet very engrossing game, sort of a couple steps up from regular flash games that can be played for free online.  It is easy to learn, but complex enough to be fun. It is not particularly difficult to win, but it is still entertaining.The game is still being developed to some degree but it is completely playable. I have gone through the first part of the campaign ( about half of the campaign has not been created yet) and I had no issues, no glitches and no problems. It can also be played sandbox mode.I tend to enjoy the ease and simplicity of flash games and I really like this one. I find it well worth the cost and anybody that is looking for a game that is quick and fun should look at this.			"

												A decent casual sim marred by very repetitive gameplay, and some design decisions that make sense from a balance perspective, but not from a logic perspective (e.g., you can learn how to build hospitals and labs, but not warehouses?)  It also suffers from a slavish devotion to random generation, which leads to some nonsensical characters and events.  The campaign is too episodic for my tastes.That said, it's an ambitious design that's ultimately fun enough to be worth the price.  7/10.			"

												i was a big fan of rebuild 1 & 2.  rebuild 3 adds quite a few new features, and more importantly new challenges.   nothing like the feeling of desperately trying to hold off the zombie hordes with every survivor available; which causes your food reserves to start draining, when suddenly an enemy faction declares war on you.   give up or fight?    fight ofc.   time to break out those machine guns.  sure, they will eat up your meager ammo reserves.  but they'll also eat tiny holes in your enemies.   now is not the time to be stingy with those bullets.rebuild is a challenging strategy game.  (if you play on challenging difficulty or above, ofc).    it is definitely tough enough to beat you, if you aren't careful.if you never played the rebuild series, i recommend it because it is a different sort of strategy game.  if you have played rebuild 1 or 2, i recomend it so that you can check out all the new features.

												Awesome game. Funny and interesting story line and the new factions make it much more interesting. The originals were great as well. As the game progresses it can become tedious though as the objective seems to remain the same. Ally or Eliminate # factions gets old. One level where you have to restore an old plane was a nice change. I wish there was more of that related to the story. Some factions reappear, but dont seem to remember me helping them much. Tried it on the hardest difficulty once(Moses Lake) and failed. I had to start over again on the next hardest difficulty, currently on my 2nd attempt at Impossible on Penecton. I hope it goes well this time. I jsut got Tiff and Wonko Married. They were my original people. On my first attempt at Impossible I lost Wonko and my best soldier, Beer O'clock. Damn good man. I couldnt deal with it for 2 days and decided to restart at a lower difficulty than face the fact that they are dead. Hooray for denial. Gods help me when I finish reading Game of Thrones.			"

												If you haven't played the first two games in the series, Rebuild's predecessors are available for free on several different websites. I would recommend starting with the second one of the series to get an idea of what you're getting into before you decide to buy the game or not.The story in Rebuild 3 is much deeper than either of the first two games and is a more entertaining experience than the sandbox gameplay option even though the way you play in both are exactly the same.It's a fun game to play and you can drop it at any time and come back to it knowing exactly what you were doing. If you forget what you were doing, the interface will give you a good idea of what's going on when you reload it just by looking at the screen, once you are familiar with the game.It does get boring after playing for a long period of time so I would recommend taking a break every once in awhile.

												So a review for the game.I remember this when it first started as Rebuild 1 at flash sites like Newgrounds and it was a very nice game there. I see that from a simple format it has evolved by now taking the advice its sequels produced to good use.On this game both story and sandbox modes are enjoyable. I am willing to look past the plot of the story and facts like the faction's memory or carrying over research. I assume every city has its own branches of factions and people that need to be taught. I am also going to be kind and assume that when I complete a mission and I leave my city with one injured builder at the moment 17 zed hordes are threatening my walls, he finds some sort of militia to deal with the threat and ensure my empire stays prosperous.After this little sacrastic intro, on the actual parts of the game. The time management system as well as the neutral/faction AI is satisfactory. The difficulty levels are fine and so far I have not encountered any bugs. The items have a nice variety and the events, while you may encounter the same event once or twice do well to adapt to the names of different survivors. The biggest positive impact I have from the game is the addition of factions, especially the cult and such religions. I am willing to overlook the extreme complexity of the policies regarding the cult because of the fact its cool to have these aspects in a zombie survival strategy game.On top of that all the small details of things you expect, like buildings, bars, churches, workshops, labs etc are as they should be. The resources of the game are few so its not confusing and you can quickly pick it up. Props to the autosave system that saves every minute, although some people may prefer to save at important points in game so they can get back if things get rough. Finally on a more advanced dive to the AI, the factions expand in an ok manner and they are not the same behavior with a reskin which is good as well.However some things in the game could be improved. First of all the inaccuracies I mentioned at the start of this review are overlookable but annoying none-the-less. I understand for example the research carrying over part is not easily integratable because of game balance, but factions having a set memory on you, even if it punishes some players is a realistic change that would add to the game. Remember that difficulty can be a positive part of a game, while some people make difficulty the defining part of their game and make money out of that (cough cough dark souls).After that I searched a bit and found some people experience bugs with the trade missions, and survivors never recovering from injury but stuck at guarding the building they were recovering. These have not happened to be but should be referenced.And finally, my biggest complaint, the game music. I swear I never thought I would have ever said a game doesn't have a nice track since its really easy to find a simple mix for any sort of game. There are games out there with incredible soundtracks yes but here I am not talking about quality. In my opinion it is almost garbage. Half the tracks that play during the game are just static on different pitch. At first I thought it was on my end, went as far as to order a new sound card since mine was from christmas of 2014 because I couldn't believe how annoying it was. Specifically all the tracks refered to as the future postcards and the one track called pistolero something are dubstep radio static. I can only recall two tracks that were normal tracks you would expect to see in the game(the one with orange in its name and the intro) everything else was either various degrees of what mentioned above while one very specific one was static on pause and play, meaning it would stop every 3 seconds making it even more annoying.Now I am aware half the people dont care about sound and play the game on mute, windowed with their own music or shows in the background. That's why I still recommend this game, would give it a 3.8 / 5 despite being a boosted flash one because it is genuinely a good purchase and worth your time and money.But when your game sound is downright repulsive, I believe that is something the devs should be aware of.

												This is a wonderfully addictive game. You do gain favorites among your characters, and the tendency of the game to make you think of The Walking Dead all the time is very cool. The first city kicked my butt because I didn't realize how food worked -- you build or liberate farms even if you don't have anyone to farm them. (They make food by themselves.) I love the variety of events that come to play -- I don't know whether the game will suffer from sameness over time, butt I'm gonna make it show me. Two cities into it I'm still loving it.I just got a character that looks for all the world like Scary Carol from TWD, and she got all the deadliest bonuses without my trying (or cheating). I love her. I'm definitely taking her to the next city! (You get to take three with you, and that's cool!)It's amazing how serious a loss can feel when it's done in cartoons: I had a great leader in a cowboy hat, my Southern preacher. Leadership skill was up to 12 and he tried to talk some recruits into joining. They killed him. Wow. Yep. <sigh> Hit me very much by surprise. I can remember staring at the screen in shock decyphering it. Yep. The game has got me!Enjoy it. It's one of the ""just one more turn"" things that'll keep you engaged four hours after you shoulda gone to bed.			"

								Worth the Early Access purchase.  I love this game.  I never played 1 or 2, I saw this game recommended on another website, and I've loved it.It can be a little on the 'short' side, depending on how you play.  I've been working through difficulties, map size, and factions.  22 Hours, and I'm not yet done, I'm finally doing Impossible Diff, Epic Map Size (truly huge) and 7 other factions (maximum).With the proposed / expected updates I can't *wait*.  I think there's great replayability.  There's random events - and don't get too attached to your survivors, they may wind up dying in random events or being sacrifices.  I managed to keep 2 of my most important survivors with me through 6 different towns, their skills were so important.I will be honest, the price might be a little much compared to what's currently available.  I'm impressed by the stability and current depth, and have *no* doubt it'll be worth the price with the coming expected updates.			"

								I fell in love with Rebuild 2 and have been following Sarah Northway ever since. When Rebuild 3 came up as a Kickstarter I had to get in on the alpha as soon as possible :)  So I've been playing this game for a while, through various incarnations. Each update to this game adds so much depth, both character/storywise and gameplay-wise. It is obvious that Sarah has invested a lot of time, love and attention to detail. You also don't get a lot of developers that interact with and listen to their fans on such a personal level. Well done Sarah!!If you like city building games with an element of citizen management and enjoy post-apocalyptic themes you will enjoy Rebuild 3. Each survivor has a specific skillset (figher, scavenger, engineer, builder, leader) and has their own detailed backstory that is revealed to you over time, with associated perks/buffs related to their character. Survivors can form friendships or become enemies with each other, can develop relationships, and even get married and have kids. LGBT individuals and POC are well represented which is great to see. In addition to the survivors in your fort, there are at least 11 different factions that you can encounter out in the city, all with unique leaders and goals. Your willingness to either work together or sabotage/raid them for your own benefit will determine their interactions with you - whether they become trade partners and allies or enemies that want you dead!There are tons of random events that add flavor and grit to the game. You will encounter and make tough choices about cannibalism, slavery, prostitution, disease/illness, gambling, starvation, cults, forming a new constitution/citywide policies, and fuzzy wuzzy bunnies. These choices have consequences that follow you throughout the game. You may also receive help from unexpected sources. And above all else, the threat of zombie invasion is ever-present and guards must be ready for a breach at any time!			"

								I didn't know what to expect when I got the game. I was hoping for a city builder with event driven challenges.So far I like it, and I find it a good time sink for a game that is an Early Access Release.Pros:- UI isn't bad, it's not fully intuitive, but I've been able to figure out most things quickly- The events are neat. From figuring out what to do with a cache of discovered rabbits, to faith getting established within your community, to an inconvienent zombie uprising keep things interesting from turn to turn. Especially as you discover other factions that in turn activate new potential events.- The survivors are varied and some of them are interesting, especially finding children survivors.Cons: - Tech tree isn't accessible until some point later than I've made it so far, unless you get some random event that teaches you an item on the tech tree (it might not even be something to be unlocked, or I may simply be missing something).- The survivors being restricted to a single ability level-up ability is annoying, as I always end up with a very disproporationate number of fighters, and not enough Scavengers or Leaders it seems. Even as the pace and number of attacks pick up, I still found a half dozen fighters that I wished were something else, so I kept just trying to kill them off.That's about it. I find that I can easily put a couple hours into the game, and the cons aren't deal breakers for me. Just things that seem off.			"

								Just like many others, I enjoyed playing the first 2 rebuilds. They were fun flash games I had found on Kongregate. I was ecstatic to find out the second one had been released a year or too later. I played the living heck out of that game and was able to get all the badges eventually. I looked into the comments after I had played it for the first time in a year and heard that the 3rd one was being kickstarted. I was getting a bit skeptical at that point and found it on steam, it had already been a successful kickstart. I bought it the next day when I had time and started playing it. It didn't have all the nice features it had now but it was still a great start, and I was beginning to enjoy more then the second one. I played the game progressively, after every update, waiting every month to play with new updates. I have been finding some bugs and reporting them, hoping they get squashed! Recently, I have been playing campaign mode and finished it. I have yet to beat Trail on impossible mode, I wonder if it has been done. Overall, I love this game and hope to see it progress further!

Many thanks to the reviewer who suggested going online to play 1 and 2 (free), because that helped me to decide to buy this.It turned out even better than I expected. People who love management-type games will love this. I had a great time managing people, taking back the town, getting people's skills up, etc. That I could pause as I pleased (and make it turn-based if I wanted) made it even better. The addition of the overlays also took gameplay to an even more enjoyable level.The backstories are a bit of a drag after a while, and I found myself skipping over some. However, as the one negative I have to list, it's certainly not enough to stop anyone from having fun.			"

								This game is totally different from all the previous versions that I've played on the PC and Android.  The newest edition of the Rebuild series has become more of a simulation than strategy in my opinion. You can set your character's previous occupation (still could use more professions like military), and the looks of your character/avatar (limited for now).  There's also different factions/gangs that you have to deal with (diplomacy comes into play here).  There's even children in the game now that adds to morale and the story line as well.What hasn't change is the theme of survival horror.  You're set in a post apocalyptic world in a city where you have to retake the city and rebuild civilization.  The goal is the same, but the journey is different.After playing the short time since I got this game, I found that this game is a refreshing retake on the Rebuild series and shows lots of promise.  I give the developer credit for turning out a masterpiece even if it is still a work in progress.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy and or simulation games.			"

												If you are a fan of the rest of the series, don't be put of by the change of art style -- I got used to it and you should too. It's also taken a step away from the ""dark"" theme the previous games had in a general sense, but in a narrow sense it's SO much darker... so don't let that put you off either. For people who are not familiar, this is a GREAT casual turn-based strategy game that is easy to learn but as challenging as you want it to be. I was constantly (for forever) just wanting to do ""one more turn""... and that's a sign of a game that holds attention if ever there was one. I *REALLY* wanted to win the story, but failed hideously the first play-through and missed BARELY the second time. It'll be a while before I try again, and next time I'll be using a walk-through, because I found it  little punishing with how long it takes to get through the entire campaign that it is SOOOO EASY to miss a mall detail only to discover HOURS of gameplay later that your victory is impossible. So it's punishing in THAT regard -- but I loved this game, it's engrossing, brings good atmosphere and mechanics for a zombie apocalypse, and adds diplomacy, character progression, and a variety of other new elements that just make the game that much more fun.

												Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is a light-hearted zombie apocalypse game in which you find yourself starting off in a humble encampment. Your goal at first is quite simple - rebuild - but there are also other matters that require your attention. You'll find out soon enough that your beginning supplies are only going to last you a short time and that, in order to survive, you will need to send scavengers out into the city to bring back precious resources such as medicine, food, ammunition, and building materials. However, time does not idly wait (unless you play turn-based mode) and there are still more things to be done during the day. You will need to research various technologies to improve your people's lives as well as constructing new homes for them to live in. Of course, you will also need to provide buildings to boost their happiness such as bars and churches but this extends to things such as pets too. Eventually, you will find that your survivors begin anew and form relationships with one another ranging from enemy all the way to husband/wife. So what are the qualities of the game that make it something everyone should try?  Easy to learn Easy to interact with the various elements of the game May initially seem uninteresting, but becomes very addictive. ReplayableThe campaign itself can be either fairly short or long depending on the difficulty, as well as how many of the side objectives you decide to pursue. The story itself is, for the most part, your standard zombie apocalypse drama. However, humour has been sprinkled generously throughout the writing in order to cast a slightly happier light on the situation. Many of the survivors also have their own stories which they reveal in bite-sized portions throughout the game after you've researched survivor management. These also come with the opportunity to select a new perk for your survivor which can include things such as Firearms Training, or being Stinky.The graphics are a massive improvement over the previous two games, and quite interesting to look at although there is a little inconsistency between the faction leaders in terms of their graphical style. An example would be comparing Senator Davis to Farmer Bucket, although it should be noted that such a thing is negligible. The sound effects are probably the weakest point of the game as there aren't very many of them at all. It doesn't detract too much from the experience, but it definitely would have been a boost to the atmosphere to have more sounds going on throughout the day.The music of the game is fairly good and some of the tracks add to the atmosphere of the game quite nicely. It should be noted that there are several 'ambience' tracks which play in addition to the main ones which is an interesting design choice. However, it does pad out the time between each of the tracks playing so that the music doesn't become annoying too quickly. Overall, the music fits very well with the light-hearted atmosphere of the game.Overall, Rebuild 3 is a great game and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a light-hearted strategy game snack. The game is interesting enough that you will get a fair amount of playtime out of it, and it is one that you will find yourself coming back to every so often.

												How have I not given this game a positive review yet?Its a fun 4x game about rebuilding after a zombie apocalypse.  Its a little lite with some of the factions, and the story doesn't work perfectly with dealing with factions after you wiped them out, but the game is great and some minor issues can be easily overlooked for a very fun experience.  More than worth the 15 dollar price tag!			"

												If you are a fan of the rest of the series, don't be put of by the change of art style -- I got used to it and you should too. It's also taken a step away from the ""dark"" theme the previous games had in a general sense, but in a narrow sense it's SO much darker... so don't let that put you off either. For people who are not familiar, this is a GREAT casual turn-based strategy game that is easy to learn but as challenging as you want it to be. I was constantly (for forever) just wanting to do ""one more turn""... and that's a sign of a game that holds attention if ever there was one. I *REALLY* wanted to win the story, but failed hideously the first play-through and missed BARELY the second time. It'll be a while before I try again, and next time I'll be using a walk-through, because I found it  little punishing with how long it takes to get through the entire campaign that it is SOOOO EASY to miss a mall detail only to discover HOURS of gameplay later that your victory is impossible. So it's punishing in THAT regard -- but I loved this game, it's engrossing, brings good atmosphere and mechanics for a zombie apocalypse, and adds diplomacy, character progression, and a variety of other new elements that just make the game that much more fun.

												I played the original games on kongregate and they facinated me. Not just killing zombies in a dumb shooter and just surviving but taking charge as a leader and rebuilding the city in your image. Then I found a kickstarter for rebuild 3 and I was so happy. Got early access to it as soon as I could and remember playing it when there were barely any models in. It is truely unique as no other game captures the nature of manging survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Truely fearing random events and hordes. Losing your ultra badass soldier on a routine mission and trying to cope as your defences faulter. The campaign is suprisingly good for an indie title, especially an RTS. The last mission, I'll try to avoid spoilers, is still one of the best build ups of tension I've played, and it was a strategy game. This game is a masterpiece and even after 200+ hours I still encounter new things every time I play. Furthermore if you do play I would recommend listerning to hollywood undead while you play. It just blends perfectly.			"

												I absolutely enjoyed the game! I found it way better than the first and second versions of Rebuild, although they were all pretty good. There are a lot of strategies in the game itself, and the difficulty skyrockets in the harder modes (at least, for me it did! haha). Hmm... I liked almost everything about the game... the achievements, the story. Oh! The story! I haven't finished the game yet, but the story is very well written and events that happen in the story are good too! I would rate this a 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in strategic games!			"

												I adored the rebuild 2 and its a game which ive completed on multiple occasions on varying difficulties. Rebuild 2 offers a not too serious but gritty feeling survival game. Unfortunately this feeling is not portrayed in this version, instead of feeling like an on the edge survivor i just felt panicked and defensless against the rididculous amount of early game zombies. I struggled to find survivors who actually were able to fight and offer me a better chance of survival.This said the game isnt completely terrible but i struggled to stay interested in its gameplay.

The overall strategy that comes from this game is where do I need/want to expand to first.Overall recommended, just do not expect a difficult strategy game that tests your ability in the long run.

												Fast Review here....This is NOT the same exact as the previous 2 Flash games you can play for free. This is a completely new version that is much deeper & really fun. Yea, the others are fun too, but I do enjoy 3 much more than the previous 2.Plus, buy the Dlx ver & get Steam versions of 1&2 included.I highly recommend this game for anyone who played 1 &/or 2 on Kongregate, etc. I also highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys simple, fun games that have mild amounts of strategy, are slightly repetitious, but enjoyable enough that you don't mind & keep playing it over & over anyway.I waited & got it on sale, but after playing it for 50 hours, I realize I would have been quite happy w my purchase had I bought it full price. Plus, this Dev is a good person, is very interested in making fun, enjoyable games, & deserves our support. So buy it, play it, & enjoy!			"

Others have mentioned the tediousness of some of the tasks like exploring and I'll echo that complaint. I'll also add my disappointment on the limited functionality of the buildings. It would be nice if they had different buildings address different branches of the research tree, for example.Overall, it's good for several hours of entertainment, but I wouldn't pay too much for it.

												Strong buy recommendation.I enjoyed Rebuild 1&2, and was a little leery of the new style for this game.  But I'm really impressed.  It's faster paced than the first two, and is a fun balance between combat and city building.  Sucks hours out of my life...My only complaint is that the upgrading system sucks.  You have to manually click through every survivor, talk to them, flip through pages, all to pick one trait.  Then if they have multiple levels, you have to do it all over again.  Breaks the flow of the game, but a minor gripe overall.Best part of the game is finding ways to optimize your build & expansion order.  With each passing city, you get to apply the skills you learn in a meaningful way.			"

												If you haven't played the first two games in the series, Rebuild's predecessors are available for free on several different websites. I would recommend starting with the second one of the series to get an idea of what you're getting into before you decide to buy the game or not.The story in Rebuild 3 is much deeper than either of the first two games and is a more entertaining experience than the sandbox gameplay option even though the way you play in both are exactly the same.It's a fun game to play and you can drop it at any time and come back to it knowing exactly what you were doing. If you forget what you were doing, the interface will give you a good idea of what's going on when you reload it just by looking at the screen, once you are familiar with the game.It does get boring after playing for a long period of time so I would recommend taking a break every once in awhile.

												I don't have alot of playtime on this game, but I'll try to go through it properly.First of, I loved Rebuild 1 and 2. When I heard there was a third game coming up, I was excited. When I heard it was going to cost? No so much, but I decided to give it a go, if only to support the devs for their two previous games. I expected it to be at least as great as Rebuild 2. My opinion? Deadsville is far, far greater, and worth every penny. Now to the review itself.Let's begin with the zombies. What's a zombie game without zombies, eh?In Rebuild 1 and 2, zombies surrounded your fort all the time. They could attack out of nowhere, anytime, and the risk of injuries/areas of the fort depended on the surrounding zombies - the defense of the fort, which was survivors on duty/idling + some buildings like marts and police stations.In Deadsville, the zombies still surround your fort. But here, they can only attack once they have ""massed"", similiar to a Zombie Horde, which will be marked on a location around your fort. They won't attack as soon as they're formed, but you will need to station some to prepare once they have. You can also attack the massed zombies if you have the strenght for it, but it's generally a better idea to wait for them to come to you.Zombie Hordes are still in this game, fullfilling the same purpose like in Rebuild 1 and 2, and just like with ""massed"" zombies, you can attack them instead of waiting for them, but you REALLY should wait for them to attack instead, much safer that way.Now, let's talk about survivors.In Rebuild 1 and 2, you'd have alot of survivors. You generally didn't bother remember their names or faces, since you'd eventually have too many at once. There would be so many to recruit, that if 4-5 died, you wouldn't give a damn.In Deadsville, you have slightly fewer survivors, but they feel abit more important and personal. You most likely won't see 12-16 surrounding your fort at once, so each one you see will give you the feeling ""I have to recruit him/her"".Also, now you will see where they are and what they are doing, similarly to how you could see where the Zombie Horde was in Rebuild 1 and 2, in the form of a marker. Placing a survivor in the fort randomly will NOT add to it's defense. Instead, you must place survivors inside the fort next to zombies markers, so they will defend the fort once the zombies decide to attack.Next: factions. You remember the Riffs, the Last Judgement Gang and Gustav? They're all here and more, each their own faction.In Rebuild 1 and 2, the Riffs, LJG and Gustav where all events that happened, the Riffs killing zombies randomly, the LJG trying to attack/rob you, and Gustav appearing to trade among other things.In Deadsville, the three mentioned above have returned, with a few other, newer groups, and they all have forts on their own (I'm unsure about Gustav, I think he's a nomad(wandering trader)). You can either ignore them, trade with them, ally with them or destroy them. Destroying is dangerous, obviously, but it's faster should you have alot of trained soldier-survivors. Allying takes time, but it's safer, if a bit costly, but it will be more worth it in the long run.Almost at the end are we? Let's look at resources.In Rebuild 1 and 2, there was food and happiness. Few and Simple.In Rebuild 3, there's those two and materials, ammunition, medicine and fuel. Materials is used in building barricades (that is, expanding your fort.) or re-building a useless building to something... well, usefull. You can get more materials by scavenging, trading, destroying a building or chopping wood(will be explained later).Ammunition is pretty self-explanatory isn't it? It's used during events (mostly defense where you more than 0% danger) or if your survivor is equipped with a gun and uses it while attacking/defending. It can be acquired by scavenging, trading or crafting (will be explained later)Medicine and fuel is used mainly in events, and can be acquired through scavenging and trades, and used in events and trades.Finally, let's talk about Survivor Classes.In Rebuild 1 and 2, there were Soldiers, Scavengers, Researchers, Builders and Leaders, each with their own, obvious purpose. In Rebuild 2, you could train each and everyone in all the fields, making them all-around epic units (jack of all trades and master of all).In Rebuild 3, Researchers have become Engineers. They still research mind you, but they, like the others, fulfill more than just one purpose. In the Engineers case, they also ""manafacture"" items, ammo and more, depending on how much you have researched.Soldiers I think hasn't changed any.Scavengers were pretty damn useless after early game, when you got food through farms, when your survivors had maxed stats so giving them items were pointless, so that all they could do was sit around or help out with the fighting. Now, they have two new reasons to live. First is hunting. On some specific places, there are ""fields"" where wild animals live. You can send a scout to ""hunt"" regardless if the field is in your fort or not, to acquire food. Like farming, bartering etc, this is a ""endless"" job that only ends if a Zombie Horde gets too close, or you tell the Scavenger to come back. Second is stealing. As said earlier, there are factions with their own forts. A Scavenger can be ordered to steal from them, the greater his scavenging ability, the more likely he is to succeed. Do note that the faction will like you less (duh).Builders have changed alot aswell. They, too, have two new reasons to live aside from expanding the fort and re-building usless stuff. First is chopping wood. You know materials? Send a builder to a forest or a place with trees in general, and he will go on an ""endless"" mission to get more materials. The higher his builder-level, the more he will get each day.Second is farming. Yes, farming. Anyone can farm, but a builder nets a greater result.Leaders helped recruit new survivors. Well, now they also hang out in the bar or church for the sake of increasing happiness or talk with other factions.Firstly, they can be stationed ""endlessly"" in a bar or church to increase happiness in the fort, just like in Rebuild 1 and 2. Exactly how it works I'm unsure of in Deadsville, since I've stationed a level 10 leader in a church to ""preach"" but happiness wasn't visibly affected...Secondly, sending an experienced leader to another faction will make it easier to befriend them (you may find out if they need something, or get better options when talking with them (for example, one faction wanted 5 traps, but my leader was high level enough so he could convince them 1 was enough))There are also alot of events surrounding your survivors, which can grant them various perks, but I won't go into that. Don't want to spoil the fun now, eh?All in all, it's a great game. If you enjoyed Rebuild 1 and 2, you can and WILL enjoy this.			"

												I play on easy as a casual timesink. A fun little game. You can play it turn based or realtime/slow, so it's not a big stress.Survivor/inventory management is a bit tricky as  you can't really go from one survivor to another in one click. It puts me off playing it at higher difficulty, becuase survivors need to be micromanaged, and it's too much effort.			"

												This game has not bored me at all, and I am pretty far into it. I have always been a fan of the Rebuild series, and the introduction of the factions have turned the game on its head. Graphics are amazing. Would buy again!			"

												It's a cartoony, strategy game. I'm not the biggest fan of games that revolve around ""zombies"" but this is a wonderful, yet simple game. It's not too complex, therefore you can easily just jump in. There is some depth, but if you enjoy deep hardcore strategy, this isn't for you. Whereas, if you enjoy a laid back, relaxed, slow-paced strategy then this is perfect.			"

												I loved playing the flash version of this game.  When I found it on Steam I had to pick it up.  It was on a great sale, but I would have paid full price and still would have been happy.The game plays even better now.  Quite happy with the differences and new details. The improvements on the flash version just make the game even more addictive and playable. My only concern is the speed of the game, but you are able to control most of that.  It just seems that there is a big difference in the 3/4 speed (touch too slow) and the full speed (just a little too fast).  Honeslty its not even a real complaint, just trying to give a positive (almost everything!) and a negitive (one slight thing).			"

												This game is a real-time-simulation zombie survival.  The player leads people in a community (3 to over-100), scavenging food and materials, clearing out city blocks, building barricades to wide up safe areas, and inviting/pursuading other survivors to join.  There are other communities out there in the harsh world, and you have to keep good relations with them.Once you finish wiping out of zombies in a city, it is time to move to another city, hoping to find the cure...  As same as its previous games (Rebuild and Rebuild 2), Rebuild 3 can be really challenging, though it is not unbeatable.  A ""must to buy"" game if you like zombies or want a tough RTS game.			"

												I used to play the original flash games, enjoyed the first one and really loved the second one. I thought while the cartoon style of art wasn't as serious as before, it was a nice change, and I really liked it, probably even more. I haven't played the campaign yet, but I think that the skirmish mode is lots of fun, and it is really great for casual strategy gamers.			"

												I remember playing this game on notdoppler back in the old days of flash gaming, I packed in so many hours. Imagine my excitement to see a fully developed version on Steam! I thought the game was good then, but this remake has pushed Rebuild to its full potential. Highly recommend this perfect blend of city builder + zombie survival.			"

												A fun stratgey game with a good main plotline. Kinda feels like Civ Lite version (less complex but more or less the same thing).The only negative things I have to say about it are that it becomes repetative about halfway through the main campain, there's not enough variety in random events/factions. One kind of minor detail that really bugs the hell out of me though is that you encounter several of the same factions repeatedly over the course of the game. You're given the option to go to war with them and if you choose and when they're defeated you can murder all of them or have (make) them join you but their leader always mysteriously vanishes. I know it would have been a little more work but I wish all they all had local leaders so I didn't have to wipe out the same leader over and over again. I had fun throughout the entire main campain but I'm tempted to give this a bad review because the method to get good/true ending (no spoliers) is the most assbackwards obtuse thing I've seen in awhile. (I'm talkin I would literally never figure this out by myself on purpose or even by accident and even with a guide it's rough) but ultimately I had fun and once I power through to get this stupid ending I never have to do it again.

												I've been a fan of the previous Rebuild games you can play on your browser, and it was a no-brainer for me to support the early release of this game (I got it over on Humble Bundle). Game is a solid choice if you are into 4X games. Your task is to build and maintain a city after the apocalypse, and you will be faced with many important decisions along the way. You will manage relations with other factions, as well as managing your own survivors and trying to help them all get along and thrive in this new, dangerous world. Other than Zombies being a threat, there are many random events that can happen to put a spin on things when you think it is getting too easy (or in my case often happen when things are already difficult). The game can be played in ""real-time"" or more traditional ""turn-base"", which can add to the difficulty (in my opinion). Lastly, I really love the music in this game - it's very fitting and it doesn't annoy me during hours of gameplay.			"

												I didn't think I was going to like this after the first few minutes in the game - it has a huge mobile app feel. But once I got past that, I noticed the nice interface, the charming graphic art, the interesting story, the strategic choices, and the overall addicting and fun gameplay. I'm very glad I purchased this little gem! It may not provide tons and tons of hours since I can see it getting old eventually but for now I'm loving it and having a blast in the story mode. This is a great buy if you need a temporary zombie survival game to get you through the week. It offers a ton of fun choices and fun gameplay.			"

												I am dissapointed, the reason why I give this a thumb up is because its by itself a good game, I just hate the artstyle and that everything is so childish and dumb, it does not feel like a zombie apocalypse, its a ♥♥♥♥ing children playground, I liked the earlier games far more by scenario/story than this. However, the gameplay isn't bad and it has some nice features which was entertaining me for quite a while.			"

												I've been playing this series of games for a while on multiple platforms over the years and this one seems to further refine the ideas that she has developed over the course of these games. Managing your survivers while also trying to expand further out, while also trying to fortify what you already have established, while also dealing with the oncoming horde of zombies, while also trying to strengthen your best characters, while also managing your limited resources, while also manging all their interpersonal stuff lends to a fun game of trying to balanve all the spinning plates!Ultimately nothing is more satisfying than clearing out a whole city just because you've finally got to the position that you can!The only con: like most games in this genre, once you've established a ""method"" to winning, its hard to to lose. But that's the problem most games like this have, be they Civilization, Endless series or whatever! "

												I played a lot of the first two games when I was younger and I have to admit this game is quite the step up from the other two. I enjoy this game a lot more (which surprised me) and have enjoyed the fact that this game feels harder than the previous installments by a long shot. I love this game a lot and don't think I could I refund it like I have a lot of games this past December.			"

												I'll start by saying, i've never played any of the other games in the series. Graphically, it leaves a bit to be desired, but i've seen worse and the art style is consistant throughout so, atleast there's no surprises here.  I've seen some people complain about the art style used to be realistic and gritty, but everything I can find of 1 and 2 doesn't fair much better graphically so, I guess it's all in your preference.  The game play is mostly a good strategy game, but you can rinse and repeat the levels fairly easily.  I found the lack of info when I purchased it in regards to the difference between the deluxe and regular a little less than helpful, but really, unless you really want the extra five or so classes, the ability to play the first two games, then really save yourself the cash.  I got it on sale for 8 dollars, I wouldn't spend a whole lot more on it.  It's not the worst game in the zombie genre, it's not the best, the controls are easy enough, and the menus are easy enough to navigate.			"

												Great game, I played the second on mobile, and freaked out when I heard a third was coming. Waiting for this game was like dying every day in anticipation, I remember I was so happy to practically throw cash at Northway, I bought it on mobile and PC. I do play mobile more than PC, simply because its on the go, but I try to get my moneys worth on PC. Definitely would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a zombie survival game different from the norm.			"
