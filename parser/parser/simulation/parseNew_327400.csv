												Colonization is a game I played back on a Windows 95 laptop.  The steam version is 100% correct to the old version based on what I have seen.  If you are able to get past the old graphics, this is a Sid Meier's game with a lot of fun to be had.  I tried running this game on a Vista and a Windows 8 PC, both ran well.You play the part of a explorer who has been given free reign by your King/Queen.  You build colonies to gather trade goods to ship to the mother land for cash. There are also Three other Computer players competing with you. While building your Colony network, you slowly receive higher and higher taxes.  After much work, you can build up the Rebels in your country and try to fight for your Independence! Based on the game age, this is a Nine out of Ten!! "

												For those who saw this and thought they could re-buy a classic marvel, adjusted to work on modern PCs and even Linux: no. This just wraps DOSBox (which is free anyway) around the 20 year old DOS binary. With the difference that when using a normal DOSbox you can at least properly configure it. This messes up my screen resolutions, and I have to manually reset them afterwards. Also unlike playing the old game in normal DOSbox, there is no option for windowed mode, despite this game only needing 320x240 resolution.I was hoping for an upgrade from the sometime flaky experience of playing the original game inside DOSbox, but this is worse.That this isn't mentioned anywhere on the game description is borderline fraud.

If you weren't fortunate enough to play it back when DOS was a thing, then prepare yourself for the the gaming glory that the mid-90s had to offer, right here in this game.Sold guns to the Tupi then watched them murder my colonists.  11/10 would arm natives again.

												This is the classic game you all remember, unchanged in any way as far as I can tell.  For those new to Colonization, you'll find this to be a solid Sid Meier strategy game that deviates from the strict formula of the Civilization series.  If retro games aren't your thing, this game was also remade using the Civ 4 engine.The gameplay focuses on building up an economic empire in the New World, with your primary source of income coming from shipping valuable goods back to Europe to sell.  Your eventual goal is to create a self-sufficient nation and declare independence from from your parent country back in Europe.  Along the way, you'll have to compete with other European powers settling the New World, as well as increasingly troublesome (but wealthy!) natives.Starting off, the game is quite forgiving.  The other European powers are generally more focused on building their own empires than on wiping you out, but can and will cause you trouble later.  Similarly, the Native Americans all start off friendly toward you and even give you free stuff, but their attitude will gradually sour toward you, even if you just leave them alone.  This will sound cold and heartless, but in the end, genocide is the best solution, as they will harass you without end otherwise.  The huge amounts of treasure you'll get from looting Indian villages is just a bonus.As I said above, the gameplay deviates quite a bit from the standard Civ fomula.  There are a lot more resources, for one thing: 16 material goods, as well as a few immaterial resources, like liberty bells (increases rebel sentiment, which gives bonuses to production, and attracts Founding Fathers) and crosses (attracts immigrants).  Of the material goods, most are meant solely for selling, but the rest are vital for running your colonies.  I'll explain this a bit more indepth further down.Another difference between this and Civ is that Population = Units.  Aside from ships, wagons, and artillery, all your units are colonists that can be given different equipment to create different units.  Each colonist can be trained in one profession, giving them a bonus to performing that job (usually, increasing resource yields).  When asigning a colonist to work a tile around your colony, they can only gather one resource at a time, but you won't usually need more than one of any type of gatherer except for farmers.  You can also asign colonists to work the buildings inside your colony.  For example, the weaver's house converts cotton into cloth.Colonists are also your units.  Give them tools to turn them into a Pioneer so they can build roads, clear forests, and plow fields.  Give them horses to turn them into a Scout, which moves faster, sees farther, can interact with native villages, and gets better results from lost cities.  Give them muskets to turn them into Soldiers, your most basic and most common military unit, or equip a Soldier with horses to make them a stronger and faster Dragoon.  Also of note is that any colonist can found a colony; there's no ""settler"" type unit like in Civ.As far as ships go, most of them are used for hauling loot and trading.  Of special mention, though, is the Privateer.  A Privateer's ownership is invisible except to the player that owns it.  This means that Privateers can attack other players even when you are at peace with them, but at the same time your Privateers are also fair game to any Frigates in the area.  Hurray for piracy!Another difference from Civ is that there is no research or tech tree.  The closest analogue would be the Founding Fathers, which confer various bonuses, including things like unlocking buildings, and are earned with liberty bells.  Since liberty bells also increase the desire for independence among your colonists (which will eventually net you bonuses to resource production), you'll want lots of them anyway.If you want a strong and self-suficient colony, there are a few things you absolutely need:OCEAN ACCESS:  Since a large part of the game revolves around trade, you absolutely need a way to load a ship up with goods.  Landlocked colonies aren't impossible, as you can use wagons to transport goods to a colony with a port, but I'd reccomend beginners stick with seaside colonies at first.FOOD:  Your colonists need to eat.  Shipping food to a perpetually starving colony is no fun and better avoided altogether.  Fortunately, food is pretty easy to get as long as you're not settling in the arctic.  Food can also be converted into horses, which is important for a strong military.  You need at least 2 horses in a colony and then they'll breed automatically.LUMBER:  Lumber is converted into hammers by a carpenter.  This is how you build buildings in your colonies.  You can buy buildings with gold, but that quickly gets expensive.  You can also ship lumber in from another colony, but this can be a pain.  Just make sure to keep one forest tile next to your colony, as you shouldn't need more than one lumberjack.ORE:  Ore is converted into tools, which are used by Pioneers for terraforming.  20 tools are consumed for every terraforming job.  Also, all but the most basic buildings will also require tools to build.  As such, you'll need to have a steady supply of tools.  And once you're done terraforming and building buildings, tools can be turned into muskets.Aside from the above, everything else is optional.  You don't need sugar, or furs, or cotton, or tobacco.  These will help you make some cash, but they're largely interchangeable with one another.Some last tips:  Remember, the natives are not your friends!  Or, at least, they won't be for very long.  Whatever you do, DO NOT give them horses or muskets.  You can make a lot of quick cash by trading with the natives early on, but they'll quickly wise up that you're scamming them.  You can prevent tax hikes by reenacting the Boston Tea Party, which will increase rebel sentiment in that colony, but also makes you unable to trade that resource in Europe anymore.  Lastly, make sure you're ready for a war of apocalyptic proportions before declaring independence.  I'm not kidding.This game was perhaps my favorite growing up, and while it's aged a bit (really missing edge-scrolling and right-click-to-move), it's still a very solid game, and I'd heartily reccomend it to anyone interested in the genre.

Nostalgia trip!The Steam version of this game is GREAT! I assumed that there would be problems with getting it to run, but it actually runs perfectly. It hasn't crashed once for me and the music is in sync. If you are interested in trying out oldschool turn-based strategy games where the emphasis is on trading rather than combat (although you can still focus on combat if you want to), then you should definitely check this game out. Also, if you are one of those people who used to play it in the past but aren't sure whether to buy it or not, trust me. It's worth it!			"

												Not the Windows 3.1/95 version I was looking for.  The graphics are what you'd expect for a DOS game, pixels the size of sand.  The music is all MIDI, not bad.  Just what you'd expect for a DOS game.  DOS is one word I didn't see at all on the store page.  I was sincerely hoping for the later version as the music was perfect for the game, and the graphics were still better than DOS pixelation I haven't seen since playing Krozi on my old x386.  Alright, yes I exagerate, but its the same shock factor of getting not the Classic I knew.Fantastic game, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was a DOS version.  I'd wait for the Win 3.1/95 version.  I'm hoping it will happen.  I didn't think they'd ever get around to resurrecting what I thought was abandonware, so I do have hope.I'm not upset at purchasing $6 of bits I'll probably not open again, but it's cured me of impulse nostalgia buys for a bit.  The example pics might have been clue enough that all was not as I'd thought.			"

It's a blast from the past for those that played it back then from couple Floppy disks. In this game you simply do what it says in the name - you colonize and do anything else tied to it in attempt to basically take the land from natives and make it your own ""America"".			"

												I used to play this game soon after its first release which was 20 years ago, so seeing it now around here took me on quite a trip down memory lane.The reviewers complaining around here about the game being lazily slapped into DosBox are quite right. As long as the publishers decided to revive and redistribute this awesome classic, they could've cared more about the packaging and the distribution methods. Back in the days there was a Windows 95 version of the game with a higher resolution (640x480 instead of 320x200), but the older, inferior DOS version is the one chosen to be included in this package. Furthermore, I was lucky enough to have the game remaining in Window mode after Alt-tabbing once, but I heard others weren't that lucky with this DosBox version.As some other reviewer said, if you already had the game in other form, it makes little to no sense to get it here on Steam too. They could've added some Steam achievements or trading cards or whatnot to it... but... did I mentioned laziness above?As for the game itself, well, Sid Meier's Colonization was amazing 20 years ago and it still feels good even today. It's just as addictive as I remember it. I also had a good laugh when, to close it, I had to chose ""Exit to DOS"". I was running it on DOS those many years ago on a computer that was 20 times less powerful than my current smartphone. Nevertheless, Colonization aged so nicely. I was quite surprised to see that this 20-year old game is still smarter and more complex than many of nowadays' games. The way it drives you towards the unavoidable climax of having to declare Independence and fight the colonial troops is really impressive as it's discrete and gradual. You know it's gonna happen yet you can rarely feel properly prepared. It's that challenging nature of the 90's games, when games were truly hard and satisfying to win, not just feeding you false rewards.And it's complex, just like it's expected from a turn-based strategy game created by Sid Meier and based on Civilisation to be. You have to take into account the natives, the other nations, the available resources, the ""King's demands"", religions, trades, politics, and so on. Briefly, Colonization is impressively comprehensive especially when you think how old it is.The graphics are decent for a DOS game. Blue is for sea, green is for land, you get the point. :) No one plays this game because of the graphics anyway.I conclusion, I highly recommend the game itself, but also condemn the packaging/the way they decided to just add in on Steam, without caring as much as they've should.

												It's a tricky one this, there are both positives and negatives, but the latter isn't related to the game which as always, is a must buy if you don't own it in any other form. If that's all you need to know, don't read on, buy it and i'll focus the rest of the review on what could have been.A turn based strategy offering, Colonization is a timeless classic that has immense replay value and an excellent soundtrack to boot. If a turn based strategy game is your thing, you cannot be disappointed, it's impossible. However, if you did already own it in another form, whether DOS, Amiga or other, what reasons are there to buy here, other than to have it in your library? I cannot honestly see any other reason. The files and structure are identical to those that have been freely available (rightly or wrongly, it's always a point of debate) as 'Abandonware' for many years now. To run those files, you would have needed DOSBox which has handily been included as part of this package. That may in fact be a positive, Colonization in your Steam library, with one click access to DOSBox and no need to mount a path or create a config file. Some mention of DOSBox on the store page would have been helpful though, given other reviews now appearing about the release.But it could have been so much more, more than what is offered which is essentially old files bundled together by someone that has bought the rights and is selling them at a price, albeit very reasonable. It's just a case of doing very little work and putting it for release on Steam.What about achievements? Imagine 'Achievement Unlocked: Armed Natives & Subsequently Beheaded'. What about visually improving the look of the game itself? Of course, there is a certain romance about playing an older game and the way it looked all of those years ago but it can work, look at Leisure Suit Larry & Secret Of Monkey Island, there is a place for a visually enhanced version of an older title. Such a missed opportunity in my opinion, Colonization: Special Edition* could have been something to take an even bigger pride of place in the collection.*And no, 'Civilization IV: Colonization' isn't it......And apparently if I update this review I receive some sort of silly badge.....

												Along with Sid Meier's Civilization, this is among of my favorite strategy games of the early-to-mid 90's, and I'm delighted to see it on Steam. While the game may seem dated or boring to some, there's a lot of freedom to play the game the way you see fit. Want to be a mostly peaceful trader? Attack natives and/or other European powers to expand as far and wide as possible? Revolt against the monarchy and declare independence? Some combination of the above? Go for it.Yes, this game runs in DOSBox. If that's a problem for you, or if the graphics prevent you from wanting to play, FreeCol or Civilization IV: Colonization might be better alternatives. Nostalgia always draws me back to the original, but I understand this game shows its age and might not be for everyone. If you do give it a shot, be sure to reference the player guide and the in-game Colonizopedia,.. otherwise at least pay attention to the help screens and try to figure it out on your own. Happy colonizing!			"

												In the year of our Lord 1492 four countries, England, France, Spain and The Netherlands, set out to colonize the New World. The expeditionary leader of one of these nations is you. Will you play as the conquistadores and vanquish all natives for their land and their riches or will you perhaps trade your way to power as the Dutch?Whatever path you choose it will in time be clear that your colonies need to fight for their independence. You didn't slaughter the natives? Good for you, now they can help you kick your king's troops off you land. You helped the French in the colonial wars against England? Well guess what? In your hour of need they are ready to repay the favor.Give me liberty or give me death, Sid Meier's Colonization is all about building a strong enough group of colonies so that you can win the war of independence. And the road to freedom is an easy to play, hard to master, game that gives you a ton of fun, and has great re-play value.Sid Meier's Colonization stand out as one of THE all time greats!I remember spending countless hours as a teenager playing this game over and over.I am really happy to see it avaliable on Steam, and at this price, this is a no-brainer if you enjoy Sid Meier-type games.I've also tried the Civ IV version of colonization, and even though it does an ok job of bringing Colonization into the 21st century, the classic still is better. After playing this all day long, I can sincerly say that Colonization is still great fun!			"

But if so, you should probably buy a racing game, etc, as this game turn based strategy game class is inferior in eye candy but superiorer in game content to 9/10 other games out there and thats no exageration.  THis baby was put out by MircoProse in 1994 after railroad tycoon 1 and civilization 1.  One of the best games iv ever played, really.  Although it is dated now I do enjoy some games every couple years.  Basically my advice to you is BUY NOW and please write 2k games an email about coming out with colonization 3 as I did!  =D			"

												Such a classic game that is still enjoyable to play despite the age.The graphic are just pixels, the mechanics are awkward compared to modern games but still so fun to play and still offers a challenging gaming experience, I don't think I will ever complete this game.			"

												This game was a formative influence on my youth. Absoltuely loved it when I first got it back in the 90's and enjoyed re-living the past again.You get to choose to conquer the whole of America, wipe out or live with the tribes that exist and eliminate or trade with your commercial European rivals. Fantastic. Full economy, military and trade management. :)The thing that truly amazes me is when you look at the game, you see many successors in the genre e.g Europa Universalis but this was the first. My hat off to Sid and his boys. Your team's imagination dreamt up the first one.			"

												This game is a 10/10, even after more than 20 years since it was released.* Graphics: outdated, yes. Yet colorful and joyful. And they do serve their purpose.* Music: just beautiful. Incredible music that makes this game one of a kind.* Playability: the learning curve is not too steep. However it will not be that easy to dominate the game.If you like Civilization, this game feels like a spin-off, but with more insight and depth. I definitely recommend it for everyone who likes strategy games.			"

4/5 ::::: Recommended Purchase(Note: I am a Linux user, and writing this review based on the Linux version of the release.)My Steam playtime is currently very small, but I am very familiar with this game from my childhood. I just want to write a quick review to say that although it's true that this release is simply the game wrapped inside DOSBox, it's not quite the slapdash job other reviewers may want you to think it is. Out-of-the-box, this is better configured than the GOG release, which had mouse sensitivity that was way too high. I'll concede that the ""default"" settings produced graphical errors on my Linux machine (the resolution appeared ""oversized"" for my screen, and I couldn't see everything -- I think this Is a very simple fix), but running it in DOSBox Daum, which is an out-of-the-box option, worked perfectly. I don't mind fiddling with config files, especially in Linux, but I've got to give them points for providing an ""out-of-the-box"" option that works!Like the GOG release, the map editor is included (which is AWESOME), and this release even does GOG one better: it includes the original configuration utility. There's not really any reason for the average user to use it, but it's neat to have. Finally, buying the game on Steam gives a healthy $6.99 to Night Dive Studios, who in my mind are the premier retro-remaster studio working today, having done excellent, quality work with Strife, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and soon a complete remake of System Shock. I don't mind giving such an excellent studio a few extra bucks, but if the price seems a little too steep, I've seen it on sale for $1.49, at which price I'd say it's definitely worth it. This is a quality release.			"

												Why you should get this game if you played it when you were younger:I am a classic game lover.Civ 4 still gets a lot of my play time, but the reboot of X-com did well to balance the old game that I loved with new graphics and ideas.Colonization was a great game as it was a different gameplay to civ. a micro management on a fixed time line. A race!I tried downloading it, and doing the dosbox thing, but if any of you out there have experience as a game lover, the right speed, the right grapics, the right windows pack to use: it becomes a nightmare. Often graphics would cut out, flip out, change on a whim. All of a sudden, you'd have Fluoro pink soldiers, and bright green blogs for ships in a black ocean.You want to play the game right? Not learn how to program a niche language from a forgotten time.This is why this game, and worms, and other old school games are worth it on steam. While there are still the old 1992 bugs present in particular situations, the special price of this game at 3 bucks US$ is too good to pass upThat and the movability from system to system for what is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ for evolving systems and the proof will be in the pudding of steam maintaining compatability, rather than spending time trying to fix ancient code for a new audience.5 stars, and thank you Steam			"

												I'm not pleased with this version as it uses DOS Box to work which I think was rather lazy. I remember having a version years ago that ran from my Windows 98 desktop so it must exist. This game is an ancient classic that I love but I can't justify paying any money for it when they finished the development some 20 years ago and have done nothing on it since. I've played the Civ 4 incarnation and that is definitely worth a buy as the graphics are much prettier and there is more functionality.			"

												Microprose in 1994, released perfect game. Game where you colonize the New World and ultimately achieve Independence from Europe. It all begins in the year 1492. Each player starts with a ship and two units a soldier and a pioneer. Once you have discovered new land, your units can make landfall and found your first colony. Now you can produce raw materials such as lumber, tobacco, cotton and iron ore and many other things from them. Fur for fur coats, iron for tools or guns, pretty easy right? You selling things in Europe, buy ships or new colonist. To moment where you fight for you Independence.Be warned. Colonization is highly addictive. Get used to the phrase ""just one more turn"". By the way, there is Free Colonization and Colonization on engine of Civilization IV.			"

												This game is awesome. While I don't have much time clocked on it I can assure you that i've played hours of it (30ish probably). The music is pretty good even though the sound quality is bad. The graphics aren't super great but they aren't nearly as important as the gameplay. The gameplay is more complex then most civs and you will find that expanding too fast is easy as you will lose track of whats going on everywhere because there's so much micromangement.+ Great gameplay+Good music+You can make a nation so that your children may grow up and vote for Trump+Map editor let's you make your own custom maps- depending on what you set the game's sound settings to it will be more or less buggy. Some options make the can not even load.- The AI is stupid and cocky and has this stupid strategy where they surround all your cities with units and just make them sit there and do nothing.- The graphics and sound quality are bad. (it is after all from the 1990s)- theres's only four nations to choose from.- Spain's bonus is that you get extra strength when invading indian cities/camps. However the more indian camps/cities that you destroy the less score you get at the end.**score is how the game measures how good you did. They have no effect on if you win or not.** just so you know the game is run through a DOS emulator.			"

												Gee, whats to say about this game?I decided to buy this game for nostalgic purposes (I played the game when I was 4), but was sorely disappointed. Due to the game's age the controls, visuals, and comprehension of the game are very, very difficult to understand. Its hard to tell what the heck is going on exactly, and almost as hard even to care.Yes, I understand its an old game and so these things are to be expected. But I found myself unable to understand what everyhting was, and only through my experience with Civ IV colonization was I able to (sort of) play. I played 1 game, then stopped. It was just too annoying. Some of the reviews were positive, and yes, if you can understand the game, its probably perfectly enjoyable. But I would suggest much MUCH more strongly the civ IV version.I got a refund for this game, but I still have it. So I might just play it some more...4/10If you can understand the game ~7/10edit- I've decided to repurchase this game. IF I give this game a chance to be understood, maybe it would be a fantastic and laidback sort of game-HydraliskMan			"

												Fun game, very addictive.  Ok for its time but for a game more than two decades old it has limitations.  Haven't found a game like it with a mild sense of humour in some of the diplomacy options, colourful and educational.  The Manual is very enjoyable to read and goes into greater detail about historic figures.  Only issues may be in the end game when you start hitting some limitations and lack of automation, or should I say the inability of the automation functions to work.  Definitely very replayable and enjoyable, and more fun that many recent games I've come across.			"

												Before anything else - I recommended the game, but know this - It's OLD.  It's from around 1995, before internet was a household concept.  The game's graphics were not intended to be glorious.  Now, then...I didn't think I see this one again - An early create-a-nation strategy game, one of many with Sid Meier's name stamped on it.  Very few names stay relevant in the industry as his, over 20 years after the first Civilization game, and now there's Civilization: Beyond Earth.Anyway, the concept begins simply.  It's 1492 - a new world has been found.  This new world can be historical the Americas, a random new world, or one you create.  4 nations, each with an advantage that reflect its history, want to colonize it - England, Spain, France, or the Netherlands.You are placed in charge of colonizing this land.  Explore, find a good place to settle, build, and use the land to create your fortune.Of course, natives already live here - interact with them.  They offer gifts, and teach you how to plant abundant cash crops.  They like to  trade, paying gold for cheap ""Trade Goods.""  But, your colonies grow, alarming the Indians of takeover, and you'll likely end up at war.  Keep this in mind before selling them horses or guns.  You can try to keep the peace (trading helps), or be the Spanish that just burn villages and take treasure.Deal with other European colonies strictly as rivals to exploit.  My strategy is be peaceful at first, let them develop their own colonies, then grab muskets and take it!  I do this because that's THEIR plan too.  These rivals claim they want peace - but if you have colonies on the same continent, their soldiers always like to camp just outside your Fort.When your settlers are not busy turning Ore into Tools into Muskets, there's the matter of money.  Main solution - grow sugar, tobacco, and cotton.  Then turn them into Rum, Cigars, and Cloth.  Load em onto ships bound for Europe.  Remember, prices are based on supply and demand.  Your rivals are also trading, and if everyone is selling Cigars, the price will drop.  It's why Silver always gets lower over time, while muskets and horses go up.Why do all this?  Because you're creating a nation - strong and independent.  Your King doesn't understand this, thinking he can liberally tax you because ""reasons.""  So, your settlers create ""Liberty Bells"", culture points of a sort.  These grow rebel sentiment in your colonies, making them more productive and free-thinking.  They also attract Founding Fathers that offer fantastic advantages to your growing nation.Eventually, boycotting taxes aren't enough.  The time for to declare independence will arrive.   Then comes the true test - the King's denial prompts him to send a GIANT force of Warships, artillery, and  ""Redcoats.""You win by kicking the Lobsterbacks back across the Atlantic, if they're lucky.

												This has been one of my all-time favorite PC games since middle school and I was excited to find it available on Steam.  I still own my original Windows 3.1 disc and instruction manual from the release in '94, but the 3.1 version has been sketchy at best ever since Windows 95 was released with frequent and random crashes that has gotten progressively worse with each Windows release.  The DOS version and 3.1 play exactly the same as each other, the only real difference I noticed are the unit sprites are designed a little different on a couple units (veteran soldiers and fisherman were the most obvious to me), and this version I was able to play straight through without any crashing.It's still a deceptively simple, but challenging game.  If you don't start on a good continent with plenty of wood and ore immediately available on your first turn, you might as well just start your game over, because it has always been pretty unforgiving if you're a turn or two behind the other European powers.  The AI is overall pretty predictable, dumb and aggressive, but I still remember the strategies I used to win this game 20 years ago and it was definitely a fun nostalgia trip.My only gripe, I feel $7 for a 22 year old DOS game is oddly highly priced.

												This is a great game.I played it back in the 90-ties, and even though I was a kid back then, I loved it. I was stoked when Civ 4 had a ""Colonization"" expansion, but was really disappointed. Luckily I found the classic one when it was on sale. If you played this game back in the day, I really really recommend you try it again. The graphics sucks, but who cares, the playability and replayability is amazing. It is both simple, yet advanced in its mechanics.			"

												This old classic certainly has its faults and shows its age in some ways; however, for me it remains one game that hooks me and keeps me wanting to play 'one more move.'  I long for a modernized version of this that doesn't seek to change the core game play; however the open source and Civ IV versions are both lacking in comparison to this old DOS classic. Well worth a few bucks for the hours of gameplay.			"

												Never as popular as the Civilization series, and with a mediocre remake based on the Civ 4 engine, this game is often overlooked. Still incredibly playable, highly recommended for any Sid Meier fan.			"

Build up skills and declare your independence.  Compete against other nations while holding off against your European monarch.  A great game of strategy!			"

Of course it can't stand up to the games nowadays but i strongly recommend giving it a try if you like this sort of games just to get the feeling how it all came to be.			"

												Where to begin with Colonization, I have been playing this game since I was much younger on the Amiga, I still find myself playing it today.Even with limited options and basic graphics the game hits the mark on the gameplay mechanics and makes the experience of playing it fun, maintaining that one more turn syndrome that the sid meier games are notorious for.Nostalgia dominates when playing this game and so I would suggest playing the newer civ games over this if you are new to the series but for me in particular this game will always remain played regularly.

												I played this back in circa '96... keep installing and playing it until I stopped having old windows 98 + XP on the same computer and went full windows XP - no more playing of old games.When I learned that steam had this game, bought it, played it, and finished it a couple more times.Civilization 3 got an expansion that emulated this, better graphics and such... but this old game needs no such thing.It's simple, pure... it deserves no facelift - it's like some 2000's revamp of Bach's of Mozart's... a new version may (if very well done) be pretty, it may sound fine... but in the end, if you like the original, you find yourself stopping it, changing for the original and enjoying it once again.

												This has been one of my all-time favorite PC games since middle school and I was excited to find it available on Steam.  I still own my original Windows 3.1 disc and instruction manual from the release in '94, but the 3.1 version has been sketchy at best ever since Windows 95 was released with frequent and random crashes that has gotten progressively worse with each Windows release.  The DOS version and 3.1 play exactly the same as each other, the only real difference I noticed are the unit sprites are designed a little different on a couple units (veteran soldiers and fisherman were the most obvious to me), and this version I was able to play straight through without any crashing.It's still a deceptively simple, but challenging game.  If you don't start on a good continent with plenty of wood and ore immediately available on your first turn, you might as well just start your game over, because it has always been pretty unforgiving if you're a turn or two behind the other European powers.  The AI is overall pretty predictable, dumb and aggressive, but I still remember the strategies I used to win this game 20 years ago and it was definitely a fun nostalgia trip.My only gripe, I feel $7 for a 22 year old DOS game is oddly highly priced.

												This is an old time favourite of mine. Having recently played through again, it was great to step back into this old time game, take on the America's and build a colony. The graphics may be pixelated, but that adds to the style I feel like it hasn't aged a day. Challenging to master gameplay, easy interface, good tech tree concept (founding fathers). Limited units makes this a true strategy game over a tech race.Runs great on linux Ubuntu/Mint
