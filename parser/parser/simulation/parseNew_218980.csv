Early Access Review
								Yeah, this game is being removed from steam, but I still just wanted to say this is one of the worst examples of early access I own, and I own both Starforge and Paranautical Activity.The game had great potential and was even fun to play in the early builds, but then at some point the dev team went silent.  Then out of nowhere some changes started to be made.  These changes essentially removed some of the fun from playing with the physics, and limited creativity (I had planned on making a bouncy path to my house filled with tricky platforming...that's not possible anymore).  They also still listed on their website that the game has planetary gravity, even though that was removed months ago, so they falsely advertised features to get sales.These alone are bad enough, but I want to go back to focusing on the devs themselves.These are people that pretty much always had to be reminded to post patch notes whenever an update came out.  If people didn't do that, they wouldn't even bother.  They always talked about being able to create your own universe in early videos (they also mentioned water, which never made it into the game), but the truth is you can't make anything unless it's attached to something else first.  And then when you break a huge planet off after making it, guess what?  It will fall right back down, likely pushing you through the floor if you get hit.  Some universe...Considering all the problems the game had that were definitely in need of being fixed that got ignored (terrible camera, lack of information on making formations like bombs, multiple bugs with collision), I'd either say this was a scam from the start, or the dev team really is just that bad, either way, I'm not inclined to buy or recommend anything they make ever again.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play multiplayer just one last time before they shut down the servers...

												I liked this game. It was fun and sort of mine ratty. I just liked to build awesome structures.NOW THIS GAME IS DEAD. It's not like one of those games where poeple just lost interest. No the developers just dropped it. They decided the have more important games to work on and could not be bothered to work on patterns anymore. While they could have just halted development for a while and resumed some time later or put together a final version to give us some closure. But no, that was too hard, they decided to remove this game from steam. They killed their game and left the remains to rot. Honestly if like a refund.			"

Early Access Review
								The game in itself is good and has lots of potential (or it did...).  However, whether or not the game is dead is to me an open question.  I have seen one or two dev posts saying it's still going and pointing people to the dev-blog on patternsguru, but the last entry was 4-5 months ago.  Even if it is still in development they've lost me.  It is totally unacceptable to go this long with zero word to paying customers, regardless of the Early Access status.  Developers need to take Early Access on Steam more seriously and stop using it as a way to scam people or an excuse to drag their heels.  I understand that♥♥♥♥♥♥happens, but please take 5 minutes to post a short ""Hey, here's what's happening.""  I've had this game for quite some time holding out hope that the developers would get a clue, but I seriously doubt they ever will.			"

												I'm so very sad about this game. It's a huge disappointment to me, and I thought it could blossom into a wonderful gem that would unearth from Steam's massive collection of games and see the light of day. This game has been neglected for at least a year by now (you're probably surprised that I decided to write a review in April of 2015). Patterns was a physics sandbox type of game. It's very different to Minecraft. Patterns used to be a very promising game with different materials and a world that you could sculp and build. You could cut down trees and watch them fall (and turn brown, for some reason). However, that feature was a problem, as everything you build could fall if it's not connected to another block. Some buildings could become bombs, even. Use the right material and build a bomb in the correct shape, and it will explode! This was probably one feature Linden Lab wanted to amplify and add to, but as I can tell, nothing much evolved from it. Planetary gravity was an exciting idea, but for some reason, Linden Lab moved it to some small blank slate maps only. I mean, seriously? I played when it was in very very early alpha. You could discover new shapes when you find some sort of crafting table inside a massive pyramid. You go to it and then you make shapes by adding triangular parts to a block, folding them, etc. I think that might have been removed as well, as I can't find it anywhere. Some blocks have special properties. Some hurt, and some are bouncy when you jump on them. When I first played after some map updates, I explored and had lots of fun just by doing that. I'd build fancy bridges and connect the floating islands so that I could explore them and revisit when I wanted to. Now, I feel that there's a little less to see. I can't recreate that fun because the only floating island map there is is not at all very hidden. No pyramids, no mountains big and complicated enough to climb and have fun. I've heard water was supposed to be added, but it apparently never made it. I grew bored and came back when Patterns was dying and soon thrown aside. I never got to see multiplayer for myself, which was an exciting aspect I was eager to try out. Now, Patterns is just a sad and lonely game groaning for attention. It's probably going to be removed from Steam, and cast into the abyss of the forgotten. I get feels just flying around when I try to play, knowing that all the potential I saw was not possible with the developers behind the game.			"

												The store page, and promises they made early on caught my attention. Even though I am at heart a minecraft fan. I spent less than 2 hours playing this cesspool of rubbish. It was interesting only for a short time for the money I spent. Years later it is in a worse state, and should have not been updated. They lied to us about adding specific things to the game, and then they announce they are dropping all support. It would have been much more professional to have stopped selling it once they knew they were no longer interested in ther own product. Atleast so many people would not have been taken by fraud. I realize these things are a risk, but developers who are serious about there craft should always deliver the expectations they made to the public. I will not be buying into any more games from this indie developer. It was a sham, a disgrace.			"

												This game is absoutely boring. I have tried short tiny spurts over several months since I purchased it and realized there is just no point to this. Build what? Ok so you you can do some puzzles and jumping and share your stuff with others or even play other peoples things but what exactly is there to do besides that and doing the side collecting of blocks so you can make more things? This is the most boring game in history. I do not recommend this game. I am sorry but it is horrible. Little confusing platforms with no real idea as to what is going on. If they would of perhaps expanded this over the last 2 yrs it wouldn't be as terrible but besides some fixes and a new ui, there is really nothing here. The universe to create isn't really there because the maps are so TINY. There is no space like in minecraft or other sandbox creative games where you can build things and have a lot of room to do so. You can gather up blocks but then if they fall or break you have nothing. They simply just vanish. It is nice having a game with this concept that not everything is SQUARE blocks around you but this needs a whole lot more in order to feel like a true sandbox. Skip it for now and watch its progress if interested but there really isnt very much here going on with this game however from what I understand, they are no longer working on this game so there may not be any more work to it.Apparently this is just like the game ""windborne"" where the game looks good and gets people excited for more possiblities but then the devs go silent and vanish doing few fixes or offering few features or they get busy with their other games instead. I also don't care for physics in a sandbox game because  it limits and ruins the creativity for me of what I want to build, adding more limitations to what I want to make. For some people that is very exciting but for people who want to build whatever they want, this is annoying.			"

												I can't believe so many people (including me) fell into this scam. I just found out today that it had been cancelled, because I haven't played the game in almost a year. The only reason I even bought it is because it looked like it had massive amounts of potential and they talked about some really promising updates in the videos. It's pretty damn sad, Linden Labs. You use a crappy game to fund your projects and then abandon it and just cut it off completely. And honestly, for the game being as crappy as it is, it's so much better than SecondLife. You should have discontinued that instead and updated this. Or you could've just told us you were using this to fund some projects and people would've been way less♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And I hope you realize that this stunt of yours probably caused a boycott and your ''upcoming next-gen virtual world'' is gonna go down hard.

Early Access Review
								Patterns is one of the nicest looking and best feeling sandbox games I've come across in a long time. Just like everyone says, it's very similar to Minecraft in terms of how it feels. The major differences are obvious, most shapes aren't cubes, but other polygons, such as pyramids. There are stress physics, so if you were to put too much stress on a polygon, it would break. There are dynamic physics, so things can fall and react with other objects. Somehow, breaking the base of a tree and watching it fall over is oddly satisfying. I hope that one day the developers include an infinite world generation feature. I'd also love to see more mobs and better crafting. If the developers took what they currently have and added a few Minecraft-esque features, they could possibly be the next big game. As of right now (January 25, 2014) this game feels a little lacking in terms of content. I am also never able to find an online game. But even with that said, I still recommend this game. It's very fun and future updates are sure to make it even better.			"

I have not had been able to play multiplayer with someone. They promised big things and ideas, and failed to live up to their promises. Don't buy this game.

												Linden Labs are a bunch of thieves who can't even be bothered to apologize for what basically amounts to a sham of a game to get a cash infusion.  I will never pay for early access of ANY game, nor will I ever support any future LL titles.  This company might as well go back to Second Life and stay there.			"

Oct 10, 2014They, Liden Lab, have decided to cancel their game entirely. This is one of the worst examples of how to abuse early access. This game had potental, development decided to flush it down the tubes with lack of communcation and activity. They decided to just drop this game and 'focus' on their other games. I will most likely reconsider ever buying something from Linden Lab again.			"

								Patterns, is a game that tries to be like Minecraft, has less features, but wants you to think it is better cause it uses triangles instead of cube. It is created by the same people who made Second Life, and in my mind the quality of the game is as terrible as the customers service @ Linden Labs.Linden Labs is a company devoted to taking the money of it's customers, changing the rules, and profitting by deceptive business tactics. Wow a mouth full right? Well... nearly 10 years of dealing with this company and it's empty promises would leave anyone bitter, it is a point only important cause the lack of content of this game which has been out for a couple years now is just as empty and disatisfying as it's broken promises.

								I have never played a game with more bugs than this horrible piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. There is absolutly nothing to do, except to buld paterns. But  ♥♥♥♥ing wait, there is a catch, the interface were one builds a pattern is completly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing broken. Delete lags the game out, undo undoes absolutly nothing, and an added feature which 'snaps' peices to desired angles such as 90 degrees or 180 degrees has been updated to add in a pelethra of new and uterlly ♥♥♥♥ing useless angles, such as the classic ol' 181.02 degree angle which coincidentaly automaticly is snapped when a cube is trying to be made (making a cube almost impossible to create without wanting to punch a baby in the face numerous times). Oh and look up at the graphics seen in the screenshots above, memorize the fantastic pictures shown there because you will never ♥♥♥♥ing see that again. Not even once. Also, new creatures added, ha. good joke. The lag behemoth which walks around and has the ability to crash the game with every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ step serves zero purpose other than speeding up the eneviitible rage quit from this♥♥♥♥♥♥on a stick game. However, I highly recomend this game if you are planning on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your pc/laptop and then going on a holocaust level killing spree and would like to get into the mood before the deed is done.Your welcome, a loving and supportive gamer.

								When I bought this game, I thought I was getting Minecraft. I wan't thinking very hard and I didn't actually pay attention to what  it really was and I don't really like it. Basically all you do is walk around, collect materials, make new shapes, and place those shapes. Which is kinda boring if you ask me. There is not really a survival aspect at all and if you wanted a game to build in, I still wouldn't choose this one. These are all just my opinions though.			"

												This somewhat of a minecraft clone building engine uses triangles instead of blocks, and adds gravity to the mix, it was quite an ambitious undertaking seeing as there were other similar platforms out there.I played it from early beta and watched it improve a bit before it was killed:- The chilled soundtrack made for a nice experience while playing.- The engine used some common 3D techniques to give the game more depth, blurring, glowy things, lens flares, sounds, etc...- Saving and loading options and multi-player interaction, NPCs and such were added near the end.Well, it was off to an interesting start though the authors decided to drop it so they could focus on other projects.A better idea may have been to release the source code to the public so that interested people could continue with it, alas, doing things creative commons doesn't seem to be in the hearts of the authors for this one, though I would like to thank Steam and LindenLabs for taking the project as far as they did.I will recommend it for the way it was executed overall wasn't bad, all communications were open and diplomatic, there were periods of silence though the most part we always knew what was going on and when to expect updates.

								For an early develoment game this is pretty badass!  I love the concept... Minecraft to me always kinda made me sick to my stomach because the graphics are horrible.  And having no physics engine and only blocks seemed kinda limiting to me.  This game fixes the issues I had with Minecraft.  You actually have to think out how each shape is going to define your build.  I like that... the options are limitless.The only problem I have so far is when I'm in my inventory/Materials section and there isn't anything telling me what that material is... i.e. Copper, Sandstone, etc.  I have to go to the materials editor (which is super ♥♥♥♥ing cool) to see what it is, and back to the materials in my inventory and hope I remember the pattern.  I'm sure this is on the list to fix.Keep up the good work!  Look forward to the updates.			"

												Made promises which they couldn't keep because these 'developers' decided they couldn't be bothered working on patterns anymore... simple as that and I feel cheated for it. This game could have been great. Just like so many other games out there. If you're going to make a game and make promises you can't keep, then at least make your game free, Otherwise you'll just end up with a ton of money and no friends. Pretty sad. Now I'm gonna go make sure no one buys their other games cause otherwise what's stopping them from doing the exact same thing over and over? Nothing. Because these devlopers aren't nice people, just money hungry.			"

								Patterns is such a great game. You can let your creativity flow. You can build whatever you want, whether is be a giant castle or just something simple like a small house. You can also build things such as working rockets, as seen in the trailer. I also recommend to play this game with friends if your friend has this game too. If you don't feel like building, you can still mess around with friends by building rockets, some bombs, etc. Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10. If you choose to buy this game, have fun!			"

												Yikes. Please save your money. Especially now, years after the game has been discontinued. In addition, before discontinuing development, Linden Labs took away many features that made the game FUN. I've spent a good deal of time trying to figure out how to add qualities to blocks (i.e bounciness and propulsion, as advertised in the video above) and for the life of me I cannot find it. There's not evel a keybind for anything of the sort. Also, the servers for this game have been down for a long time, too, so you can't play with friends, and you can't share and/or try out community models and worlds. Basically the only fun thing to do is build structures and topple them down. Even then, If you don't have a great system, larger structures can butcher your framerate to unplayable levels when they fall. The only outstanding feature I can recall is the ""Telekinesis Beam"", this is really wonky and hard to control, I don't see its purpose other than to move or possibly throw an object. You can't control distance with keys. you have to either look at the place you want the object to go from an elevated position, or else it just moves to the maximum distance if you look away into empty space.The bottom line is, the game is NOTHING like what they show in the video, except for how it looks. I have yet to even find a creature like the ones seen in the teaser above. Maybe it would've been better if they had at least left in rockets, bouncy blocks, etc, but they didn't even leave us with that, which for some, might've even been a saving grace for lack of online features. It's such a shame they ruined the game before discontinuing development.Save money, buy something else. I'm very disappointed in this game.And now for a more personal gripe. Unfortunately for me, when I bought this game I was young and ignorant and I paid no attention to reviews, I was too excited for what I saw being advertised. This was also before steam had a good refund policy. In addition, my system at the time couldn't handle the game; it ran at an unplayable 1-2 fps. Now that I'm returning to it I really would love a refund, but unfortunately that's not possible at this point. "

Maybe it would've been better if they had at least left in rockets, bouncy blocks, etc, but they didn't even leave us with that, which for some, might've even been a saving grace for lack of online features. It's such a shame they ruined the game before discontinuing development.Save money, buy something else. I'm very disappointed in this game.And now for a more personal gripe. Unfortunately for me, when I bought this game I was young and ignorant and I paid no attention to reviews, I was too excited for what I saw being advertised. This was also before steam had a good refund policy. In addition, my system at the time couldn't handle the game; it ran at an unplayable 1-2 fps. Now that I'm returning to it I really would love a refund, but unfortunately that's not possible at this point. "
