												I'm honestly not sure how I can review this game without it turning into a gushy love letter to one of the most entertaining and fun games I've come across, so I won't even try to avoid that.Dear Kitty Powers' Matchmaker,You are the campiest game I have ever played, and you are simply fabulous. I love you not only for your adorable looks, but also for your sparkling personality. Often, you can be a bit cheesy, but you always know how to make me laugh.I enjoy the completely nonverbal but totally understandable communication that my clients make, and I love your innuendos and your swingy little music. Sometimes you remind me a little of Cook, Serve, Delicious, in that you are a very well-balanced, innovative, and challenging game in the guise of a loungey little casual game. But don't be jealous, honey, because you are definitely an original.I love that you look at a player less for their reflexes and more for their memory and attention to detail. I really like when you encourage my competitive side and make me want to be the very best (out of all my Steam friends). I also think it's really sweet that you've helped me to get love blossoming amongst my friends (who are cool enough to play this game).I really enjoy your progressive nature, and the way that you make me work to unlock new perks and goals as I play. You keep adding new and fresh things into our relationship, and that just makes the fun last longer.Kitty, you and I have spent several nights with each other, and every time I just don't want the evening to end and for us to part ways. Sometimes this makes mornings very difficult, but that's ok because I enjoy every moment of our time spent together. Basically, Kitty, I am simply crazy about you!Love,Praxis			"

												This game is like eating three pints of ice cream while watching your favorite movie. You have this sinking feeling that something or someone may judge you, but you know what? It tastes good and it just FEELS SO RIGHT.This is a very well thought out dating sim game and I'm happy to still be waist deep within it. Your task is to help your boss, Kitty Powers, make perfect matches. Send your clients off on their dream dates and make sure they don't blow it.Simple enough, right? Not quite. There are types of people to mix and match together while hoping that date goes perfectly. Will it take one perfect date or do you want to steam it out with three dates? Guide your clients by playing mini games to make sure they succeed in winning the affections of their date.If you succeed, you get promotions and you get paid. Getting paid means better restaurants to take dates to, better ways to fancy up your clients (because they REALLY need your help), and other little perks like kicking out the more troublesome clients.The tutorial makes things look incredibly easy, but once that's done, you are almost completely on your own and left figuring out things for yourself. You'll have to understand clients interests and how your little black book works. You'll either figure this out through dumb luck or failing. Either way, there's no harm in making a few mistakes at first. No one's perfect starting out. Even I have a completely ruined relationship from a client that I thought were totally into each other. Oh well, win some and lose some.I love that you get updates from satisfied customers and you get perks from their continuing relationships. I thought that this was a great touch and another incentive to get things right the first time. Another thing that I loved? Making my own profile to send out myself to be a ""mystery shopper"" for my own dating life. Can't wait to see the results to have a good laugh over that.The graphics are bright and inviting, reminding me of traditional time management games. And those games? Those games remind me of addiction. They remind me of ""just one more level"". That's what I noticed immediately. I wanted one more date conquered just because I needed the ego boost. Just to say I was Kitty's best employee (I have no friends playing this so this is my wild imagination), I needed to do more work for more upgrades. Just ONE MORE client! It's very friendly and I'm almost happy that Kitty isn't cartoony because that would take away from the humor that is our wonderful and loving boss. She is quite sassy and pixels just wouldn't suit her, after all.I especially appreciated that there was a bit more inclusion in this game. It's not just limited to man-seeking-woman or woman-seeking-man, the devs did realize there's more than man and woman relationships so I must say I appreciated that option. Thank you. It means a lot that you did that.There is a bit of stereotyping...but more so on the personality types of ""sporty"", ""nerds"", ""hippies"", etc. If that offends you then I have no idea what to say. If you have trouble with characters who are supposed to be ""punk alternative"" speaking with what seems like (forgive if I read it in the wrong accent!) a Cockney/London accent then steer clear. Seriously. British Punks from London stereotypes. I can't imagine anyone hating that but hey, they're there amongst a few other cliches. I thought they were all incredibly adorable characters I really, desperately wanted to see happy. They're very ""human"" with wants and needs and the need to be validated.Even for cartoon people without souls, yes. I'm entirely serious.The more things you buy for your matchmaking business, the harder things get. If you buy better restaurants, you get paid more, but the games get harder and sometimes slightly lewd. Yes there is a game to hold in your fart. The fact I can write a review complimenting a game for recognizing that yes, you have to hold in your gas during a date and it is indeed a game of chance is astounding. I never thought I'd have to compliment a fart mini game.Buy a salon for your business and you can alter your appearance for a better potential mate for your client. Wouldn't that one guy or gal be great IF ONLY your client dyed their hair lilac? Now you can...if you do it quickly. Does that guy/gal prefer a more chic style? Quickly change clothes after you buy an add-on for your salon. They say you shouldn't change for anyone but hey, let's make an exception, right?It's an easily accessible game that truly anyone can play. While I'd keep this for the crowd that can understand dating, I'd honestly say this is really a decent game for anyone to play. It's cute. It's bubbly. You can play against your friends and compare scores. You can even send your friends personas on dates if they're playing. You get bonus points for making matches with real life people and you'll tell who they are by the little globe by their profile as you match them up to people.I can't find a single thing bad about this game, really. It's a little tycoon/sim on dating and it really illustrates the whole luck/chance and repetition that is dating. And I'm not bored! There's always some new curve ball coming at me!Plus Kitty Powers is the best boss I have ever had. If I could just do this in real life with Kitty as my real boss, this would be great.			"

												I bought this of sheer boredom.And I hate to admit it, but it's actually a lot of fun, challenging, and incredibly addictive, though it's nothing more than a gloryfied memory game.Played 4 hours in my first session, and I'm nowhere near having everything unlocked, and have yet to get my first achievement.Basically, you run a dating service, and your job is to pair up couples successfully, by comparing attractions, interests and personality types.Take them on dates, pay sincere compliments (or lie), and keep dates interesting by selecting different conversation topics. While on dates, you get to play different mini-games (mostly memory oriented, as far as I can tell after playing 4 hours).And occasionally, something incredibly funny happens, and it actually made me LOL af few times.Personalities consist of 5 different traits, each with 2 different mindsets and behaviors connected to them.Combining these with a ton of different interests, jobs, hair styles and colours, clothes style, eye colours and make-up (for women), and facial hair (for men), and different accessories, makes up a dating pool with tremendous variety.And this variety is what makes the game interesting.The really brilliant part of this game is, that you start of by creating your own character, by customizing looks to your own preferences, and answer a series of questions to determine your own personality type.And (if you allow) this character will then become a dating option for other players to pair you up.And the game will then send you notifications on how your 'virtual self' does in the dating world, depending on other players choices and skills to determine your personality type.Your character is given a fake name if allowed in other players games.....just in case you're the kind to worry about such things.And as you successfully pair up couples and earn reputation, you unlock different things to add further variety to the game.Such as extented dating options, different restaurants with different difficulty levels, and pre-dating alteration options that allows you to change clothes or hair styles, colours, make-up, or buy gifts to impress your date.This is a well constructed casual game, well worth the price tag, if you're into games you can pick up and leave at any time.I have no problems recommending this game - much to my own surprise.

												Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is an incredibly fun and satisfying dating simulator that you can't put down. You want to play for an hour? WRONG. You will play for several.In the game you run a dating agency and find perfect and not-so-perfect matches for your clients.Your guardian angel, Kitty herself, drops occassional sassy hints throughout the game which require me to breathe in a plastic bag.The game consists of choosing a client, looking at their interests, personality traits and preferences then finding a match in the little black book (a must have *wink*). If the match prefers a certain hair colour you can always change it before the date. Because who doesn't want to change themselves for someone else?Be careful with picking the right restaurant! Each has different difficulties and scenarios. If you can't calculate the right tip, like me - someone who cried on their final math exam, here is a nice link I found to help you out: http://www.onlineconversion.com/tip_calculator.htmMake sure you watch out for your mail as the clients will write back to you whether their relationship has grown or dissolved. With all the weddings I arranged I'm upset I haven't be invited to a single one!I never found anything in my life so satisfying as matching fictional characters and watch them diss each other's outfits and hair. This is why I'm single and spend my evenings playing dating simulators until 1AM..................................................................................................................................................tl;dr10/10 - I farted and blamed it on the waiter.

												If you're looking for something light-hearted and fun, go for it. It has lots of little puzzles in it (one including whether your client can keep a fart in or not!) that pop up, as well as the more long-term puzzle of figuring out each personality type. It's a lot of fun and I think a special part of it is that you can make your own avatar and have your Steam friends paired up. Plus, it's fun telling your client what to do on their date, such as LIE!!! :PYou get feedback from your clients after their dates. Sometimes your clients will end up hating each other that they'll ""decide to move to the other side of the planet"" to escape them, and then some are just so happy they send you a unicorn toy.			"

												It seems simple enough, and it seems like a game that you'll play for an hour and then you'll be done, fix settled and good to go. But it's not. It's far more addicting than that. I sat down because I had a brief window of time and told my self I'd work on one person, That I'd get them paired, easy no problem, and then continue on my day. Not only were they stubborn and had to go through three dates before they were finally happy with someone, but I then proceeded to play through three more people before I got a call asking where I was. Not only that, but it's really fun to see if you have updates from the couples you've paired up. I always get happy to see the letters informing me if they're still together or not, and a little sad if they're not. And I can see myself playing this game for a long time to come because I not only love working on the challenge that is pairing people up, but love the updates. I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you haven't.			"

There are several restaurents you can take your date to which all have different difficulty levels and each restaurent you unlock will unlock a mini-game that can happen in any restaurent from that point on.If you're look for a good laugh or even just a good waste of time I suggest this game, it is a lot of fun.

												I was meaning to write review for this game for some time, but I always wanted to finish it first. That took me quite a long time (and about four approaches), but finally I got to pair-up Kitty, so I consider it some form of ending. ""Kitty Powers' Matchmaker"" looked like a perfect game for me - it didn't take itself seriously, it has great style, it has humor, romance (with LGBT options), fun minigames and aspects of pure randomness, which I absolutely love. Sadly, something didn't quite work out for me.The game has all charm in the world, but it gets boring really quickly - it has a progression system, where you buy upgrades and unlock new options as you go along, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested in moving forward. I've restarted game few times (as I don't like to pick up where I left after long break), and first few dates are always the most interesting and engaging, but once the initial feeling of uniqueness wears off, the content gets very repetitive. Also, I find pairing up low-star folks more enjoyable - it's much easier and dates go very fast, when compared to three star customers or VIPs. Those are, understandably, more demanding, but not nearly enough rewarding, to make it fun, instead of frustrating.Despite my lack of interest, I still give this game a positive review, as it does many things right - I loved the art style, Kitty is amazing, there are funny moments, good mini-games and great ideas thrown there. I'm waiting for a next game from Magic Notion, hoping that it will turn out to be more engaging, because the potential is definitely there. If you like dating games, I recommend to pick this one out during sale and see if it's something you enjoy.			"

Serious review (Humorous, non serious review below): This game is... interesting. You create a character, that is supposed to be ""You"". You choose your looks, your personality traits, your birthday which is also your star sign (Gemini, Aquarius, etc.) Your first date you set up you cannot mess up, as it's the tutorial that's running you through how to play. You choose your venue that you want to act as a matchmaker for. Each venue has different people's personalities. You do kinda feel like a third wheel on the dates, since you're just silently watching them. The goal is to pick up on verbal cues by the dates and give them the best experience. Make the right comments, order the right food based on the hints they give, etc. You can date other peoples character profiles as well. You get coins that are used as a currency to buy upgrades and other things to help you. The better you do, the more coins you are tipped at the end, the higher your reputation goes up, and the more you matchmaking you can do. All in all, it's a pretty interesting game and if you like the idea of setting people up on the perfect date, then it's worth a try.Humorous, non serious review:I am Lord Tippington, a balding, introverted, antisocial, nerd. I have hundreds of hours logged in ""The Sims"", have had many lovers, and as such I feel I am the most qualified to take the esteemed role as ""Matchmaker"".My first day begins now.I have chosen a comic book shop as my first matchmaking venue, I will help fellow nerds such as myself find love. My first individual is none other than m'lady ""Ambrosia Bunfoot"". I tip my Fedora at her. ""M'lady!"" I inquire, ""What doth bring  such an esteemed m'lady such as yourself to my humble abode?"" She does not answer, save for the phrase ""DUNGEON MASTER.""Ah! But the esteemed m'lady is a dungeon master! How could I not have guessed by her beautiful bowl-cut-mullet which appears to be stained by the grease of hot pockets of the distant past?I brush my trenchcoat back and fall to one knee, and grip noble Ambrosia's hand with my cheeto stained fingers, ""M'lady, I, Lord Tippington, am an expert matchmaker and can find you the most noble of men!  Pray, tell me, what interested such a fine m'lady such as yourself?"" It is not long before she robotically belts out the words:""FPS GAMES.""""WIZARDY.""""ELVES.""""M'lady! I had no idea you indulged in wizardry! Pray, tell me, are you familliar of the Wizard's Gathering?"" ""Nevermind yourself with such trivial questions! I will find you a suitable sir right away!"" I tip my fedora as I search for potential candidates.I find a match! I tip my fedora multiple times in glee. He is a fellow neckbeard, with a long, grease drenched mane. The sir goes by the calling of ""Lucas Goldthwaite"".  Tonight is date night, I have chosen a noble English pub as the location. They are taking their seats! I begin tipping my fedora furiously in anticipation.M'lady is getting along really well with Sir Goldthwaite! They're... quite happy together. Happy. Together. My sausage-fingers clench into a fist and shake with jealousy. As I watch in the shadows I notice they order Cheese Cauliflower and a Cheese Board to feast upon. I would've chosen something more bacon oriented, but alas.The date winds down. They have agree'd to get more serious, settle down with a glass of fine champagne in a romantic hot tub, and partake in the age old tradition of making autistic kissing sounds at eachother. I watch from a distance, and stare at the happy couple I have created with ever-growing jealousy and tip my fedora repeatedly with rage.My next dear romantic is a M'lady by the name of Rita. Rita... is b-beautiful. I find myself at a loss for words upon her entry.  I begin sweating profusely, and begin to sheepishly stammer: ""H-hello m-m-m'lady.. can I h-help you today?""She is no different than the damsel as before.""TRAIN DRIVER.""""BUILDING COMPUTERS.""""UFOS.""""READING INSTRUCTIONS.""""I must find a sir for such a perfect m'lady!"" I thought.I turned to my computer and placed my cheeto dust stained fingertips upon my keyboard and began searching the database with expert precision. I have concluded her match is a dirty peasant butcher by the name of ""Frazer Melonthwaite"". A sir that appears to have taken after Mrs. Doubtfire.Date night has arrived and they have chosen an American themed restaurant. It appears to be a 50's style diner. I would have chosen a Taco Bell at 3 am to ensure I would only encounter my own fedora and trenchcoat clad brethren.The two have taken their seats, and Rita, being the kind, and gentle lamb of a lady has allowed the uncouth sir ""Frazer"" order first....He appears to have ordered something without meat! S-surely he must be mistaken! A sir-ly sir that may be suitable to ste- I erm... mean... take the harmless Foal ""Rita"" from my good graces just yet! No! I will h-help him. I will get him a large order of Buffalo Wings! The manliest and sir-liest food in all the land!My dear Rita loves it! Frazer... Frazer is displeased.  My tip my fedora in disgust.I shall try conversational topics next! I have told the sweet, dear angel Rita to ask the peasant boy Frazer his valueless opinion on her attire! ...He hates it?! Oh, my dear Rita how I'm sorry for wasting your precious time with this... dirty individual. He's left for the restroom? How dare he leave such an exsquisite m'lady all alone?! I expect him to be gone for long, as he is likely only accustomed to disease-ridden defecation holes. I ponder whether I should approach her and take his place...Alas, he eventually returns and he appears to have mistaken the toilet as a wash bin, and tried to freshen up. His hair is soaked. It looks awful.Being the fragile little butterfly Rita is, I inform her to lie to this insufferable fool of a ""sir"" that his hair looks good. Alas, she is timid and her speechcraft is lax. He does not believe her, and storms out. Rita is heartbroken, my white knight instincts kick in. I extend my greasy hand towards her and bellow ""Dear Rita! Please allow a true good guy such as myself to court you! I shall treat you to only the best Hot Pockets my mother has to offer, and I will protect you from the evil ""bros"" that wish to harm you!"" She ignores my White Knightery. She is heart broken and  vows to spend the rest of her days in a trash can.In the desert wasteland.During a neverending storm.I tip my fedora in shame and question why no m'lady would allow such a good guy to take their hand in courtship.10/10 Strangest and best blind date & bitter third-wheel-nerd simulator.

												I first saw this game in one of PewDiePie's videos and it made me laugh, so I bought it. In the beginning the game seems pretty easy (especially when watching someone else play it) but as you level up (currently I'm level 19) it gets harder to find pairs that match well and make them a happy couple without lying too much on the date. The only problem I've had is trying to figure out what ""type"" the client and their date are based solely off their interests/hair/makeup/facial hair/clothing, but I'm sure that's something you figure out with time and internet research.

												There are lots of dating simulators out there, but none of the (admittedly few) I've tried has drawn me in like Kitty Powers' Matchmaker. The gameplay is casual gaming at its best, with a bunch of minigames, some simple, others a bit more complicated but all of them fun (except for one, the pachinko game, which is basically a lottery). Playing a date or two is a good filler between longer games, but it's also fun to sink a whole evening into the virtual dating agency.It's a very charming game, fronted by the lovely Kitty Powers herself and full of nice jokes that are so bad that they flip over and become good.What I like the most, though, and what sets it apart from other dating sims I've played, is the way the developers seem to have thought about what dating is and what makes for a good relationship. The dates are all about paying attention to the prospective partner and trying to find common ground. Not only do you get points for pairing off your customers, but you will also get letters with updates on how the relationship worked out in the long run. This means that even though you can speed through a date, hide your weaknesses and pull a few ""white lies"", you will need to be honest and find really good matches to get those A+ results (necessary for getting the baby achievement). All this adds up to a fun, charming and well-designed game which I recommend with all of my heart!			"

												Liberty walked into my offices looking for her perfect match. I rumaged through the choices and offered her the top three candidate profiles, all of which sounded pretty lame but it was the best Kitty Powers' Matchmaking Offices had to offer. With absolutely nothing in common except his documented obesssion with blue eyed beauties, Liberty took my advice and went on a date with loser #1. The evening started horribly, Liberty having selected all-American fine dining at its best with real authentic truck-stop flavours. Except Greg, her date, wants some fancy red meat dish with milk and the only thing on the menu is corndogs and french fries. Liberty suffered through Greg's talks of UFO's and internet meme's, eventually realizing through dull conversation that he shared none of her interests such as celebrity gossip or clowns. At the end of the date, Liberty thought she'd give it one more shot by asking Greg out for a second date. Greg is fairly unimpressed at this point and wants Liberty to beg for a second date. Liberty begs. Guess she swiped right after all.This game is great and doesn't discriminate. It's a fun little memory game with unique profiles for all the clients and date candidates. 10/10 for being Fabulous.			"

												Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is honestly one of my favorite past time games, where I'm feeling like I'm not in the mood for a story, but also not in the mindset for PVP related games. Kitty Powers' is the perfect game to just do when you want something to do but you don't wanna do a ton. It's a very casual game for those, who wanna try to play the covet role of cupid, and try to match even the most odd pairings.Anyways what I love most about Kitty Powers' Matchmaker, is it's openness to sexualites unlike most western-released dating simulators, where they don't bare any LGBT relationships. Kitty Powers' offers freedom and equality, with all the characters being derpy like one another. My only negatives is wising for the game to become more developed and offering a variety of different scenarios and outcomes. I would also like to mention that this was originally a mobile game, for much cheaper price tag, compared to the PC version.  "

												I love this game. It's super silly, quirky and loads of fun. You guide your client through their date and tell them what to do, what not to do, and there are some mini games that arise to add an element of panic and surprise. For instance, whether you can stifle a fart or or lie convincingly to your game. You can even spruce them up before their date to make them more appealing to whoever you paired them up with. It's campy galore and who wouldn't want to run a dating agency with an amazing drag queen diva? It is definitely geared toward a British audience. As an American with limited British language knowledge, I sometimes have to pause the game to look up what they are saying in the Brittania Urban Dictionary but that just adds to the fun! Also, while we are on the topic of linguinstics, some of the meals in the resterants I've never even heard of! But a quick search on the internet proves that they are in fact real and some look super tasty. Anyway, this game is playable forever and now I can watch other people fall in love or get dumped so I don't have to.			"

												Jolly and casual dating themed management game. Fun graphics and humorous situations. Kitty is a gorgeous hostess, too. As the game progresses you're gradually presented with lots of new variables. This might not be a good thing, depending on how you handle frustration. I was on fire until I unlocked pretty much every customer type, but at the end I couldn't really get any matches at all because the customers tastes and styles were all jumbled up and it was impossible to find matching types. At that point it's hard to tell what the customers' type is - if any. Still, I'd say the games is easily worth a dollar or two for a few hours of fun.			"

It's nice to play it as a break between more ""serious"" titles and the humor never falls short. Really good value for the money.You can see me playing it here -

												Tags : Business Management/TycoonA casual game aimed at solving a series of mini puzzles in the hope of matching two people together. Some games involve luck other involve probing each other for compatibilities. Effective style and great sense of humor. Repetitive music and although the catch phrases are funny and the verbal styles for each type are nice they could use more variety. The representation of same gender couples is very high in this game so if this is something that ticks you off either for ideological or realism purposes you might want to skip, but then again the main character of the game is a drag queen so what do you expect. I quite honestly do not get tired of this game			"

												Kitty Powers Matchmaker! What can I say about this one? Well Let's just say, that this game is GREAT! I love the art, ""some"" of the music is good, and it's a charming lovable experince. Sure it's nothing special but this dating game (for the first time in a while.) Didn't fall off the cliff of ""WTF am I looking at"" And its ""REAL"" Dating! emphasis on the word ""REAL!"" For the first time in a while have seen a game do dating (sorft of dating) stuff I'm not play candy crush! I'm not going out with underage teens! I'm not even dating! Not only that, But Kitty Powers Matchmaker Is A ""VERY"" wacky game that doesn't take take anything seriously, But Stays on track with the whole dating phenomenon.			"

												This game might seem childish but it really isn't! It's one of my fave games and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's a great game to play with your friends (you'd be suprised but it is really fun to watch your friends yell when you don't get them together) I enjoy this game a lot and even when I saw it I thought it would be very childish but look at the names of the resturants (There's one called Jerk King and Tai Me up) You might want to try it out, it's a good fun little game!Update: I have been playing this game and I have now beaten it twice and almost for a third time. Ithink this game is a game worth playing as with more items like resturants and gifts more gameplay emerges. I still love this game and still recomend it.(Plus it should totally win a Steam Award, I picked ""5 more minutes"" but you all could pick something else!)			"

You feel like you need to help all the single people in the world and with just one more, you could make a difference. On some occasions it's even frustrating when you've done such a good job and all you see is hearts and in the end, they're just friends. Some challenges are quite odd but I guess some dates are bound to be disasters.			"

												I bought this game on a whim because I was bored and I wanted something fun and ~romantic~ to play. Little did I know that I would sell my soul to Kitty Powers and become the most powerful matchmaker in the universe. Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is fun, cheeky, and surprisingly challenging. I sped through the game pretty quickly, but even so the game doesn't become less interesting because I reached level 20. Trying to find the perfect match for each character has been a fun and occasionally frustrating adventure, and I'm just getting started. There are quite a lot of achievements to try for once you get through the initial learning stages of the game, that can keep you occupied for quite some time. So, if you like pink, drag queens, and challenging yet ridiculous experiences, this game is absolutely for you.			"

												While this obviously lends itself to easily written silly games, this is one probably the most fun - if dopey - casual/tycoon game I've ever played. I honestly don't even know how to describe what I like about it. It's just plain fun. Instead, here is the small list of things I don't like about it, compiled over my admittedly meager 1.5 hours played (in my defense, I bought this at 1 AM on a Monday morning).-Loading seems to happen all the time. If there's a different 2D background for the 2D characters, there will be a load screen, and they're often relatively long. I can usually load a new area in heavily modded Skyrim at least as quickly as KPM can load the lewdly named American restaurant. I feel like load screens and load times both should be pretty minimal for something like this, but I'm no expert, and it's not horrid. Just annoying.-It can get a little samey, and it's probably not something most people want to sit down and play for more than a couple hours because of that. The dialog is modular (i.e. there are probably 5-10 different ways of saying ""I like your hair"" and any other conceivable saying), but you see them a lot. After 30-45 minutes of playing, I stopped reading the unimportant dialog because it wasn't funny or interesting after seeing it a few times in that time. It was still fun, just a little less immersive, especially because it felt like the same people talking. Also, unless things change further in, the dates are all just dinner at a restaurant that consist of a few random minigames from a small pool. While they do vary from each other a little and it's a good formula, it does get old.-A lot of the difficulty of the game seems to stem from its randomness. Randomness is kind of a necessity in a game like this, but I think it has a little too much influence. It's very hard to predict how your client's date is going to react to what you say or the decisions you make, and I think there should be more reliable guesswork, if that makes sense. But maybe I just need to play more to understand. I do like that failing a client too much makes them leave and hurt your rep a lot - I almost got to a third strike with one client and I had to do everything I could to make their last date work out.-I'm not sure if I'd pay the full $10 for this game, just because it remains to be seen to me how much the gameplay fleshes out, but I got it on GMG for $6 and that was definitely worth it. At time of posting, it was $7.49 on Steam, which I would have paid if not for the GMG deal.All that said is just overanalysis of things that weren't big deals. The art is fitting, the voice work and images for the one persistent character is hilarious and well done, and the gameplay is enjoyable and error-free. If you're looking to play a game all day, this probably isn't it, but it's definitely something you can keep on hand and get a few hours of fun out of. It also throws your friends' characters in the game as potential clients/dates, so you can have some fun with that if you can convince someone else to play it. I also plan to break it out at LAN parties so my friend Brian can laugh at me and call me rude names.			"

Posted: May 22, 2015
I'm Hobbes Bauer, and this is the longest day of my life...Some days you get a review, and you know it's fate. Where the game picks you, as much as you pick the game. Kitty Powers is one such game. It's a strange beast, being made up of one part casual coating, one part extremely devious memory games and puzzle minigame, and one part hideous pink topping. Had this been the same mechanics in any other presentation (say, a popcap game), this game would be literally flying off of digital shelves all over the place. The problem stems from well, the insane use of pink, but more of that shortly. Let's get into what the game is about.A dating simulator that's actually mechanically interesting? Say it ain't so!You are a fresh hire in the ever expanding world of the Kitty Powers Matchmaking empire. You have been given a franchise branch in a city, and it's your job to service the city by matching people up and sending them off to find love and happiness (or at least make you enough money to keep you in profit). To this end Kitty Powers furnishes you with two hundred ""Kitty Coins"", a Kitty Powers office which would make Kerry Katona weep tears of joy, and introduces you with a step by step tutorial that teaches you the ins and outs of the basics of the game, as well as introducing you to some of the most basic of the minigames you'll encounter.Once you've completed your first tutorial date, the training wheels come off, and you can use your Kitty coins to purchase anything that's within your level. As you successfully complete dates and match couples, you'll gain reputation and experience, this unlocks more things to spend your coins on, and as it turns out, there's a lot to buy. There's a big selection of restaurants to pick up, there's a wide bevy of make-up customisation to groom your dates before the night out, as well as additional pages in Kitty's book for room for more dates to give you extra leeway in selecting possible date options. In short, this game has depth, which is surprising, it will take you time, quite a bit of it, if you want to see everything.Each restaurant comes with its' own unique events, along with a generic pool that means each restaurant encounter will be different, along with the conversation system (where you ""pull the love handle"", deities help me, that's a thing now) which not only requires you to remember the personality types of each date, but enforces harsh penalties if you repeat topics, not just on the same date, but on previous dates as well. For a supposedly casual game, this one doesn't pull its' punches when it comes to the memory mini-games and layering on the difficulty over multiple dates. You get reminders about topics covered and restaurants visited with a given couple, but the game will make damn sure that you're kept on your toes. It might -look- casual, but under that cute exterior, this game has a rather steely spine.Mechanically excellent, graphically chintzy...It's all presented in this smooth, glossy casual style that immediately evokes memories of Popcap games, and has that easy, big button approach that makes it very straightforward, and friendly to those even with poor fine motor skills (even if the humour sails terribly close to the wind on many an occasion). The art style is very, very consistent, albeit in many cases you're going to wish that the designers had a volume dial and they used it to tone the damn thing down, the game uses neon pink liberally. Great for calibrating your monitor, not great for your eyes, have ice buckets on standby if you intend to play more than half an hour at a time.Herein lies the great contradiction at the heart of the game, the mechanics are good, and in any other game there's the foundation and the scaffolds of something really good. This game hasn't got the positive reviews it has just for being he-he-hilarious. It's got them because when you manage to get past the horrific pink, there's a really solid game under the surface. But the visual design is going to deter people, I mean it uses comic sans fer chrissakes. That's not how you win the hearts and minds of some people. But then I have concluded the audience for this game is likely not the traditional audience who plays things like say, Counter Strike or the likes. Still, softening the pink would have helped a lot.Love can be simple, except when it's not...The game does a really good job of translating both the concept of a dating game, something that to now has always been done pretty terribly, and the longer term effects (by sending letters) using good procedural generation techniques. It's managed this by taking itself ""not very seriously"". This game isn't afraid to poke fun at itself, the loading screens are full of self deprecating humour, the game likes to jibe about various game genres, it asks you to ""Pull the love handle"" with a straight face, it throws chintz about in the same way Max Payne threw bullets.In turning the whole process of dating, love and romance into this utterly comic and slightly off the wall casual game that's both approachable and yet at the same time potentially really tricky, it strikes a fine balance. As you get into the higher difficulty dates, you'll find the memory games get genuinely hard, like, brain training hard. You'll be asked to remember details that you may not have been paying much attention to ordinarily, you'll be asked to remember and pick out the desert from a list as they roll past, you'll be asked to correctly identify and order food based on vague descriptions. As I said, inside this cute chintzy game, there's a really tough nut in the center.It's just too damned pink.The guilty pleasure of being fabulous...So. Hm. How do I put this. It's good. As much as I grit my teeth and press the button to recommend this, it's actually a good game once you get past the first initial dates and the difficulty ramps up. But you'll need a serious tolerance for the visual design (or a good pair of sunglasses) and probably Clicker Heroes so you can hide what you're doing, lest people stare at your Steam Profile and go ""What in the name of gods...""Verdict : Highly Recommended as a guilty pleasure. So do your research first, and/or run Clicker Heroes so people don't start laughing loudly in your chat window. "

												This game is amazing! It's funny, fun and never gets boring. I like how it uses the avatars of other people who play the game as potential matches for your clients. So far I have yet to put a bad match together, but the night is still young. This is the best dating sim I have played, it's not relationship bias on who dates who, which makes it a great game for everyone. I do wish it would calm down on the loading screens though. I am happy with my purchase and I recommend it to all simulation players, whether you're looking for a relaxing game or need a laugh, this is for you.			"

Its actually a giant memory test and the more you get in the game the more you love it, i thought i'd be playing this only for a couple of minutes and in the end i played several hours, always funny when you try to match two completely off types haha, 11/10!

												At first I was very excited to play this game after seeing it so much on YouTube, and admittedly for the first few hours the game was very enjoyable! All the different personalities your clients can have, customising your own character, the different restaurants, mini games and more were all initially very exciting to explore. However after playing a few times the game slowly become repitive and boring. As you level up you can unlock new restaurants, have new buildings added on to your agency (this doesn't affect anything in game) and you get more options for getting your client ready for dates, but other than that, working hard to level up and get better is pointless. You have the same games when on dates and even thoughyou can get harder difficulty restaurants not much changes. Overall this game was disappointing and I regret buying it, I would recommend buying it while on sale, if at all.			"

												Very humorous and cheeky. A very addicting and fun game that can be played for hours. A fairly simple concept but it goes way beyond just setting two people up on a date.  The game mechanics are actually quite complex when you look into it and because of that, it's very rewarding, has great replayability and provides a good challenge. A bit of a guilty pleasure, really. You think you'll just sit down and play for a few minutes.. but then it turns into a few hours. Includes mini games, same sex marriage, an array of achievements that scale from easy to very difficult and a very positive and uplifting sort of atmosphere. The devs are active in the community and are working diligently to gather feedback and put out patches and bug fixes. Always very nice to see a dev team who takes pride in their work and appreciates the community.			"

												This game is a delight. It's entertaining fun that has made me laugh out loud so many times, and I can't remember the last time a game did that. The titular (oo-er) Kitty Powers is probably the greatest part of its appeal, with her strong personality and hilarious quips. The characters are so funny and cute, the mini-games are incredibly fun, and overall the whole thing is just so amusing. It's fun to play, and that is the most important thing in a game.It's also a well-made game and works solidly. It has all the options (and more, really) that would be expected from a modern game relating to display, audio, and so forth. The whole package (oh MY) truly is an appealing one, making the experience a pleasure. Play for a few minutes and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the day, or play for a few hours and go on a matchmaking marathon!I find it especially laudable that both Kitty and the developers have stood behind the game and continue to promote it, to encourage videos, and have even made appearances for the game. They have continued to update the game, and overall they have been exactly the kind of developer everyone loves. It's clear a huge amount of love and care went into this game, and I'm glad to see more people discovering and enjoying it.Even if you aren't sure if this might be your kind of game, I still suggest giving it a try. It's a lot more fun than most games in this genre can manage. It's funny, cute, sweet, and really enchanting. It pulls you in and has so many things to unlock and discover, there is so much play value to it. At its regular price it's a steal for all it has to offer, but at a sale price, I have to say you should get it immediately.Great game, great fun, and far more entertaining than plenty of the games I've played with a higher profile. Kitty Powers will put a smile on your face and maybe inspire you to do some matchmaking of your own! Or maybe just to play one more date on the game...just one more!			"

You don't go on the dates but you are there watching and guiding responces and playing all kinds of many games.  like match it, solts, memory, spin the wheel. YOu have to listen to the date's likes and wants. I wasn't expecting to like this game much but i do. It has a bit of british humor and terms that might be confusing at first but you do catch on rather quickly. in case anyone is curious . . . no you Don't play as Kitty. you make your own character, She is your boss.

												Oh. My. Lord.This... This is beyond words.My introduction to the game was watching Jesse Cox play through it, and as I watched, my only thought was ""Good god, I need to own this trainwreck.""And lo, I did. I don't know when I stopped playing it for the lolz and starting playing it because it's so damn addictive, but I've sinced racked up well over 60 hours (here and on mobile) on a ""throwaway"" game. The humor is fun, although I must give thanks to my friends who were really into British slang, otherwise I'd never know what was going on.. The mini-games are an amazing clash between eagerness and deep-seated hatred, which shows how incredibly well-crafted they are.Would I recommend? Oh yes. But that might be because I want someone else's soul sucked out by this game, so I can have more people to talk about it with. Oh, and if anyone gets my avatar, I REALLY want to know what her job and interests are. XD			"

												This game is great! Super addictive and fun, with lots of cute and humorous moments. Sometimes it is pretty darn frustrating and difficult - I was taken aback when I suddenly had to remember what my waiter looked like, or remember the name of my date. It basically trains your short term memory to ensure you remember little details. I am STILL trying to figure out what 'type' of person people are - over time, I am starting to recognize certain patterns of interests so I can pinpoint who is 'Edgy' type or 'Geek' type, for example. I'm still lost about Glam versus Chic, though. I can see myself playing this game on and off for a long time because it is so easy to pick up then put back down again.			"

												After 22 Hours of playing I finished what I would like to call Playthrough one of this Game. As it seems this Game does have NG+.I bought this game via a key rather then on Steam and I must say that I really do enjoy it. At first I thought it would be just a nice mobile phone game brought to pc, to chill out and play. But no it is actually quite challenging and you will need to think alot. Looking at the Achievements at first, it seems like it would be simple to get them by just 'grinding' in the Game however there seems to be alot more work behind it which I personally do find very nice. The Challenges for the Achievements do not seem very hard but not to easy either.Since this Game is alot different from what I usually play so it is hard for me to review it without spoilering anyone. But all in all I can tell you that this Game is alot of fun especially over a long period of play and I believe that everybody should try it out atleast once in their lifetime.I do recommend this Game for its full Price to everybody as it is over 20 Hours long.

												Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is fun and addicting!  This game is completely unique to anything I've ever played before, and it combines so many elements!  Let's start with clientele!  First you choose a location (disco, gym, comic book store, ect.) for Kitty to set up fliers to attract customers.  The locations you pick determine the type of clients that arrive; for example, choosing the comic book store will bring in the ""Geeky"" types.  Each client is different, varying in looks, personality, and interests.  Because of the uniqueness of each character, it can be hard finding the right match for your client, but that's what makes it so much fun!  Will your client swing a home-run of strike out on their date(s)?  The actual dates are the most intricate part of the entire game.   Literally everything has a part in determining the success of the date, from choosing a restaurant to holding in your farts!  There are fun mini-games to be played that vary with each establishment you go to.  Leveling up unlocks new restaurants for clients to visit and different features in the salon to beautify your client before the big date!  There is quite a lot of memorization involved in the game, so it can get tough once you reach the higher scoring dates, but I don't believe it distracts from the overall entertainment of the game.  My favorite thing about the game is the mailbox feature.  After successfully setting up your client with a hot date, you will receive mail from he or she updating you on how things are progressing in their new relationship.  Sometimes things go sour and the couple breaks up, but sometimes they'll end up with children and even name one of the babies after you!  It all comes down to how well you do when playing matchmaker.			"

												I've bought this game on the app store after a few hours of purchasing the game on steam. This is a game where you bring two lovers together for Kitty Powers',a hilarious ,pretty self explainatory. The core game mechanics would be made up by many mini-games that you can level up and buy upgrades to please your clients and get more sucessful dates. It can give off the repetitive feeling since you're basically doing the same thing over and over again.One of the game mechanics I thoroughly enjoyed would be the matchmaking system. Leveling up will give you more options to make conversations between your client and his/her match. There are groups of clubs that you can advertise to gain more clients. An interesting part of the game that made it stand-out would be the integrated matchmaking system where your created character can be matched by other players by either using your facebook account or steam. I did not get the chance to see my character being matched but I did match up a lot of other players with a bonus reward of cash and xp. I liked how bringing up bad dates would lower your reputation thus making it harder to get more cash. The only bad news I can say would be that personally for me the game crashed quite often but as long as I just verified my integrity cache,it was fine. It would also be great if the developers made an option to be able to merge your character if you bought the game on another platform so you didn't have to start all over again. Would I recommend this game?Sure,it's a good game to lose yourself and relax. At the same time,I guess it did help me learn some new ways to talk to people.			"

												Dear Kitty Powers' MatchmakerI remember the first day we met. I heard dozens of people talking about how funny and original you are. When we saw each other for the first time, it was love at first sight. The time we spent together was wonderful. I loved your naughty sense of humour, creative ideas, cartoonish appearance and open minded nature.But as our meetings became longer and more frequent, things started to change. You gave me this weird challenges that were pretty much luck based, and when I failed sometimes you would punish me, and sometimes you would forgive everything. It was like I had to spin a wheel of fortune everytime I messed up!

We kept doing the same things over and over, and when you suggested something different, it was as boring as everything else. Sure, you promised a lot, but you wanted me to spend hours doing the same thing with you first!So, I think you know what I'm going to do.You're nothing but a pretty box that promises tons of fun, but I kept getting out the same boring things and couldn't get to the ""super cool thing"" you had on the bottom.I can't help but feel that the time we spent together was wasted.I'm sorry, but that's it.

												Super fun and addicting--however it should be known that you can buy this game as an app for your phone for about $3...so I'm not sure why it's this much on Steam. However, in others' experiences I have read that the app is more buggy, so if you don't have a smartphone or would just rather have a more stable, PC version get this one. It's still plenty fun and they don't keep you waiting around by making you either wait or pay microtransactions to proceed.			"

												   Even though I have only played two hours of this fabulous game (plan on playing more of it) I fell in love with it since the very begining. It's just that Kitty Powers, she's literally the best thing, from the voice acting, the jokes, and her character. I want her as my mother basically. The dates just reel you in even further to! You will be interested the whole time while you try to pair up your dates. I know I was, the only reason why I knew is because the first time one of my clients got dumped, I GENUALLY FELT SORRY FOR HER.I'd prefer this game to mature, open-minded people, ya know? Cause there are same-sex situations in this game (nothing explicit) but you know how people get. This game can also be meant for Straight, Bi, Gay, Trans, and ETC. It's literally the most accepting game I've seen today.			"

												This game... at first I had bought it just for my Samnsung phone and I loved it! I was hooked on it an matching couples left and right. And then, I heard that they had the game for a popular gaming platform I use, Steam. I was so thrilled and it was only a low cost of $9.99! I had to have it, and so I bought it and I couldn't be more happier. The graphics and the comedic value this game has makes it one of the best games I've played to date. Only complaints, once you get farther into the game (progression they call it) it becomes so difficult to match couples! Also, remember certain attributes of certain ""types"". You'll need it! So glad I purchased this game :)			"

												Soooo great. This game just does not stop being ridiculously playable. The writing is funny, the combinations of qualities/like/hates/looks of the daters is pretty much infinite, the mini-games are a mix of skill (often memory) and total dumb luck. Maybe the only truly frustrating thing about it is that some of the Steam achievements are really difficult, but considering you can just keep going from town to town to town building new parts of Kitty's matchmaking empire, I guess they're not theoretically impossible. But you can't get greedy and impatient about pulling them off - you'll only get mad. Crazy value for money. A must-buy.			"

												I honestly wasn't so sure about this game when I first saw it, but now that I've played it for a while I can definitively say that I've had a good time.  Dating sims such as this are a serious guilty pleasure of mine, so this game is right up my ally.  This one is a little different, however, because rather than going on dates yourself, you pair up other lonely hearts and send them on dates in an attempt to help them find their soulmate.  It's set up in a game show-type fashion, where you watch your client and their date through secret cameras and tell them what to say to their date in an attempt to impress them.  If you can't impress them, however, you will lose reputation points and undoubtedly hold your head in shame.  One negative thing that I must bring attention to is that this game gets stupid hard later on.  It may just be the fact that my skillz just aren't mad enough, but I'm a little too dense to figure out the date's type based on their interests, which is something you must know for maxium chances of success.  It would be nice if you could see their type along with the rest of their info.  Another thing that I'm not so keen on is the randomness of the mini games which can get pretty frustrating.  Sure, you can cheat, but only if you have enough coins.  But I suppose the random aspect is all part of the fun, kinda like Mario Party.  Overall, this is a fun, simple game that I must admit is pretty addicting, even if it is a little difficult.  It doesn't take itself seriously at all, which I something I value in life as well as games, so if you think this is the sort of game you would be interested in, I'd definitely give it a shot.			"

												Matchmaking be hard work.  Prunk must pay close attention to learn about character peoples.  Then must do math (thank gods Prunk had calculator), use memory skills, and play guessing games to make client date a happy date.  Sometimes, it no work out and Prunk lose client when they had three bad dates which make Prunk want to work harder on next one.A slot/fruit machine give you choices of questions to ask date what they like.  You get more choices with career promotions from Kitty Powers.  Kitty Powers is cooky fun - Prunk like her style!  Game start with a few restaurants to take date on, then you can buy more restaurants which open more fun mini games.If you believe (Prunk does not) that a person need change to make other person happy, you can buy salon things to change client's hair color, face accessories and so on.  Sometimes Prunk changes client hair color to suit date's taste, but not so much other stuff.  Many choices to make in game, many fun minigames, and Prunk have fun trying to figure character peoples' personalities.Tutorial is nice and Prunk lose much time playing game.  Game should come with warning that could harm real relationships because love playing game too much, hahaha.  Prunk, though, recommend game - very fun game.EducatedOrc Prunk say:Fun & Entertaining - 5 / 5 gruntsSkill Leveling - 5/5Action Intensity - 1 / 5 gruntsStoryline - 4 / 5 gruntsAddictive - 5 / 5 gruntsOVERALL - 4 out of 5 grunts			"

												A tounge-in-cheek dating simulator. If you enjoy colourful games filled with minigames and humour you should definitly try this.A few of the mini game dating occurances are annoying due to being entierly dependent on luck. The others are easy enough to understand yet can be a tad of a brainteaser at times.I like the humours tone of the game and imagine I will load this up for an hour of gameplay every other week when I need to crack a good smile.

												It's a cute little time-killer where you set people up on dates (including, potentially, your Steam friends who have played the game), and then coach your client through, in the form of a lot of small minigames. Don't recommend binging on it, it gets repetitive fast, but a round here or there's not the worst way to treat the game.A completionist's nightmare, however: those achievements are almost all a grind to the one.

												Dear Kitty Powers' MatchmakerI remember the first day we met. I heard dozens of people talking about how funny and original you are. When we saw each other for the first time, it was love at first sight. The time we spent together was wonderful. I loved your naughty sense of humour, creative ideas, cartoonish appearance and open minded nature.But as our meetings became longer and more frequent, things started to change. You gave me this weird challenges that were pretty much luck based, and when I failed sometimes you would punish me, and sometimes you would forgive everything. It was like I had to spin a wheel of fortune everytime I messed up! And I'm not even talking about the times when you forced me to struggle with hard tasks that were often full of random unfair obstacles!Sure, sometimes you had something different in store, but how was that supposed to be refreshing when it was all either memory games or random luck?I tried to make our meetings exciting, but you wouldn't cooperate.

												What more can I say then that, Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is a delight and joy to play. Entrusted with your own matchmaking branch. You must guide lovelorn clients to true happiness. Everything in the game is over the top. The music, the graphics and nothing ever takes itself seriously. However that doesn't stop this Indie gem from displaying true dating disasters or success. Pick the perfect meal for your vegetarian date. Maybe you let a fart slip; blame the waiter or confess? Even the dreaded Ex could show up during a date. With your careful guidance and a little luck at several mini-games. You will steer the date to a success and perhaps even find true love for your client. While this titles origins do lie in the mobile market. NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS are in this title. All the features and content are there for you enjoy. With the ability to create yourself and send it into the dating world. You will get letters about your own crazy dating adventures. In all this game is fun, well designed and very addictive. I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Surprisingly fun!I rather enjoy dating sims, and this one has the distinct non-anime flair.  While the anime games are fun, this one has the british theme.  The personalities of the dates are amusing, the challenges are fun, and I'm just surprised all around with this game.  It will definitely test your memory as well.  As the levels progress theres more and more to remember about your potential dates, as well as a little luck, just like actual dating!  The host character is also just hillarious.  Quite the Dame Edna type.  I'm not sure if that was the intent of the game, but it worked wonderfully.  She's a fun mentor as you progress through the game and is never lacking a funny quip or two.  All in all, I found the game challenging for a dating sim, refreshing in the fact its not another anime dating sim, and all in all just a lot of fun.  Perfect for a casual hour or two, or a marathon that you find yourself still playing the game at 5am and you have to go to work/school the next day.  I honestly lost about 3 hours saying ""just one more date"" "

												This isn't the usual tycoon or even the usual dating sim. This is Kitty Powers's Matchmaking and believe me, it's harder than you think.The one thing that it has in common with other dating/matchmaking games is the ... well, dating and matchmaking. But how you go about it and that fact that you will have all possible couple combinations (which is amazlingly refreshing for once) is different ... and can be quite difficult. There is some guess work and some unexplained features that can make this a little more difficult - for example who is what 'type'. No, not sexuality wise but life style wise. How do you best figure that out. Then you start having to guess some more and make conclusions until you finally realize that someone who loves Halloween might just like someone who enjoys costume parties. It's not black and white - it is not match the same with the same but it is a but find the middle ground. The rest of the set up dates are won or lost with a serious of mini-games and a good memory or the ability to right things down fast. Some are a lot of fun, some not so much  - and some are simply depending on luck.  Depending on your matchmaking skills, memory and luck, the couple will hit it off or not. Coins, XP and reputation are awareded. XP unlocks additional features via level - Coins are required to buy the features, cheat or get hints - and Reputation ... well I only know that the tip you receive for a sucessful case increases with reputation ... but that's all I know. For now, the game does get slightly repetitive but I am hoping to unlock some additional features to spice things up with time. Kitty Power's comments, the ... unusual ways of talking, crazy hobbies and the likes are currently still making up for it. One thing that I am really missing is the means to reset the account. I have the feeling I invested some money in the wrong things at the beginning and would have loved to start over.All in all - it's addictive and challenging and I am bent to crack a good bunch of the achievements.So yes, for the price, I would recommend the game.

												I bought this game after watching a few YouTubers playing it. This game is unfortunately addicting. You start off matching a few people and the next thing you know, you have gotten the Serial Dates achievement meaning you have gone on 100 dates. The gameplay is simple enough, nothing too complex. Trying to get achievements may drive you crazy because some take more time than others. However, I think that this is the kind of game you play and make your friends play for a good laugh.  The game is funny, fun, and although can feel a bit repetitve at times you find yourself trying to help as many clients and get as many promotions as you can.			"

												Funny and cool game: Make your own character and match some lonely people up. Get your rep to Fabulous so you don't have to worry about it... as much ^.^. If the people on the date made 1 mistake, ask them ""Can I see you again?"". You don't want to take the risk of being desperate. If you don't like this game and it's too weird or romantic stuff going on, then you can make yourself some cookies. Here's the recipe: Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.Enjoii your cookies.			"

I love how it is so inclusive and has homosexual and bisexual clients along with the heterosexual.

												Kind of adorable, actually! I love these kinds of games, and this one is especially well-made. The avatars are a little goofy-looking, and I would love to see more customization options. The gameplay itself is oddly addicting, and I often find myself wondering why I can't stop playing. The dating games get a little repetitive, and some of the logistics don't make sense to me (Why is a socially-inclined character so horribly disgusted with an introverted one?), but it's all part of the fun. Most of the games are memory based, so keep track of everything about the person you're trying to date! Not for everyone, and somewhat limited, but I definitely have had some fun with it.			"

												Sooo.. I saw a Let's Play of this game and decided I needed it in my life. The Kitty Powers character - while I don't personally like her - is very reminiscent of the Lily Savage style character, a fun but fabulous drag queen who rocks it. The gameplay itself has you setting up clients with potential dates and trying to make the right matches for them based on personality type and more. It gets pretty nuanced which is pretty cool. But that's not all, you're also a fly on the wall in each date, the client has an earpiece through which you tell them what to say. You have to work out what the date wants to eat from clues like ""I want something cold with no meat. And no wheat."" You play a slot machine for conversation topics. You'll have to choose whether to lie or tell the truth on some of your answers, whether you think the date will be pleased or not. If you lie, you spin the 'Wheel of Misfortune' to see if you got away with it or not, with the chance of winning bonus coins. The coins you use in the shop to unlock add-ons to the salon where you can do your client up before their date, unlock more pages of potential dates, and unlock more retaurants. Each restaurant unlock adds in a new ""thing"" in to a date. For example, one restaurant unlock throws in the chance for your client's ex to randomly show up and you have to decide whether to be honest about who it was or lie. The date will either care greatly, or not. If you lie, you get the Wheel of Misfortune and if they don't believe you, as before, it's a strike. You get 3 strikes in a date. If you get 3, they walk out. Oh and if your client gets dumped they get a broken heart. If they are dumped 3 times, they storm out and you lose a bunch of reputation.TL;DR - It's a very pink, camp game with a really fun centre and I'm bloody addicted. But prepare for a British culture slap in the face.. I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to ""go for a cheeky Nandos for a bit of bants.""			"

												I have fallen in love and it's all thanks to Kitty Powers!More seriously, this game is incredibly fun and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a casual game that'll steal hours, and hearts, from them.Story:You're a matchmaker. Make some matches. Try to make REALLY GOOD matches too so that you can make some extra money and make better matches. Gameplay:Simple but effective, each ""round"" you play is a date for one of your clients. At any date any given ""event"" might happen, triggering a mini-game; the amount of mini-games it draws from depends on your progression and how many different restaurants you get. The games are fun (if occasionally frustrating!) and don't really get old. Examples: card matching, higher or lower, plinko, spot the difference, etc.It's not surprising to me that this is also a mobile game; however it doesn't necessarily feel like a mobile game ported to the PC, if that makes sense, and I would definitely rather play it on a PC than my phone or a tablet. I do wish there were some integration of the keyboard for mini-games though.Overall my biggest worry about gameplay is always whether or not it detracts from or serves the story. As it's not a story-heavy game, and as the gameplay is quick and casual, I'd say it hits the mark perfectly. Low investment in skill or cognition for an inversely high amount of pleasure.Art and Writing:The art is campy, randomly generated, and absolutely perfect for what the game is. My one complaint here is that ALL of the characters are super thin and cisgender/gender normative? But diversity in appearance, race, and sexuality make for a fun enough romp that I forget that while playing. Kitty Powers herself is absolutely adorable while jumping off the screen, and while I think she's a tongue-in-cheek joke herself (she is a drag queen), the game has so far managed that without dipping into transmisogyny (I'm only level 9 though). The characters are incredibly repetitive, but the combinations of what they say change each time and the new combinations are almost always very funny.Sound and Music:The voice-actor for Kitty Powers is awesome. The character really comes alive even though she completely lacks animation. The rest of the sound? Eh. The music is loud, even when put down all the way to 1 and mostly it just annoys me. That's not terribly surprising, though; I rarely prefer to play games with their music (I like to turn on netflix or similar while playing). Sound effects and character ""chatter"" (they're not really speaking English) are very nicely done, though.			"

												Admit it, it’s always been one of your greatest ambitions to own and operate your own dating agency. Well, Kitty Powers is here to help! While Kitty romps around town collecting the loneliest hipsters, geeks and chic types, it’ll be up to you to pair them off with suitable partners, reaping both fame and fortune if all goes well.And how, you ask, do we ensure that our potential couples hit it off? Well, the obvious answer is MINIGAMES! Test your memory to recall amusing childhood anecdotes, pay a Generation Game style game to remember the dessert trolley, play higher or lower to hold in a potentially date-ruining fart, it’s all in here! What if the truth hurts, and maybe that guy’s beard isn’t all that? Well, just lie! It’s as simple as spinning the wheel of fate and seeing whether they believe your little fib. After all, aren’t all the best relationships founded on lies?Doused in innuendo, with plenty of winks and nudges,  Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker is a simple but bawdy good time. the refreshing ability to pair off same sex couples (without making an enormous deal out of it) is also a very nice and welcome touch.First reviewed here: http://www.goplaythat.com/2015/05/20/goplaythese-dating/ "

												Kitty Powers' Matchmaker really surprised me.  From the screenshots, one might assume it's another iOS port onto the PC, but this game actually goes way beyond what we've come to expect from iOS games.  Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is about your own custom character's adventures being Kitty Powers' matchmaker and pairing up individuals you think might make nice couples.  Sometimes things go exactly how you think it will, and sometimes it takes a bit of prodding to get them to love eachother.  Sometimes you will taste the taste of total failure, sometimes total success.  Dates can go either way in this game with the dates getting progressively harder as the player unlocks more things, such as resturants, salon stylists, and more.  I highly reccommend this game to someone who is looking to fill the void that games like Cook, Serve, Delicious! left after completion.			"

												Kind of odd, but in the most hilarious way. This game's pretty addictive, too; I didn't even realize I'd been playing it so long until I looked and saw it'd been 3 HOURS. If you like silly games that involve choices, you'll probably love this. If you don't...TRY IT ANYWAY!			"

												Such a fun game. :) The fun of matchmaking meets memory gaming.My only complaint is that if you don't log-in for a while your agency gets smaller and smaller. It's disappointing to lose all that progress, but it isn't something I really sweat to the point of not enjoying myself as a matchmaker extrodinare.All in all, this game is quite addictive.			"

												This game is pretty fun and challenging at the same time. Basically its a bunch of glorified Brain games i.e. Who was your waiter, What did your clients date change in his apperance, etc. Some are not brain games which is only like 2  or 3. Although its still fun and manages to incorporate a RPG mechanic of leveliing up and a REP system. If you like these types of games buy full price.  Otherwise buy it if you really wannna play it or hold off till a sale.			"

												Hello Kittens!This dating sim is a really quirky and fun game to play and pass the time with. The humour in it is so on point and funny. I love the characters little mumbles they make and the things they say. If you a huge fan of all things Drag Queen you will absolutely love this game. I really like that you have to really pay attention to what your client is looking for and likes because it helps you to find them their soulmate. The game mechanics is really easy to pick up and the art style and graphics are really colourful, cute and fun to look at. You can also pair off any of your steam friends who also own the game and they get to see how their dating life has gone as can you if your friends pair you off. This game as far as I can tell is never ending and also its one of those games that you can sit down and think “oh I will play for 10 minutes” and then 2 hours later you are still playing.If you are looking for a casual and fun dating sim to play then this is the game for you!

Everything is pink. yes i know. put on your heart boxers and put on a black shirt that goes down past your knees and deal with it. becasue playing this game your just as bad as kitty her-him-self!This is defenetly the game i had to reaserch like a crim over youtube and everyother nook and cranny the web could give me before i decided that it wasn't infact created for childern two to six years old, and that i wanted to play this.... then had to wait nearly a month so  i could buy it for ten buck only to find out it was on sale and now have extra steam cash! Yay!! more games!! But yes. PLAY IT!AND PUT DOWN THAT CAKE!!! IT MAY NOT BE A LIE BUT DAMN IT THATS FOR KITTY POWERS!!  "

												This game is so addictive! I bought it at first as a joke because it looked entertaining, but didn't seem like something I'd play much. Plus, it was on sale. I was very wrong in thinking I'd play for a bit and be done. It's a great cool down, casual game after playing something intense and fast paced. I've already mastered almost everything, but the cool thing is that even when you do that, it's still tons of fun because every date is different and unpredictable. It can be frustrating when you think everything is going perfect and BAM you ask the wrong question and it ruins the whole thing. I highly recommend it, I've had a lot of fun with it already!			"

												This game allowed me to become a true matchmaker between my friends. So far using this wonderful game, I've been able to poorly match 2 of my best friends together. They give me a tip of 50 tokens but it wasn't enough. I went around my school and decided to enhance my Matchmaking and play this game for a couple hours more. Honestly, it was the best idea yet. Everyone at school called me Austin Powers the Unceleberity Matchmaker. It's really sweet, they organized a club in my honor and it's to help people find the perfect match for them.Just don't tell them my reputation is low.			"

												So not gunna lie I got this game and was told lots about how bad it was some of the examples of the things I heard are -1) What is the point of this game.2) It's okay for the first few minuted but gets very boring.3)It's just a game of chance not skill.Now going in to the game I was not looking forward to it but I still had hope, with these examples in mind I will now put up pros and cons for each1) The point is to make a successful dating industry. How do you do this you may ask well it's simple I have no idea!A good tip I found was taping the left mouse button on random things that look pretty this worked very well I managedto get a successes rate of over 85%.2) The first few minutes are actually the most boring parts of the game this is mainly because you can't click anything pretty as all you can see is an overweight women bossing you around, but hang on doesn't that mean that point 1saying you have to make a successful dating industry is a complete lie? Yup it is you still have a boss because come on nobody understands the game so the computer may as well give you a hand? Well not just a hand THE COMPUTERENSURES YOU GET A SUCCESSFUL FIRST MATCH YUP 100% SUCCESS RATE. Now If you play games for a virtual number quit now 100% is the best you can get! Oh and yea YOU CAN CLICKER MORE PRETTY THINGS THE FURTHERINTO THE GAME YOU GET!3) Um what can I say [Insert Lie] Spin wheel of fortune to see if you pull of the lie If it lands on a tick you get a way with it and if it lands on cross nobody believes the lie. I guess I'm just very lucky that I landed on a tick and you actually think I enjoyed this game.			"

												If you're a fan of comedy-focused dating sims like Huniepop Kitty Powers Matchmaker is right up your alley. The game is mostly a memory game where you have to remember details about said individuals and find suitable candidates for love. You sit on the dates you choose and decide on how you want them to respond to a series of questions. Theres a lot of other fun stuff thrown in like minigames and a store. Overall this is a fantastic game for anyone looking to have a nice casual experience with a smile.			"

												I'm sure this game is great. The only thing is, I can't tell you myself because I can't even play it.I can't see what my avatar looks like because the picture is covered in pink pixels. The dating customers and their matches are also either pink pixels or invisible. I can't see what they look like, so I can't play the game properly. I've tried re-installing the game and restarting my computer, but nothing's working.Also, if anybody knows how to fix that, it would be a great help.			"

												My child downloaded this game without reading the recommendations from the curators, which states it is a pair up of female/female couples along with others. If you are not interested in exposing your child to these types of relationships  and you  try to teach them your own morals and not politically correct morals of others, do not buy or allow your child to buy this game.

												I never thought when I first bought this game that I would become the worldwide best drag queen celebrity match maker alive. I started off as a lowly, straight matchmaker, only given the tough cases and told I'd be fired immediately if I didn't succeed. I had to climb the corporate ladder for months, going on years before I was given interesting cases and finally explored the depths of myself to find my true inner being. The first good clients I had, were John Green and Colbie Caillat. I gained more confidence with successfully matching them, and even tried my hand at mascara. My boss encouraged me to accept myself and just be who I felt inside. As the clients I recieved grew higher and higher in status and wealth, I grew more comfortable with being a woman. Current day, I am matchmaking Barack Obama through Ashley Madison and am a fullblown glam drag queen. Live ya life, hunnies! And buy this game so you'll become as fab as me! (;			"

												Although I've only played this game for 6 hours, I have to say, this game is one of the better dating simulators (at least from what I know). Instead of going on dates yourself, you guide your clients through their date with the girl/guy you think is right for them. You can also choose which restaurant they go to. The restaurants have 3 levels; easy, medium, and hard. You can also change the way your client looks before your date. If you succeed, they get together. Afterwards, depending on how you acted on the date, they'll break up. They can also get married and have kids if you did well on the date.If you fail (AKA get dumped), you have to try again with another person. If you fail 3 times in a row, they'll leave the agency, and your reputation will drop.Sometimes, you'll get stuck in the middle, and have to go on three dates before you succeed (or fail).			"

What happens in the game is basically you get tons of different people who want to be set up on a date and you get to choose a person for them to go on a date with. Then you randomly pick a restaurant and then when you get to the place they start talking and tons of different puzzles are in the middle of it all! It is so addictive and entertaining!			"

												This is a fun little game that will keep you entertained with it's silly banter.  It's bright, and cheerful so my daughter even likes to watch me play.  There are a lot of achievements to shoot for and the minigames that are throughout it are fun, AND funny. Sometimes I don't understand what the characters are saying since it is brittish english versus american english, but it's pretty easy to figure out when you think it though and use context.  Slang is just strange sometimes.  Anyway, I recommend this game because it does exactly what I want a game to do, entertain me.			"

												Kitty Powers' Matchmaker was introduced to me after I saw Markiplier and Ihascupquake play it (man, I get SO MANY GAMES from YouTubers). So I bought it and played it. Here is my conclusion.Pros-Kitty Powers is a super fun narrorator (love you Kitty!)-Art style is nice and cartoonish-Though it's a dating simulator, it's not just hitting on hot girls/guys (whichever you're into). In Kitty Powers' YOU'RE the one pulling the strings, which means you WATCH the failure, YOU'RE not the failure. Plus, I love playing god :)-The music is adorable-The dialogue is pretty funny, I especially like the ""space alien dialogue."" It's won my cardiovascular organ!-The mailbox. Apparently a couple I made named their first child ""Ozzie."" Aww!Cons-Game can get repetitive quickly-If you're not into goofy, cartoonish things, this game is not for you. Coincidentally, if you're not into goofy, cartoonish things, I don't want to know you :)-The Mailbox. It's SO DEPRESSING when a couple you thought was PERFECT for each other breaks up.Overall, for the $9.99 price, I say Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is definately worth the buy. It's a good thing to play once you've broken up with your BF/GF and want to destroy the meaning of love. Fabulous!!!			"

												I really enjoy this game. It's fun, it's sassy, it's everything you expect it to be for a class match-making game. That being said, it gives a good number of details to consider in match-making (personality traits, jobs, zodiac signs, physical appearance, honesty, and pure luck, for example) so it's not always easy to make things work between your ""clients."" There are several mini-games and environments, and the clients are both randomly-generated and sourced from other players, so there's good variety there. My only complaints are that it does get a bit repetitive after playing as much as I have, and that as your reputation goes up it becomes very, very difficult to make a match and make money. Other than that, it's a solid, fun game, especially if you're looking to waste time or want to see some silly date simulations.			"

												Looking for love? This is not the place. The characters are unique, frustrating, and funny all at the same time. The challenges during dates can be... a little weird. If you need a game that you can take a break with. I would reccommend this. I got a few good laughs. Enjoyed Kitty Powers. Shes quite fun. Most frustrating part is when I finally make a match, only to find out a few days later they break up. The different types Hipster, Punk, Geek, Etc. are pretty true to their sterotypes (there are stereo types for a reason). It goes into depth with Horoscopes and interests, along with different ""types"" Such as romantic or traditional vs. New age. The game is very well thought through.			"

												This is the most fabulous match-making game I've ever played! After a long 12 hours of playing this game, I can assure you this game is an absolute addiction! I shall present my TOP 3 REASON for you to consider this game in your collection! TOP REASON1. Everyone just loves Kitty Powers, who won't? She is the QUEEN! 2. Each and every one of the clients who step into the agency is just a unique human being as any real human being are. It is just like a real-life online match-making service and that is the main key why this game is so much fun! You won't and will probably never meet the same client, EVER!3. Surprises and surprises! Honestly, the best part of the game, at least to my opinion, is the moment you receive letters from the pairings whom you succeeded in pairing. The letters are fairly mysterious and I LOVE it. Whether the pairings go happily ever after or the relationship didn't work out is 50/50 which makes me absolutely amused.			"

												I really love silly, casual simulator games like this, so when I first saw a video of it, I immediately downloaded it. It didn't disappoint at all, for what it's priced and its re-playability, it's a really great game to kill time with. There isn't much technical talk for it, besides how easy it is to navigate and the fact none of the screens are ever too cluttered/overwhelming. Gameplay is simple, and easy to get the hang of. They start you off super simple with a fun tutorial, and it gradually gets more difficult. You can also control difficulty later by choosing easier clients (if you have them in your lobby, and if you kick harder ones out to get easier ones); however, to ""progress"" through the game. That being said, the story doesn't change too drastically as you get more money & different clients. It's mainly a change of gameplay, added perks for boosting client moods, etc. There's a lot of charm to the characters, albeit they have some super weird lingo and it's a little hard to recognize social cues with each personality type. It's great if you're interested in quirky games, rather than something serious and deep!Honestly, if you want a time waster that you can go back to time and time again, you should check this game out.

												""Kitty Powers' Matchmaker"" is a very fun game to play especially when you have some free downtime. I absolutely love the fact that it supports same-sex equality within the game itself. The game is very laid back and peaceful in a way and it's very positive and upbeat. It definitely keeps me in a good mood; however, when I fail to match a pair, I get a tad frustrated, but that's just me—I like to succeed when I play games, but, then again, who doesn't? If you're still not sure whether you should get this game or not, I would recommend watching iHasCupquake play it. You can check out her ""Kitty Powers' Matchmaker"" first episode here.			"

												I watched gameplay of it on YouTube and felt it would enterntain me good.And it does! Already played for 24 hours now and I had lots of fun while doing so.If you like dating games, I definitely recommend this one:You get to run your own dating agency, create your own dating profile and through the game you are guided by the charming Kitty Powers. ;)She always has a amusing quote to tell you. And just like her, the game has a funny touch (also sometimes a bit weird, but I personally love that).One of the coolest features is, from my point of view, that you are able to match other peoples Avatars and even your friends with other date canditates. Playing with rather 'real people' is really nice.I didn't get bored with it so easily, because you can unlock many things in this game, e.g. new restaurants where you can date, more pages in Kittys book to have even more potential candidates and options to adjust your costumers to their date(s). Also the game is loaded with mini games that I found sometimes hard, but most of the time just funny. ^^Got the game cheaper and for the money and the fun I had so far, I can't complain. It's rather an occasional game, so if you aren't such a freak about it like me, you are searching for a little game to spend time and like dating games, GO FOR THIS HERE! ;)			"

												If there was a mid-way thumb, I might give it that.  There are tons of things to love about this game.  It's smart, witty and, let's face it, if drag queens ruled the world we would all have fabulous hair.  The game-play is, overall, enjoyable...with enough depth to require some brain work, but that's also a downside because I apparently don't have enough brains to make it work.  When taking on a client, Kitty tells us what ""type"" they are, which is easy enough, and we need to match the client with a compatible type, but it's difficult to figure out the type of character I'm hooking up with the client.  Each type has a number of different interests, and different types enjoy the sames interests at varying degrees, so it's hard to really figure out which characters are a good match for the client.  If they're not a match, your reputation goes down the toilet and game life begins to suck.  You can look at the guides that intrepid players have tried to compile, and even the enormous graphasaurus table is not nearly complete.  When it comes down to it, having a successful date in the game seems like little more than chance, which takes away some of the motivation to keep playing, especially after a run of miserable dates.  I don't mind putting in the time to figure out a game, but it has to be within the capacity of the human mind.  After 17 hours of play, I'm apparently the sorriest matchmaker on earth.  Still, this game is fun and funny, and is worth trying.  And...drag queens.  Every game would be better with drag queens.			"

												Finally ""completed"" the game after reachiing a certain level.It was pretty fun and addictive. I don't think it's everyones type of game because it does have some repetitive aspects but that would be the norm for this genre of game, and so it was really executed well in the game development.Its fun, funny, charming, cute, silly and actually educational. It teaches you the names of certain authentic food dishes from around the world - so I can say I have learn't quite a bit of the food etiquette side of things. I found it most amusing that there is a South African themed restaurant in the game since I live in South Africa.Over all, for the price of the game and it's content, it's a good buy to keep in your library for some good chuckles and time passing fun or if you have a niece or nephew or little one that comes over - this game will entertain them for hours!:) Have fun Kitten			"

It can be irritating at times, but otherwise I recommend, it's a really fun game.			"

												Oh dear, where do I start on this one? I know!Kitty Powers' Match Maker is a game where you work at this match making agency that allows you to force your client to date a random stranger, and you get to decide whether you want to help them fall in love or completely screw them over. Take your client and their date to the restaurant of your choosing as you do things like:-Deciding what to force the couple to eat-Engage in conversations that will reveal how much of a hypocrite your client will have to be to impress their date-Give your client's date gifts that you'll regret giving them-Play mini games to help your client do things like holding in their farts, remember what the waiter looks like, and even give the chef complements that will insult themAll in all, Kitty Puppeteer's Marionette Manipulation is a fun dating simulator that I highly recommend.

												This game may look unbelieveably stupid and pointless to adults, but it's actually really fun and addictive. You get to create your own character, personality and looks. And surprisingly, it's pretty realistic.You are a matchmaker at an Kitty Powers' agency, hoping to find love to all. You seat your first client, and Kitty shows you the right match. You can't lose the first date, for Kitty shows you all the right answers. But from then on, you're on your own. As you buy new restaurants, level up, gain reputation and new types, you also gain new challenges to face on your dates. Your client's ex can pop out of nowhere, you can have massive bowel problems in the middle of dinner, or you could fail to remember a story and disappoint your client's date. Remember exactly what your client's date looks like, 'cause they might just change their look and you're left to tell them what they changed!All I can say is.. good luck, and try not to get walked out on.

What happens in the game is basically you get tons of different people who want to be set up on a date and you get to choose a person for them to go on a date with. Then you randomly pick a restaurant and then when you get to the place they start talking and tons of different puzzles are in the middle of it all! It is so addictive and entertaining!			"

												I never thought when I first bought this game that I would become the worldwide best drag queen celebrity match maker alive. I started off as a lowly, straight matchmaker, only given the tough cases and told I'd be fired immediately if I didn't succeed. I had to climb the corporate ladder for months, going on years before I was given interesting cases and finally explored the depths of myself to find my true inner being. The first good clients I had, were John Green and Colbie Caillat. I gained more confidence with successfully matching them, and even tried my hand at mascara. My boss encouraged me to accept myself and just be who I felt inside. As the clients I recieved grew higher and higher in status and wealth, I grew more comfortable with being a woman. Current day, I am matchmaking Barack Obama through Ashley Madison and am a fullblown glam drag queen. Live ya life, hunnies! And buy this game so you'll become as fab as me! (;			"

												Although I've only played this game for 6 hours, I have to say, this game is one of the better dating simulators (at least from what I know). Instead of going on dates yourself, you guide your clients through their date with the girl/guy you think is right for them. You can also choose which restaurant they go to. The restaurants have 3 levels; easy, medium, and hard. You can also change the way your client looks before your date. If you succeed, they get together. Afterwards, depending on how you acted on the date, they'll break up. They can also get married and have kids if you did well on the date.If you fail (AKA get dumped), you have to try again with another person. If you fail 3 times in a row, they'll leave the agency, and your reputation will drop.Sometimes, you'll get stuck in the middle, and have to go on three dates before you succeed (or fail).			"

												This game is really fun! Very detailed and thoughtful! I do recommend this game if you're the love type! The only disadvantage I find with it, is the fact that when you get heart-broken, you're reputation goes so far down; for example, if you get a match, your reputation goes up by 5 or so, but if you fail, you go down 30! It's so hard to get back up, but that just supports the game in it's difficulty! :)			"

So after finally getting Steam, I decided to search for this game and found it available for a decent price. While I waited for the game to fully download, I was reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews on the page. There was one review that, after playing the game, I totally agreed on. It said that even though you might feel like someone might judge you, it absolutely feels so right. If you're doubting whether or not you should get the game because of that, don't you worry about it!! The game is worth it and it's so fun to play. Beware of picky VIPs and 1 star people with the worst luck, they'll make you want to kick them :PP.S. After fully upgrading the agency and reaching level 20, I thought that I 'finished' the game because the credits rolled BUT no no no, you get to move to another place and fully upgrade that agency too. HOWEVER all the upgrades and restaurants that you previously bought STAYS WITH YOU! Isn't that great?			"
