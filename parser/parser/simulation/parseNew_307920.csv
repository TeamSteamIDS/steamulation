												Overall I like the game. Has a few improvements like choosing skin varients and being able to sterilize animals. The missions are a little more challenging. I liked the new buildings and decorations. I loved the new maps. There are many new maps to chose from that vary in climate and set up. If you like plants, it has crop farming which can replace your greenhouse. I liked the animals better and caring for the plants wasn't very fun for me. A little buggy for me. The skin varients didn't work for me in freestyle, only in the missions. The narrator for the missions didn't speak (which maybe you prefer, but I would rather hear him talk). Also all the animals constantly vocalized so if you went to first-person mode near a large group of animals you might find all the noise quite annoying. The expansions for WLP2 don't tie together very well. For example, if I wanted to play Crazy Zoo, I could still get the Farm World animals, but thats it. None of the plants, buildings, or decorations would transfer to the other expansion, which is kind of annoying. I enjoy playing the game, it would just be a lot better if they fixed the buggy stuff.			"

												Farm World is a fun and addicitve game with plenty of scope icluding terraforming the land to suit your needs.I bought the ulitimate collection.There are plenty of choices  in the game that you are in control of plus a lot of decoration for your farm and animals to choose from.I like the way you can take a pic of your favorite animals up close by zooming in so you get a first person look at the them such as the horses eating in a pretty setting.I am playing on a laptop with windows 7 and I am currently having no probs with the game.The graphics and are well done and the animals movements and actions are very realistic , also trying to figure out how to keep your farm in profit whilst keeping your farm animals alive is tricky but like I said addicitive and fun.I would recommend this game for a bit of  light hearted fluffiness :)			"

												This game is really bad from many perspectives. Tutorial - From scene 3, you just have to figure out yourself how to achieve the listed goals. The workers you employed will just stood there idling for no reason. My worker which harvest rice just spend whole day swimming.Workers - After a while they just stand there not doing anything. Even if you pick them up to the working area, they just walk to the original point and stand there.Ground leveling tools - Don't bother trying this. There are many options for ground leveling but it doesn't work properly. I mean roller coaster tycoon that was released on 1999 works better then this.Item tooltip - So the rice says it's cold. What do you want? A blanket? Planting - You have to plant the rice one at a time. How annoying is that? Secondly, if the rice field doesn't work properly, imagine how many annoying smiley faces you'll see in that area. Summary - Not recommended.			"

												I wouldn't recommend getting this game. While it was fun for a while it has become super buggy. I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!			"

												i dunno, it has chickens that is why i got it, and animal breeding. well it adds more animals to farm world. just if you are doing it for the chickens do not put plants down unless you like having plants say they need air conditioner or blankets. the chickens are the easiest animal to take care of.

												very poorly done - tutorial is lacking & difficult to understand - actions are even more difficult to carry out.Can't think of any pros except the graphics are OK but not fantastic.Frankly, not worth wasting my time on if it was free.			"
