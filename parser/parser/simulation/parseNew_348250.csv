												My Mum is in her 81'st year - bear with me - and she has had a go at one or two ""experiences"" in VR since I got my Vive last year. I thought she would love to try this. Within five minutes she was back at the place she grew up, giggling and squeeling with delight. Then she went up ""Tandle Hill"" and suddenly I noticed she wasn't laughing anymore.I asked her if she was ok, and I noticed she was quietly crying and shaking. ""What's the MATTER""?, I asked.""I haven't been here since I was a little girl; this is so wonderful - thank you so much, I never thought I would ever come here ever again"".THAT, my friends, is worth the cost of the Vive itself.Pro's: Become Superman/Supergirl and go where you like; visit your own house; go to that place you always wanted to; sit on cliffs and scare yourself to death; ""Leap"" from tall buildings; Take off and go into space then land on the other side of the planet; go to that holiday place again (without the traffic jams); play a game of ""can I find it again from space without getting lost on the way down""; save your own favourites and jump straight there next time. Change the time of day or night by dragging the Sun across the sky. All for FREE !!!!IN MY OPINION - the best and most enduring VR experience ever, and probably for a long time to come.Cons:Well, not really any, but I would like to see the following features added as this gem is polished:To be able to leave human scale on ALL THE TIME. I know it is great to feel like Gulliver, walking between the mountains or skyscrapers, but for immersion I'd like to be able to leave my eyes 70mm apart and view the Earth in normal scale (at least have the option).Ability to reverse the ""BRAKE"" option so that you are slow by default and you pull the trigger to accellerate; I, personally, want to take it all in, not rush off.I am not bothered about the comfort mode and prefer not to use it, but for those that get motion sickness, an option to change the size of the ""tunnel"" view to suit.I for one, don't mind that you can't text-search for places to ""teleport"" to; searching adds to the enjoyment, but I'll expect a lot of people would prefer the option.I know there's mirror mode, which you can modify to show just left/right eye as a circle on the screen, but for your friends to be able to view the experience full screen. I appreciate this could affect FPS etc, so just the option would be nice. Graphics settings, perhaps.Oh, I don't know, fly to and around the Moon next maybe?  ;-DThese are not complaints, just hopes for the future. This App is nothing short of incredible!			"

												I have yet to find a person who isn't floored when I demo this for them on the Vive.You could say that Google Earth isn't new - after all, it's been around since 2005.  But it's one thing to stare at satellite maps, or open Google Street View, or look at a three dimensional map of a metropolitan location on a computer screen - and quite another to float a bit above the Chicago skyline looking at buildings in stereoscopic 3D, with full headtracking - flying between skyscrapers, floating over the countryside connecting cities, or standing in front of your childhood home, slackjawed and gobsmacked as memories wash over you.You're not quite there.  But this is as close as it gets.  I have to remind myself that we've progressed this far since 2005 - I cannot wait to see what the next 11 years will bring.If you are evangelizing virtual reality, but your friends still think you're an idiot for dropping 800 dollars on what amounts to high-tech ski goggles tethered to your computer in your basement - well, this shuts them up in a hurry.  And if it doesn't, nothing will.			"

												IMPORTANT INFO  FOR OCULUS TOUCH USERS!!!!!!!!!You can use this with Oculus Touch, you simply need to download a zip file called FakeVive, it has a single dll file. All you do is place it in the Google folder. So simple. Instructions below explaining how to find the clip that informs you how to use it. Search for a clip on YouTube called, ""How to use the Oculus Rift with Google Earth VR - Works!"". It's been uploaded by, Virtual Reality Oasis. The clip is only 3:22 and he explains exactly what you need to do and has links in the description. It's so easy to install this and it works perfectly with my Oculus. This is easily one the best VR programmes I have used so far. It proivides a totally unique perspective and is an absolute pleasure to use. You almost feel like a god. Or, Godzilla. You decide. Either way, you should love this amazing programme. So pleased I learnt about the Oculus fix.Feb 10 2017 EDIT: Don't understand why some people didn't find this helpful. After all, the information I provided is 100% valid. Nevertheless, I have altered the post slightly in the second paragraph by deleting info about starting the search for the clip on Google, since it is easier to simply search on YouTube instead.			"

												I am afraid to show this to my friends because I don't think I will get the headset off them again. Is this a glimpse at the future of tourism? Perhaps so...The welcome walkthrough will whet your appetite: gorgeous natural features appearing before you like carefully and lovingly constructed models, every rock and gradient carefully shaped into place; the city of Japan is laid out before your eyes, the model so detailed you can almost crouch down and peer into the windows of the buildings and see what is going on inside.And then, with the click of a button, the world zooms around you and everything is presented in 1:1 scale. Suddenly the cute model skyscrapers take on their real proportions, and you have to arch your neck up to try and see the top.It is not flawless; not everywhere has full 3d geometry, and the height/object detection algorithm doesn't always get things right, but by god it is close, and I am sure more detailed geometry will come in due course. But don't be disheartened, there is already a whole WORLD out there to explore in the meantime, and if you are willing to forgive the graphics from time to time, this certainly has the ability to take you there.Without doubt my new favourite VR experience, and further proof that my Vive was worth every single penny.

												One of the best VR experiences I've ever had.This is not some quick demo like some other stuff around, this is a well thought out and polished product. I've been checking out my favourite places and some well known tourist destinations and I'm loving it. Even areas without 3D objects look great.I was afraid that my 2.5Mbps internet download capacity would spoil the experience but it works reasonably well despite that limitation.There are some things that could improve it like a compass on the right controller or having the option of a flat sea (you can see the continental shelfs).If you like geography or flying or mountains or travelling or checking out motorcyclist routes... you've got to try this, it's amazing!!!UPDATE - I've been informed that there is a small arrow on the globe in the left controller that can be used to navigate.

I haven't had much trouble with motion sickness. I'm guessing this will just get better and better as they add more areas and improve their rendering algorithms.  As it is now, it is truly amazing work!			"

Just incredible. Lose yourself for hours.Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash is famous for offering a very forward-looking view at the Internet, online social interaction, and virtual reality (coining the term metaverse). One futuristic technology that it offhandedly predicted was a virtual globe that offered realtime satellite imagery of any place on Earth. I remember reading that particular bit and thinking how incredible it would be.We're not quite at that stage - well, not us consumers at least - but Google Earth comes very close indeed. An amazing app in and of itself, it becomes positively mind-blowing here with GEVR, applied to roomscale VR.There's nothing I can say that isn't better explained by the trailer video, so go ahead and watch that.Oh, but make sure you have really fast internet, and no data cap. GEVR is very very bandwidth hungry.Some things I would add: Photo mode: it already allows us to snap a photo when saving a place. Why not allow just snapping photos, and saving them in high-res? I was standing in the middle of the Himalayas, looking at row after row of snowy peaks, gobsmacked, and I so wanted to capture that view. Search: (EDIT: They added search!! April 2017) come on, you can't be a Google product, and Google Earth at that, and not have textual search. Google, you already made a nifty xylophone keyboard for Daydream, just use it here with a search interface. (EDIT: They added search!! April 2017) Street View: Again, it's already in the web app. It's probably not easy to implement - especially in terms of switching back and forth, and how to handle positional tracking and such - but it would be an amazing addition.Offline caching: (EDIT: April 2017 - with some ini editing, advanced caching is now supported!) Would be great to be able to select a few spots and save their data permanently. Let us worry about storage space. (EDIT: April 2017 - with some ini editing, advanced caching is now supported!)  "

												Superman. Crazy educational. Profound sense of proportion and perspective to be had, truly every person on the planet needs to experience this if they can. Also Superman.Advice: I recommend going into settings and disabling 'comfort' mode if you can, as well as enabling 'human-scale'. After trying it without comfort mode, I totally understood why they forced most of the world around you to darken by default while you moved around. Travelling so fast with full 360 degree vision is too intense initially, feel like the floor is perpetually falling out from under you.. at first. Then you get used to it. My gf acclimated in less than a minute and then what was supposed to be a 15m session turned into 1.5 hrs, so it is very usable this way. Additionally, set 'human-scale' on so you can truly land and walk around. Went to my old high school, walked around on the property and there were moments it seemed I was really there again. This ought to only improve as time goes on. THANK YOU GOOGLE.			"

												After playing over 40 titles on my Vive, this is truly the most immersive.  Let's break it down to the pros and the cons.Pros:-Nature, cities and tours are INCREDIBLE.  You can view these in super high detail in a ""giant"" view or human-scale view.  There is nothing quite like standing on Mt. Fuji and looking around like you're there.-You can literally travel anywhere in the world with ease-The attention to detail is some of the best I've seen-This IS the reason to invest in an HTC ViveCons:-Load time to render landscapes-Less popular areas are less detailed-Blocky fragments in some areasOverall -- this is truly an experience that will WOW you and wow your friends/family even more.  From the Eiffel Tower to the Collisseum to Mt. Everest, you'll never get bored if you enjoy seeing the world.  And the best part?  It's free.  Download it NOW.			"

												I remember back when Google Earth first started up.  It was pretty cool back then, but there were a lot of gaps in the map...some of which I had actually been to visit, so it was kinda aggravating.  They added more and more to it, and then one day they started asking people to help by making 3D models of various buildings based on aerial photos.  It actually worked pretty well in some situations and the Earth slowly started being made 3D.I had no idea that was going to turn into this though.  In the areas where they've paid a lot of attention to the 3D models, it looks pretty damn good.  In those places where less attention was paid --well, it's kinda bad.  I shouldn't complain too much.  I could locate and somewhat recognize most of my old living quarters, though quite a few of them had trees obscuring everything. Anyway, this is Google Earth in VR... which is pretty awesome.  If you like Google Earth and like going to streetview from space and then walking around, you can't quite do that just yet.  I imagine they'll figure out how to make it work though.  Then I can do a virtual marathon, or see how long it would take me to walk in real time from New York City to L.A. (if you count walking back and forth around my living room to be valid).I really hope/wish that Google will take the time to get people to clean up some of the areas on the map.  I can accept that ""B.F.E."" isn't well maintained, but when a suburb of a major city has what looks like cobwebs hanging from the street signs, it's kinda lame.  Also, there's a few car shadows where they attempted to make a model of the car, but then it's like someone erased it, so there's a big grey hump on the road instead of a car.  They should just erase it better, or draw in a generic car over it so it looks better.Things I liked:  They've got a ""comfort mode"" which lowers the FOV until you're done moving so you don't get sick  Some of the scenery in the tours was fantastic  Saving your location is as easy as pressing a button  Navigation in general is pretty simple and you can fly over the city like superman (sorta)Things they need to work on:  clean up those ugly spots on the 3D model.  If you can't make it yourself, release the tools and let everyone do it as a steam workshop type thing.  Moving forward is fine, but turning is a drag (literally...hold a button and drag the map to turn)  They should make a flight mode where you turn as if you were in a small plane (or a jet or whatever).  Remote locations are still not filled in very well.  I did some time in one of those remote locations and even now it's mostly an aerial photo painted on the ground.  It's not really their fault but turning off the comfort mode did start to make me queasy, but the comfort mode turn reduces the FOV by way too much in my opinion.  I could probably go on with more pro AND con comments, but I know you're probably bored.  It's still awesome... grab it, download it, try it out...			"

But it has it's flaws:The streets from human sized view looks like an earthquake hit itAnd it needs to be updated to load what's closest to yopu first, then foxus on everything else.  Cause it uses too long to load anything decently fast at this rate even with 100Mbit.			"

												This was an absolutely incredible experience. I'm not ashamed to say that it almost brought me to tears. Just the three minute introductory tour was jaw dropping. My son is very interested in life science, biology, space... This is going to be such an amazing and incredible tool to help him experience the world! I have lived abroad in Europe, was deployed with the military in the Middle East, spent time in Japan, and have driven from Alaska to Florida and back...twice. Not everyone gets to be as lucky as I have been when it comes to travelling, but now, I can relate all those experiences with so much more detail by taking them there.This application is truly a MUST HAVE for anyone with VR capabilities. It takes some getting used to and I would warn folks about the possibility of motion sickness until you learn how to ""fly"". This experience alone has completely validated my VR purchase, in my opinion. When my friends ask to come experience virtual reality, this will be the first thing I show them. Amazing work Google. Absolutely beautiful.			"

												Google Earth VR is what you've been waiting for, secretly dreaming of - probably even before you got VR. The ability to travel anywhere in the world and actually immerse yourself in that place, beats looking at a flat screen any day. Google Earth has VAST data it can take advantage of, such as the many 3D buildings people ALL over the world have personally built with SketchUp or other applications and imported into Google Earth, we're talking about literally millions of contributions all over the world - finally we get to take full advantage of that.There are various ways to use Google Earth VR. You can either look at it from above, or take a flight across cities either on top of a 2D map or a 3D map if height-data is available. There are also areas, famous landmarks and cities that have been entirely re-built into 3D by dedicated users all over the world, you will be able to fly across (and even between) those buildings like a plane or a bird.But that's not all, you will also experience First Person View if you go into the settings (press the menu button on top of your controller) and go into the 3-dotted settings menu to your right, select the option to fly full body scale), also...if you don't feel motion sick - you can also turn off Comfort-Zone for a full view while you fly.Now - there's an extra thing to keep in mind while using this and that is your internet bandwidth. As of testing I was lucky enough to have a very fast broadband internet, mine happens to be 250 Mbit Down and 100 Mbit Up, the Upload speed is not that important to you here - so you want a fast download speed in order to fly fast and experience the graphics as detailed as possible, now this also depends on the speed of the Google servers and the entire routing between you, the internet and your computer to make it work seamlessly. Most of the time when you fly or walk around, you will notice that the roads have bumps in them, in fact you might even say that it looks like world war II was just recently here, but fret not - this is because Google uses the height data it has in its map-data, this is of course filled with errors here and there, so when you see a lot of bumps in the roads, it's either from people, cars or just errors and to you and me - this will look like graphical bumps in the road, something I'm sure they'll figure out an algorithm in the future to smooth out.In fact - you can still contribute - if you think your city or favorite area isn't represented here properly, you can still upload your 3D work, textures etc. to Google Maps - and it will probably be seen here in glorious VR 3D. And to think that this product is free - amazing.You will spend more than a couple of hours in here, I bet.			"

												Ever wanted to visit somewhere but without the jetlag? Maybe you want to visit somewhere you used to go. With a VR headset and Google Earth VR you can. You can select anywhere in the world manually, or use a list of presets. You can also favourite locations so you can get back to them quickly later.It isn't perfect: When you're at ground level, the area can take a long time to load (and I'm using a i7 4790k) and when you're up close, the detail is very low- buildings will typically spawn as basic polygons and slowly work into the correct shape. Even after it's finished loading, the detail is pretty low but it's enough for you to recognise significant locations. For example, I visited Japan a couple of months ago, so I thought I'd revisit the Tokyo Skytree in VR. I could make out the river nearby and some of the buildings I walked past on the way. It's a strange feeling seeing it all again in VR.Overall it's a pretty fun application to mess around with and it's free so you may as well. Over time maybe it'll become more detailed but it certainly serves its purpose. It would be nice if you could type in a place name though, rather than having to find it on the globe manually.			"

												I didn't have many expectations going in, but followed the tips people gave such as 'watch the intro'. While most of it was cool, it got repetitive - till you see the earth in the universe and get an Apollo 11 moment, that is.After that you are in control and get to zoom in on the place of your choice - and looking at your country from the sky is also really cool!The zoom/funnel is pretty well done but did lead to some motion sickness in people I demoed it to doo. Perhaps there should be (or is?) an option that slows the zoom a bit down.Human scale is disabled by default but can be great fun, although only the bigger cities seem supported (and most famous nature attractions). It gets glitchy (a lot of things are melted wax) in smaller / less popular streets  but still provides a cool experience.			"

												Fantastic eperience - at the moment there is nothing else like it. I've never been in New York, but here I could walk between the skyscrapers and look up and marvel at their size. I've sat on top of the golden gate bridge, stood on the Tokyo Tower, and walked beneath the cranes in the Hamburg Port.It's just fantastic to quickly get to other places, and not only see what they look like, but also feel the size and distance of things. You can fly over the Swiss Alps and stand on tops of mountain hills or walk on or around famous buildings, visit deserts, lakes, islands or just try to find your house in your home city - it's also great to see what your city looks like from above in a way that no map can ever replace. Just to be able to instantly jump around, change the scale, and look at the map like a toy collection on your floor gives you an impression of cities that you've never experienced before and cannot do in any other way!

												As with many other VR titles the screenshots simply can't understand the feeling of scale you get in this software. It's simply amazing, and must be tried.Flying around or dragging the world around you with 'Comfort Mode' turned off is very immersive, but can make you slightly unwell. I tried it, didn't feel so good after some time, but fulfilling a fantasy of ""flying"" high above the area I grew up was worth it. The perspective you get in VR is so vastly different from Google Maps, even with 3D, and very humbling. Comfort mode narrows your field of view when you move around, and gives you the impression you are standing still in a wireframe virtual room.Currently it lacks a way to search for locations which is a must. Earth is large. And while you can zoom all the way down to street level and experience the world in a 'correct' scale, flying up in the sky also makes the scale of the world smaller. I would be nice to keep the scale 'realistic' when flying.Sure, the normal desktop Google Maps and Earth is pretty much the same content, the Google Earth VR can't be explained in words or pictures. It must be experienced and would have been worth it even as a paid application.			"

												I'm not sure I can put into words how this feels to experience, but I'm damn well going to try.This is a mindblowing thing to see/feel/experience. It's the full fat Google Earth you play with on desktop, but you're not just looking any more - you're flying over your house, you're zooming down to earth to float like a god around anwhere you want. I bought Mircosoft FSX and added the VFX scenery so I could get a teeny, watered down experience of the dream that is Google Earth VR. This is FREE.I have just ""flown"" around my neighbourhood, to the top of mountains I climbed many years ago and recognised the landscape straight away - the memories came flooding back.The 3D in built up areas offers a spectaular feel to cities you already know, even if going right to ground level looks lumpy and odd. From anything above about 100 metres its stunning.I have no idea how I'll find enough time to go and see the places I want to see but they're here. waiting for me.My only regret? I can't vote for this over and over again - it deserves more than 1 like.			"

Apart from occasional encryption glitches and stutters when moving one's head, it was probably as close one can get to the properly working VR on such a a setup.  Immersion was good enough for me, though I have to note I'm easily immersed anyway so it's a subjective statement.Forgot to mention that of course only head rotation tracking works, so unfortunately no moving and leaning around apart from using the controllers.

If you do try this, be sure to change yor setting to human perspective. That way you can stand on a street and see everything in a lifelike situation. For example, go to New York city and look at the skyscrapers. The great thing about this program is it will only continue to get better. Experience this!!!			"

And of course, look at your house and everywhere you know. Atop mount baker in WA was good, Central park stunning. I just spent 2 hours flying like a god. astounding. Hope they add more 3D models of everywhere.Recommend you don't turn off the comfort mode.			"

												I spend a lot of time in Google Maps so I was really excited to get this, this was the first VR app I used and and my first experiance of ever using VR, I go to New York and my jaw just dropped instantly its absolutely mindblowing, for me if I go right down the streets and really up close to buildings its stretched blocky mess but is still absolutely incredible for what it is, for me personally this made shelling out hundreds of £££ for a VR headset worth it			"

It has all the options you want, like enable or disable confort modes, you can watch tours, cities and interesting places. Or just fly around like a bird.Would love to have a 3d streetview like experience in the future, to make it even better. But wow, this is just amazing. This is a must have for every VR owner.

												It doesn't even really make sense to review Google Earth VR because there is nothing else like it in the world today, a singular unique profound experience.  You can fly anywhere in the world in a heartbeat, and most cities (especially in US and Europe) have an unfathomable level of stereoscopic detail, to the point where you can read the signs of most large shops. You can see the world at a variety of scales, from standing on the street or on a beach or atop a building at human scale, to flying over an apartment complex or mall or airport, to flying over a city, to soaring above an entire region in orbit. It allows me to get a ""feeling"" for a place I've never been, so that when I go there, it already feels familiar. I stood by the poolside at my apartment complex. I went to a pier in Nice, France and adjusted the sun to see what it would like at sunrise. I went to an apartment I was thinking of renting in Daly City and studied the topography of the surrounding area to evaluate how foggy it might be. There is nothing like this, no end to the possibilities. And I'm even more excited for what the future may hold with richer data sets.That's not to say there isn't room for improvement. There's no way to navigate to a particular street address, or to see map labels while in ""walking mode,"" or to superimpose useful data like directions between locations, traffic, population density, elevation. The level of detail is remarkable considering the scale, but at human scale still looks distorted and blurry compared to real life or Google Street View. Many developing or remote regions have only limited satellite data and appear mostly flat when you zoom in on them. It's a bit frustrating that I can't adjust the scale and my position independently - you can either be a human standing on the ground (or on a building) or you can be a giant standing on the ground. You can't be a human flying through the air. You also can't move straight up or down without awkwardly pointing your controller straight down below you, which is hard on my wrist. You can't rename saved locations to help you remember what they are. And although the streaming data solution is really effective, sometimes even on a very fast connection it can take a while to fully load the detail of a really detailed area. Sometimes I wish there were more extensive caching for areas that I visit frequently. And although I'm not prone to VR sickness, others who are may struggle with all the movement that this app requires (their comfort mode helps but will not work for everyone).In short: if you have a VR headset, you NEED to try this app. There's nothing like it on the planet.

Move to the middle east and its barren lands, and discover the sudden change in the all green Nile Delta. You can go to your home town and living place, look around, and zoom out, getting a sense of your surrounding area and scale of earth itself.A magical experience, and definitely something I will show to others visiting my Vive.

												Google Earth is simply amazing for VR.I was hooked at the gorgeous introduction tour. It really showed me what VR is capable of. You get taken all over the world, where you can view everything in 3D from a giant's perspective. You can go anywhere. Places that normally have street view will show up in 3D with surprising detail. You can still visit places that don't normally have street view, but they will look flatter. In the typical fashion for anybody goofing around in Google Earth, the first things I did were visit my house, my school, and my friends' houses. Great fun.I do have a few complaints.You can't type in a search term for a location, you have to drag the globe around and zoom in to find the place you want to visit.Loading can be very slow for people with slow Internet connections (like under 25Mbps). Many places are not in 3D yet, so I hope the Google Maps vehicles will do their thing and spread around in the near future. The tutorial's wording is a bit confusing, like when it tells you to ""Tilt it town"" to walk on the surface. Tilt what? I didn't have any issues, but my parents were definitely confused.Overall, this is some amazing software that I'd recommend to anyone with a Vive.			"

												I'm still questioning how they are giving this away for free. You can explore the entire world(most cities have 3D-scaling!) and gaze at amazing landmarks, either as a god, godzilla, or in human scale! Stand on the head of christ the redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, have a gander at Disney World, look through Japan and its famous locations, or even visit your own city and house!Only criticism is the fact that Stonehenge in england is not modeled in 3D, one of the few landmarks I really want to see! That and the Moai in Chile(although I haven't checked throughly yet if they are there)For the love of god, get this! It's absolutely free, the controls are intuitive(some more explaining of how to fly faster etc would be nice), switching between the viewmodes(walking on the earth or looking at it from the side) can be incredibly nauseating for lots of people. The tours and pre-set locations are great for people who already have an idea of where to go. There's no reason to ignore this lads! Remember to fiddle with the settings a bit in order to walk around and experience the cities in human scale!			"

												This is a beautiful thing.It is a joy to use and explore places.It is not at the resolution/ detail level yet that it feels like being there in the real place completely, but it is detailed enough that i could fly to different places i lived in, recognize all the places i knew from my childhood and teenager days very well and it brought tears to my eyes as i flew through the sceneries and my memories.It is a great technical feat how smoothly it works and i look forward to when future versions have even higher res models and higher def textures.Also major props to the UI/UX and sound fellas, everything is intuitive and fun to use and the ambience sound effects are very soothing, relaxing and enjoyable and get one totally zoning out in positive vibes.When bad politics and news around the world get you down, zone out and enjoy the beautiful sides of it in this app =) "

												Absolutely beautiful. I was honestly blown away. I took a trip down memory lane; revisiting important places in my life. I enabled ""human scale"" and it felt so much like I was back there again. It's enough to move a grown man to tears. Sitting alongside the Mississipi river, looking into the window of my office, or sitting at the exact seat in the St. Louis stadium as a few months ago. If you have a Vive, you NEED to get this. The entire time, all I could think about was ""this is the f*cking future.""			"

												This is exactly what I expected and then some, a must try experience. Being able to zoom in from space to standing on a bridge or rooftop is an amazing experience. Locomotion methods are good and provide options, there are comfort mode options that can be disabled and of course you get the entire planet's 3d map data. How cool!			"

												It's free.  It's Google Earth... in VR!  You can go from street view up to orbit and back again.  You can look at any place on the Earth's surface, and most of it is represented as 3D structures.  The detail is terrible, but if you don't get too close, it looks fairly realistic.			"

												 Astronauts speak of the Overview Effect. They say seeing the entire earth beneath you has a profound, humbling and almost spiritual affect, transforming one's perspective of the earth, humanity and life itself.  This experience gives you a taste of that incredible sensation, and an endless number of places to visit.  In this experience you can stand outside your own house and take off like superman, flying through all the places you have ever been or wanted to go.  It is a truly awe inspiring and humbling thing to look down and see everything you have ever known reduced to termite mounds clinging to the side of an orb alone in the void.

It leaves you shocked and amazed for hours afterward.Can it use improvement? Yes. Are their models of everything pretty terrible? Yes. But does it matter? NO. In spite of the terrible polygons it is still incredibly immersive and awe-inspiring.This will now be one of my default demo experiences to leave people absolutely in awe after using the Vive.			"

I twist and loop the view around the whole time to get a slight sense of vertigo. I love to stand on the street of a major city and zoom off into a space while looking down as the city fall away. Do a little jump in real life to add a crazy sensation as you fall back down while rocketing away from earth.			"

												I'm into this for 11 hours and haven't had it for 24 hours yet! Haha. Honestly, this is the experience I have been looking for since the promise of VR in what, the 90's? I look for games that have worlds. I'm the type that explored GTAV and did a lot of cool things but will probably never beat the game. I'm looking for experiences. This one is the ultimate. My eyes didn't tear up but this is sort of a moving, emotional experience for a geek like me. I read another review that a user did have some tears. I'm not suprised; I mean.... it's the real world that you can fly down into and view every building. I went back to my childhood property where I explored and branched out as I grew up. I went to Barcelona which is extremely detailed compared to some places, dont miss it. The coast of France, Italy.This changed my view of where I want to vacation, educated me, and just blew my mind. The controls are fantastic.Wishlist: share the saved locations / positions, search, and meet up with a friend online to explore together (hands, head, voice?)			"

												Absolutely stunning.Amazing detail from just satellite pictures.I couldn't believe what I've seen when I went to Tokyo. I even travelled on the top of Mount Everest! :DWith this software you can go anywhere you want. Most places can't be seen in a life time but with this app you can see everything, even Disneyland!Only too bad the places where I live at and where I was born at are both not in 3D.			"

												It suffers some from the quality of the data available (hey, modern magic can still only take us so far), but I predict this will remain one of the most compelling uses of VR for a long time. The comfort mode works really well, after an hour I was starting to get a little sick, but there were a few times I turned comfort off so I could experience flight with a bit more oomph.Anyway, my car is currently in the shop, and I miss being able to drive it. So I spent 20 minuts ""driving"" around my city along my familiar routes and it made me feel a bit better about not having my car. I could see this kind of thing being used for therapy, to visit places that have made you happy, without having to actually travel there.Inspiring.			"

												It is awesome. It could easily be better, but its free, so, good job google.It has the same atmospheric effects as the usual google earth desktop app, which look pretty bad and obscure your vision a lot when you zoom out. It can be a bit slow to load in the models(even on 1gbit fibre), and doesn't load in enough of them, so things in the distance are super low poly.The controls are pretty decent, but it would be better if they actually used the touchpad as an analogue input rather than treating them as buttons; to adjust speed of movement. And the tilt of the earth, instead of only having two options for tilt being looking straight ahead and birds eye view.			"

												Very good combination of what was offered in Google Earth (classic) and VR. However this high-end piece of technique doesn't hold for an 'industrial' or 'business' standard. It looks more like a game or an Apple 'app'. And it is understandable why. We wish Google to focus on more realistic and 'dry' approach in next version of Google VR. -Make texture render 'realistic'-Transition smooth-Exploration more 'real time'Thank you,			"

												Not a game. But educational experience. This is stunning.  And FREE? (thank you Google - I've always been a fan and always fought having bing crammed down my throat).  What you see in the demo video is what you get.  (no effects or fluff added that IS the experience).  Control is intuitive.. my kids just got back from Disney in Florida and they went there in this VR app and were able to point out all the places they went to and explain to us where they were swimming and staying.   I went to Miami where all the cruse ships line up and enjoyed seeing them from the air.  I would love to see this interfaced with a workout machine (I use a VirZoom) which is a VR bike.  And it would be so cool to ride anywhere in the world.  (down low the graphics get flakey) but no problem, I'd be happy flying 50-100 ft above the street as long as it moved with my peddling.A lot of people miss the fact that you can point to the sun, GRIP and drag it up and down which changes the time of day and lighting effects.  Great option.			"

												Alas. Earth was the last straw what brought me to VR. After settling down from traveling, I was looking forward to some virtual throw-back. I spend way too much time on mobile Google Maps' street view (blue sliding rail was a great addition). I was sorely disappointed with Earth VR. Most locations aren't yet built out in 3d, so they show as either a flat satellite image on the ground, or cities of grotesque polygonal blobs. Green blobs must be trees, white blobs buildings. It's that unrecognizable. Even the optimized locations like San Francisco and Paris seem barely there. Like you're looking at a model of a city on a table, objects made of clay to give you a gist, but lacking detail.I certainly realize the immense technological feat this app represents. The man hours and science pored into this incredible project, and I definitely don't want to poo-poo that. Earth has incredible potential, and I believe one day we'll be walking through virtual cities. But I think a down-vote is warranted simply because this is an app I couldn't spend more than 10m in before saying ""eh, bummer."" I've showed 2-3 people; they were ecstatic, went instantly to their hometowns or favorite cities, and dropped their arms in disappointment. They each tried some big city to see how the optimized locations look, and immediately asked to try a different VR experience. One day, Google - I believe in you.What's needed:- Street view. I understand that 360 photos lack depth and all that jazz, but it's bound to be better than what's here- More 3d-mapped locations- Better 3d-mapped locations (really, nothing looks real - not even Google's campus)			"

												This is a must-have experience for any VR enthusiast. There's something special about being able to fly to somewhere you've been, or always wanted to be and feel like you're standing right there. Unlike using street view on a desktop, Google Earth VR allows you to explore the world through a more immersive perspective.I recently visited Arches National Park in Utah, so naturally I felt like checking it out in VR. Amazingly, when I turned the ""Human Scale"" mode on, the size of some of the landmarks felt identical to what I remembered only a few months ago. However, this mode is inactive by default so that you don't notice how blurry some of the textures are up close.You can save a seemingly unlimited number of locations to revisit, but unfortunately you cannot search for a specific landmark or address. They have some tours built in of famous cities, deserts, water features, etc. Overall, it's a great program to add to your ""demo to your friends"" list.Pros:+Sense of presence is stellar+Controls are easy to use+Navigation is simple+Good built-in tours of famous landmarks+Human scale mode is fairly accurate+It's freeCons:-No search feature-Long texture / geometry loads in some areas-If you live in a small town, you probably won't have any building models			"

												From what I've seen from those with the controllers Google earth VR is amazing, unfortunately, being the owner of an oculus rift which is now supported by the app, I do not have the controllers that you need to properly use the software. I was hoping that there would be support for the xbox controller that came with my headset but unfortunately there is not.I do hope that Google adds support for the xbox controller or even just mouse and keyboard support so I can use this app without having to spend another £100 although I can see why it may be a challenge because the app appears to be build around the use of the motion controllers.

												Google earth is what pretty is all about. If you like staring at cut flowers in a vase, then you'll love google earth. If you want to take advantage of the mind-blowingly awesome capabilities of earth in VR... Forget it. Google clearly fell in love with the clunky spatial controllers of the Vive and created a dogs-breakfast of a user interface.Clearly google has lost the plot when it comes to usability, so the wonderful aspects of being able to see the earth up close are lost to the unusable controls, which are frustrating and imprecise when it comes to navigating.I get it - really I do. You want a room level experience and you created it. That's nice. So what if I want to sit and just view things from a usable angle? Oh... That's a pain. Adjust steam floor levels within the app? Too hard. Switch on a keyboard and just use mechanical instructions to tell you what I want to do? Verbotten.Google Earth is typical of most VR junk out at the moment. The programmers are so stuck in their mindset that they have to do everything VR that they lose track of why we use computers in the first place. Maybe I don't want to point and shoot. I just want spin and move with thumb controllers or the likes. I don't want to swing my arms around all the time like I have control issues. I just want to absorb the view while controlling things like I can on the desktop.This app misses the plot. I'd give it one star for user interface, but the pretty graphics, if you're willing to wait minutes for them to load, are still pretty... I'll give it two starts and a ""Not Recommended"" until they figure out what a user interface is.			"

												**This game uses SteamVR and OpenVR API. OpenVR natively supports multiple VR headsets including Oculus Rift. Google specifically wrote code that does a hardware check on what VR headset you use, blacklisting any headset that is not an HTC Vive. This is not ok. There is zero reason this application shouldn't run 100% plug and play with Oculus Rift. Until this is resolved, this review will remain negative.**That being said, this is a fantastic application. Probably among the most impressive things I've tried in my Vive. It's unreal being able to go to any point in the world and marvel at the landscapes. Flying between skyscrapers, stomping around cities like Godzilla, shrinking yourself down to human size and standing on top of the worlds tallest buildings, visiting places you've been to and experiencing how you look at them with godly control, it's all great. I really hope they add some mini-games and social features to help flesh out this experience. Can't wait to see what features they have in the works.			"

												>Only a few areas are 3d modeled, the rest is just a flat texture that looks worse as you get closer.>The city models are really messed up when you get close, just a ton of blocky and mis-shaped polygons, wierd polygonil extrusions and inverted ones in the middle of streets. >You can't really fly, rather you zoom and pan around unable to do both at the same time>Basically it's just like the app minus the simulated plane flying option>Most things look fine from a certain distance away, but too far and it's just a haze. Too close and it's a polygon nightmare full of blurry textures, Street view on google maps looks far nicer.Overall, I find it pointless and everyone else must either have a better version than I do or are just so easily amused that a ball of yarn would do just as well for them.

												Feels very much like flying around a model village.  None of it feels real or has a real sense of scale.  You don't feel you're hovering over the place or actually there.  You also can't zoom in far enough to increase the scale to life size proportions.The cities that are in 3D look like cardboard villages from a child's trainset.  The photogrammetry is very flat and square; especially at this low resolution.There are some nice attentions to detail (when you drag the Sun around and lights come on at night and the Milky Way appears, for example).  But you in no way feel like you've gained an idea of what it would be like to go there, or how grand that thing is or might be.  There's no 'wow factor'.Most of the sites in the menu appear to be moutains, canyons and volcanoes (so a lot of American landmarks).  Which would be great if there was a real sense of height and scale.It's something you'll install out of curiosity once and either uninstall it or forget about it.I'm left feeling rather underwhelmed...and a little motion sick.

												It's hard not to recommend a free game, but this was more unsatisfying than satisfying.  It took forever to load the earth.  It gives you a very limited amount of areas to explore.  You seemingly have no controls, cannot control movement or anything.  You're basically just observing the ""ride"".  I feel like this probably isn't how it's supposed to work, and maybe I had a glitched experience.  But all of my other VR games work fine, and I have not experienced any other problems.  If that is all there is to this (a visual experience), it's pretty lame and leaves you wanting control.  Not worth the time.			"

I laughed out loud in amazement as I stood at the top of Half Dome, then stepped off the edge and flew down to the valley below. I got a little emotional when I went to the lake where I spent my summers as a kid and set the time of day so I could watch the sun set over the mountains in the distance.I've been wanting this ever since I read about Hiro Protagonist's VR earth in Snow Crash many years ago.

But even after all this, after seeing what VR can do, Google Earth VR was still absolutely mind-blowing. The sense of scale you get when you 'tilt Earth up', when you revisit the place you went for vacation to, when you find your home where you're VR-ing in Google Earth right now, when you see the mountains around your hometown. A cliché, I know, but I can't put it into words. You just gotta try it. And since it's free, why wouldn't you?			"

												This is just amazing! I've always loved to explore the world using the regular Google Maps! But now i get to do it in VR in a completely new manner. It's simply mind blowing! I'd love to work on a project like this. I'm also super excited about the future, when the detail will become even greater up close, so that you can travel basically anywhere in the world, and walk those streets.I think they manage to do a good work with the move-tools, like removing the periphery to reduce motion sickness, even though some motions still made me dizzy. I hope there'll be more 3D-buildings in the future, because I know for a fact that there were 3D buildings in my hometown Stockholm before, but seemingly not any more.			"

												I spent 2 hours in Google Earth VR last night and it's *mind blowing*.Start in space and spin the Earth around. Point somewhere and start flying in. As the Earth gets larger it becomes a wall in front of you, extending out in all directions as it should. Zoom to a city and you can see all the building 3D models as if they were little miniatures stuck to the wall.Tap a button and it all tilts down so you’re now standing on the ground, towering above the landscape as a giant. Point at something and again and you both shrink in size and move towards it, an effect similar to flying but mor comfortable because your feet are always on the ground. Keep going until the perspective scale switches to 1:1 and you’re standing on a street, looking up at buildings with the same scale they would be if you were actually there.Grab the sky and spin it to make it any time of day you want. Put the sun near the horizon for a colourful, photorealistic sunset.Now do the same in any city, any mountain range, any glacier, any desert. Fly over and stand in front of monuments, volcanoes, waterfalls, cliffs, oceans.There is nothing like it; must try			"

												Simply one of the coolest and most useful and promising technologies yet conceived for VR. Really brings together so many different great ideas, from Google's original purchase of the EarthViewer technology, their aggressive addition of imagery, the procedurally generated models of buildings/houses, and now adding room-scale VR. Just... awesome.My request in future updates would be the ability to lock-in different scales. I _love_ human scale, but the whole Alice in Wonderland magic bread thing is a little weird, and does cause some discomfort. I don't want to be a giant, I just want to fly! "

Looking at giant landmarks you'd never get to visit in real life and really see their scale and their surroundings is an overwhelming feeling. The quality isn't always perfect but there are a lot of really great sights to see.Some things that could be better :* Better quality options. Sometimes you want to look at stuff in the distance but the model is reduced to a few polygons)* Support for datalayers. I'd honestly love to read the Wikipedia entry about Mount Everest while standing right in front of it.* More 3D-content! While looking at the less detailled areas from a distance is okay, it really loses a lot when taking a closer look. But I guess it's pretty hard to rebuild the whole world in high quality 3D...			"

I also want to be able to drop the GPS file of my bike and running routes onto the map and add the standard video from my GoPro and the 360/spherical video from my ThetaS camera in the VR experience. I would also like to place/replace building models from my sketchup/trimble library.I also want to enjoy this in a multi-user platform with others that have a HTC Vive and eventually with those who will be using Daydream, Oculus Rift, GearVR, Merge, and I would eventually like to be able to see something similar with Mixed Reality applications like the Microsoft Hololens, Meta 2, and others to come.Excellent job so far.

												[edit: I later figured out you can skip the tutorial by holding the trigger.  Also there's a ""human scale"" option that makes everything feel less like a toy when you zoom in.]I'm really enjoying this.  It ""plays"" differently than expected though. I thought I was going to feel huge like Godzilla.  Instead, I feel normal sized, and the world seems tiny.  Still, someone needs to make a Godzilla mod for this.One nitpick: I dislike the unskippable tutorial that makes your controllers vibrate incessantly.  I knew what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go immediately, and it absolutely REFUSES to stop harassing you to go where *IT* wants you to go until you've pressed every god damn button it tells you.

Beyond saving a favorite location I would like to be able to take pictures and videos within. I also want to be able to drop the GPS file of my bike and running routes onto the map and add the standard video from my GoPro and the 360/spherical video from my ThetaS camera in the VR experience. I would also like to place/replace building models from my sketchup/trimble library.I also want to enjoy this in a multi-user platform with others that have a HTC Vive and eventually with those who will be using Daydream, Oculus Rift, GearVR, Merge, and I would eventually like to be able to see something similar with Mixed Reality applications like the Microsoft Hololens, Meta 2, and others to come.Excellent job so far.

												The intro video almost gives you chills and moving the sun makes you feel like a god.I've had people ask me when they can VR tour China and this is a great first step, but definitely has some issues to fix.After 20 minutes you realize the app isn't perfect (probably depends on internet speed and I'm only at 20 Mbps). Basically textures and geometry pop in like crazy, but you get a good overview of places. For some reason, my home town was also full 3D but many places aren't, which is a drag. It's a very bizarre feeling being in VR on your childhood street, even with N64 graphics.Lack of streetview photoshpheres is a pretty big deal. The way you zoom in, decelerate and shrink is somewhat disorienting. I don't like the all or nothing comfort zone. Either you're Jodie Foster in Contact's machine looking through a tiny window into space or it's full screen and you can lose your balance flying around.Probably resist the urge to turn off comfort mode. I think I got a headache from doing that :P Sneaks up on you, but nothing a 30 minute break doesn't fix.			"

												Bravo! Three thumbs up!Now. How long will it be until they add an option for users to donate their photos to an effort to photogrammertize the entire planet based on the existing satellite data layer set and, custom buildings people have contributed through Sketchup or other means, and actual photographs, by date and GPS location, to make an ongoing, and nearly up-to-date texture map of the world.Then! Once they have the solar drones up, or inexpensive disposeable micro-sat constellations feeding real-time data so that you can see near- or real-time visualizations of the entire planet...Scary big brother stuff, but also neat as poop to think about the non-nefarious opportunities...The future is hear now, people, open your minds. This VR thing ain't just a game, it's a shift that will take humanity forward more quickly than it is currently prepared for... ups, downs, sideways and forever.Not too mention, this is an incredible way to escape, yet be, in reality. I spent 2 hours last night revisiting locations I have been to throughout my life, seeing changes and new perspectives. Finding things I took pictures of 25 yearsa ago and comparing them to my old photos from ""negatives,"" etc. Wow!Woohoo!			"

												Just f'in brilliant.  So cool to be looking down on your house and being able to see all around your own neighborhood and it's all in pretty damn good 3d.  Some areas are just flat maps on the topographical terrain, which is still pretty cool because you can get the sense of height from that.  Most cities I went to in my first hour or so were all in 3d from buildings, trees, cars, etc.  It feels like you're in a paper mache project of whatever city you're in and you can zoom down to be as tall as maybe a couple story building and walk around looking around the little houses or zoom up to see as high as you want and then out all the way out to an earth view.  You can spin the earth with your controller to move to the next place you want to zoom intoRuns great on my GTX970, i7 3770, smooth motion.  Each area comes into focus at a lower level and details pop in as you settle down to an area.  Its like when you zoom into Google Maps and wait for the next lower detail pic of the map you're looking at.This is the future of education.Couldn't recommend more and for the price, no brainer.			"

												Great fun to spin the globe, point at a random piece of land and swoop downwards from orbit to pavement in a matter of seconds. Or stand on the edge of a dam / bridge / skyscraper and pretend to jump off it. (Hint: Enable the human-scale option from the elipsis button, top-right in the menu)The level of detail is very impressive considering that most of the geometry is auto-generated from satellite imagery and not hand-crafted.  It's not perfect by any means (Big Ben is a bit crooked and the texture has an inconsistent 'perspective' to it) but the fact that even cars in parking lots, buses in London traffic, trees and lamposts, and even A/C units on the tops of buildings (!?) have been 'modelled' (I mean, they're textured boxes) just is amazing.  Certainly good enough to make the experience enjoyable and worthy of a download.			"

												Wow. This is truly the best VR experience I've ever had. This is why I purchased my Vive, to explore and visit places I've never been before. I actually positioned myself inside the Coliseum! I know that I will spend hours in Google Earth. One suggestion -- please allow a field where we can enter an address. It is actually quite painful trying to target a specific house in a specific country, in a specific province, in a specific city. With a search field, Google Earth would check every box on my wish list. Thank you so much for this amazing, amazing VR application. I was completely blown away!			"

												Excellent VR experience !  People can walk around the world's famous view spots in Virtual Reality without going outside. You can fly over a city, stand at the top of the highest peaks, and even soar into space.But it only can record this app through the SteamVR Headset Mirror Window,  It is inconvenience. Fortunately, we have found anther app VRCapture can solve this problem, it can record people's experience when playing Google Earth VR and share the recorded videos to Youtube.Here are two exmple recordings of Google Earth VR

												I went and stood on my street and looked at the mountains ive seen in real life a million times but this time in VR in perfect depth. Then I flew around and looked at all the places ive lived in my life. Then I decided to head somewhere Ive never been, so I flew over to New York and stood on top of the statue of liberty and looked out upon the New York skyline, then I flew over to San Fransisco and stood on Alcatraz island and looked at the golden gate bridge off in the distance...you were all looking for a killer app for VR... this is about the closest thing Ive seen so far... 10/10 im off to visit the Eiffel tower now.

												This is a little bit like that first time you got Google Earth years ago and you looked up your house and was amazed... but even more awesome! It was fun looking at major landmarks around the world, but I spent more time simply in my local area, and even though ordinary suburbs like mine don't have the fine details or building faces, I still loved seeing my streets, the familiar colour of the hills, the schools I know nearby.. it was awesome. I look forward to getting lost in this and visiting many more places. It was really comfrortable, and some nice extra settings to tweak the experience.. thanks for those!The only problem is the lack of search feature. I found my house by starting at a landmark in the features menu that was on the opposite side of my country, and then spend about 15 minutes wrestling the flying features to narrow it down through thousands of kilometres of dirt and small towns I have never heard of, before hooking onto something I semi-recognised and then traced my way home from there. Although that was kind of fun, I would much rather visit other places in the world (or show my friends around) through a quick text search.. either in the VR view or using the desktop controls.			"

												This is really amazing. You can make yourself any size and explore any part of the world. Of course, the higher resolution that Google has on an area, the better your experience will be. Any city with 3D buildings looks really great. This feels like having a scale model that you can walk across (or through, if you make yourself human size) - it feels like being in Legoland, but the buildings are more realistic. You can grab the sun and move it through the sky to change the time of day, also. It is also possible to grab snapshots of places for your favourites and jump to those places instantly at any time. All of this and it's free.Downsides (an I am nitpicking here):No search function (this is really surprising - you'll need to know your geography to find places you are interested in)You can't rename your favourite places (and depending on the place and scale you took the snapshot at, the name can be very generic)Places with little data are very flat (but this will constantly improve with time)No Google Streetview (you can go down to street level but it uses the Google Earth data so the detail ranges from ok to non-existent) - I am pretty sure this is because Streetview would be just a 2D 360 sphere which would be quite jarring compared to the amazing 3D of the Earth.

It's SO FRIKKING AWESOME to be able to wander around the planet, just spent the last hour exploring capital cities around Europe, which is really efficient when you're as tall as the Eiffel Tower!Movement is extremely clever! If you drag the Earth around you your field of view becomes limited to directly ahead, completely eliminating motion sickness you can get from travelling in VR.I would easily have paid a few quid for this experience.

												Just f'in brilliant.  So cool to be looking down on your house and being able to see all around your own neighborhood and it's all in pretty damn good 3d.  Some areas are just flat maps on the topographical terrain, which is still pretty cool because you can get the sense of height from that.  Most cities I went to in my first hour or so were all in 3d from buildings, trees, cars, etc.  It feels like you're in a paper mache project of whatever city you're in and you can zoom down to be as tall as maybe a couple story building and walk around looking around the little houses or zoom up to see as high as you want and then out all the way out to an earth view.  You can spin the earth with your controller to move to the next place you want to zoom intoRuns great on my GTX970, i7 3770, smooth motion.  Each area comes into focus at a lower level and details pop in as you settle down to an area.  Its like when you zoom into Google Maps and wait for the next lower detail pic of the map you're looking at.This is the future of education.Couldn't recommend more and for the price, no brainer.			"

												I spent 2 hours in Google Earth VR last night and it's *mind blowing*.Start in space and spin the Earth around. Point somewhere and start flying in. As the Earth gets larger it becomes a wall in front of you, extending out in all directions as it should. Zoom to a city and you can see all the building 3D models as if they were little miniatures stuck to the wall.Tap a button and it all tilts down so you’re now standing on the ground, towering above the landscape as a giant. Point at something and again and you both shrink in size and move towards it, an effect similar to flying but mor comfortable because your feet are always on the ground. Keep going until the perspective scale switches to 1:1 and you’re standing on a street, looking up at buildings with the same scale they would be if you were actually there.Grab the sky and spin it to make it any time of day you want. Put the sun near the horizon for a colourful, photorealistic sunset.Now do the same in any city, any mountain range, any glacier, any desert. Fly over and stand in front of monuments, volcanoes, waterfalls, cliffs, oceans.There is nothing like it; must try			"

												This is a really cool experience.  The ambient soundtrack and breathtaking visuals really grab your attention.Pros:Tons of imagery.Cool seeing my house rendered in 3D.Navigation doesn't make me sick (aka it narrows your FOV when flying.)Cool walking like a giant among terrain and skyscrapers.Free!Cons:Seems a little slow to load (hopefully their is caching)I'd like to see these enhancements some day:Transition down to street view and 360 pictures.Do something similiar for Mars and the Moon (if there is enough imagery.)Transition to live video in areas where there is generically available video cameras.Multi-user experiences.Annotation.Adding in building data.

												I've just had a good hour into it and holy crap!! is this awesome. Last time I tried this was in the pre-dk1 era using a Vuzix VR920 HMD with 40 degrees FOV. I have since been waiting for Google Earth to get VR support for Rift or Vive. Now its here and its absolutely beautiful. A true marvel of modern technology. Thank you Google!!!			"

												A borderline spiritual experience. Short of actually physically going to space I think this may put your existence in perspective in a way nothing else can.The comfort features are excellent but may annoy people used to VR. Thankfully it's easy to turn them all off and experience the wobbliness of flinging the landscape beneath you.			"

												This is a little bit like that first time you got Google Earth years ago and you looked up your house and was amazed... but even more awesome! It was fun looking at major landmarks around the world, but I spent more time simply in my local area, and even though ordinary suburbs like mine don't have the fine details or building faces, I still loved seeing my streets, the familiar colour of the hills, the schools I know nearby.. it was awesome. I look forward to getting lost in this and visiting many more places. It was really comfrortable, and some nice extra settings to tweak the experience.. thanks for those!The only problem is the lack of search feature. I found my house by starting at a landmark in the features menu that was on the opposite side of my country, and then spend about 15 minutes wrestling the flying features to narrow it down through thousands of kilometres of dirt and small towns I have never heard of, before hooking onto something I semi-recognised and then traced my way home from there. Although that was kind of fun, I would much rather visit other places in the world (or show my friends around) through a quick text search.. either in the VR view or using the desktop controls.			"

												Excellent VR experience !  People can walk around the world's famous view spots in Virtual Reality without going outside. You can fly over a city, stand at the top of the highest peaks, and even soar into space.But it only can record this app through the SteamVR Headset Mirror Window,  It is inconvenience. Fortunately, we have found anther app VRCapture can solve this problem, it can record people's experience when playing Google Earth VR and share the recorded videos to Youtube.Here are two exmple recordings of Google Earth VR

It actually list the street names and even street numbers for bigger cities. It is very detailed when flying over places from above. I am using it to help me decide where to vacation next, there is nothing like this, really useful for travellling to see the landscape ahead in such detail. The only thing missing is detailed street view, right now the houses on ground level look blocky, view is exceptionally detailed from above though, the higher above the ground you go the more crisp and detailed the view is. Many cities/mountains/Attractions are in fulll 3D glory, but again street view level not detailed yet. Highly recommend.			"

The sense of scale you get when you 'tilt Earth up', when you revisit the place you went for vacation to, when you find your home where you're VR-ing in Google Earth right now, when you see the mountains around your hometown. A cliché, I know, but I can't put it into words. You just gotta try it. And since it's free, why wouldn't you?			"

												Oh my god. This program has given me a sense of wonder that I have simply never experienced before. This was a feeling of meta, of being a god, while simultaneously giving me a feeling of being so small. If I could, I would have literally everyone try this so they can know just how big this world really is. Get It Now.			"

												Fantastic! Get to ground level and the details are not there, not yet, but you certainly get a sense of how large things are like the Manhattan skycrapers. It actually list the street names and even street numbers for bigger cities. It is very detailed when flying over places from above. I am using it to help me decide where to vacation next, there is nothing like this, really useful for travellling to see the landscape ahead in such detail. The only thing missing is detailed street view, right now the houses on ground level look blocky, view is exceptionally detailed from above though, the higher above the ground you go the more crisp and detailed the view is. Many cities/mountains/Attractions are in fulll 3D glory, but again street view level not detailed yet. Highly recommend.			"

												Core i5 2500K, GTX 970, 16GB DDR3Feels like I lose 1-3 frames per second, and the experience becomes jittery.  The textures take quite a long time to load in which they are still loading into frame when you turn your head even at a slow rate.  Every few minutes, attempting to move while at ground level suddenly teleports me into orbit at a random spot on Earth.  Due to that, I don't get enough time to truly relax and explore the area to my content.Even with those issues I am experiencing, I do recommend downloading this.  Being able to fly right to ground level with some of the places I've visisted, or homes I've lived in is down-right nostalgic.  It's a wonderful experience, and I enjoyed it, glitches and all.It's free, so you've got nothing to lose except your own expectations.  So give it a try.  ( :			"

As others have said it will blow your mind, but when so much detail is worked in that the moon has pahases and not just a static skybox style to it you know someone was paying attention.Nothing like going to a place and following some paths and finding something you didnt know existed just down the street from where you work.10/10 would move the sun round and round again.

												Very early stage of developement. The flying around these great landmarks is pretty good and does induce a wow every now and again, but as others have said there is issues with Surround sound - ie it wont even load unless you disable your surround sound device or force stereo. The graphics are beautifull at a distance but up close they are indeed ""blobby"".However I expect Google to patch these things out in the future in the same way that the standard Google earth was worked on, blurry to start then refined over time.I am surprised that they didn't use the databases from the Non-VR google earth to make this a stunning piece of software straight off the bat. I will be recommending this as it is free and I am 99.9% certain this will be completely different in a couple of months time and most of the teething problems will have been dealt with.			"

												Google Earth is overall, my favorite VR app due to the raw potential it holds. That said, the interface for interacting, navigating moving is absolutely horrible, very un-intuitive overall, and even after playing for over an hour it still feels wrong.There is no ability to 'grab' the world, and use both hands together to navigate or swim around, the movement feels very rigid and stiff. When rotating the angle of the earth, you can only toggle between top-down and flyover, why can't I use it at a 45 degree angle? I can't get used to it. Overall, amazing work on the app to the whole team props, but the navigation controls do not do justice to the full capabilities of VR. I'd spend a lot more time using it once the navigation is improved.			"

												This is amazing. I was hoping Google would do Earth for VR, and now they have. You need to turn on ""allow human scale"" in the menu to be able to fully appreciate what this is like, and then wait while it downloads higher detail information.I did find myself getting a bit motion (or simulator) sick; I'm not sure if my system wasn't maintaining 90 fps, or I was just swinging around too much while exploring. Standing in front of my own house was a surreal experience.Hopefully they will add the overlays and images from desktop Earth, and ability to load KML files.For exploring, and going to places I've always wanted to but couldn't, this is a spectacular tool. You can also drag the sun into nighttime, and see the stars. They do flicker a bit, presumably aliasing issues, but its still very good and gives an idea of what the night sky is like in the absence of light pollution.This really needs search ability though, and it would be neat if you could shrink to smaller than adult human scale to see what things look like to a small child, or smaller. I trust that additional features will be coming in future updates, to get it at least to parity with, and hopefully beyond, desktop Google Earth.			"

												Simply Amazing,     What an impressive job Google has done with this real life three dimensional map. I am completely wowed by the first steps into VR mapping of the world and can imagine the improvements that can be done in the future.                  To  me it looks like a world full of models. Model homes, model cars, model highways, model mountains and everything else. But the crazy and cool thing about all of it is that it is all real. I was flying down I-10 and noticed a bulletin board and wondered if I would be able to see what it read. Let it render a short time (Wish I could load everything off my computer but from what I read, the entire data file would be over 3000tb so no way on that one at this moment in hard drive history). Sure enough, it was something I have day dreamed about. 215 million estimated Powerball Jackpot. I could also see big traffic signs that show exits and destinations (while it is not perfectly rendered, it is a great start).         I spent the first day going to places I've lived and worked before. Conjuring memories, feelings for my recently departed mother (which the soundtrack definitely helped with. It is very soothing and peaceful) and this application pulled me back into the past. All the while showing me what has changed from what I remembered. While it isn't the easiest to find everything unless you can navigate without street names (I would think that would be something on the programming horizon) it's not that bad. There were a couple times when I would find the location on Google Maps on my monitor and just follow the topography VR until I found my destination.      The sense of scale is God Like. Feel like I am all powerful while in command of it (Would be cool in a Populace type game or strategy game). During my second day of scouting a new city to move to (San Antonio). I was looking at a neighborhood and remembered that it was a room scale experience. For a short time I started walking around thinking I could be a King Kong and smash everything below me. I must also say that I would love to see this much traffic in real life. There is none (basically, until you hit some traffic lights and then you can see ghost cars were they were captured but only fleetingly. I'll have to check New York City and see how many cars are present on the streets. See how bad traffic really is there and other places in the world.     All in all, I love this thing already. First off, it's free. Second, what you see is all real not make believe. In a way, it is learning also. Understanding your environment or places. Good way to scout around too. This is a great intelligence tool. Third thing is the controls in this application are very easy to master. One way I would get closest to the ground would be to point the hand control straight in the air and fly backwards until I can't go any closer to the ground. Since most of the time I am just sitting back, lounging with my feet kicked up for maximum comfortability. That brings in to the fourth reason. Four, you can chill and do this. You don't have to move things around if you have to prepare your play space. This can be a sitting, standing or moving around within this world.     Google Earth VR is so impressive. If you haven't tried it yet, there is nothing to lose and so much to gain. It has changed the way I will shop for places to rent also. Fly around the neighborhood, see if it looks good. How close it is to shops, grocery stores, neighbors and you can even see real life graffiti on buildings. So you can get a better idea of what it's like there. I am excited to see what improvements Google will make to this wonderful app. I got many ideas but I'm sure anyone that experiences this will also. Open your mind, and jump in. It'll be to a world you already know.			"

It really is a surreal experience to fly over your home town as a 10 meter giant. I'd suggest turning off comfort modes if you're going to play because IMO they detract from the game and sense of freedom.

												This is simply jaw dropping. Google has been accumulating so much geometric detail that it seemed almost pointless but seen through Google Earth VR it makes perfect sense. The only negative note I would make is that scaling and rotating would benefit from using the two controllers triggers to place two anchor points. The whole navigation seems to be signle controller oriented.			"

												FANTASTIC! If you want to introduce a non-gamer to VR, this is a great option! Google has done an amazing job taking Google Earth and turning it into a VR experience. You can travel anywhere, see everthing with surprising detail and even learn some new things along the way. There are pre-made tours that Google has put together that are awesome or you can just explore on your own. The controls are intuitive and simple. Getting around is easy to do and I have yet to experience any delay in areas loading (I'm running off an SSD, so I'm sure that makes a difference). As you can probably imagine, this is very cpu intensive and at times, certain areas render a little slower. Surpisingly, this doesn't detract from the experience but it is noticible with lower end cpu's (FX8350... bring on RYZEN!!).In summary, get this! You absolutely won't regret it!			"

												Although even with a fast internet connection (50 MBit) the scenes don't load as fast as in the promotion video, this ""game"" is one of the best I've seen for VR so far.It's a true joy to visit and zoom into places, fly around cities and mountain ranges and find spots you've been before already. But the most amazing part of it is when you start to zoom out to 5, 10, 20 km height and more, and get a true sense of how big our planet actually is!Everyone who's tried it out at my place has been amazed!And it's free! You can't go wrong with that! Try it out! :DFor future versions, I just hope they'll add native support for other devices as the Vive and add features like a search, and possibly Streetview and user photos. But as it is right now, it's already a truely great experience!			"

												Will it really happen one day that we can fly and land into popular public places and sights and literally can walk around in Street View, LIVE?! Like over Times Square New York, visit the Maya temples or..you name it.. The only way I assume it could be made possible is by hanging dozens of streaming VR camera's(rain resistant and high enough not being able to steal them;) Free space to move would be limited of course but maybe a part of a street or sight, like 50-200 x 10-30 meters?? Other issue will be those privacy rights, passing people will be visible as well because the images are live..Google Earth Live VR ...:)p.s. please make Google Earth VR compatible with the Oculus Rift asap!!!

Certain parts are very detailed and certain areas are only flat scale, but i would really like to see everything also made into real scale sizing as you zoomed in and out. I would like to see the scale of the statue of liberty, for example in real scale as well, so when you stood beside it, it would be huge. Besides that, this is pretty amazing VR! definitely one of the best programs for the vive, and it's free!			"

												Google earth VR is one of those applications that falls into the category of ""things I will return to over and over"" - for both useful familiarisation with a location to just aimless virtual meandering.  I would advise switching human scale on, so that when you ""touch down"" everything around you is to scale.  The moment you fly up the scale sneakily changes such that a city more resembles a scale model leaving you to stand head high with sky scrapers or fly up more and stride over districts, crouching and peering over buildings and features that capture your interest.GE comes with comfort mode on by default, which means that the centre is in focus as you move, but the outer areas are blur until you are at a standstill.  Personally I prefer to take that off, but I can see why some find it a bit much as you shoot off into the sky like some middle aged super hero.There are also some nice touches like being able to drag the sun across the sky to change the lighting, and a handy earth 'lollipop' to help you easily get roughly to where you want to go.Google earth VR is a happy marriage of a lot of historic work and technology that has been around for its own purposes,  and some added talent and serendipity to bring all of that to VR.  If you are (like my wife was) expecting photo realisim as you stand on some Tokyo street, then bear in mind the 3D assets are the same as you see in any other Google Earth incarnation -  as amazing as they are, they are the result of very ambitious arial scanning and as such at human scale the models have that melted cheese appearance.  It would be nice to see street view intergration as an optional layer, one where you stepped into and were contstrained to the Rails of the aquisition vehicle, until you opted back out to full 3D freedom.Another ommision is a way to search for places or landmarks.. Its a pain to have to leave VR to get your bearings and re-enter and find manually.I don't know how far the team intends on taking this project, but I hope they continue to push the great work forward, add a fun interface for viewing local photography or other layers; and maybe one day get to more frivolous features like believable ambient noises based on the locality, businesses , population and features such as forests, oceans and parks nearby -  I have to say, as silly as I look, I have even used GE VR to jog around Central Park... I live in the UK ;)			"

												One of the best VR experiences right now and something you can easily show your family members, who are not much into gaming. Intuitive controls and a clean UI, but I really wish they would add a search function to check out specific locations. This way it's more of ""fly around and explore"", but some more comfort features would be pretty nice. I'm also pretty annoyed by the loading time sometimes. It seems like the Google servers have issues when you are mirroring the screen for other people in the room - like a request limit of data to prevent abusing? I don't know what it is, but as soon as I disable the mirroring, I can see my PC downloading the data MUCH faster. However...it's free, it's amazing, you HAVE TO try this.			"

												It's amazing and it was really something exciting to see my home city, Montreal, from such unlimited perspectives but I would be even more amazing if ""human scale"" was fixed, it's really weird (and frustrating) to have those uncontrollable change of scale while going from bottom to build to top or from a building.I wanted to get a view from top of mountains, top of Christ of Rio, Top of Buildings and everytime I got sick while trying to do it.A secondary map window on desktop would be usefull to navigate in the World			"

												One of the best experiences in VR! :)It's fun going to places that are impossible or very difficult to access in real life.			"

												Definitely in agreement that this should not be free. With tremendous ease, I was able to check out every location across North America that I'd visited in real life, some of which I hadn't actually been to since my childhood. The transition between micro level landmasses to the detailed satellite imagery (and in many cases fully modeled buildings) is remarkable. There's something innately satisfying about zooming out to the full Earth, picking a random spot and then zooming all the way in to see what you find. Human scale is even cooler (albeit lacking in detail).If there was any way to donate to the project I would do it.			"

												Just 2 words: freaking awesome!You will admire the beauty of our planet now.(Assuming you lower your expectations and you don't need every single village on Earth scanned in 3D. Plus no StreetView here.)			"

												great app especially with it being free, things are pretty blurry and disfigured if you're at street view but not much can be done about that, works great on the rift it should of been out sooner for it			"

												Absolutely incredible program, the entire planet is a diarama for you to explore at your own pace.  It's so easy for hours to slip by as you explore places from your past and others you hope to travel to some day.  The topographical landscapes are beautiful and some of the ocean floors are also mapped so you can see how deep they are.			"

												This is awesome. Easy to lose track of time exploring. Looking forward to more 3D buildings and other detail being added. Also, would be nice if there was a way to identify highways when you're zoomed in.			"
