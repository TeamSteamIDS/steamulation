												The game is a too repetitive in the missions, with bad voice acting, still some bugs in movement-controlls, annoing witing-phases for your mana to build up,..... For the current price of 16.99 € a total rip off.			"

												+ Terrain control+ Cute, but not annoyingly so, characters- Poor sound. VO sounds like someone had some awful series of accidents in audacity.- Poor camera (and camera controls). Feels like a poorly adapted port from a mobile game; no zoom, quite clunky in general.- Lack of variety. Limited missions, characters, powers, and reasons to actually play.More or less feels like a dodgy phone adaptation of Black & White without any of the qualities that made B&W engaging, fun, or challenging.

												Game is extremely short spent 2 hours and 48 minutes to beat it. The game it self is pretty easy but rather slow pace for combat. The troops in the game are pretty weak so u tend to just overuse your god powers to get though a level.			"

												I wanted to love this game, it could've been everything I'd been yearning for since Populous: The Beginning but unfortunately these were shoes too big to fill. Controls felt minimal and very clunky and the aesthetics of the game looked rather primitive. The gameplay itself lacked depth with nearly every aspect whether it being construction, units, powers or terraforming almost as if it was an iOS game. Idol Hands has potential but stumbles with every feature that makes God games great, I would sadly not recommend it.			"

Please read completely before making full judgment. The TL;DR is at the bottom.Before I purchased this game, I saw that the top reviews were negative ones. However, I liked the screenshots and description, and I am fairly open-minded with low expectations, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I think one of the biggest problems is that people are going into this expecting more than what it is. The popular tags really should include ""Casual"".Overall, I liked it. It is a God game, but on a Casual scale. It does not reach the grandiosity of many other God games. I can understand how there are so many negative reviews, especially the ones made on release day at a higher price point. Considering Pocket Games planned to, and did release, an iOS version after PC, I think the design was targeting mobile from the beginning. This game is limited in scope, scale, depth, etc. I will go into it more later.I have played the game to full completion, including all achievements. It took around 5 hours to complete, and then another 5 or so to grind the ""Tree Expert"" achievement. So, it is a short game. Does that make it bad? Not really. I like being able to complete games. It's perfect for people like me that don't have much free time due to work and family. I completed it over 3 nights.My Detailed OpinionsThe characters have a unique design to them. They are charming, but they are also fun to set on fire or strike down with lightning. They make noises and exclamations, but it's nothing complex.The terrain design is well done. There aren't a large number of textures, but they fit the overall feel. The islands themselves include little scenic bits that might go unnoticed, such as a variety of flowers, ferns and other undergrowth. Being able to alter it is also nice. It's not as detailed of alterations as something like From Dust, which I played on Xbox 360, but it's still there.The game is not that difficult. Due to the limited size of the playing field, there is only so much that can be done. During the campaign, there are caps on the number of each type of Furling other than Warrior. Only the sandbox allows more.Each campaign ""level"" is just a variation of another. Since there are only 5 types of Furlings and just a handful of God powers, the only thing that makes each different is the island configuration, starting buildings on each side, and so forth. Also, I swear the AI starts cheating more. On the final level, it was like the end of days for my side. I was spending quite a bit of time putting out fires, fixing the terrain and creating replacement Furlings. I don't see how the AI was able to throw so many meteors when I had the same number of Priests and couldn't do the same.The controls take some getting used to. However, once you've used them a few times, it's not so bad. Also, some of the things mentioned in older reviews have been addressed. Check out the discussions to see what the developer has said.The key features are very deceptive. Here's a breakdown:Play God... : It sounds like they can be commanded. They can't. The description counters with ""your people will live their own lives"". Even the Warriors go all willy nilly when they get near the enemy. In almost all war strategy games I've played, if I put a target, my troops go after it. These guys use the Totem as more of a compass marker than a destination.Shape a beautiful... : Yes, I like the land. But, calling it a ""world"" makes it sound massive. So does the ""take over the world"" wording in the main description. In reality, each mission is a relatively small island or pair of islands (enemy on one side, you on the other). The only way to make it any bigger is to keep leveling it out into the water. But in no way is it global domination like it sounds.Feel the power... : Sorry, it's not ""massive"" natural disasters. They are fairly weak. Even the volcanoes can be countered. They are short-lived and have a short projectile range. Just flatten them and use Rain. Anything destroyed can be quickly rebuilt. Earthquake can only take out buildings in a close range. It's not as destructive as a real one. A well-targeted meteor might take out a building and set some on fire, but it doesn't cause a massive crater or such.Play the game... : There really isn't multiple strategies other than mixing up which disasters you use and when/where Warriors are sent. But, with the limited scope, there isn't any real replayability like bigger RTS games.In the description, it says this:learn skills to eventually forming an immense fighting force that you can unleash upon your enemy’s population to wipe them outThey don't learn anything as they are just created as one of 5 types (and only 1 is a fighter), ""immense"" is not an appropriate term for a standing army of 10-20 warriors, and the enemy's population is just as limited as yours. Wiping them out isn't that difficult.The Quick Review+ Pleasant, but not overly done, graphics+ Terrain design and control+ Charming characters+ Not too difficult, not too long (it's Casual)~ The Furlings sometimes set up shop in strange places. Even when there is room near a resource, they sometimes build too far away.~ Caps on the types of Furlings during campaign.~ AI that seems to cheat.- That stupid ""Tree Expert"" achievement. It's so out of place compared to the others. It's so annoying that I made a guide for it.


How to Become a Tree Expert 
A Guide for Idol Hands
By: AbbydonPrime

			""Tree Expert"" is the most out-of-place, annoying achievement for this game. At the time of writing, only 1.5% of players had obtained it.		


- Even with a GPU that exceeds the ""Recommended"" (higher end) requirement, I had to leave it on the medium setting to run smoothly.- Game gets laggy on sandbox once there are a lot of Furlings and trees. Loading my Tree Expert save would even cause it to go Not Responding for a while.Final SayEven with the questionable and negative points, I still liked it, and I do recommend it for the Casual audience that wants something a little more than an Alawar strategy game. If you are looking for a world-scale God game with plenty of complexity, turn back now! The price is questionable. If Casual is your primary thing, then $4.99, about $1/hr, isn't too bad. I got it on sale for $1.24, and I highly recommend it at that price.---For more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...  Group | Curator Page "

												So this is Idol Hands.  With all the hype over at GMG, i was expecting something huge, something they failed to deliver on.  Its not bad, don't get me wrong, its just not Black and White 2 great.  Those are some big shoes to fill, i get that, but the developer could have tried a wee bit harder.  After reading some of the negative comments, they all share the same gripes, which are also mine.Postive:its a god game, with volcanoesyou can Smite them rats into oblivionterrain control( it is a god game, right?)Negative:camera control, you have none really.  No rotation, no zoom/unzoom, just overhead and action. another reviewer says the right mouse button rotates, tried it, it didnt work for me.Length, its short, and a good portion of the game is spent in the tutorial that you cannot bypassits just not grand.  you get 50 population, with that you have to figure out how to divide them into 5 catagories.no way to speed up the actionyou start with a set score and it counts down when you start, no way to recoup the score ( so far the only reason to replay, to beat the score)Bottom line:I miss watching your monster change according to his actions, i miss the way LionHead made you feel playing  B&W, its scope, the ability to help your villages, the good/evil dynamic.  This is what made B&W great, what made it epic.  Idol hands cant deliver on that premise, maybe with a well tuned expansion it can, but now...no.  After the hype at GMG i felt they were trying to make promises they failed to deliver on.  As the 1st venture for Greenman loaded, they need to learn that people will only pay for a short, flawed game if the story and the game dynamics pick up the slack.  IH doesnt get there at its current cost.  It is fun, it is simple to learn, and if they continue to develope the game, it can be what its trying to be, so i recommend it for a sale or a coupon purchase as a casual game.7/10kids 5+			"

												Idol Hands takes a godly amount of time to actually start getting interesting and that's only if you can survive the dodgy voice acting during the unskippable tutorial which, let's face it, sounds like it was recorded from a tin can connected to some string. The fact that in a game where you literally play a god, it was bizzare that my actions were limited by mana and subsequently I never actually felt like I had any meaningful input and didn't feel empowered as a god. All this and a bizarre choice of camera controls all added up to a pretty boring experience.

												Idol Hands currently isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's fun and enjoyable. I'm aware the devs are active on the steam forums and are planning (during March 2015 - less than a month after release), a path to fix some issues people have reported (some being feature requests). To me, it already looks good and has great potential. Idol Hands is a God-like game where- belief auto-collects, you can raise/lower AND smooth land, you can set earthquakes, rain clouds and lighting bolts, there are 5 ""professions"" you can set your followers (woodcutter, farmer, blacksmith, priest, warrior) who will help gather resources to kill the opposition, there are (IIRC a quote) about 11 ""worlds"" each consisting of multiple (smallish) levels (you can only have 10 of each profession except warrior which has 20 IIRC). Game has story line/tutorial, is ""complete"" and is undergoing quite a bit of work (looking at forum threads), graphics are medium quality (some things like earthquakes and raising/lowering land do look a little ""janky"").

So disappointing seeing what could have been a truly awesome game being botched like this. It could have been great!For me, this game instantly presented problems:Major issues:- It immensely increased in fps lagging very quickly as the village expanded even just a tiny bit. It seemed like it would drop down 2-5 in FPS-rate for each border expansion or flattening of land, getting just worse and worse, for no obvious reason whatsoever.Neither the (low) amounts of units, the decent-enough graphics, or even somehow any added complexity to the map during play, seems as reasonable explanation for the game to perform in this manner.After flattening the land 4-6 times around the first non-tutorial village, the constantly decreasing (and never recovering) FPS of the game became unbearable. (And changing graphics quality made no noticable difference.)Minor issues:- Instead of simply being able to click on the ground with the pointer (like in B&W), the point-of-effect was controlled by WSAD keys, shown by a continuous beam on the ground; Making even having a hand/pointer feel pretty much useless. It would have been much better if there was simply a key to be pressed to decouple the hand into UI clicking.- No matter what i tried, it seemed like there was no way to hasten or skip the messages of the Furling mentor-guy. I just has to wait for the message boxes to disappear, one after the other, even if it was just one very short line of text.I bought this game because Black & White, Settlers, From Dust and Mega Lo Mania are all at the top of list of my favorite games ever. But the price made me suspicious, and the game sadly confirmed my reason for suspicion.I have put the game on ""Follow"", hoping to some day see it in better shape and to buy it again then. But this time it felt like i paid (a small amount of money) for a demo of a going-to-be-awesome game. :( "

												This game seems fun at first, then after the first 2-4 levels you realize the only difference is that the enemy gets tougher, starts working faster and the terrain starts off different... Eventually had to start carving massive mountains to slow down the enemy which failed when their God flattened them and i ran out of Mana. 1/10 fun for the first few levels and gets incredibly dull and repetitive.

												I really wanted to like this game but there were just too many problems with it. It was very glitchy. I was forced to restart many of the levels because the soldiers would not respond correctly after placing the totem. They'd stand around in a group even if the totem was placed in an area they needed to attack. And even though I played the entire game from start to finish I never received the achievement for completing the game. The game must have glitched out again...			"

												I bought thid game after seeing the hype about it and am really glad I did. I love the way the terraforming works. The hand prints itleaves behind is super sweet. I love the AI and Furling's ability to buid their own houses. It's like a mini civilization being built in front of your eyes. I wasn't too keen on the voice of the narrator but i feel that is a very minor issue. My kids love the Furlings and the game itself is really fun. My kids played it with me and they really enjoyed it. The start if fairly peaceful and slow but it soon starts to intnsify with the battles as I started getting hit with ligghtning and earthquakes from the other side.I  have done a few early levels and am looking forward to continuing later today. Am looking forward to unleashing volcano power.			"

												The game starts off with the promising mechanic of terrain moulding which supposedly would turn the tide of the battle. Unofortunately, it gets old pretty quick... No matter what kind of units you make... They are capped.. So you'l always get the perfect ratio. Your choices do not matter.Another issue is the far from cute awful beings they created for this game. They're dumb, slow and keep repeating the same ""YA!"" sample non-stop whenever they attack. Speaking of fights, you do have the power to create soldiers but my lumberjack managed to defeat a soldier and when I had 3 of mine attacking, at the same time, an enemy... They did not inflict more damage than if there was but one.Overall it is a terrible, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥broken game. Shame on you developers because this had potential.2/10			"

												Feb 2016UPDATE: I can easily recommend the game now, as they fixed a lot of the issues I had a year ago.  It's also only $5 as opposed to $20.  Changing my review from negative to positive.---Feb 2015Oh, how I wanted to recommend it.  On the plus side, it’s a god game that lets you reshape the land so that your furlings can construct their own structures as well as cast powers like earthquakes and volcanoes (similar to Populous).  On the surface, this sounds great!  On the other, there are some really odd things about this game that make me scratch my head in wonder as to what the developers were thinking.  There are no time controls, no WASD or arrow key camera movement, no zooming (there is a fixed bird’s eye view), holding in right mouse click and moving the mouse up and down (not left or right oddly) rotates the camera, no HP bars above buildings, your score decreases as you play (rushing you into beating it more quickly), and more.  As far as I can tell, there are eight levels on the campaign menu and no skirmish modes.  The inclusion of the latter would have given the game some replay value and could have made it worth $20 despite these short-sided gameplay mechanics.  As it stands, it just doesn't do enough to justify that price tag (in my opinion).

												Idol Hands may have been promoted as 'the god game that people have been waiting for' but it just doesn't seem ready. When you compare it to classics such as Populous and Black & White. it doesn’t match up in terms of depth or challenge. It’s a nice little way to pass some time if you’ve only got an hour to spare and don’t want to get involved with a video game that’s too absorbing, but if you’re looking for the next big thing in the genre unfortunately you’re not likely to find it here.However, it seems as if the developers are quite active when it comes to managing both their first release and the community. Perhaps if they continue adding features and manage to release a multiplayer mode, the mixed reception the game has received so far will improve there may be some life in Idol Hands yet. But at the moment it still has a way to go: they may be better off reducing the £14.99 price-tag and marketing it as a casual game, rather than Populous’ successor.A full review of Idol Hands can be found here: http://1001up.com/2015/04/09/review-idol-hands/ "

												Well, after the Godus debacle, at least this is a god game and not a money grabbing scheme. Let's put it this way: this game is where Godus whould have started. It's has interesting elements, at the cross between Populous and Settlers.The BIG probleme is the interface and balancing. the interface is really clumsy (no zoom... seriously???) and not great to work on. On balancing, it takes ages to destroy the core of an enemy... I mean you can wait for 30 min just waiting for your guys that have no opposition to just try to destroy the core and not do anything else...There is some potential but at this stage not enough.GRanted it is better than Godus.

YouTube™ Video: Phawx Plays Idol Hands - Terrain Deforming God Game - Quick Look Let's Play 

			Views: 2,606		

			Steam Store Link - http://store.steampowered.com/app/345750/		

Quick Impressions: Idol Hands is a God Game that features terrain deformation as a requirement for growing your village of Furlings as well as being used offensively/defensively (whichever way works best strategically) against the opposing God/village.Easily the Terrain Deformation is the stand-out feature in this game and is handled remarkably well and is graphically impressive. You'll need to use these powers to level land so that you're farmers can cultivate crops and feed your population so that you can produce more workers (wood/metal/priests) and warriors to protect your village. As you level the land around you, the border of your colony will slowly grow larger as your workers build new buildings automatically.Another plus that I really enjoyed but doesn't really change much of the game was clicking on the minimap and zooming out super far and you are presented with a landscape that is very reminiscent of the view enjoyed in Act Raiser. Again, not the biggest thing but I really liked it.The big negatives that I have for the game is the SUPER long mandatory tutorial sections (1+ hour(s)) and the inability to speed up the game. Everything in the game runs at 1x speed, always. So the early part of the game is rather boring because you don't even have all of your spells yet.Overall though, the game is very charming and family friendly.Recommended			"

												Well, nothing like Populous or Black and White. Sorry, but this is a mobile game.My brief experience with this game was like this:- Select highest resolution, start game.- Graphics are not bad, but not great either.- Tutorial 1 is fine, similar to other god games, but your focus is always on the middle of the screen, not on your mouse cursor. Bizarre, but ok.- Begin tutorial 2; lowered terrain and, by doing that, accidentally destroyed one of my farms.- Started getting this annoying message saying my villagers didn't have enough to eat.- Tried to level lots of terrain around the villagers, so that they could build another farm (they're supposed to do that on their own). Didn't work.- Created a couple of farmers to see if *they* would create a farm. Didn't work.- Leveled more terrain, created more farmers, create some woodcutters and waited.- Nothing... only that stupid message saying I didn't have enough farms.- During this whole time since the beggining of the tutorial, I was watching my points DECREASE by the second. It works like a timer, trying to force you to persue your goals. Hated it.- Hate it so much I stopped playing and came here to tell you this. I won't open this game ever again.- Paid R$ 19,00 (about USD 5,00). Didn't hurt, but could have bought a better game.Sorry guys, I didn't like it. I won't ask for a refund - I wanted to find out how this game was and I guess I did... But I don't feel like playing it again. I'm better off playing Dungeons 2: it's not really a god game, but it gives you the feeling you are actually the sh*t. In Idol Hands I feel I'm more of an observer who can raise terrain. Pretty lame, IMHO.			"

												Loved the action in this game and really cool graphics - cute but firey. A real darker underside to what, on the surface, looks like a really cutesy game.Pros:Its got great graphicsThe AI is really sweetLove the earthquake and volcano effects - we need more of thoseGreat price for such a beautiful gameSeem to be really engaging with the communityGreat for the young ones in the family as well as us older playersCons:Not enough content, but i did read they are working on more content, lets see what the future brings...Need the camera movement fixingWhat is that Score Counter thing doing in the middle of the screen? That needs to be somewhere i can't see it please...So addictive i think i am going to miss lunch and dinner...off to carry on playing before work starts :)Oh - and that old guy's voice....really?Tips:I found that you need to re-organize your groups so that in the beginning you have loads of wood cutters and iron miners, but towards the end you don't need so many and you need more soldiers. Given you are limited by total Furlings, i had to kill off some Miners in the end! Painful....but necessary ... in God We Trust.			"

YouTube™ Video: Should You Play Idol Hands? A 3-Minute God Game Review 

			Views: 502		

			God games have a special place in my heart. Having picked up a title like Baldies in my youth and thoroughly enjoying the game I found myself as a child to really enjoy these games.		

This game was clearly sponsored by the Pro-Hurricane lobbies.  Rain doesn't do any damage, all it does is put out fires and make your crops more useful. FACT:  HURRICANES KILL MORE PEOPLE EVERY YEAR THAN ANY OTHER NATURAL DISASTER.  Volcanos do not beat rain, rain is the most powerful force on Earth.Despite this poor design choice the game is very fun.... for a couple of hours and then you realize how repeatitive the campaign is.  It's always playing against the same enemy using the exact same kind of tactics doing the exact same thing.  You begin to realize how shallow exactly the game is in design.The campaign is really long, but eventually you will be wondering when will it end as you face the same enemy and same objective over and over and over and over.I bought this game because I grew up with Populous and was a huge fan of Baldies.  But this game doesn't have enough diverse options for play.  The population caps on various classes mean you will max out every single class and work towards playing in one manner.			"

												Im glad i didn't spend as much as i would have on steam. This game isn't horrible but it's a very basic game. It doesnt have much to it. It's a pretty simple style RTS game. I do like the concept of it. Being a God of a little tribe and being able to shape the lands to make it easier for the tribes to grow... However the AI is a bit slow reacted and bland. The game doesnt exactly have a story either. It's more or less other tribes are on islands and you need to grow and invade them. Like i said the AI takes some time to respond to attack orders but the game needs a lot of work. This game has alot of potential if the developers took their time and added more to it. Now as i look the developers are taking feed back to the game. In March 2015 they're going to update it and add features to make it a bit better. I personally would like to see a bit more difficulty, more macro sets, more builds of characters, more tech. (catapults, etc) Maybe even being able to shift all your mana and making a mighty hero to serve.Again as i previously stated the game needs work, but it's not horrible. If the developers stick to their game like the update says and even continues to add future updates then this game would be great. It has a lot of potential			"

												This game was fairly interesting at first.  As the tutorial walks you through your new powers, I was feeling like this would have a fun level of complexity to it.  However, the game quickly becomes repetative and tedious with the end game of each level taking an inordinately long time to finish.  The game strategy is basically choosing what order to build your 5 types of units in, most with a hard cap on the total amount you can have, and managing when to use your mana, as in using a cheap power now, or saving for a more powerful attack.  You have no control over the placement of your buildings or actions of your workers and very limited control over your soldiers.The game is also fairly short, I beat it in about 5 hours, maybe less.  About a third of this time was spent more or less just waiting for my soldiers to finish taking out the enemy's town with virtually no resistance.There is a sandbox mode once you are finished, but other than using my earthmoving powers to draw a few funny shapes into the dirt, it got boring very quickly.This is not a bad game, but I would not recommend buying it.

												Below is my original review of the game, about a year ago or so. I jumped back into it after reading some of the negative reviews people had posted. At the price 4.99 that it is now, this is a great deal. I do wish they added more control of your people but its not a game breaker. It is a shortgame but still enjoyable.The first thing you will notice about the game is the fact your in the tutorial...for a while at that. But the graphics are actually what you are going to notice. The game revolves around the idea of building up your village and to do so you need flat land. They have found a very smooth and easy to use tool set to accomplish this. The way it shapes the land was very well done and thought out.The one thing that stands out as of now to me, with just a little over an hour of game play, is I find myself wanting a little more. A little more options, control, village details, etc.I am going to recommend this game, but at the same time I feel this is a 14.99 or 9.99 game.			"

												The God game genre has seen its fair share of flops; Idol Hands tries very hard not to be one of the many to set aside. Idol Hands is a game that will appeal to casual audiences but will not impress them by any means. The features of Idol Hands are very few, and variety is lacking. Once the initial interest in the game’s single focus mechanic has been played out, you are left with a disappointing hurry up and wait game.To see the full review head over to http://www.modvive.com/2015/02/20/idol-hands-review-playing-in-the-dirt/ "

												So its time for a review...I have to say that i enjoy this game, allthough there are a few disapointments.-i would like to be able to see hitpoints on the buildings i destroy as i just watch them scream and shout before the building finally is gone.- havent figured out what makes the power thing destroyed to win lvl, if its destroying all buildings or just wacking it enough- the tutorial is abit of a drag, could probarly easy be fit into one small tutorial as the game it self is easy to grasp.- it seems to be only 8 lvls. perhaps a skirmish map or two might be an idea?other than that its a fun game with weird litle creatures and god powers. :)8/10			"

												The short and skinny...PROSDecent graphics, but that's subjective.Devs are active in the forums.Devs said in a post they plan on adding more content/features. Some may be game enhancements (camera, zoom, speed settings), but extra content such as new lands and spells will most likely be DLC. So this is more of a ""nuetral"" variable, not necessarily a ""pro.""CONSlimited ""God actions.""  You can raise, lower, flatten land. You can call in a few powers such as earthquake, lightening, meteor, etc. But that's about it. These powers don't seem all that powerful in game. Easy mode = build up decent population with 5 priests, spam earthquake in enemy village (you can destroy 2-3 each time). It's the only strategy needed to beat the AI it seems.5 classes (farmer, woodcutter, miner, warrior, priest).  And you have no control over them w/ the exception of a totem you put down for the warrior. No upgrades or enhancements, no strategic planning or placement.You dion't decide where to build. You create a minion, and they take over from there. You have NO part in their life after creation.Limited camera control - either sky high overview, or on above ground. No in between zoom or close ups.Battles seem so underwhelming. There is a heart icon over minions that represent their health, but the battles seem rather long (no way to increase damage. And attacking the villages? Get the snacks and driniks...you'll be there for a while. There's no health meter over any building so you have no idea how damaged the building is. Destroying villages, even if you have an overwhelming army just takes forever.No game speed options...which due to the above is really, really bad. You play at normal speed only. This game BEGS for a speed increase for the long battles and traveling and building times.The campaign is really just a tutorial. Having a tutorial is a good thing, but to have it BE the campagin is questionable IMO.Once you create a minion (Furling) you cannot destroy him or train him to be something else. So if you create a lot of woodcutters in the beginning but don't need them later...you are stuck with them. As I said, once you create your minions that's it...you have no control over them afterwards.AI is very, very bad IMO.  The enemy god will do silly things while his village is being attacked, such as water farms or continue to send his soldiers to my village while I have 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of warriors attacking his own + using powers to destroy his buildings.  In addition, my own, uncontrollable warriors just attack things randomly. Instead of attacking the enemy base, they will attack things that aren't relevant, such as the standby enemy minions who aren't assigned to any task. I don't feel like God with this game in its current state. It's extremely limited in what can be done. Your playstyle and options are extremely limited. This is a very, very casual game. It lacks what almost every other rts or previous God game has in terms of variety, actions, features, etc.If you are expecting depth and strategy, lots of things to do, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting just a simple, casual, easy game to play to pass the time, you'll have fun with it.I highly recommend watching let's play videos before purchasing.  I don't see the value of the game w/ the current asking price. Compared to other indie games on Steam, this seems more like a $10 game, at best for what you get out of it.You will finish campaign in less than 3 hours. There just isn't much to do in the game.  There's no variety. It feels like it is still early access w/ such a lack of content. It's like they tried to compensate for the lack of content by creating a tutorial/campaign. I'd much rather have a shorter campaign and have more stuff to do. RECOMMENDATIONHold off for now and see how the game develops. It has potential, but hasn't reached it yet and it there just isn't any way of telling if it ever well atm.			"

												Well gave it a go, wish people would have waited for DEV's to update and when they did, update their review.  I have been playing games for years and this one shocked me.  After doing some research on the studio too, this is pretty awsome for a first game.  I have the attention span of a merecat so to keep me going on a game for a while is usually a difficult task.  -Graphics look great and are limited to options which can be why it runs so stable.-Tutorial is excelent and the map navigation can be done easily now.-Voice acting is silly but the are tiny creatures, have you ever heard one in real life to compare :)-Hearing the screams of the enemy is comical -Very creative terrain modification.  Love the Hand Of God effect!Overall i must say, Home run for your first game and will be looking for further titles.  I hope that people who reviewed the original version will update their review.

												Very short game. Once you finish the ""tutorial"" levels you're literally about half-way through the game, and the difficulty from there only increases very slightly. I was never actually challenged or worried about winning. That being said, if you can pick it up for super cheap (I got it for a dime) and you enjoy little ""city"" builders with minimal depth and don't mind almost no replayability, then have at it. I put a few hours into it and only regret that it didn't have more to offer... 'cause it's fun forming the land and using my desctructive godly powers on the enemy's village.			"

												Positives: Easy to learn game! I figured out how to do everything even before the tutorial was completed. Very simple graphics, so it runned great on my old laptop (Which is 5 years old.) It's kid friendly, and I was not sure wether I was playing a childrens game, or a adult game. I'd say it's perfect for kids. It has some great charm, and the kind sensation the game gives a impression off, feels really good! It lightened my mood. Cool graphics when lowering land!Negatives: I couldn't descide what buildings to build, and where to place them. The Furlings did that for me. I really disliked that. There was no way to make roads, and more fancy looking towns. There was no structure, or streets, walls for protection etc. Just a town, and all I could do as a ""God"" was to create land. And I could do some natural powers, such as rain, lightning, vulcano, etc. But those got old, pretty fast, because of the graphics when shooting one off. Annoying to see it come up in a circle every single time, and being locked to it... And making a pathway from one hight level to the other was hard, seeing as how when I just lower ground it is in the shape of a hand, while highening lang was more ""correct"" in my head, as it highed only a nice radius around my cursor. The game only had 8 levels, and 3 bonus levels. The last bonus level was dissapointing, even though I get why it was as it was. But the game story in general was very dissapointing. I had hoped for a bigger challenge, and a longer story. It seemed to me, as if the developers gave up on it. I'm sorry, but I would not reccomend buying this game.			"

												This Game is a failure.. it could be really enjoyable cause the idea is interesting, but due to some bad aspects & controls, i give it a thumb down.+:*some great ideas*not bad graphics*simple to handle-:*game very short*controls are SO bad, this is the biggest problem! you can control your munions, their direction, where they have build   stuff, where they have to go, can be painful when you need ressources and your minion have to do the whole map to bring it back to his associated building..*Poor content, fade levels, few materials and things to do..*Repetitive quickly, all missions require you to destroy the enemy ""Base"", and the only way is your soldiers, and for this go for 40min for something you can beat in 10min CAUSE YOU CAN'T CONTROL THEM. they fight useless ennemies, destroy secondary buildings, and can die easily VS a normal units / farmers..*can be finished 100% (the only reason i keep playing it) but will take a good (huge) amount of time in the same levels cause back to the 1st point, the game is short, so you have to play the same levels again and again...*noticed some bugs for example you try to Flat a land but it do the contrary or in the wrong way, also couple of times in the same level i use my powers but doesnt affect the ennemy buildings or even damage the land...I DON'T RECOMMEND IT unless you want to try to 100% the game in less than 10hrs (if you are lucky)			"

												First of all, I love Civilization type games and the challenges they bring. I bought this game on sale back in October (2016) and was not too disappointed. In this game, you play a deity that is lovingly worshiped by a small tribe of humanoid creatures that resemble bipedal lemmings. They follow your every command and will build, harvest crops, raise offspring, kill enemies, and even bring you token offerings in exchange for your divine protection.It's addictive and each level gets progressively harder, introducing new elements to game play. If you're easily frustrated, then this is NOT the game for you.			"
