												Played this game years ago, so bought it again. its a good game for what it is trying to achieve and makes a change from russian aviator games focusing on il-2's which won all the attention. Play it and kill some germans!			"

												While very difficult to play, this is a fun game. It's just old. It's nice casual quick fun.			"

												If you know Wings of Fury and you like(d) it, then there is nothing more to say about this game. It is not a special game, but it is good for spending some time and have fun. Graphics are nice, controls are good and 5 bucks are more than worth it.			"

												This game is quite simple looking but has a lot of complexity under it.  The main campaign see's you do missions and depending on how well you do and what objectives you complete you earn points to upgrade your plane.  Upgrades make a huge difference to how easy or hard a mission is and your chance of completing objectives.The game is a little buggy however, some missions see me take off with ammo and I cannot fire, but a quick restart fixes there.  There are also a few usability things such as on arcade flight mode if you take off and turn around too quickly, you will automatically land.			"

												Bad. Very bad. There's no hope of my complaints being change with how old this game is.While the ""casual"" mode automatically gives you every single upgrade to begin with... At start on hardcore mode you can shoot down one enemy ship before you run out of ammo and/or fuel.The landing strip - if you take off and need to turn around immediately you'll likely be forced to land again. Another gripe with the landing strip is that they clearly haven't cleared the trees right next to it so you have a good chance to crash if you try to land and miss. You don't have a choice which way you take off. The menu is un-user-friendly, for instance you can't access options in game.You're expected to kill ground troops with a gun which is very hard since you are considered to have ""crashed"" if you come within the lower 1/6 of the screen, not to mention you have to point down at such an angle it's almost impossible to pull up before the game arbitrarily says you've crashed.

												If you are smart enough to spend 2 minutes studying the screenshots and the available information, you will be happy for $5. Know that it doesn't offer widescreen support though. That's my only complaint. Other than that, it's a decent game. Nothing amazing, but pretty fun. Rock Paper Shotgun liked it, I like it, do you have $5 to risk?			"

												This game is very, very entertaining, despite what the negative reviews say.  It's unique, simple, and just has a certain feel about it that brings back memories of games like TU-46 and Wings of Fury.  You can also download a demo version(Not from Steam) if you're unsure.			"
