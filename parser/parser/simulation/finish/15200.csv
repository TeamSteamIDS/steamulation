												There might be a way to patch the game after all, still I have not tested it so I keep my original comment as it was below. Even if you can patch it, it took me 2 weeks of trying and I became really frustrated, so thumbs down stays.WARNINGSteam only sells you V 1.3 of the game, even if you buy the addon too. Basically all mods require V 1.4 or even 1.5 and there is no way, at least non I found, to patch the Steam version.Dont buy it here, get the DVD but dont buy it on steam!			",164,19,5,31,34,2,37

For everyone wanting this game or who has it from Steam, you have to manually update it to version 1.4  Its really simple, to do:Local Disk > Program Files (x86) > Steam > SteamApps > Common > Silent Hunters Wolves of The Pacific > Data > UL Click on Upgrade Launcher and it will patch the game and update it.Your Welcome and have fun!

												I don't quite remember what drove me to the Sient Hunter series. I think I saw them on Steam one day and thought to myself ""hey cool, submarines!"". Before that moment I had very little interest in the subject and even less knowlege. To my understanding: a submarine was just a boat that traveled over and under water with a periscope for looking around. I know now that they are so much more than that. A submarine is a complicated piece of machinery that is designed to stealthily ambush enemy merchant ships. They are no match for destroyers and dive bombers are a constant nightmare. Above water, in daylight, they are sitting ducks. Underwater they are blind as bats, with only sound to guide their eyes. Most of your torpedoes will be duds, and if enemy war ships become aware of your presence your only hope is to submerge and leave the area quickly; and pray that the depth charges don't sink your boat. There is a reason why German u-boats were called ""iron coffins"". It's because they had the highest casualty rate during WW2.In Silent Hunter 4 (wolves of the pacific) you get to play on the American side as a submariner in the pacific theater of the war. With the U-boat Missions addon you can play the German side in the same theater. That expansion updates the game to 1.5, so it is required in order to use a lot of the mods for the game. There is one mod in particular that expands the default German campaign into the Atlantic and North Sea areas; definitely a must if you prefer that side of the conflict. Or just get Silent Hunter 2, 3, or 5 (all u-boat games). Silent Hunter 4 is unique because it's the first game since Silent Hunter 1 that lets players command American subs. Unfortunately Japanese subs are not playable, which would have been a huge bonus.I think the general consensus of this game is: you will either love it or hate it. I've seen people putting the game down either for some annoying bugs (and they are annoying) or simply because they don't prefer the submarine warfare in the Pacific theater. Personally, I like it. The American subs are unique in their own way, but not completely different from the German u-boats. The threat is still there, but the Pacific Ocean is a vast place. You may find yourself traveling around for what seems an eternity before engaging in any type of action. To me, this is the only drawback of the game. Most of the bugs and failings of the game can be improved with mods, however; and there are plenty of them online.The entire Silent Hunter series is great, and every game in the list is a good submarine sim. If you are just looking for an arcade experience and want to jump right into the action, then you can do that. However, if you want an ultra-realistic simulator then turn up the realism settings and dive into the plethora of game-changing mods that are available online. This game is a great entry for anyone even remotely interested in the subject. You won't learn everything about submarine life, but you will walk away with a new found appreciation for it!

												A+I have played Silent Hunter 4 more than any other game on Steam. I was obsessed with it, played it every waking hour. Read up on Submarines. Watched the six-hour cut of Das Boot twice. I would describe it to non-submarine nerds as a slow-paced stealth game. Very methodical. You can even calculate the trajectories for your torpedoes yourself, in what becomes perhaps the most compelling educational math game of all time. The game is very narrative, and open world in nature, though said world is almost entirely endless sea. I have hounded Japanese ships off the coast of Alaska, hiding in the fog as I used hit-and-run tactics against no fewer than five enemy destroyers, ever wary of their lumbering shadows in the mist. I have stalked convoys for days on end, slowly whittling down their numbers. I have used daring tactics to great success, narrowly avoiding the avalanche of depth charges from the surface. And I have used safe, time-tested strategies only to find myself sliding into a watery grave. The game is tight as ♥♥♥♥.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm sorry to say, but do not buy this game on steam. I love the silent hunter series, but this steam edition of the game is just full og bugs. When you have spent hours sinking ships and completing task, and suddenly you get a bug and have to restart the campaign and then try to bypass the bug it's just incredably frustrating. This might be okey the first time, but when you meet new bug after new bug every single time, the game just isn't fun anymore. Somebodey have to fix this before i can recommend the game.

												In my opinion, the best out of the Silent Hunter series. Unlike SH3 &SH5, you can play either the American or Germam campaigns. Plenty of free mods & extra missions available @ subsim.com. My favorite mod is ""Ultrasubs"". When you run out of ammo & torps, you can ""T"" bone the other ships & literally cut them in half. Also, you can play with only the mouse, or only keyboard, or combo of both.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Because the fact that you can travel cross the entire world in this game is so awesome. SH4 is good and worth a try. I prefer Sh5 but Sh4 got some controls that is strongly needed in Sh5 to make it the best. So if you like Sh4 then you can try Sh5.			",148,16,2,19,28,1,33

												Silent Hunter IV, along with Silent Hunter III, are great Submarine simulation games. The tenseness when invading Midway in the U-Boat Missions campaign, sinking an Aircraft Carrier, a light Cruiser, and a Battleship, all while being shot at by Torpedo Boats and having Bombers pass over me was a very interesting experience.The controls may take some time to grasp, so I would suggest playing the tutorial missions if you are new to this series like I am.

												It's not for everyone I must say, at first I was rather turned off by the lack of any true tutorial but as you get a feel for the controls the game truly shines as you sneak into the middle of the Japanese fleet heading to capture midway that you painstakingly search the pacific for, line up the perfect shot with a steam powered no wake torpedo in tub 3 and 4 waiting for the perfect moment and then FIRE!  You're waiting tensley as the seconds tick by into minutes and then as despair comes to your heart and you are about to call the order to dive and head back to base you see the first then second plume of water rise into the air over the enemy carrier.  You smile to yourself lower periscope and dive below the thermal layer to make sure destroyers won't find you as you head back to singapore.  This is a game that really does reward the patient, there's satifaction in setting up that shot and hitting exactly where you wanted to.			",109,10,0,11,26,0,32

												In Slient Hunter 4 the player takes on the role of a US Navy sub commander at the outbreak of World War 2 in the Pacific. Take on a number of mission ranging from regular patrols to photo recon and more. Do you have the skill to evade depth charges, attack convoys, raid harbours and sink ships to help bring the mighty Empire of Japan to its knees?

I also recommend SH3 wich is really good too, the difference between SH3 and this one is different missions and some other uboats, otherwice graphically they are the same, even if SH3 is considered the best in the series I personally think both games are equally good, some die hard fanatics like SH3 more but personally I dont see any difference. this is not a addon to SH3, it is stand alone, you can also mod this game, it plays well on my Win 7, 64 bits. not much more to say, just get it!

												This game has a lot to offer for just $10.The game includes the following features:  Multiple controllable submarines of different sizes, capabilities, crew count and more.  A huge amount of ships both enemy and friendly.  Enemy threats not only include ships but also reconnaissance and attack aircraft of varying                     types that pose a massive danger if surfaced.   You can play many roles (sonar & radar operator, navigator, captain, gun operators (deckgun,            AAA gun), torpedo tube operator, etc..)  The game allows you to organize your crew to specific tasks based on their experience; if           some crew members are sleeping you can assign any other crew member their to position,           same thing if they're wounded.  Ability to prioritize what problems are being dealt with (i.e. damaged bulkhead, periscope,                 etc..) by the crew and situation.  Real-time gameplay with the ability to fast forward as much as you like (not always the best          idea to go too fast)  The game looks fantastic and is not very demanding at all.  Ability to travel the entire Pacific and possibly further (never tried).  Destroying enemy merchants, naval vessels, aircraft and such can be very rewarding           especially when you are on a patrol. The game automatically writes logs of time date and           location of neutralization of enemy activity.   Game has a few different types of missions including rescue missions in enemy waters,            searching to destroy specific vessels, war patrols, support missions and much more.  This game can bring hours of slow paced and intense experiences if you play it right.The game is not hard as long  as you know what you're doing. I highly recommend looking up some    tutorials on Youtube and Google right away because the game's tutorial isn't very good to be   honest. Once you accomplish that the game will make a lot more sense and you'll have a lot more  fun and struggle much less.The game goes on sale often, but right now at $10 it is completely worth it.

												I should note: I tend to play with Steam in Offline mode 97% of the time, so my time shown in game is realistically about 3 times more than what it says I reckon . . .Very good game. If it is the type of subject matter that interests you, and the sort of game play that you expect, I'd say this one is an absolute must have.I was surprised by how realistic it is. Missions involve long periods of traversing ocean and nothing happening. Then spotting (or being spotted) by an enemy and launched into action. The variable time compression (all the way to 8192:1) makes this aspect of the game just about as pleasant as it could be made. A scripting system would be neat, to ""automate"" ship activities during long transits. If I had a control panel that allowed me to assign a time of day  (either clock time or relative to sunrise/sunset) to do X, Y, or Z activity I'd say this aspect of the game would be perfect.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-15 min before sunrise-> go to Periscope depth; raise observation scope; 1/3rd speed; stay on plotted course; general quarters.When batteries 5%: lower periscope; surface (no other changes).Else if sunset:  lower periscope; surface; 2/3 speed (no other changes).-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=I realize there are a lot of mods available for the game and I intend to avail myself of them shortly, so I don't mean to say that the game is ""perfect."" However, in terms of being ""complete"" and just about as ""perfect"" as one can reasonably expect a piece of commercial software to be . . . I would say that, minus that little scripting functionality I describe above, this game is 9.5/10.I honestly cannot think of any other ""vanilla"" feature or balancing the game needs.Now as far as gameplay: the ""submarine school"" is not really adequate, but there are lots of Youtubes available. Hitting stuff in hard mode when you have to do some trigonometry is pretty challenging and pretty cool. However, you can play the game in just about as easy/arcade of mode as you prefer.

												Once I got past the ""wow"" of the graphics, the game quickly took a crash dive straight down the toilet, and forgot to close the hatch first.I hate the interface and the bugs in the dynamic campaign broke the game on countless occasions, In fact, those bugs have prematurely ended my naval career more times than Japanese depth charges. The stock manual targeting in SH3 wasn't the best, but it was a damn sight better than SH4.Anyone who can figure this game out with it's complete lack of tutorials (and enjoy it) deserves a medal. Not friendly towards newcomers at all.Silent Hunter 3 is the king of the franchise and always will be - buy that instead and get some mods for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm 50/50 on this. The game has a huge learning curve and the tutorials are very unhelpful. However, I'd imagine that once you have mastered the controls/mechanics that it becomes far more fun. I just... don't have the patience for this one, you know?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fapworthy game right there. That is, if your fetish is submarine warfare. I've only played some vanilla, but mostly with Trigger Maru Overhauled. Now there's a mod that gets you all sloppy and ready to pump the shotgun. The game with that mod just creates an incredibly realistic story that you are directly writing to history!

												HI so I played this game on and off for a few hours, and I have to say, dispite some minor bugs here and there, Communities are very efficient at modding and after getting my mods working, well, mods are key to this game, without them like ""Trigger Maru"" it's impossible to enjoy.  I have to say communities still rock for Silent Hunter Wolves of the Pacific, there still needs some more ""Polishing"" mods out there, but with the overhaul called Trigger Maru, it makes it so much more fun than the normal issues lag when huge fleets like 60+ ships appearing and the like.

												First off, this game is not for everyone. It has no waifus, no real impressive graphics (aside from very pretty water even nearly a decade later) and requires mods and its expansion to really provide an immersive experience. But even Vanilla, the game is a blast. It's hard to recreate the tension I get out of this game, especially when you're really into it. It also focuses on an aspect of World War II usually forgotten by the general public in favor of the more flashy and decisive land battles in the European Theater, or the large scale naval engagements in the South Pacific - the devistating and heroic actions of the men of the Silent Service, the USN's Submariners. And even they are left often ignored, the focus on their German counterparts in the Atlantic instead. When this game gets into you, when you get into that mindset of the wolf amongst the waves, it offers an experience I can say no other game has offered me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, it would be a F-ing awesome game... IF YOU'D KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT, the 'training' isn't usefull at all, they just put you on a mission and except you to know how to do it, for example, if you choose the navigation training, you just spawn in middle of an ocean with a objective, and that's it. They don't introduce you how to control your Sub at all, they just expect you to learn it yourself. Usually learning yourself is the best way, BUT not here, because there's too many things to learn, it's just impossible. It's hard to sink a ship with torpedoes since your Submarine won't want to agree to turn towards the ship, it's always too late to turn since you've already gone past the ship you're supposed to sink. That's about it, this can be a awesome game, IF i knew how to play it, it does look good, there are alot of different ships, many nations. Even Merchant ships. But it just won't work when i can't control my Sub properly. The AA guns on the deck is easy to use tho, the aiming is kinda bad and zooming in doens't help almost at all, but it still is easy to shoot down enemy Planes. This game has pros and cons, but if it had proper tutorial to navigation and other stuff, I'd most likely love this game.			",124,26,17,17,33,2,24

												I'm very dissapointed by this game. SH3 had it's bugs, but at least it was playable. SH4 has more bugs than Florida swamps. Don't buy it, you'll only get frustrated. There have allegedly been 3 patches, but to no effect. When your sub gets damaged, team will randomly decide not to repair it. Which will result in you sink to the bottom of shallow Japanese sea. On other ocassion, damage control team will not repair sub based on your list of priorities to fix. For example, you have flooding, they will continue to repair other stuff, which will again result in you being a nice addition to bottom of the sea.When you try to shoot AA gun, in some positions you will not be able to see coming plane, because your view is how you turn your gun, behind metal fence of conning tower. So you aim your AA gun through steel wall, and it's best to leave it to the crew, which is lousy shoot FYI.First mission in American Career, extreme stupidity. You complete main objective (photo recon of Hiroshima port) and game will not let you know if you're done or not? You sink ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of their warships and merchants, still you're not done. You try to exit map, mission failed. And a little thing to mention is that you have to choose sub type on start of career. So you decide to go with sub that has range of 11.000 km, stationed in Pearl Harbour. First mission, do photo recon of Hiroshima port, which is 8.500 km from your home port. In short, you will probably be on very tight schedule with diesel. You think, ok, I'll take it slowly, try to use electric engine even when out on open see and no enemies, but when you start game, you discover,♥♥♥♥♥♥ there's not command to your crew to calculate ""range at speed"", so♥♥♥♥♥♥ you don't know what is your fuel consumption and will you be able to get to home port at all. Well, it turns out, I could not.Another stupid AI mistake. I'm in middle of enemy port, sinking ships. After I sink their largest destroyer, other war ships stay on position waiting me to get in position and sink them. Stupid!Next issue, again, I'm in middle of enemy port, surrounded by guns on shore. I was using electric engine and being submerget at this point since I don't want to get shot. Batteries fall to 25%, and your crew reports that, but also decides to surface ship without your command (obviously, AI has been programmed to do this), I did not notice what they are doing, since I was busy taking manual data and manouvering sub around port. Who is idiot who thought that I could not order sub to surface to recharge if needed, but I should be able to take manual data for torpedo solutions.Final word, I think steam version does not have patches. Which makes this game unplayable. Don't buy unless you are willing to read 6 year old forum posts for help. I must mention that I'm die hard fan of sub sims, but this will not make me less disappointed. Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Shame on you Ubisoft! ",112,33,6,18,22,0,24

												While it lacks the slick GUI of Silent Hunter 3, Wolves of the Pacific offers up more of that awesome addictive tension that Silent Hunter 3 offers and does so in a pretty package. However, the disparity between vessels, I find, to be not as great as it was in 3. While you've got your very fun low end subs like the S-Boats, you don't have the awesome death-incarnate murder machines like the Type XXI. The Balao is great, but what I'm getting at here is that you don't see the same disparity of performance that you saw in Silent Hunter 3. This is a minor gripe, either way. This game is still well worth a purchase.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

The grapichs still looks good and you can see on what have been focused on. It's not a bad looking gameThe story is not focused alot in this game, but are in the game and are shown through mission briefings that more or likely are based on history facts.

												Not overly impressed after enjoying it's predecessor SH3 for so long. Funny way to start recommending  a product but I am still in the hospital drying my wet clothes ............because;I just traversed the width of the pacific from the south china seas with 70,000 tons to my credit on first patrol, set course back to Pearl saved, used time compression and destroyed the boat running into Hawaii. (last saved in the South China seas) Is there no return to base option? If so I cannot see one! When I approached Surabaya in the same fashion it asked me if I wanted to refit there! (maybe I was speeding this time:D)Overall I enjoyed the patrol itself (to be fair), however the Porpoise class sub seems to run high in the water and takes too long to crash dive on alarm as the approaching nme aircraft seem to be escaping the eyes of the 'ever alert' watch on deck and drop countless bombs immediately and accurately. This sub has a deck gun at the rear of the conning tower which I will never understand in it's design and nor would a hundred other Admirals, you have to juxta position your boat for a surface gunnery attack which can be extremely dangerous in many ways! There is a submerged safety factor from depth charging although unfortunately, repetitive at 50+ metres depth ('passing thermal layer') which is a little unrealistic as it seems to occur repeatedly. Also as I said the aircraft seem to carry an enormous amount of ordnance to drop on you instead of the usual two or so that a f/bomber would carry. It could be the amount of realism set in options perhaps but puts it in the 'arcade' genre when this part of the action happens if not.The crew SHOUT or YELL orders emotionally (similar to SH3) which no skipper I am sure would tolerate especially during the critical phases of battle. (turn down the voices  seems to help as you work out your moves). Three torpedoes successfully into a small old freighter, a quick surface and use ten rounds of HE and AP onto her and still she is not sinking and has headway at a 5O degree list and on fire ...yeah right! Oh hang on she just called up the Imperial Japanese airforce with their ten bombs each and they have immediately arrived!The message clipboard is tedious even after you send your status reports and old news just sits there unfiltered. SH3 BDU naval message was more exact and relevant for the skipper's info and tactics etc.You can add your 78's to the gramophone again which is excellent! (What's a '78' ?....look it up)!It's open world of course, a vast canvas with random friendlies and nme battle groups etc, don't try land like I did, you don't have wheels!Excellent UI easy to understand and use even on your first mission, all of the controls are important to attack and survival, logical, weather and seascape is excellent as are the models of ships. There is a lot of plankton. The Pacific Ocean is very big!All in all for me it's 7.5/10 because it has an editor attached which has to keep the interest; it's good fun and perhaps if you are a true purist of the subsim sort then the higher realism options may increase your enjoyment. $20 sounds fair for the scope of the product, it's replay ability and graphic qualities. It has depth (haha) and worthwhile to spend time on despite it's shortcomings and with mods of course it's expansive.			",126,62,4,8,19,0,20

												Though the numer of hours currently is not much I can assure you can expect that changing soon. While the hardcore sub sim-types might gripe, overall I found this game entertaining and fun, with a lot of tension and excitement to be had. IF there is anything to detract is I find the camera angles system a bit limited but that could just be me/my opinion. Oh and it seems sometimes if too many things are going at once I've had a couple crashes, fortunatly the game allows saving mid mission. I would say if you havent played any sub sim this might be the one to get or at least try and see if you like it, you can scale the difficulty with the exception of damage.			",24,3,0,4,14,0,18

												I have played this game for a long time outside of steam (about 140 hours logged) and I have nothing bad to say about it. It kinda sucks how steam doesn't give you the right version, but that's a steam problem, not a game problem. If possible, buy the game outside of steam. The community for this series is still really active and there are a lot of great mods out there for it. Multiplayer is a blast, though you'll have to find some people to play through LAN because the multiplayer servers are non-existant. Overall, great game, challenging and realistic sim. Avoid the 5th one.			",154,29,2,17,30,2,25

												I was initially attracted to this game having met CAPT Edward Beech when I was young, and from listening to the stories my grandfather told about all the submarne skippers he'd know over the years he repaired their watches in New London. This game requires patience and strategy, whether the missions are long or short. Manually upgrade as Falco descrbed, and stand by for a good many hours of challenging play. I definitely recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,3,0,0

												I give this game a 6.5/10.PROS: As my only Submarine simulator in my inventory, I will say my first impressions with this game were very good.  I got hooked on sailing the pacific ocean, stalking my enemy before destroying their ships and forcing them to the bottom of the sea.  Learning how to use the crew, their watch schedule and rotation, and watching them get promoted and recieve awards for their actions was the most satisfying part of this game for me.  Each submarine performs differently and the missions you recieve can have very tense moments that had me sweating.CONS: This game is not very well optimized and using time acceleration can be very dangerous as enemy ships and planes will appear of out no where and sink your ship. Also, after hours of gameplay all of my save files suddenly became corrupt and I am completely unable to play the game now. I would look into what went wrong, but I am playing other games now.If the game had been fixed at some point during it's life then I have no doubt it would be one of the best Submarine games on the market.   If you are interested in this game, buy it when it is on sale and have fun. Just be warned that there are many problems that may make your experience aggravating.			",106,10,0,14,31,0,29

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. No, really. Back to the days of commanding a B-17 squadron, but this time, a Submarine for the US Navy in the Pacific. My first encounter did take sometime. One hour to even find anything, but when I did, I wasn't letting him get away. A Japanese Destroyer, I didn't even check what class from the handy ship encyclopedia they give you for ID'ing ship classes and faction ownership.There was a problem though... it was faster than me! I wasn't letting it escape, so I surfaced, manned the gun and fired at it like. 'Yeah! You! Come and fight!' Needless to say, they did. Unfortunately for them, I was a lot more accurate. I hit him twice, causing two fires on his outer section. When he came straight for me, I dived and evaded. It was then he made the fatal mistake of turning east. I had escaped to the West and cut my engines. Twenty minutes passed as I kept a low profile, watching it limp around, looking for me in all the wrong places, but then.... *woosh* 'Torpedo in the water.' ....and another... He tried to turn, cut his speed, but it was too late and my shots were true. A massive explosion rocked the aft of the Japanese destroyer, causing it to slump into the Pacific ocean. The second, smashed into the front, at first, apparently causing little damage, however fifteen seconds later, she was submerged and rolled into a watery grave. A massive explosion erupted a large wave into the air several moments after she went under with all hands on board. Love it. Learned a lot from my first encounter, and have a lot more to learn. Bring it on!			",51,4,1,15,23,1,28

												Perhaps the best of the submarine sims even up to 2016. A big choice in sub games is what nation. This one plays with the potent USA fleet boats in the Pacific and with an expansion German U-Boats. So potentially a 2-in-1 game purchase. There was/is a huge community which includes various mods such as the www.subsim.com group. You now need to use some extra steps as: http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=214687 You can get carried away with the mods. The vanilla is quite playable as is. My one wish for this game would be if the mods could end up operating in the steam workshop. ",82,19,0,25,28,0,28

												A truly engaging addition to the franchise which encourages, and rewards, creativity and guts. I had the luxury of not playing the game until I'd already played Silent Hunter III and V and I would actually recommend that strategy to others. Playing III beforehand gives you an appreciation for the streamlined management system in place in Wolves of the Pacific. Now, watches are organised for you, orders are easier to issue, and the crew aren't dropping dead of exhaustion all the time. However it does lack the emotional investment of Silent Hunter V, in which you can walk the boat and get to know the characters which make up your crew, so if that is the experience you really want from a WWII submarine sim, go with V rather than IV (if you don't mind putting up with the Ubisoft launcher's BS) Overall it's terrific, a welcome addition to the genre for it's historical content, upgraded and streamlined features and additional DLCs.

The ability to set the difficutly level to how you like to play is great.I finally found a hard copy of this game so I can add the updates and any mods I want to play around with. This is a great game if you enjoy history and naval tradition.I have played sub sims as a U Boat CMDR, but prefer the USN boats in the Pacific. Version 1.3 which is on Steam only allows for US Fleet boats. The Gold Edition or Version 1.5 update / add on gives you U Boats.			",0,1,0,1,2,0,0

												I like this game overall but have had a few growing pains with it. One thing that bothers me is that Wolves of the Pacific is only patched to 1.4. In order to get the 1.5 patch, Ubisoft makes you buy the U-boat addon. That is just a money grab. If I wanted to play U-boats I would fall back to SH3. At first I thought that the stock game had way to many airplane attacks in career mode. Once I got SD radar, the airplanes are a non factor. The TDC behaves differently in US fleet boats than in German U-boats from SH3. This is modeled well in SH4 to reflect the historic differences in subs. Overall SH4 is as good as SH3 with one major improvement. SH3 saves did not always load while I have had no trouble loading career saves from SH4.  Generally the seas seam to calm too often. 75% of the time the Pacific has only 2 to 3 ffot waves. Also the Deck gun can easily account for 50 plus tons of sunk ships which is way unrealistic. I did some research of the USS-Drum. That sub was 8th all time in tonnage sunk by a US sub during WWII. It suck approximately 85,000 tons of ships over 13 missions. You can do that in one mission in stock SH4 at 100% realism. Needless to say I have modded a few things. Namely, reduced shells for most deck guns from 120 to 24. Otherwise the game is so easy it isn't even fun. I also made it more likely to have dud torpedoes early in the war. Be sure to sheck out the mods available at subsim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros.- This game is ****ing awesome. There are many things to learn before properly playing the game, but it will be rewarding. - This is the only game which featuring WW2 US Submarine Fleet. - American MK.14 torpedo makes u laugh every 5 minutes.- In-game graphic is not bad, even though this game is about 10 years old now. - The campaign quite well-designed and I can see that this is a well-researched game.Cons. - This game is buggy as he11.- Steam version of SH4 is old and it does not support any further upgrade. This means you cannot download and apply user-made mods to fix bugs or enrich the game system. Thankx UBI Soft for not providing any upgrade to Steam.- This game is complicated but it doesnt have a proper tutorial. It is much more helpful to learn things on Youtube. - Some Japanese boats have unreasonably strong durability.- Japanese were not really skillful with Anti-Submarine Warfare in WW2. This is the same in SH4, and the game becomes bit too easy after few hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												worst few pounds i  ever spent no tutorial,(as such) little in the way of in game help, thank god for the community or i would still be waiting to find the enemy. I understand the need for realism but this goes a step to far for me, at least drop a hint or two  If you like an endless game of cat mouse go ahead but be prepared to spend hours going around in circles, still I suppose it gives you time to read the forums:)			",39,8,2,6,20,0,19
