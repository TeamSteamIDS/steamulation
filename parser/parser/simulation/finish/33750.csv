												Do you like building up  a prison and haven't played the prison tycoon 3? Then don't buy this nor the third one since nethier have a tutorial so good luck in trying to play the game (Get prison architect instead save your money for  that and a enjoy a more complex, better polished game which also has better graphics.)

												game is totally outdated do not waste your time, it's not a sharp game either everything seems to lag. Idea is great and it seems they have coevered all the basics but it can feel like a struggle just to find a guard and prevent a prison escape			",3,1,3,0,5,0,10

												Another crappy game from a bundle pack that should have been retired instead of hastily ported to steam. The game is bad for a lot of reasons, but the biggest is its confusing interface. There isn't a tutorial mode, there are very few 'challenge' scenarios, theres no way of seeing when the next milestones are, building position seems to be irrelevant... The entire game is from another era - and while it might have some nostalgic value for a couple minutes, it definitely doesn't meet todays standards of a pay to play game -- it doesn't even hold up to most free games.

												Yep I'm a life long gamer. Can't play this thing. Is this a game or a con? Honestly, worst thing EVER. Steam, you should not even have this on your shelf. Bad for your image allowing this stuff to be sold to your customers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
