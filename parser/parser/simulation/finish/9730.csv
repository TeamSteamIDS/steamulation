												Great game, just don't get it on Steam. I remember enjoying playing this a few years ago when I bought it in store when it first came out. Since then I've lost the CD and randomly thought to buy it again. I downloaded it from Steam and immediately noticed that the file was corrupted. The skins for many objects are missing and the game crashes nonstop. After a week of owning it now it crashes back the desktop as soon as the game loads. First I thought it had just installed bad so I reinstalled it but had the same problem. I quick google search of my problem revealed that I'm not the only one who is having issues with Steam's version of this game. It's a shame they have a no refund policy. As advice to anyone thinking of buying this; go for it! It's so fun for tycoon lovers. Just don't get it from Steam.			",16,0,0,0,3,0,0

												I forgot just how much fun Tycoon City: New York was to play. Think of Monopoly meets Sim City, it is sort of like that. I've owned this game for several years on the PC, but recently added it to my steam library, so I played it again for a while and found it very easy to get back into the groove of the game. The game is pretty simple, build up New York City, one area at a time, while competing with several other NPC Tycoons who are doing the very same. You can buy out businesses, upgrade existing ones and more. This game was a lot of fun years ago, and while graphically speaking it is a little out of date, and the camera controls can be a little funky at times, it is still fun to play.

												I got this game in one a bundle somewhere and I do own games like Cities Skylines, Cities XL and older versions of Sim City, so to be honest I did not think much of this game. I launched the game just to try it so I could put it in my 'hidden' list. Before I knew it, I was 2 hours into the game. You won't hear me say this game is better than the games I just mentioned. Tycoon City: New York, is a pretty basic city builder but there are a few things I found interesting. For instance, you are able to add certain items in front of building like; flowers, benches, banners and satellites. Also, you do not own every building in New York but you are able to buy them of your opponents. The game was released in 2006, so the graphics obviously aged and there are some problems with the textures in this Steam version. Naturally, the game only takes place in New York, so it helps if you like the city's buildings. Tycoon City: New York, is not the greatest city builder ever but it's still fun to play, if you don't mind the graphics and simplicity. You should, however, not get this game at the regular price.

												Sure the game is fun at first, but as you get farther into the game you start to notice its missing some things. 2 theater textures are not present (A mission involves one of those building making it impossible to complete that mission). The bridges are poorly developed, The entrance to the bridges completly go over other roads and they don't even connect to the other side they simply end in water. And some ground textures are not present and lots of errors in Central Park. I give the steam version a 2/5			",82,9,2,4,31,0,10

												The game was made in 2006 so its expected to have a bit of trouble running, no it will never be fixed by the developers, but of course by removing a few files you can fix most, if not all of the major problems with running the game. Of course the graphics are also sub-par but in 2006 these graphics were the bomb tbh.Besides that gameplay wise the game is quite fun, you run New York thats about the gist of it, theres a variety of buildings and building styles for each district not everything looks exactly the same, tbh I don't even think I got through every building the game has so that says something. You also get a bit of customization with the exterior of buildings, but this has a bit of a bug because some buildings will not let you place items in the right place or let you place items at all. Overall, the game has problems but when you fix them the game is enjoyable just like any other city builder out there.			",27,3,0,1,12,0,0

												The action in the game is great. But it just feels the game is not finished.Lots of textures flicker. Lots of glitches. And not to mention the fact that it randomly crashes. If you don't save frequently you'll have a bad surprise.But on the other hand the game itself has something that newer games tend to lose over the years and versions.If it wasn't for all the glitches in the game it would keep up with modern games very well.If it was cheaper I would recommend it. But at 10 EUR is way to pricey. There are recent releases that are cheaper than this that came out in 2006.IMO this game would be worth it at 2-3 EUR.			",64,4,7,6,15,0,10

												Disregard the 'Mostly Negative' reviews. As someone who is very critical about game play, this is a tycoon game not to be missed. The main issue is that the Steam edition has a major bug which make the game crash after four minutes, but this is an easily fix when you delete a file in the game folder which will then make the game playable. This game is highly addicting and focuses on managing business across the many districts of New York City. You are a developer, and there you're tycoon will consist of over 200 different buildings and their features. You could be running 30 different types of apartments which have very specific desirability and profits, pizza stores, movie theaters, specialty shops, fancy restaurants, department stores, convenient stores, the list is endless. It's actually quite shocking how much content isn't advertise for this game. Fairly easy tycoon game with a lot of replay value and addicting game hours. It's much MUCH larger than it appears, and should be a number one pick for anyone who likes or loves tycoon games. It's well worth the money.			",68,11,1,14,28,0,28

												I am quite upset i read the reviews. But i have a pretty updated machine and a new updated graphics card. I figured maybe be a few with less then idea graphics card. But when i try putting in a new theater all i got was a box all the texturing for it was not their just a huge box. I didn't have the issue some stated that when the npc talks their invisable. That work ok for now i guess.The game was running quite well for a while then when started to get into to buy building that cost alot more the game started to crash almost immediately. Looks like the game doesn't want me to advance. I been quite disappointed with steam lately cost i have bought quite a phew games from them and they seem to keep getting hook with more games that look good but at the end you get stiff with a broken game. I hope that they get their act together and screen these guys trying to put games in their system that are not complete and that crash more then they play. I would say if your going to let them run through your system, push them to patch their games as soon as possible. I would have recommended this game to anyone if it wasn't for it not being complete and the constant crashing btw i tried it in every graphic mode same issue arise.			",40,2,2,15,27,0,6

												Cant see why this has so many negative reviews. Its a old game a little buggy but still fine to play.It runs fine on win8, only downside I can see is that its not very hard to lose money in fact the only time you lose money is when you build something. Other than that its a sound game. I know it seems stupid to get a tycoon game when its pretty much impossible to go in the red but its just fun to build up New York and not have to worry if you place something in the wrong area and to just crack on building.It may show its age and not the best tycoon game ever but if you have a low end Pc or straight up laptop and are abit of a tycoon/city builder nut I would recommend giving this a go.7/10			",864,292,28,120,159,13,190

												Brilliant game, economics just got fun. Some people will hate this game and hate on it for being so simple. but this game is acctually genius i love it and its very well developed for a city building sim. you basically are in new york with around 20 other AI business people the idea is to make the best business. then the best chain of stores with a massive depot office one you have developed enough sucsessful businesses of the same type. each sim can be stopped in the street and they have a large pool of information concernuing where the like things etc etc, its acctually all the right information depending on the type of personality the sim has, they also work or attend education. you dont have to just build shops and resturants, you can build accomidation, entertainment venues, hotels, luxury locations for the rich and famous providing they have a suitable enviroment, education building and some council buildings, depending on you invividual busnesses succsess you will watch you quirqy empire rise to the top from being the only deli in the over developed office section, or your art shop in the middle of knowhere that you built by accident suddenly hit city record sales from the rich and famous attending the new entertainment venues nearby.its just so much fun to watch and plan.HOWEVER, this is the very bad current steam version on the game and a few in game items will not work and just appear as blank texture boxes in grey. Unless you are a die hard fan i would stay away until the textures are fixed or some nice person makes a workaround for the steam version (i hope they do) i love this game. Currently the bugs are not isolated to individuals but all people who have played the steam version of this game and have found many none working items in the form of big grey boxes.

But as for the steam edition it's good for about an hour or so of trivial drool... The game IMO seems to really only have two strategies, Begin the game, build♥♥♥♥♥♥ upgrade said♥♥♥♥♥♥ aka. spam round green shrubs cuz green shrubs are the♥♥♥♥♥♥in newyork i guess.   ---   Once you get your capital rolling in decent then you realize all that pointing and clicking, and reapeating, is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when  you can just buy the cities premade stuff... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing is, it shows you the buildings finances every month going back.... so basicly 150k buys you 19k a month every month, without deviation... so basicly after your 3rd purchase or so, your income gets just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. to the tune of you click, finances, buy this building, spend 10 seconds spamming bushes if its not upgraded to the max already, and by the time you click the next 300k luxury highrise, you've already got the funds to click finance, buy this building, spam bushes again... the quests are novelty, they tell you to go build this building, or so many of this building... but at that point why? why bother looking for realestate in a desirable location when you can just buy whatever they want you to build.... Expect bugs, i've posted screenshots, some buildings are only half modeled textured... some are missing models all together, my jebb theaters or whatchu call'ms the 250k and the cheaper 150k theaters just show up as a big white box, labeled ""Placeholder""  what a rip off (not the game, the theater) I paid 2.00 for this game with a coupon so I don't feel cheated or robbed or anything... the game was decent, just don't expect to get hours and hours of fun. Expect maybe to get hour and hour of fu......aaaaahhhh got nada that ryhmes with fun ♥♥♥♥ it, you'll get hour and hour of something to do for that hour and hour...all in all, I recommened it for anyone who's got a coupon or pays a dollar for it, I got to warn you though, not being able to skip the dialog in the scenes when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nuuyowkaas insist on telling you whatever they were trying to tell me... Fortunatly for me my cherrymx blue's be really loud in my keyboard so all the clickity clacks from mashing every key in search of the fuc king skip past this who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥dialog already did a nice job drowning it out...

												So I bought this game off another digital download service a few years ago and it worked perfectly.Then I had my old computer die on me and had to buy a new one and reinstall everything. So I head back there to redownload the game, only to find out they switched their original digital download to a Steam key.""Hey, no biggie"", I thought. ""Might as well have it on Steam"".Except no. My perfectly good copy of the game has been switched for this Steam-ing pile of crap, complete with missing models and textures. It's not like I can reinstall it from a CD either. There WAS a perfectly fine digital download for this game, for which I paid, but I can't play it anymore, because someone somewhere decided that this is what Steam users would get. That's as if someone took the jewel case of your favorite album, and swapped the CD inside for a Nickelback CD (unless you're a Nickelback fan, in which case I hope God has mercy on your soul). Of course, the digital download service won't do a refund due to the purchase having been made years ago, and I can't really get one from Steam either because I just activated my key here, so I'm basically screwed... My advice is DO NOT BUY, even if they discount it at 75 cents. This is a thoroughly broken product, and it's extremely unlikely that it will ever be updated.			",133,13,18,5,67,1,29

												I don't agree with the descriptions of the other players.This game is a fun to play for several hours. You watch your city as it is growing with buildings from yourself and other tycoons.It's made up with an living atmosphere, i haven't looked where the citizens go or where the cabs travel, for me this things doesn't matter. Maybe in the later game.One of the players mentioned ""grey-block-buildings"", guy turn off your ingame filter and they appear normal. Till now I couldn't find any bugs, the game is starting without any problem. Graphical issues may happen because of your graphics card driver (like the sprites of some plants)The money ingame always goes up, so your main goal is to increase it as fast as possible. The ""chances"" are also nice goals to aim for, but often you don't know which buildings you have to set.This game is more for kids, i think, because theres no way to loose money, you can't make mistakes.

												Game is missing some textures and crashes often. If you want to trow money in the trash, this is the thing to buy, It's unaccpetable that steam is selling a game with this problem. Not even the game studio will give you an answer.... This is why torrents exist...			",59,10,4,4,20,0,4

												Word of advice: skip the tutorial!  The tutorial will annoy you so much you'll want to quit the game before even playing it.This game was part of a bundle I bought sometime in the past, so I went ahead and installed it.  I wasn't interested in the game at all, but the genre of city-building is always an interest of mine, so I gave the game its just chance.  It just did not have the same addictive feel I got from other city-building games, like SimCity and dare I say it, CitiesXL.  There are some nicely implemented features for upgrading buildings, which adds a hint of tower defense to the mix in a way, but overall, it just wasn't a fun game engine to build in.The biggest issue I had was with the visuals in general.  Everything looks horrible and feels even worse.  I know that visuals don't make the game, but well, this type of game really needs to have good visuals.  You're building for the sake of building, it just needs to look good, and yet it does not look good.  Objects are floating inches above the ground for no reason, and you cannot rotate the orientation of any objects other than buildings, which rotate automatically to face the nearest road/sidewalk.  Characters look terrible, but in all fairness, there are some nice sounds to some of the entertainers.  Animations are very choppy.  Camera controls are easy to learn but the camera itself likes to mess up a lot when zooming through buildings and other obstacles.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												This game looks like a really fun game, and it has great potential, but the problems are just too many to ignore.  This is not like most city building games.  Your streets are already pre-defined and the buildings cannot be build just anywhere...only in the zones that they tell you that you can build in.  The building selection is very small, and some of the buildings are glitchy at best.  The transitions between water and land are unrealistic, and the maps have giant blank pieces in them.  I have also experienced issues with the game crashing.I did like how once you built a building, you could add extras to the building to enhance it's influence.  However, this also means that you really can't build and move on... To maximize the effects of the buildings that you build, you need to customize every single one individually.  Imagine doing this for hundreds of buildings that you build.  Plus you need to moniter how each business is doing.  This is far too much micromanaging for me.This game had some good parts, but I would recommend passing on this one.			",286,127,7,24,82,1,54

												Dont buy this game.Although this game is one of my favourite tycoon type games, this version of it is just plain terrible.I payed Just over $1 for it and still felt like I was ripped off. The game crashes consistantly, there are missing animations, models and textures.Go out and buy a retail copy instead.			",111,19,4,16,28,1,20

												To anyone considering buying this game: DON'T! Not only is it a waste of your money, but EVERYTHING about it is just awful. Bugged, messed up, and really annoying. I endured the tutorial, and two minutes in I left the game. THAT BAD, PEOPLE, IT WAS THAT BAD. Do yourself a favor; save ten dollars and buy ANYTHING other than this piece of garbage.

												If you want the true Tycoon City: New York experience, then this is not the version for you. You're better off with the disc version because the Steam version is missing textures, missing models, and has random crashes. I'd recommend the disc version.			",2,0,0,0,4,0,1

												RECOMMENDED ONLY IF... YOU CAN RESOLVE THE TECHNICAL ISSUESThis is a great game.  It took me about a full day of reading the community guides and playing with screen resolutions and shutting down processes in the task bar to actually get it to work though.  But, once you have get it working, it's a lot of fun.If you seriously would get a kick out of developing NY city, and I certainly do, then you'll want to make this game work.  You basically manage property and build different types of residences, stores, restaurants, bars, landmarks etc.  The game is fairly easy and the short beginners tutorial makes it easy for most people to pick up.The gameplay centers around understanding the needs of the nearby residents and building attractive businesses, services, etc. for them.  You generate income this way and each thing you build costs money.  You not only build a business, take a burger joint, for example, but you then spend these points on what you'd like -- a burger mascot, shrubs, a neon sign, etc.  I suppose the game has that sim nerd element but it's hardly hardcore sim management.  It's quite friendly and approachable.  The graphics aren't stellar, but the concept is pretty cool.  If you get excited thinking about building your own version of NY city then go for it.The community guides section of Steam has a post about what you need to delete if you are having game crashes.  I needed to follow it.  There are two folders that you need to delete.  The guide talks about checking every single file in these folders but I just took them right out because I didn't have time to play programmer.  The game then ran without crashing, and my save games weren't affected.  Also, if you have the quit to desktop or minimize to desktop issue make sure that your Windows screen resolution is configured in the games config section.  They should match otherwise you may have problems.  I hope those tips help.So why not take a break from the intensity of Simcity and try this one out -- I'm glad I did!			",124,37,3,14,44,1,13
