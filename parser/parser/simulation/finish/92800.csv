												SpaceChem has the most marvelously difficult puzzles where you don't so much find a solution as build it. The difficulty rises steeply, and you may yourself stumped, only to wake up in the middle of the night thinking ""Eureka! I've got it!"" (true story.) And once the atoms and molecules are whizzing around, doing their perfectly orchestrated dance that you yourself choreographed, you feel a wonderful sense of ownership of the solution, since it is in a very real sense yours.No knowledge of chemistry required, though people with programming experience may have an edge.

												I hated chemistry in school. You know that meme about math problems? The one about word math problems and the answer is ""Purple because aliens don't wear hats"". That one. That is how I felt and still feel about chemistry, engineering, and math. I have no idea where I even got SpaceChem, because I sure as hell wouldn't have bought it, unless I now have a sleep-buying condition I don't know about. At any rate, SpaceChem sat in my library for a very long time and it was only because I wanted the trading cards did I fire it up.It sat playing in the background for a little bit, and then I noticed the soundtrack. Such an elaborate soundscape, I had to take a look at this game, even if it fried my brain. The UI is stylish and minimalist, everything I would expect from a game with the words ""Space"" and ""Chemistry"" referenced in it. What I wasn't expecting was the rich story unfolding within the game. Like a science fiction unraveling through the planets explored with the completion of a set of puzzles found on each planet.I won't lie, the puzzles involve chemistry and engineering (to a degree... hur hur) but don't let that put you off. Initially, I could feel my brain melt out of my ears as my senses felt overloaded with symbols, flashbacks to chemistry lab and purple because aliens don't wear hats. But that soon subsided as I got stuck in with the tutorial and slowly tackled a couple of the earlier puzzles. There is a fluidity and beauty to this puzzle game that is perhaps what makes mathematicians, scientists and engineers smile when something goes right. I hate to admit it, but I felt it compelling at times to just watch a result replay. And there is a great sense of achievement when you solve a puzzle!There is a lot at your fingertips within this game - there's even a periodic table that you can review - but don't let that put you off. I can only play the game in doses, but the music is perfect to thinking and solving a logical puzzle, and that is ultimately what this game comes down to: logic with chemistry elements. I imagine anyone studying engineering or chemistry may find great joy within this game - and it could even be a great learning tool to someone trying to master some of the key concepts of the subject. If you can get pass some of symbols and terminology (and stop giggling at the term ""waldo"") then you will not be wasting your time exploring the puzzles and story within SpaceChem. The soundtrack alone is worth it.I never thought I would say it, but SpaceChem is a little gem of a puzzle game. I recommend it.			",105,106,6,22,35,3,23

												Sheesh, where do I begin?  This game is a logician's wet dream.Sure, it's an exercise in humility, but I feel I can safely say it's also the most compelling puzzle game I have played to date.  There is no chaos whatsoever--only increasingly complex order and efficiency.  If ever there were a game that captured the passion of engineering, this is it.The music is deeply inspired and provides a suitable background to your work.  The story has some enrapturing quality as well, a smidge of suspense and intrigue enough to give you that extra nudge forward.  This may sound insane, but reading the story between puzzles feels physically relieving, as though the stress on your mind is shifted to different regions, much like those atoms are shuffled so smoothly around the reactors, so orderly, clean and calm.Wait, did I say 'work'?  I mean that in the kindest sense possible.  You'll understand once you start to 'play'; these words will become interchangeable.I could see this game used in schools to outstanding effect.It's a masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game consumed my life... literally... for a couple months. To put this game into simple terms, SpaceChem is basically a visual programming game. You receive various inputs and using various tools within the game, the goal is to generate a specified output. Loops, if/then statements, arrays, and many more tools are at your disposal. The game starts simply, but the difficulty increases quickly. Pretty soon, you will find a puzzle that completely stumps you.This game is not for the feint of heart, the puzzles are hard. But since the game operates within a well defined set of rules, you will find yourself thinking of solutions throughout the day. I found myself drawing sketches to solutions that I had brainstormed while at work. Then I'd eagerly wait until the day was over to get home, try out the idea, and refine any issues. Like I said, the game consumes your life. But when you find yourself stumped on a puzzle for hours, only to conjure a solution during the day, and implement it to great success, you will feel an immense amount of accomplishment.Quite simply, this is one of the best puzzle games I have played. I wish there was more, I must have more. My only disclaimer is that if you don't like steeply difficult challenges, then you likely won't enjoy this game. I will say it once more, this game is hard.			",122,25,2,10,8,0,11

												First off, this game is not chemistry.  Do not let the 'Chem' in 'SpaceChem' scare you off.  Second off, this game is an addictive programming puzzle game that uses the periodic table as a basis for its puzzles that has a steep learning curve and a brutal difficulty in the moderate to later levels.  It's an excellent game if you want a major mental challenge or simply wish to work on your spacial programming and optimization skills.			",323,87,5,57,28,5,67

												SpaceChem is a puzzle game that deals with atoms and molecules.I don't really think the story makes that much sense, but where this game really excells is in the puzzles.The game is made up of chapters and levels. Each chapter will introduce one or two new new gameplay features. The levels take you through an easy tutorial of how to use the new element, and gets progressively more challenging. This learning curve is very good.As for how the levels themselves work, you are given various tools and a grid. The job is to move elements (like hydrogen/carbon etc.) around, and join them to form molecules which you then pipe out. It initially seems easy but once you add mulitple reactors piping out to each other it quicky adds more of a challenge.My only issue is, if I find myself becoming fixated on ridiculously complicated solutions. You can't skip levels if you are finding them too complicted. This means if you are completely stuck and can't progress unless you can solve each level sequentially.This game is controlled with a mouse, but has keyboard shortcust to make things easier to control. This works really well, in my opinion.The graphics are very simple, which is good as it makes it easy to see what exactly you're doing.The music and sounds in this game are very nice.There are extra challenges included once you complete the game, and ones that can earn you extras in TF2, it seems. This coupled with the wide number of challenges means the game definitely has a very good play-through time.Definitely buy this game if you like puzzles, but don't buy it for it's chemical/scientific accuracy.

												SpaceChem is a really excellent puzzle game—if “puzzle game” is even the right way to describe it (more on this in a moment). It casts the player as an engineer working for an outer-space industrial operation—your job is to program and arange the reactors that recombine chemical elements for various industrial purposes.Right up front it’s worth noting that SpaceChem isn’t actually a chemistry game. Ignorance of actual chemistry isn’t a hindrance. The actual game play consists of setting up tracks which carry chemical components around within a reactor, and inserting commands to make sure that what you want ends up where you want it. In some stages there is a further level of complexity where you must set up and connect multiple reactors to be used together.All this has a lot more to do with computer programming than it does which chemistry. In fact, it seems fair to say that SpaceChem is like the fun part of programming separated from all the arcane knowledge and headache that go along with it. You are, in essence, issuing simple commands to a machine to enable it to complete complex tasks. (People who have coded may also feel some déjà vu as they set about finding the bugs in the operation of reactors they’ve already set up—it feels just like debugging code.)Here is where SpaceChem is so different from most other puzzle games. Instead of being faced with a problem to which you must FIND a solution, here you are faced with an objective and you must DESIGN a solution. These stages are less puzzles than engineering tasks. And possible approaches to the SpaceChem stages are innumerable and call on your creativity as much as your deduction. This is emphasized by the feedback you get once you’ve completed a stage which compares your solution to all the others on record along several dimensions. For me, this added an incentive not just to beat a level, but to keep returning to my solution: surely I could find a way to do it faster, or with fewer instructions than the others who’d solved it. Thus the replayability of even a single stage is vast.That is the real strength and focus of the game, the core structure of the problem solving. Some other elements are less strong. The visuals are very simple, though, for the most part, I think this brings an abstract elegance. The story, such as it is, is darkly comedic but tacked on and not really worth your attention. And the boss battles, essentially normal stages with some sort of twist in how you apply your chemistry, are awkward and un-compelling as if an afterthought to the game’s design. But these complaints are peripheral to the core excellence of the game as an opportunity for creative, structured problem solving. (And don’t take the creative bit to mean it isn’t challenging. The difficulty of the game has been widely noted. Things start off easily enough, but don’t feel bad if you find the later stages very challenging—you have a lot of company.) So if you like puzzle games, coding, or a good challenge, SpaceChem is for you. (In addition to my Steam copy, I’ve put in many hours on a DRM free copy, and a number on a copy for my tablet. The game's that good--I've acquired it more than once.)			",144,42,0,12,19,2,43

												Having played through the base game, Spacechem is a great puzzle game at it's core. Pros - The puzzles. They become increasing harder as you go along, but it is pretty steady. Each set of puzzles build on skills you have acquired from the previous. There are challenges associated with many of the puzzles. You do not have to complete them to beat the game, but they really make you think and work for the achievement. They can be tough, but I enjoyed solving them. Nothing in the game is forced on you with the challenges and achievements. It saves your progress so you can keep moving forward in the game and go back later to beat the challenges. I really felt a sense of accomplishment finishing this game. Many puzzle games become the a+b =c formula and thus, boring. Space Chem held to the end.The controls and UI worked really well. Learning the hotkeys helps. There are many videos on You Tube. Really cool after you beat a puzzle, you can see how others did it. I did not see any of my solutions online and there are may ways to solve each one. The instruction on new tools were good. Told you what you needed to know and left you to figure out how to employ them. The periodic chart was a useful addition.Cons – The story outside the puzzles was a cheese sandwich with the crust (Try eating one and you'll see what I mean, dry and chewy, just sayin'). Not the worst I have seen, but after while I didn't bother. I mention this only to point out it does not take away from the great puzzles. That is the heart of this great gem. If you don't like the story, skip it. The graphics do not interfere with the game at all. They were functional. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy puzzles that challenge your critical thinking and problem solving abilities. This is an exceptional game. Skip the story, solve the puzzles. You'll feel smarter, I do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SpaceChem is a very entertaining, mindbending challenge that manages to retain an approachable difficulty curve while the leaderboard system encourages you to to think deeply about the puzzle mechanics to out class your friends. The depth available to the game has spawned a community that has still not managed to perfect solutions for every level leaving plenty of room for the enterprising chemist to dazzle and impress. In short, if you're looking for a puzzle - this is the game to get. It's fun from the start and only gets better.Do not buy this game if you can't program. Turing completeness makes for some of the most engaging puzzling we will probably ever see in a video game, but it also unfortunately means that I cannot in good faith recommend this title without that massive caveat. The game makes no pretenses about its true nature and the introductory challenges are little more than cues to familiarize yourself with the game's controls and the puzzle mechanics. The experience with the demo version is only a portion of what the game has to offer: a lack of confidence in tackling the game's challenges will frustrate you and copying other people's solutions will leave you with no understanding or appreciation of the game.

												SpaceChem is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brilliant. In the course of the game you use reactors to combine elements into molecules - that's pretty much the gist of it. However, it's done via timing mechanisms where you take in molecules and atoms and manipulate them via a series of steps - adding/removing bonds, fusing them, splitting them, teleporting them, the list just goes on. From an actual chemistry standpoint it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, but what's really intriguing is that this takes the essence of programming/circuit design and distills it into a fascinating game. Engineering students/programming students should CONSUME this game - it's a wonderful example of the sort of work we try to solve.I got hopelessly addicted to this game for a good long while. It gets hard - REALLY hard. But the feeling of satisfaction upon finding a solution is just....so fantastic. Even more if you've got some friends who you can compete against trying to find more and more efficient solutions.I cannot recommend this game enough. It's wonderful.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												Why haven't you played SpaceChem? Probably because you are intimidated by the trailer and think it's too complicated, or because you didn't know it exists. Well, this game does exist, and now you don't have an excuse anymore to not at least try the free demo.SpaceChem is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It uses fake chemistry only as a backdrop for its puzzle mechanics. So don't worry, you don't need to know anything about chemistry in order to play this game. Your job is to design machines that transform a given input into a required output. For example, the game gives you single hydrogen atoms and demands hydrogen molecules (two hydrogen atoms bonded to each other). You can then use functions like grab, drop, input, output, bond, etc. to create a machine that automatically turns hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecues. How you do this exactly is up to you. It can be very satisfying to watch your solution run, because it is YOUR OWN creation. You are not simply following a strict path the puzzle designer wanted you to take. And after each completed puzzle, a graph will show you how efficient your solution is compared to others, giving you extra incentive to make your solution work just a little bit faster or use less functions.As you progress, more functions will be available like fusion or flip-flop switches, allowing you to create even more complex machines. Some levels let you link several machines together, so the output of one machine can be used as an input for another machine. The last couple of worlds are very challenging, but even if you give up there, you'll get your money's worth. And if the campaign isn't enough for you, there are still tons of user created puzzles to solve and challenges to master.If you like puzzle games, or if you like programming, buy this game now! If you are uncertain, play the demo. It's pretty long and gives you a good look into the game. For some people the demo might even be enough.I have finished the GOG version, and that's the one I'd recommend, because it includes the DLC.			",71,25,1,3,4,1,8

You're not fast but very smart? Like insanely hard puzzles? Then buy this.I'd say this one is the best and the hardest puzzle game I've played in my life.			",168,34,2,20,12,2,11

												This is one of, if not THE most challenging games I have ever played. When I say that I mean it is legitimately challenging - it's not hard boss fights or tricky jumps or any of that . My brain ached with strategizing as if I was taking an advanced physics exam. I still haven't beaten the game because it is just so damn hard but Spacechem really blows other puzzle games out of the water. It's so smooth, so well made, so unique and still manages to be fun while being mindblowings difficult. Throw on top of that an actual storyline and neat little extras and this game is an absolute must buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spacechem is a very original puzzle game. It doesn't ask you to follow the developpers' train of thoughts and find out what they wanted you to do. Instead, you're presented with a problem and have to find your own solution.This is incredibly satisfying, because anything you try can theoretically work if you think hard enough. Or, you can just start from scratch and try something completely different.The difficulty curve is perfect, and there are enough levels for everyone to enjoy the game even if you don't make it to the end (the last couple of levels are pretty hard).Because there's no fixed solution to any problem, the replay value is huge. It becomes staggering when you take in consideration the different leaderboards and how getting a good score in each category requires a completely different approach each time.One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

												SpaceChem is a genius game about ""chemistry"", although you do not have to know much chemistry to play this game. Players are to design a set of instructions and algorithms for molecules to react and pass through for them to reach their output space. This game is quite challenging, and you will have to search for errors or optimize your algorithm. It is, in a sense, very similar to programming. I have spent hours playing this game because it challenged my mind and kept me thoroughly entertained. This is one of the most creative game I have ever seen and I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys intellectual challenge.			",412,105,6,51,43,3,53

												This game has nothing to do with chemistry--the (fake) chemistry is just some nice visuals to distract you from the fact that you're coding--and everything to do with programming in assembly. If programming in assembly is your kind of thing, or a thing you'd like to make your thing, you'll probably enjoy this game! If not, you should probably try it anyway! But bring a whiteboard.

TL;DR:It's not a bad game, but you should think carefully about whether or not you are the target audience.On paper, SpaceChem sounds exactly like my kind of game. It's a playful take on concurrent programming, and on top of that, it's themed around chemistry.I like puzzle games. I like programming. I like chemistry. Surely I will like SpaceChem then, right?Unfortunately not. I tried really hard to enjoy this game, but each time I play, a very distinctly nagging feeling hit me: I could just be programming. The game isn't bad in any notable way, and I actually had some fun playing it. But I just have so much more fun actually programming.This will be a ""buyers beware"" to the kind of people that get irritable during handhold-y tutorials and on-rails games.SpaceChem is a game. Not a sandbox. This game boils programming down to two concepts: Solving the problem, and optimizing your solution. There is going to be one single ""best"" solution to the problem at hand, and your solution is going to be either optimal or sub-optimal. End of story.Here is why you will probably like this game:If you need someone to tell you what your immediate goal is, if you feel uncomfortable with just being dropped in the deep end with no milestones or objectives, this game is for you! Intimidating as it may seem, this game does a wonderful job at providing the player with a controlled environment, clear goals, instructions and rules.Here is when and why you should think twice about buying this game:This game does its own thing, and it does it well, but it is neither chemistry nor computer science in any way. It is a game with a theme. At most, it is about repeatedly improving on solutions to the same problem. Hence, neither ""because programming"" nor ""because chemistry"" should be your reason for purchasing this title.If you have a fascination with chemistry, have done any programming in the past, or just generally prefer sandbox games, this is not that.

												This is weird game. Seriously. It was also bundled bunch of times, so you can grab it, if you so desire, for almost nothing. TL;DR (regarding gameplay itself) at the end.But what it's all about? I wouldn't say ""chemistry"" like others (and whats funny - also title) says. In chemistry, at least for now, you have to use reagents to get specific products (for example Na + Cl2 -> 2 NaCl). Here, you can operate on atomic level to manipulate what are you getting.You have something in your inputs and there is requirment to get something specific to output. Sounds easy? At first it is, only thing you need is to ""spawn"" molecule, grab it (with weird looking circle-like thing), drop it, ""despawn"" it and do it periodically. After that? Get 2 molecules, bound them and send them out. Next? While having only single H (hydrogen) and single C (carbon) make not CH but CH4 (methan) instead. And you can't simply spawn 4 H's (they appear in the same spot - causing an error), grab every one of them (only one atom with its bindings can be taken at the time) bind them with carbon... I would say playing this game literally using YT to pass levels is pointless (and I saw it in leaderboards that its common practice) because difficulty level grows quite quickly, you will need those YT clips to pass next level... and next one, and next and so on - which will become boring very quickly, you won't enjoy it as much etc. It is logical game for a reason. It took me good hour to do one level, but it was so good feeling I did it MYSELF without external help.(almost)TL;DR:Pros: good (but not great, mind you) design leaderboards (doing levels over and over again to do stuff even faster or with less ""parts"" is amazing) it's clear regarding what is actually happening/will happen requires carefull planing difficultyCons: well... difficulty would love to see some kind of small guide in the game how exactly everything works solutions are sometimes hard to pull off due to... ... limited amount of complication you can haveRegarding my last point - each waldo can ""go"" into specific point at best 2 times during one cycle. No more, due to how the game itself is constructed. Its painful when I want to drop 3 specific atoms one after the other in the same place, but I simply can't... Of course there is way around it but it makes things even more complicated.Ok to sum up - this is great game that requires huge amount of thinking, planning and almost literally debugging to make things work as intended. Feels seriously like programming but it's not.			",334,126,7,81,44,2,89

												SpaceChem is the video game equivalent of ""nerd sniping."" It's an approachable, but extremely difficult procedural programming-based indie puzzle game that's loosely based on chemistry. You are tasked with assembling ""reactors,"" which manipulate molecules to create other molecules. The game challenges you to think through a solution on a high level, then invent a way to actually accomplish it. The difficulty curve ramps up quickly, then continues to ramp up as new game mechanics are introduced.Play this game if you're feeling smart and want to prove otherwise. Unless you can beat it. Then you might actually be smart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The single best puzzle game I've ever played. 100%ing it without peeking at solutions was a true tour de force, but once you beat the final level in the main campaign getting the rest of the achievements is definitely doable. The game does require you to leave puzzles and come back to them with a fresh head, and quite often throughout the day I would find myself thinking of possible ways to solve a puzzle or another.It's easy to jump in and out of the game, which means one doesn't need to set time ahead for a session, so it's pretty useful for people without too much free time on their hands. Unlike most other puzzle games, SpaceChem admits open ended solutions, the player does not have to double guess the designer's intentions, and not finding a solution is never caused by poor signposting -- one of the main frustrations with regular puzzle games.

												A few points for context. I have a Chemical Engineering training background. I do lots of programming in my job. And I really love puzzle oriented games. In other words, this game should be a perfect fit for me.For the most part, this game is amazing. They took a very simple premise, and made a puzzle game that can get really complex. Additionally, since it is possible to design your own puzzles, I can easily understand the existence of online contests around this game.Unfortunately, I think that it is my programming background that shows the flaws in the developement environment. The help screens (and tooltips) are a bit lacking in detail. The cut-n-paste mechanics are a bit too weak. The ability to save components for reuse are also not useful enough. I understand that this is just a game, and not an IDE, but it is a programming game... or perhaps, I am just being too critical.   In summary, I do recommend this game, but it is not perfect.

												As a student of automation I really adore this game...Motivation for you to challenge spacechem is that statistics claim that only 2-4% of players will finish this game. And that you can´t stumble upon more complex yet simple & uncompromising game.While going to sleep with unfinished level I was experiencing something like lucid dreaming about possible solutions. It´s sure that this game will not be appreciated by majority of players.

												You beat each level by designing a machine to beat it for you.Pros:A clever educational game, and probably one of the most challenging puzzle games ever made. Solving the puzzles requires a mixture of computer programming, creativity, and chemistry. You don't require a knowledge of either subject since the game will teach you what you need to know. Great for students interested in learning about either subject.If you want to show off how clever you are, this is the game for you.Cons:The puzzles can be so challenging that playing the game - at times - feels like work. This isn't a relaxing activity. It requires a lot of concentration and focus. Although I like the game very much, it's hard to find a time when I have the energy to play it. ",404,137,13,41,55,6,68

First a little story:I got this game back when Steam gave everyone a free game for Christmas. At first, I was massively disappointed. Why the hell did I get this crap while my friend got Half-Life: The Complete Pack? Sometime later, I learnt this game had TF2 items, so I popped it open and got confused the first few minutes in, so I cheated my way and got the achievements I needed to get my free items. All's well ends well...Until recently, I was watching one of Mark Brown's ""Game Maker's Toolkit"" (being interested in becoming a video game programmer myself) videos in Youtube, and in one of them he praised SpaceChem. I felt bad for having tossed this game away back, even considering it's gained so many awards for being inovattive and a challenging puzzle game, so I popped it open once more, and here I am reccomending it.Onto the game now:The negative reviews on steam have a very good point in the game, this game is NOT EASY. You will benefit a lot by having programming knowledge from this game, however I could very easily reccomend this game to my friends who aren't programmers, simply because it does what it is supposed to very well, and that is being a puzzle game. Chemistry, while it is in the game and is a theme present in the game, is not required for the game. Even if you're a biologist (Lol people consider that a science nowadays?), you won't have to do chemistry here, so be happy.It starts off slow and easy, and it has a considerable difficulty curve. I haven't quite finished the game yet, but I am enjoying it and I've never really had any big moments of head-banging frustration, but I've had many ""EUREKA!"" moments. If you're not sure if you can really quite cope with this game, I encourage you to try out the demo. It should give you a rough idea of how the game plays.Graphics:The artstyle is quite nice, sadly though you spend a lot of time inside the reactors, so you get a gray screen with red and blue lasers most of the time.Story:The story is intriguing, and the written text files in the game are well written and have an interesting story developing (I don't want to spoil too much). That being said while it is not the focus of the game, it is still a nice touch.Sounds:The music has managed to staple itself into my brain. Bravo on that. It's a good soundtrack too. Sound effects are nice, my only complaint is that the sound of removing the pipes is a bit odd.If only I gave this game to my Ex back then. She would have loved it because she loves chemistry and puzzle games, despite her not being a computing nerd like me.This game is even forcing me to reconsider Portal as my favorite puzzle game. I even bought the DLC just to support this awesome game I didn't get the chance to purchase (As well as to get some extra content)SpaceChem, I'm sorry I ignored you my love. You're staying in my heart for a while.Story: 7/10Graphics: 8/10Music: 8/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not really sure how to review this game, I feel it is a very good game I just can't be bothered with it. It starts off very well with a nice intuitive system, great music and intriguing story told through text screens between levels. So where does it go wrong? Well it doesn't really go wrong as such, it is just the puzzles get ridiculously difficult. They are extremely satisfying when you solve them but they quickly get to the point where you don't even know where to start. This level of intellectual challenge is not what I am looking for in a game. I gave up having barely scratched the surface of the game. I think get this game if you are looking for a real challenge and if you can accept that you are probably not going to finish it.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

SpaceChem is a game that's difficult to talk about without sounding like a major nerd, but I'll try.The game follows the story of the titular galactic chemical industry supercorporation, SpaceChem, through the eyes of a freshman reactor engineer. In itself that would sound like some of the most boring setups ever, but consider that SpaceChem universe is full of hostile giant alien wildlife, paranormal phenomena, and, worst of all, malfunctioning equipment, and it is all up to SpaceChem to deal with that stuff. You know, while synthesizing molecules.In the actual game, you operate special reactors that can manipulate separate atoms into place to synthesize molecules. You also get to build these reactors on the planets' actual surfaces and connect them with pipelines together to synthesize really crazy stuff, such as making water into plutonium. That plutonium is then used in nuclear warheads together with rocket fuel that you have to synthesize, and that warhead is launched in real time at a giant octopus attacking your facility, no questions asked. The game is not exactly easy, but it does a decent job introducing new mechanics exactly once you have mastered the previous one.SpaceChem is a crazy mix of really dumb fake chemistry, really smart solutions, really cool boss fights and a really bizarre-yet-thrilling story. You also get exclusive cosmetics for TF2 if you manage to solve special balls-hard australium puzzles, only for nobody to recognize your genius in that game.			",108,13,7,4,10,3,10

												Congratulations!  You’re hired as a reaction engineer for SpaceChem Industries, the galaxy’s leading chemical supplier.  You’re going to be shipped off to far-flung worlds, harnessing their resources to generate the molecules that our space-faring society requires.  SpaceChem is a game about molecules.  No, that’s not right.  It’s a game about programming.  Well, that isn’t exactly true either.  SpaceChem is a game where you will take an impossible-seeming assignment, deconstruct it and build an incredibly complex engine to complete it, one bit at a time.  This is a game of puzzles, of organic problem solving, of creativity.In the most boring terms possible, here’s what you do in SpaceChem.  Take input molecules, break them down or combine them, and then output a target molecule.  Your “waldos” can manipulate the molecules on the board, but you have limited space to work in.  After a few easy introductory levels, timing and layout become incredibly important to your success.The best thing about this game is how open-ended it is.  There is no “correct” way to solve each level.  You could solve it with a small number of instruction symbols.  Or you could strive to limit the cycle time of your reactor.  Either way is valid, but you will hardly ever be able to minimize everything in one single solution.  When you finally do conquer a puzzle, you will see your scores compared to the entirety of the playerbase.  How did someone solve that level in less than 1000 cycles?!  It took me hours to figure out how to solve it in 3000!  You could revisit the problem again and try tweaking your reactors (as all of your solutions are saved when you finish them), or you could jump into the next problem right away.The soundtrack is both familiar, and entirely new.  Its’ epic soaring highs and quiet methodical moments are both uplifting and encouraging, but it doesn’t distract  from the matters at hand.The visuals are likewise very well thought-out.  This feels like an industrial console, and is likewise very simple and it is mostly very easy to grok what is going on.  This is critical, as your understanding of how the different objects interact and the sequence they will perform is your only hope of debugging your solution.SpaceChem is not easy.  In fact, it is one of the most difficult games I’ve ever played.  I couldn’t even beat the last few levels without looking on youtube for hints on how to set up my reactors.  But, it is not punishing.  Instead you feel joy whenever a little part of your setup finally starts working, and when you manage to finally get that last piece into place, its like you toppled an empire single-handed.If you have experience programming, or want to try your hand at it, SpaceChem teaches you the most important skills that you’ll require.  Not syntax or coding.  But trial-and-error, debugging, and breaking a problem into smaller parts.  If you think you can crack some of the toughest puzzles in video games, this is for you.

												This game is wonderful. Chances are if you're this far down in the reviews you have an idea of how this game works. If you don't, basically you use puzzle pieces to program machines that do chemistry. For every puzzle, there is no one solution,  you are limited only by the rules and your creativity as to what will work. You will spend hours trying to figure out one puzzle, but when you figure it out, there are few feelings better than that one of accomplishment the game creates.The game runs absolutely fine, of course, it's really not very demanding, so if you have a lower end PC and need to waste umpteen hours of your life, this can be your game.If you like puzzles, or programming, or chemistry, or running headlong into challenges, difficulty be damned, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

												This game is the perfect puzzle game.It is brutally difficult with extremely challenging puzzles.The basis of the game is that you control a thing called waldos of blue and red colour to achieve an output atom structure based on the input atom structure.There are various puzzle elements like bonders,sensors,flip flops that are introduced to help you in your way with bonders bonding atoms,sesors sensing the atom and allowing you to take alternate paths and flip flops which are the most complicated puzzle element I have ever seen.***K flipflops.It is a highly rewarding fame once you figure the solution.It requires high critical thinking to come to the solution.It has absolutely nothing to do with chemistry with the atoms just forming a premise for the puzzles.I got more than the amount paid for the time I played the game.teh defense missions are one of the weak points and I gave up the game in the last 4 stages at a level called dont fear the reaper.but till that time I got more than my money's worth.the story is intriguing and is interesting and is displayed through text only.Highly recommended if you like to solve puzzles.Highly frustrating but equally highly rewarding.

												Here's the thing with this game. It's pretty confusing, obscure, and difficult. But man is it rewarding once you start to figure it out. And that's not a negative. The confusing, obscure, and difficult add very much to the game. It shows you the basics in the beginning, but throws you into the fire real quick. I love puzzles and have been playing games similar to this for the past 25 years, so when I first got into this game I didn't like it. I went back to it again but still didn't. I was cleaning out my steam library and decided to give it another go and actually try to make some progress and it clicked. By far one of the best and unique puzzle games I've played. 10/10 Would find another hidden gem of a game in my library.			",90,27,0,36,32,0,31

												SpaceChem is an extremely difficult puzzle game that has players think like programmers in designing ""reactors"" that turn chemicals into others on an atomic scale. Two ""waldos"" move along tracks you design and execute commands on those tracks. There are several different commands and new mechanics that are implemented as you play.There are three game ""modes"" in the main story: ""Research"", where you work within one reactor; ""Production"", where you use multiple reactors; and ""Defense"", essentially ""Production"", but with added commands and boss fights. Throughout the main game, the player is told a story of a protagonist who joins SpaceChem, a company that produces chemicals, as they learn of its dark secrets.The game is simple at first, even up to the third world, but then one hits this game's learning cliff. Where it seems the puzzles can't possibly get more difficult, they do. Exponentially. It took me over a year to beat this game (though I played on and off times), and that was just the main story. SpaceChem has loads of user-created puzzles (I believe over 100) that further test your knowledge of the game. Your solve times are also ranked against other players on histograms. SpaceChem also has a full and powerful level editor and ways to upload your own puzzles. The community is great too, although it has been less active.There's just so much to do in this game - you'll find yourself spending hours just solving or optimising single puzzles. Nothing beats the euphoria you'll get from finally beating a puzzle you've been stuck on.Overall, SpaceChem is worth the full asking price as an excellent design-oriented puzzle game. It even has large discounts on it and its DLC very often, and trading cards to go with it. If you're a programmer or enjoy programming, or you just want to get into Zachtronics games, SpaceChem is definitely the way to go.			",18,3,0,1,5,0,2

TL;DR: a puzzle game like you've never seen before.SpaceChem is a unique puzzle game, combining in itself chemistry, casual programming, logic puzzles and schemes. Game's set up in a sci-fi universe, and there's a certain storyline (if you're interested enough in reading it).Game difficulty is progressing relatively fast, forcing you to learn quickly, in order to complete tasks that are more and more challenging. I've spent around 2 hours and completed around 20 puzzles (that's not that much, because I've spent 10-15 minutes on the last ones, while first were a piece of cake).Your main goal is to create molecules by combining atoms of chemical elements in factories (it's really hard to explain the process itself, you should watch a video). As the game progresses, you'll have more and more complex tasks at hand, and more than one factory to maintain at each level (combining, say, H and O elements in one, and adding C to them in the 2nd, then combining everything with Hg in 3rd).There's a lot of possible solutions to each puzzle, but the player is motivated by the high scores (among his friends or all users) to use the least possible amount of elements to complete each puzzle.As the game progresses, molecules are becoming larger, and schemes required to combine them are becoming extremely complex, to a point that you don't consider this a game anymore -- more of a chemistry/physics/logic/math class homework. But it's surprisingly thrilling and satisfying, especially when you score high amongst your friends.I'd rate this game 8.5 out of 10.0, with the tutorial being a bit lackluster (learning curve is a bit steep) and graphics being outdate, in some way (not that it matters to a logic game).Should I buy this game?If you're into logic/puzzle games, and you enjoy schemes and casual programming, this is a must buy. If not, you might try anyway (I'm not into puzzle games myself, but I utterly enjoyed this one).			",1448,480,42,172,104,11,232

												The most satisfying puzzle game I have ever played. I found the mechanics kinda difficult to grasp at the beginning but the basic principles are fairly easy to understand. Basically, you are building molecules out of atoms (who would have guessed). You start the game with one reactor that has 2 ""circuits"" in it, you can modify shape of these circuits and put different commands on them that will input/output atoms, grab them, bond them together, you can also rotate the molecules and do other stuff with them that I don't know about yet since I am not too far into the game.Later on, you will be given multiple reactors that can all be ""programmed"" separately giving the game a whole new level. For instance, you can have one reactor that will be used to brake bonds between atoms, then it will output them to another reactor that will bond them together with different atoms to form the molecule that you need. Now all of this sounds like you need a degree in chemistry and physics to be able to play the game but that is absolutely not the case. It's all logical, you don't need to know absolutely anything about chemistry or any other science.What some people may dislike about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly but a nice thing is that all the solutions are always saved and you can revisit previous levels to go over the basics again, experiment or improve your designs. Because unlike many other puzzle games where you are merely trying to find the single solution that the developers invented, in Spacechem there are hundreds if not thousands of solutions to every level and there is even online workshop kind of thing where you can download player-created levels and also upload your own (I hope that's what it's for, I have never actually used it :D), giving the game a HUGE replay value. I can imagine sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.Even though I am not very good at puzzle games and I doubt I will ever finnish this one because the difficulty gets absolutely ridiculous in later levels from what I've seen on youtube, I have to recommend Spacechem. It's extremely original, challenging, satisfying and fun. What more could you possibly ask of a puzzler? It even has a story! I haven't really followed it too much but it's there and sometimes you get a story-related mission like the one I recently got where I had to destroy a giant bulldozer closing in on our base by filling some tanks with methane causing them to explode in it's face!

The satisfaction of finally beating a puzzle and watching your reactors all work seamlessly is the best feeling ever, it feels like a real achievement when you beat each puzzle. I don't know if I will ever be able to finish this game but I already feel I have gotten my money's worth from this game and im only on the 4th world after 8 hours.Toughest puzzle game ever xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I did it.I beat this game.It only took me 6 years.Look at my time spent. That's how thorough this game forces you to be for just the campaign.The game is based around very basic programming and chemical principles, and involves you taking chemicals as inputs and transforming them into desired outputs. More difficult puzzles involve you using multiple sequences like this in tandem to power different devices to defeat some kind of boss.It may start out simple, but by the end it gets obscenely complexThe level of catharsis is proportional to the elegance of your solution, but even a brute-forced, less elegant approach will still warrant a satisfying sigh of relief for a job well done.All in all a great and very challenging puzzle game. While it may help a bit, you don't need a high level of mastery over chemistry to understand the game--that said it'll help teach you some basic principles. Buy if you're looking for a challenge.

												More like programming than like gaming, this game got me asking myself MANY times: why in heaven do I still playing this?! Probably because of the sense of accomplishment? I'm not sure. I hope I will figure out at some point, but I totally love it.You use a fictional machine to build an output, by disassembling/splitting/manipulating a given input. It happens to be molecules and atoms, but it could as well be sheeps and dogs, who cares? The difficulty of the game scales exponentially. There is 0 luck, 0 dexterity, just pure logic, so you can only blame yourself for failing. Under the hood, this is an ""algorithm building game"".The achievements are mostly progress-related, with few exceptions, but trust me: they are DIFFICULT. Don't trust the completion rate you see on Steam page, many people look the solution online.			",176,110,1,20,21,1,21

It looks complicated, upon startup. Game redirects to not-terribly-helpful YouTube video as well.

												If you can beat the game by yourself without looking at youtube solution at all, then congraz you are officially a ♥♥♥♥ing genius. Don't play this if you are not into puzzle game or you know you aren't smart enough (a.k.a stupid), else you will probably end up smashing your PC.It only requires a very basic knowledge of chemistry...basically the game has almost nothing to do with chemistry. (Anyway if you failed your chemistry test paper, most likely you will fail at this ultra complex puzzle game as well lol)The tutorial in this game is totally useless, I have to figure out everything by my self. However if you are good in programming skills and have some basic knowledge on chemistry, you will have no problem in the begining, until you reach those final stages where you are going to cry for mama. Upon solving the puzzle there will be a graph comparing the stats between you and other players, this is the moment where you will realize how dumb you are, how in the hell is it possible to solve that♥♥♥♥♥♥in less than 300 cycles when my solution has 3000 cycles!? TL;DRThe best and hardest puzzle game I've ever played.Recommended for those who want to kill their brain cells, if you have a tumour in your brain, it will probably die too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spacechem has one of the worst tutorials ever. It doesn't really help much in terms of teaching you the controls or how to play the game or the concepts that you need to think about to solve the puzzles. It even unintentionally teaches you some bad habits that unnecessarily clutter up your solutions and make things harder on yourself.However it's still an amazing puzzle game if you're willing to put the effort into it. While many puzzle games are designed to require a very specific order of steps to solve them, Spacechem is more of a sandbox. You work on your own to learn new mechanics hands on through experimentation, then you can try to think about how best to apply the concepts with meticulous planning or just try to work through it with trial and error and  gradually refining your solution until you find something that works. And as long as it works, it doesn't really matter how efficient your solution is (though you can always try to improve your work). So maybe the tutorial being bad isn't as big a deal as it might seem at first (assuming it doesn't turn you off the game completely).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Might be the reasons stopping you from exploring & enjoying this gameFirst 5 levels""A bit too simple, is this really fun?""""Just grade 7 chemistry. Real-life reactions don't work that way. It's more tedious than difficult and I don't see how it's educational.""but the well-written story keeps me going :)Around level 8 or so""Woah the difficulty rise is a bit steep. I can't figure it out. I feel dumb & not exactly motivated to solve""↑ On hindsight that level isn't particularly hard, but this game is minimalistic. Minimalism gives it more possibilities. Also it doesn't give you any clues so you can think independently, explore around freely and have more fun when you discover a certain idiom of symbol arrangement on your own.The only problem is it might bore you before you ""get"" this game.When I just got into this game, I've no idea how certain arrangements are possible---like multiple entries within 1 run, or overlapping pipelines, so it takes a long time to arrive at the solution---outside the box thinking takes a bit of wrestling.Once I get to the 3rd & 4th planet, this game is pretty fun.It's challenging. It's getting addictive. If I beat a level but my solution isn't exactly neat, I'll replay the level.The game also starts showing more variations in gameplay.The mid and later portions of this game really gets difficult and tedious.I'm not there yet. I'll see if it loses me anywhere, or if it'd be both brain-wracking and fulfilling fun at the same time.			",113,57,1,15,13,0,36

												I expected SpaceChem to be a cerebral game, and it delivered. What I didn't expect was for it to be so damned hard. I'm only about 25% through the missions, and some of them take an hour or more to complete. Finishing the game will an 80 hour task.SpaceChem is fun, if you like logic and programming puzzles. I'm hesitant to recommend it, because I know many people won't enjoy this. I think, though, that if you like this kind of game, you know who you are, and you'll find SpaceChem to be both entertaining and deliciously unforgiving.There are some nice non-game features, like leaderboards, in-game video recording (for Youtube!) and creating forum signatures based on your progress. One side effect of the videos, though, is that people seem to be looking up solutions on Youtube and duplicating them. You can tell by looking at the leadersboards. Why would anyone play this way? I dunno.Anyway, I won't be finishing this soon, but I won't be uninstalling it, either!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Space Chem is a puzzle without being a very obvious puzzle. In fact, you don't even need to know any chemistry, as it manages to blend science fiction with chemicals to make a very interesting game. Use ""waldoes"" to take apart chemicals and molecules and reassemble them to spec, with the the parts colliding, and try to do it wtih the fewest steps, parts, and so on. The game gets fiendishly difficult in the final few levels, when you have to swap parts from molecule to molecule using very limited means. The lack of hint system, IMHO, is this game's only weakness, but it also encourages some VERY creative (and seemingly head-slappying d'oh! what didn't I think of that) solutions. Search for some Youtube videos on this and see some of the more ingenious solutions out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever played. Most logical, that's for sure - it isn't chemistry, it's pure programming, creating algorithms. Each level has multiple ways to complete, almost always there's more efficient way and sometimes finding even one is very hard. The reward for completing the level? More difficult level! And a lot of satisfaction - of course as long as you won't look at the leaderboards. I've kept this game installed for almost three years, planning to finish it one day - because giving up, deleting SpaceChem wasn't an option. I was returning to some difficult, unsolved levels after months of not playing, totally forgetting previous ideas. I was making sketches and notes when not playing. And finally I've completed last level. Now I can return to previous ones and try to optimize my solutions. Or try all community levels. With SpaceChem there's always another puzzle to solve.

												I love this game. Even if i found the tutorial rather weak i really got hooked up by this game. This a very special type of puzzle game and not all people may like it so if you're hesitating i would highly recommand you to play the demo first. The difficulty is well-made even if it increases really fast, you start with easy level and you finish with completly insane one.The only bad point i would have with this game is the story. There is nothing wrong in it but you quicky forget and stop paying attention to it. I played it ~90 hours (+50 not on steam) making it one of the game i played the most.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the best Puzzle game I've ever played.On each level the player is required to *create* a solution rather than just find the way the developers intended  like in many puzzle games.  This makes the gameplay compelling and rewarding because each solution is very much the player's own.The game is seriously challenging too, starting off with some easy levels so you get the hang of things, but quickly ramping up to missions that require complex solutions that actually take planning and ingenuity. For puzzle fans the game is well worth its normal price tag.  For everone else, at least try out the demo; the demo in itself is a decent length and will definitely make you decide whether this game is for you or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best puzzle game since... I don't know, maybe original The Incredible Machine. Maybe that's too harsh, but personally this was original enough to remind me of ""the good old times"" when games were something new most of the time. Oh, Bridge Builder! That qualifies too. And I'm sure dozen other games that just now I cannot name.Try waking up middle of the night with a numbed hand and in fever after spending 8 hours of playing SpaceChem. Still in sleep brain does funny things when it tries to solve the puzzle of how to get the hand working again. I learned I need to connect red input to red output to move my hand again.

												Incredible game, especially for someone who loves programming like me. I've devoted 70+ hours playtime to it and I'm still not done playing it. I'm really proud of myself for having solved all the assignments except for the last one on my own - that one needed an intervention from a guide because my solution required way too much manual work. I also felt a bit silly when I found out you can bond / fuse an element while simply passing through the respective zone - I thought you had to drop it there first. There is also a bug with the ResearchNet achievements: all of them popped up at the same time as soon as I solved one published assignment. This is another thing I loved about this game though: you can make your own assignments and publish them.			",192,73,1,22,13,3,14

												Earlier on today I activated the steam version of this, and thought I'd write a review.  Alas One needs five minutes of play time registered to play, so didn't I go and boot it up and play about for a bit.  This being my first time playing it on steam, didn't I see my friends records for levels, and didn't I go try and beat them.  And it's several hours later now.  But I certainly don't think they were hours wasted.  I didnt' even play that far in this time - just the first two worlds, but really enjoyed optimising my solutions to try match those of people on my friends list.This is one of my favourite games.

												Here’s a game I don’t like, but actually feel bad about not liking.SpaceChem is a puzzle game in which you have to create chemical compounds inside reactors. To be more precise, your job is to create procedures that assemble those compounds - yes, assemble. It’s not so much a game about chemistry as it is about creating factory lines, or concurrent programs.The concept behind the game is nothing short of brilliant, and I don’t think there’s a single game in the market remotely like it. I was taken by it in the first few hours. After that, however, the difficulty ramped up considerably, and I found myself taking way too long to figure out a single solution.That’s my problem with the game, it’s just too complicated for its own good. You have to spend massive amounts of time on details trying to make the solution work, and forget about the story because of how much time goes by between scenes. It ends up feeling like a job, not a diversion.Sometimes, I wish I could have gotten into it. I admire people who play this game well. In fact, I spent a lot of time at Spacechem.net trying out different solutions for levels, completely taken by how brilliant they were. But I saw no joy in trying to figure them out myself.I guess SpaceChem can be compared to EVE Online in this regard. It’s a game that’s really fun to watch unfold, but only the most patient and dedicated can actually play. If you’re in that group, good, buy it, but if you’re like me, skip it. There’s not much for you here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like Where's Waldo but with chemicals.Okay, maybe not. It's a fiendish and quite unique puzzle game that has you manipulating atoms and assembling molecules inside special reactors. The process of engineering the assembly lines, however, resembles the usage of a visual programming language. A friend of mine said that if you have any spark of a programmer inside of you, you will love this game. I agree with him. The 'language' that the Spacechem reactors use may be somewhat limited, but that's what forms much of the challenge of the game.And I mean it when I say it's fiendish. The tutorials are more akin to guidelines, and they don't tell you some of the tricks you will probably end up needing, meaning that self-discovery plays a fairly large role. Fortunately enough, the solutions are open-ended - seeing your solution work provides much of the satisfaction of the game. That's why if you get stuck (and you will probably get stuck a fair amount), it's best to find hints, go back to earlier levels to try and find inspiration from them or simply take a break.Anyway. Surprisingly for a puzzle game, it has a pretty good story, killer music and Team Fortress 2 promotional items. You'll need to use TF2's advanced crafting to make them, and you need to solve three puzzles to gain all the crafting ingredients you need. It's a pretty remarkable implementation, perhaps one of the most remarkable out of all of TF2's promos.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spacechem is absolutely beautiful. It manages to capture the magic of computer programming and make its joys accessible to a wider audience.Let me talk about actual programming for a minute. Programming is 90% problem-solving, 9% frustration, and 1% elation over the feeling of dominance. You start with a goal in mind; creating a program for a specific function. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the computer to do what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it, and find out it doesn't work. That's where the frustration comes in. You tweak your code, you run, it fails again. Lather, rinse, repeat about once per ten lines of code, then...VOILA! IT WORKS! It's a great feeling that I can't possibly describe sufficiently.Spacechem's gameplay follows the exact same process. You start with a goal in mind; taking given input molecules and turning them into given output molecules. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the game what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it and find out something went horribly wrong. You tweak the commands, run it again, fail again, repeat again, until eventually...SUCCESS! YOU ARE WINRAR! You feel like a total bada**.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably one of the best puzzle games I've played in my entire life. It is also one of the most difficult games I've played and I suck at it terribly.Basic premise is to program little robots on a constrained tilegrid (one action per grid) to turn atoms and molecules into different atoms and molecules by combining them, breaking them down and whatnot.Trust me it's more exciting than it sounds. You build your paths and actions, and see what breaks. You fix that, and see what 5 other things break. Hours later you have this massively elaborate thing, but it works, you made it, and you're proud. It's a satisfaction of your own work that you don't see much in games. It makes you feel like a genius mastermind once you have a puzzle solved and your solution running smoothly, only to have the game throw another curveball at you in the next one.

												This will probably be the most difficult game I will ever play in my entire life unless they make a Spacechem 2. I think I may have PTSD from repeated attempts a few of the later levels (nothing like spending 2 hours on a solution to find out it won't work orz)Recommended if you like a complicated mathematic/engineering challenge. Not recommended if you like having a lot of free time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about SpaceChem? I thoroughly enjoyed it, in the way that one enjoys the Sunday Crossword in the NYT, or figuring out how to solve a six-layer Rubix Cube. The game does a good job introducing you to the basic mechanics, but strategy is all up to you. Some experimentation is required to figure out the finer details of how different features work.The first few levels are a walk in the park and the story is actually quite entertaining. Once I got a ways into it, the levels started taking me so long (because by jove they were complex!) that by the time I got another peice of storyline I'd forgotten the last thing that happened.Probably not for everyone - it's a *very* difficult puzzler, but for me this game was two thumbs up.

												I definitely recommend this game if you like puzzles/programming. Each level you have to construct a kind of flow-chart to convert one type of molecule to another, but you only have so much space to work with and can't have things collide with one another!It can be very challenging, but there are lots of solutions available online if you do find yourself really stuck on one level. There are also hundreds of levels made by the community that give the game a huge lifespan. Just be careful because it can become a huge timesink!Overall I rate it 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spacechem is a fun game. There's no denying that. You get to use sophisticated technology to design molecules for a company and fight monsters and all sorts of weird stuff using your head.But what they didn't tell you is that you're actually working for Syria. It all makes sense now, doesn't it? It's ingenious. Have you ever heard of Ender's game? We're secretly designing molecules for Syria so they can come closer and closer to nuclear armament. So please, put this game down now before it's too late. The Syrians are THIS close to achieving nuclear fission, all they need is for a few more simulations to be run by the likes of us hungry players, we have to stop this together. Alert the FBI, CIA, your grandmother, and the president, because thousands and thousands of american citizens have been bamboozled into working for free - no, PAYING - to help the Syrians build a bomb to wipe us out.It's not too late, only you can help us now.

												SpaceChem is a puzzle game that combines the chemistry with physics, is very entertaining as you spend a little time thinking about how to solve the puzzle that'sto come.

The graphics are simple and straight-to-the-point, and thus hold up very well for a game 5 years old as of now. The music can get repetitive, but is nice enough. Don't expect realistic chemestry, but the puzzles are challenging and satisfying to complete.

												There was a bit of time in 2011-2015 where I was fully obsessed with this game and the obsession came to a head in Late September 2014 when after 2 months of designing and running reactors on paper, an iPad and an Android tablet (usually simultaneously) where I finally beat the last level of the main campaign from scratch with absolutely no outside assistance. (Took a few months to recover before uploading my designs to Steam.)I own SpaceChem and 63 Corvi on Android, iOS, and PC (Both on steam and DRM free). 3 SpaceChem t-shirts, all of the swag you can imagine that was created by Zachtronics for the game and I have easily over 4000 hours played across all platforms (not to mention the ridiculous amount of time I spent doodling and planning on chemistry lab graph paper).With that out of the way here's a review:Warning, this game is not for hardcore puzzle game fans.This game is specifically for those who need to be obsessed with puzzles to the point of tryharding.Have you ever thought you could beat Tetris?Have you ever actually beaten Tetris?That's what playing SpaceChem feels like.SpaceChem is incredibly tedious and it will cause you mental anguish to the point where you might have a nervous breakdown. Need proof?Here's the statistics of people who actually complete the game: (Without Guides)[puu.sh]Image courtesy: http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem-statistics-time/You'll note that the further players get in the game the less they want/are able to finish it.In other words it is truly an incredibly humbling experience insofar as measuring your own intelligence. It's like an IQ test, if you apply yourself you will succeed, if you're haphazard about it (Like using guides or other players solutions) you will still succeed but it will make it much much easier than if you had just tried on your own.Most levels in this game have hundreds of millions of potential ways to solve EACH SECTION of the puzzle. If you try you will complete every level it is just a matter of designing your solutions.I know my summary score and my personal score don't add up, but this game is a 5/5. it is a masterpiece and just because the audio/story/visuals aren't ""the best"" it is a legendary game and deserves no less than a perfect score.Audio: 3/5 - AdequateGraphics: 4/5 - Sensible and useful but still a little confusing at points.Story: 2/5 - Not really inspiring or terrible but below average for necessity. Gameplay: - 5/5 - Legendary comprehensive chemistry factory game.Overall: 5/5 - I wouldn't give back the thousands of hours I've spent playing this game. I loved it, and I am proudly a Partner Reaction Engineer.TL;DR - It was +BOND at first CYCLE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SpaceChem is an excellent puzzle game that demans more from its players than many standard titles in this genre. It  requires spatial design, layout construction, coordinating of various components, and production output among other facets. It requires its players to build an assembly line to bond chemicals in various designs and then export them to either a load bay, or to the next factory in line, in which that design will be incorporated into a production that will result in an additional design. It can be wonderfully consuing and engaging for the right audience, and an infuriating nightmare for those who don't want to dive into the more challenging levels. It's fun for awhile, and it's excellent in its design, though it's not something I want to spend too much time with, though those who enjoy various forms of engineering will find hours of enjoyment in this game. Highest recommendations for those who enjoy engineering puzzles with a heavy science bias, while others who wish to dabble in that game space may enjoy it for a bit and then look elsewhere.

												Definitely recommended with a couple caveats:- Some puzzles will take hours/days to solve. You will be thinking about these puzzles during your spare time. You may even start keeping/carrying around a notepad to sketch possible solutions on. - You WILL get very frustrated. However, my advice is to NOT look up the answers, because again, the satisfaction you'll get from solving a level you've worked at for days is worth it. This game has caused more frustration than any game I can remember since the NES era. It's THAT hard. The difficulty spikes something fierce after only a couple levels. However, I can say that very few, if any, games have caused me to feel so satisfied from solving one of the levels. If you like solving puzzles no matter how high the difficulty, look no further than this game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Figuring things out for yourself   Chemistry   Logical puzzles   Getting atoms to do your bidding This game is a great time sink but one that is fulfilling. You will feel as if you are achieving something, which I believe is mostly due to the game's academic feel. You don't need to be a chemist or an engineer to enjoy it but you definitely need a logical mind to tackle puzzles beyond the first couple of levels.One of the first things you'll realise is that the tutorials alone will not fully explain what you have to do. You'll really need to take a step back and review the UI, hover over items to figure out exactly what they do, and actually invest some time in a bit of trial and error to see how things work in practice.You will find yourself spending a lot of time, especially later in the game to solve levels but it won't feel like a waste after you finally crack the problem that's been preventing you from completing the game.Take it slow in the beginning, get your bearings and master those atoms.

												SpaceChem is a fun game. It's essentially a stylized programming language masquerading as a video game. But despite that it's extremely fun to play and also fun to optimize your ""code"".that being said, I find that it isn't designed well for fitting on screens, and since that's how most people play video games, this is a problem. Furthermore, I tried the fullscreen mode and it was way too far zoomed in, so I could only see a small portion of the content. What's worse is that the portion I can see doesn't include the option to leave fullscreen. so now I'm stuck with an unplayable SpaceChem. This is a real shame because I really do enjoy the game.

												The player takes control of an unnamed undergraduate at the University of Chicago, working as a technician for a scientific team that discovers an alternative, low-cost, pollution-free fuel source. When one of the chief scientists is murdered and the invention stolen, The player (voiced by Gary Oldman) and his physicist lab assistant Lily Sinclair (Ivanka trump) are framed for it and have to flee for their lives, with the FBI, CIA and other involved parties in close pursuit. Paul Shannon (Gilbert gottfried), The Player's mentor, is the director of a scientific company which has commercial interests in the invention. The Player and Lily set out to find the stolen invention and hopefully clear themselves of the false charges. My Take: A formulaic action shooter with some impressive set pieces marred by lackluster writing. Regardless, it wasn't the best game nor the worst game ever made.

												Back in 2000, CogniToy, now defunct, released a strange game called Mind Rover: The Europa Project. This game was of a genre I call a programming puzzle game. The object was to build a little car to complete certain tasks. However, the only thing you could do is put sensors and switches on your car and wire them together creating a program. After that, the car would run the course and either succeed or fail based on your program. Others have tried but not succeeded the way Mind Rover did, at least not for me.Fast forward ten years and Indie studio Zachtronics Industries released SpaceChem. While the premise is different, the concept is the same: a programming puzzle game. In this game, you are a SpaceChem engineer whose goal is to program reactors to take input molecules and output other molecules. The goal is to create a reactor program that runs as efficiently as possible: fewest code instructions, fewest cycles and in production puzzles - fewest reactors.The screen is split into a grid 20 by 20 squares. On the left are two inputs (alpha and beta) 10 by 10 each on the right there are two outputs (psi and omega) 4 by 4 each. There are two waldo’s, one red and one blue, that execute your program. During every cycle, the waldo’s move one square along the drawn route and execute the action (some actions, such as rotation, take an extra cycle count), if any, in the square. Each square can have one action and one redirection for each color. Actions that you can do include getting an input from the input feed, clearing the output reactors, rotating a molecule, bonding (or de-bonding) molecules together, sync the waldos’ movement. One other rule - molecules cannot bang into each other. From there, you create the program to complete the task, run the program, tweak the program, and around and around until you are satisfied.Running through the campaign, there are several different modes: Research, Production, and Defense. In the research mode, you have one reactor in which to take the inputs and make the outputs. In production mode, you have a planet view in which there may be many inputs to many outputs. You have the ability to create multiple reactors (level dependant) and pipe them around the planet. In this case, the movement of molecules through the pipes costs one cycle count. The final mode is the last mode for each planet and is a modified production level in which there is a specific goal and sometimes a time limit. After you finish the campaign mode there are some other puzzles that can be completed for added challenge.In all modes except defense, there is a graph that shows the results of your program. This shows how many cycles it took, how many reactors (1 on Research puzzles), and how many symbols used (every redirect or input counts as one). The big kicker is that is shows where you stand versus other players, and here is where the ultimate tweaking and optimization comes in. Slight changes in order of operations, distance waldos need to move, which waldos are waiting during sync instructions all of these can have drastic changes to how fast your program executes.I don’t know what it is about this game, but there are a couple of layers of challenge for me. On the first level, I just want to get a solution. The learning curve is fairly steep and there isn’t a user manual. There are about 10 tutorial missions, and the research usually gives some hint as to things you may need to use in future missions, but the puzzle difficult ramps up fairly quickly. The second is to optimize my solution. Moving things around and changing the order of operations can shave cycles off as well as reducing the number of symbols. The next optimization is to watch the reactor and see if one of the waldos is spending too much idle time. If so, can it be doing another task. This is easier to do in research puzzles as there aren’t restrictions on inputs and outputs. However, in production puzzles the reactors must wait to be fed (which takes time) and output pipes can only hold so much material. These reactors may stall while waiting to complete an instruction and in doing so create a jam. As you progress, you learn little tricks to get things to work more efficiently. These can be used in earlier puzzles to greatly improve times on earlier puzzles.I know that this type of game isn’t for everyone, but I love getting into the game and tinkering and tweaking on puzzle solutions to make it 2 cycles faster (obviously more is better, but any little bit is a victory). If you are a fan of puzzle games or like programming (even better if you like both) then I would suggest giving SpaceChem a try			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first impression that SpaceChem imposes on it's audience is one of boredom. Complex gameplay mechanics, insufficient instructions and a non-illustrated storyline (which looked like it attained quite some inspiration from a generic fanfic) is enough to bore even the most patient gamer. But behind all that, you can leave your fast-paced FPSes behind and take SpaceChem with an open mind, it's actually a rather interesting game once you scrape the surface and get to the inner layers. To be fair, I still don't quite get some of the in-game mechanics, and I'm starting to struggle on the second planet, but that's the purpose of a puzzle game. If a puzzle game is simple, it's not a puzzle game; it's a test to check your sanity. But anyways, this game may seem uninteresting and even dreadful at times, but it's honestly a well-thought out puzzle game that simply doesn't have enough shine on its surface to keep players on the game for more than 10 minutes. If you can dig past that dull surface and get into the heart of the game where the creative thinking comes alive, this game is certainly worth the time and effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sounds simple, but some of the stuff you have to do is very puzzling and this game gets advanced, QUICK.As well as adding elements to each other to make new ones, you also have to defend space labs and set up a network of pipes to little mini factories to merge many many elements together.8/10, like Tetris with guns.

Brain-breakingly difficult at certain points, but it has an incredibly well-organized learning curve; every challenge is one step ahead of the player. The game pushes you to become skilled at molecular bonding with a real sense of urgency in its missions.

												Challenging puzzler, requires thinking in specific ways.SpaceChem starts you off very simple to ease you in to the basic way of things, but then quickly ramps things up. That learning curve may leave a lot of folks out in the cold, as I've found you need to learn specific techniques to complete the middle to later levels, and if you don't happen to think them up (or perhaps look them up) you might be left frustrated.If you enjoy puzzlers and difficulty I heartily recommend SpaceChem. Do come at it knowing that you may get stuck, but once you figure things out (or get a little help, perhaps) the satisfaction of beating a tough puzzle is well worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great indie puzzle game, and without much parallel from what I've seen.There were great puzzles in the actual game, and much more in the researchnet when you've finished the game. There isn't much actual chemistry in the game; it's used more as a basis for the puzzles. The storyline was good, the visuals were fine. The reason why this game stands out is the open-endedness of the puzzles; finding your own solution and improving upon it is the main thrill of this game, and the euphoria of completing a puzzle or optimizing your design to the most efficient possible is where this game gets its fun. There bell curves (usually) in the missions, which tell you how well your solution is compared to others.I've been told that this game is quite similar to programming, which may drive you away or towards this game. I find it more about making a machine and watching it work as it executes commands the way you programmed it.On the other side, I'd say that the graphics in the reactors themselves are rather bland, but I can excuse that as it would become too complex if it weren't bland. I'd prefer if the game had told me what you can do and what you can't do with the molecules (can't collide), and there are some hidden tricks which are not mentioned at all (bonder priority, especially, though particle smashing to a lesser extent as well). The music also may get a bit repetitive (I personally can't get tired of it though).Other than that, this game is quite an amazing puzzle game. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an intellectual challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A most interesting puzzle game, SpaceChem uses the concept of atomic waldoes to turn inorganic chemistry into an interesting series of puzzles. The ability to ""do over"" when a reaction fails to work as anticipated is most welcome. This iteration also includes a back story, not necessary to the game but definitely interesting, offered as skippable text blocks between puzzles; and there is a free demo, to give you the flavour of the game if you're a little low on cash.

												I got this game when it was being offered for free, and I must say, it is easily the most challenging puzzle game I own. Zachtronics, the creators of Ironclad Tactics, also made this game, and you can count on them to consistently deliver unique, fun, and challenging games.If you enjoy challenging puzzles - in particular, circuit-based ones, space themes, progressively challening levels (this is basically the Demon/Dark Souls of puzzlers), and pondering on what the solution is for hours (or even days) at a time, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are decent - you will mostly be looking at a grid with blue and red circuits, however, the detail put into the land, structures, and ""others"" (usually the end of every planet) is well-done. The music is very good. There is quite a bit of lore that provides the story if you are interested - it's also well-written.The controls are simple, as you can do everything with only the mouse. There is an option for using keyboard hotkeys, and I personally found it easier (and much faster) to use the hotkeys. The learning curve is moderate to extremely difficult - mostly depending on your understanding of circuitry (chemistry is actually not that important in the game, as you will be given instructions). The game does a very good job of presenting you with progressively more and more difficult scenarios, adding new mechanics at every planet. The tutorial is absolutely essential and will help you understand the basics of the game.Be advised, the game implements very strong scaffolding, so if you do not understand the mechanics in the earlier levels and resort to guides/walkthroughs, you will have an extremely difficult time completing the levels on your own. I recommend you take a look at some video walkthroughs only if you've been stuck for a long while, as there may also be a new mechanic you have not thought of yet. Admittedly, I had been stuck on a puzzle for over a week, so I finally gave in and looked for a solution online - I was then able to complete the next few puzzles with knowledge gathered from the stage I was stuck on (I had not fully understood the new mechanic that was introduced).The circuit puzzles all consist of constructing an element/compound with your two starting circuits (blue and red), and dropping them into the output section of the grid. There are many restrictions and a large variety of different ways to solve each level.Later, you will need to take care of production, so you will not only be mapping out circuits (red and blue), but you will also be building reactors - and attaching them to things with pipes. Even more later on, you will be presented with ""defense"" levels, where you must power weapons to fend off enemies. Overall, if you are looking for an extremely good challenge and like circuitry, give this game a try. It will tease your brain quite a bit, and you may or may not love it. If you are intimidated by circuitry-based puzzles (and a minimal amount of chemistry), you may want to pass on this one. Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am playing SpaceChem and I have got to say, I most definitely recommend it. I will admit I am not very far in to the game, I also have to say that SpaceChem is really as boring as dirt, I doubt it will keep my attention long, and I am easily entertained! So why then you ask am I so willing to recommend it? Pure and simply because of its difficulty of course! Not often will you find a puzzle game that is so ""simple"" yet so hard, I think alot of it comes from them giving you so many different ways to complete each puzzle. You dont actually have to know chemistry to play this game. I think this is because the game is more pseudo chemistry really, so dont be afraid to try it.Overall I have got to say, SpaceChem is a ""Simple Hard"" puzzle game, that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of puzzle games. It really does take a special kind of person to enjoy this game, and not get bored almost immediately though. So be warned, if your not good at, or not interested in puzzle games, this is a game you may want to stay away from. To everyone else though, go take a look, you may be surprised.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like complex problem solving puzzles then this is the game for you.  The only real drawback is the lack of an adequate tutorial on how everything works.  The game only gives you very basic information and it was a bit frustrating, to me, figuring out how some things work.  You can find tips online however to help.That said once you get the hang of things you can literally spend hours, if not days, working on a single puzzle.  Then you can work on the puzzle some more, if you choose, to optimize it to use less symbols or time.I recommend the game because I like complex puzzles but if you are looking for something quick and easy ... keep looking.

Therefore, I don't recommend the game to the impatient or casual gamer. I do recommend the game to puzzle enthusiasts and programmers.  Two more things:  1) you do not need a background in chemistry to play this and 2) download the demo if you're interested to see if this game is your cup of tea.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't like puzzle games in general because they're either too easy, or are pure pixel hunt, or involve ""guessing what the developer wants you to do."" But this game is different. This game feels like real world design challenges. This game feels like a combination of programming, proving geometric statements and (just a little bit, despite of its name) chemistry. This game's logic works like this: you have two loops running at the same time, each can carry out certain commands in their courses; your task is to time those commands so that they do the right thing at the right time, and in the end find a way to synchronize the two loops so that they can loop back to their oriignal starting point and the whole process resets. You have limited space to place your commands so you have to really think hard where you place them (like the steric hinderance effect in real world chemistry synthesis). Overall, a really, really fun, thought-provoking game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It turned out the game is really fun! I love science, so this is cool, because it has ""science"" aspects.The endless possibilities of completing a level adds replay value, and the story line is comical and funny.

												The player takes control of an unnamed undergraduate at the University of Chicago, working as a technician for a scientific team that discovers an alternative, low-cost, pollution-free fuel source. When one of the chief scientists is murdered and the invention stolen, The player (voiced by Gary Oldman) and his physicist lab assistant Lily Sinclair (Ivanka trump) are framed for it and have to flee for their lives, with the FBI, CIA and other involved parties in close pursuit. Paul Shannon (Gilbert gottfried), The Player's mentor, is the director of a scientific company which has commercial interests in the invention. The Player and Lily set out to find the stolen invention and hopefully clear themselves of the false charges. My Take: A formulaic action shooter with some impressive set pieces marred by lackluster writing. Regardless, it wasn't the best game nor the worst game ever made. If you're looking for a fast paced game that you don't have to think too much on, this is it.  8/10			",346,41,3,30,32,1,52

												10/10This game has it all - brilliant design, fantasy science (more like space alchemy), a science fiction episodic story and absolutely brutal difficulty. If you love puzzles, you're in for a treat. Some of the later levels will set your brain on fire, easily taking an hour each (my total playing time is inaccurate).There are also many, many possible solutions to every problem, so you can really work things your own way. If you complete a difficult mission and check out other solutions on youtube, you might find there was a way to solve it 5x more efficiently, and it will blow you away. Note that the mechanics rely on loops, so you're essentially programming an assembly line.Last but not least, the music is great, which is good because you'll be listening to it a lot.

												This game will break your brain. And you will have fun reassembling it afterwards.It's one of the few puzzle games where there is actually no predefined solution. Each problem holds a plethora of possible solutions only really limited by your imagination and time. Get the demo (which represents a good 1/4th of the game) and give it a try.Don't expect to finish this game legitimately unless you have a finely honed analytical mind and/or experience in programming. I know i won't. There's a reason that 'Finishing the game' is considered one of the harder achievements.This doesn't keep me from feeling this is some of the best 15 dollars i've ever spent.

												Ho boy.SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games that are beyond difficult. You really have to put your gray cells to the test here. I only completed it as fast as I did because I consulted guides on how to solve the different assignments, else it would have gotten rather tough early on already.The main objective in SpaceChem is lining up two production circles, one red, one blue, to grab whatever is put into the reactor, to then output something different, be it a broken down product, something fused together, or something simply taken apart and put back together. The way SpaceChem wraps it into a Lovecraftian space adventure provides an interesting story, if sometimes a bit predictable. But nevertheless, it is a game that has replay value, because there is no fixed way of solving the problem presented. There are fast ways, there are efficient ways, there are fast efficient ways, and then you can do it as complicated as you like - SpaceChem provides a variety of solutions even for the simpler puzzles.And when I say simpler, I mean puzzles involving a molecule consisting of two, maybe three kinds of atoms, and the product requiring the same atoms in different configuration. Later on, when more options are available, your synapses will be frying from trying to figure out how the Hell to tackle the problem at hand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think the beauty of this game is that there is never any ""one solution"" like a lot of puzzle games end up falling onto. You're free to create whatever solution you can think of to solve each puzzle... within the confines of a rather restricted space. And it may not look too restricted at first but in the later worlds, whoo, does space management become a big aspect. I understand the need for it though, having no space restraint would make a lot of puzzles really simple in comparison to what they are now, though.The difficulty curve of the game is pretty dang smooth, ranging from simple in world 1 to ""literally hours for every single puzzle"" in worlds 6 through 9. But no challenge ever feels insurmountable when you face it, just intimidating. It's very clearly a programming-styled puzzle game, and it hits all the right nerves with that; designing the best functions to keep the overall design running smoothly, optimizing ever so slightly to hit a time quota, finding new and more efficient ways to solve a problem that subsequently frees up reactor space you desperately needed. I'm one to dive right in to the puzzles and keep tweaking away at them until I hit upon something that functions the way I need to, and then stubbornly stick to whatever functions unless I can't possibly work around it, and, generally, the game doesn't stop me from using this philosophy successfully. There's probably something to be said for planning out something elegant in advance, too, and I bet there are some really cool puzzle designs made that way. It's a game that feels very free, even in its restrictiveness.The game's visuals are basic but effective, they get the job done. The music is... I honestly have no clue, there's too little of it for how long the game runs on and I had to turn it off and put on my own music after a while. The story is passable, but with how long I went between each time I played this game I found it hard to keep track of.That is one thing... this game is incredibly exhausting to play. I'll hammer away at the solution for one puzzle for a few hours and then when I've solved it I'm completely drained and end up not coming back to the game for weeks or even months. Before today the last time I played this game was at the start of June, for instance, and I've been picking away at the levels since... around last october, I believe, at least during this attempt at getting through the game, which for the record was like my third time overall, I think. So yeah.I can definitely see this game not being for everyone but it's certainly a good experience if you're programmatically-minded, though definitely a challenging one, easily one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

												I am playing SpaceChem and I have got to say, I most definitely recommend it. I will admit I am not very far in to the game, I also have to say that SpaceChem is really as boring as dirt, I doubt it will keep my attention long, and I am easily entertained! So why then you ask am I so willing to recommend it? Pure and simply because of its difficulty of course! Not often will you find a puzzle game that is so ""simple"" yet so hard, I think alot of it comes from them giving you so many different ways to complete each puzzle. You dont actually have to know chemistry to play this game. I think this is because the game is more pseudo chemistry really, so dont be afraid to try it.Overall I have got to say, SpaceChem is a ""Simple Hard"" puzzle game, that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of puzzle games. It really does take a special kind of person to enjoy this game, and not get bored almost immediately though. So be warned, if your not good at, or not interested in puzzle games, this is a game you may want to stay away from. To everyone else though, go take a look, you may be surprised.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down the best puzzle game I have ever played. It has a No True Path To Victory design philosophy I find really appealing. The field is wide open for solutions, making them feel very personal. You use the provided tools to create and break down different chemicals at the atomic level. Your solution's efficiency is graphed against the other players who have completed the puzzle, which is a fun incentive to go back and optimize your solutions. Finally the game will record your solution and upload it to your Youtube account, through a very simple in-game process. Not a necessary feature but a very cool one. With a level editor on the way, and other gameplay expansions this game is absolutely worth the price.			",961,223,15,134,84,5,161

												This game is one of the best i have ever played. Unfortunately i cannot play it any more, my mind spins with possible solutions for hours afterwards, keeping me from sleep. It is at heart a programming game, but disguised into chemistry machine building.  In fact you are building a network of mutlithreaded realtime processors. The programming aspect makes this into a ""sandbox"" pussle; you must fulfill the objectives, but there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. Afterwards you get a comparison with others that have played the level, and get to se how well you did versus them. The interesting part of that comparison is that it rates you on both processsing time and design simplicity, and in general you cannot do well in both. This will either leave you with a feeling of that you chose the right optimization or (as in my case) trigger competitive insanity. All in all: difficult and timeconsuming; requires concentration and effort. You might also learn something.			",36,4,1,7,18,0,7

												A remarkebly clever problem solving game which challenges your engineering ability rather than your skills in puzzles. There's no set solutions, just a job you can get done any way you want. So everyone's solution will be slightly different. Whether it be faster, smaller, etc.This is easily my favorite problem solving game ever, despite how some levels are psychotically hard. In fact, as a puzzle game alone, I'd dare say it's more interesting and rich than Portal.			",408,43,47,21,45,3,40

												This game is one of the best i have ever played. Unfortunately i cannot play it any more, my mind spins with possible solutions for hours afterwards, keeping me from sleep. It is at heart a programming game, but disguised into chemistry machine building.  In fact you are building a network of mutlithreaded realtime processors. The programming aspect makes this into a ""sandbox"" pussle; you must fulfill the objectives, but there are an infinite amount of ways to do so. Afterwards you get a comparison with others that have played the level, and get to se how well you did versus them. The interesting part of that comparison is that it rates you on both processsing time and design simplicity, and in general you cannot do well in both. This will either leave you with a feeling of that you chose the right optimization or (as in my case) trigger competitive insanity. All in all: difficult and timeconsuming; requires concentration and effort. You might also learn something.			",36,4,1,7,18,0,7

Nevertheless the concept is great and as it gets gradually more difficult and there are often new things to discover it can keep you busy for quite a long time.			",216,33,17,26,50,6,46

												Ho boy.SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games that are beyond difficult. You really have to put your gray cells to the test here. I only completed it as fast as I did because I consulted guides on how to solve the different assignments, else it would have gotten rather tough early on already.The main objective in SpaceChem is lining up two production circles, one red, one blue, to grab whatever is put into the reactor, to then output something different, be it a broken down product, something fused together, or something simply taken apart and put back together. The way SpaceChem wraps it into a Lovecraftian space adventure provides an interesting story, if sometimes a bit predictable. But nevertheless, it is a game that has replay value, because there is no fixed way of solving the problem presented. There are fast ways, there are efficient ways, there are fast efficient ways, and then you can do it as complicated as you like - SpaceChem provides a variety of solutions even for the simpler puzzles.And when I say simpler, I mean puzzles involving a molecule consisting of two, maybe three kinds of atoms, and the product requiring the same atoms in different configuration. Later on, when more options are available, your synapses will be frying from trying to figure out how the Hell to tackle the problem at hand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think the beauty of this game is that there is never any ""one solution"" like a lot of puzzle games end up falling onto. You're free to create whatever solution you can think of to solve each puzzle... within the confines of a rather restricted space. And it may not look too restricted at first but in the later worlds, whoo, does space management become a big aspect. I understand the need for it though, having no space restraint would make a lot of puzzles really simple in comparison to what they are now, though.The difficulty curve of the game is pretty dang smooth, ranging from simple in world 1 to ""literally hours for every single puzzle"" in worlds 6 through 9. But no challenge ever feels insurmountable when you face it, just intimidating. It's very clearly a programming-styled puzzle game, and it hits all the right nerves with that; designing the best functions to keep the overall design running smoothly, optimizing ever so slightly to hit a time quota, finding new and more efficient ways to solve a problem that subsequently frees up reactor space you desperately needed. I'm one to dive right in to the puzzles and keep tweaking away at them until I hit upon something that functions the way I need to, and then stubbornly stick to whatever functions unless I can't possibly work around it, and, generally, the game doesn't stop me from using this philosophy successfully. There's probably something to be said for planning out something elegant in advance, too, and I bet there are some really cool puzzle designs made that way. It's a game that feels very free, even in its restrictiveness.The game's visuals are basic but effective, they get the job done. The music is... I honestly have no clue, there's too little of it for how long the game runs on and I had to turn it off and put on my own music after a while. The story is passable, but with how long I went between each time I played this game I found it hard to keep track of.That is one thing... this game is incredibly exhausting to play. I'll hammer away at the solution for one puzzle for a few hours and then when I've solved it I'm completely drained and end up not coming back to the game for weeks or even months. Before today the last time I played this game was at the start of June, for instance, and I've been picking away at the levels since... around last october, I believe, at least during this attempt at getting through the game, which for the record was like my third time overall, I think. So yeah.I can definitely see this game not being for everyone but it's certainly a good experience if you're programmatically-minded, though definitely a challenging one, easily one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

												I don't recall enjoying a puzzle game so much ever since I played the Microsoft version of Chips Challenge back in 1994 in Windows 3.1 on some Compaq Presario (486!). Robin Walker is indeed speaking the truth!Caution though, it's indeed a tricky game and some people might find it very frustrating. I even seen it referenced as a game for engineers before. If you have the patience and like solving logical problems, this is a must buy.			",417,83,10,50,73,2,93

												Best. Puzzle. Game. Ever.No hyperbole here, a simple and undeniable statement. What sets it apart from other games in the genre is that the puzzles are both challenging and openended, hell keeping track of the pipeline you've just built is a challenge in itself.

Product received for free
												This game is only for ""Puzzle-masters"". It's just insanely difficult (if you don't use guides ofc, but I'm glad I didn't). I stopped at the end on the fourth planet, because I kinda had enough of it. I'll switch to something more relaxing, cause this game trains mind better then math, and then I'll return. I don't wanna talk about the game, but the only thing I'll mention is that you can use your own music while playing which was really important to me. Original sountrack isn't bad, but your choice of music will make things easier. I didn't follow storyline, so I cannot judge it.Anyway, all puzzlers, I should say need to check SpaceChem out! Its real price is 10$ and I think you better wait for a special offer, but paying 10$ for this is not a waste of money, I repeat, if you enjoy puzzle games!FINAL ESTIMATE: 9.5/10 ",36,7,3,0,2,1,2

On each square of the track, you can put a simple instruction.When you are ready the ""Valdo"" will follow the track, executing instructions on the way.If all goes well, it will build a ""molecule"". Each puzzle gives you a set of molecules to construct.There's no ""You must do it that way !"", only the end result matters.If you like watching automatised production lines, you will like that game.I like watching automatised production lines.

												This game has little to do with chemistry. It's an automata programming game.I remembered the first time I see such a game when I was in high school. It's called  Manutactoria [jayisgames.com]. You are literally programming Turing Machines there. And I think SpaceChem is quite similar: the semantics of and the interactions between the elements are simple, but with these simple elements, you can do infinitely complex jobs.It's hard, but not all that hard. I completed all the puzzles in the story line except for the optional ones and the final boss fight in a little more than 20 hours. You do need to focus on the most specific things like the placement of the bounders and routing the two waldos through the array of symbols, and some times these problems are solved with ugly ad-hoc tricks, but you definitely should go beyond that level. Once you discovered how to do a recurring task like moving around a cross-shaped array of bounders to assemble or disassemble a methane molecule or arranging several flip-flops to perform a sequence of commands a desired amount of times, the puzzles starts to get easier. You quickly figure out similar structures in the input and output and decide what should go where. Then you adjust your known structures to solve each step and the job is done.Every time when you see in the statistics that your dashed yellow line is way to the left of the peak of the bar chart, you feel clever.Those at the right end of the chart are not stupid either. Everyone who progressed to the later part of the game must be clever.But some people are just more clever than others. The research net is the difficult part. It is organized into volumes and issues, just like real scientific journals. Amusing. But the puzzles there are seriously difficult. Most of the time you stare at the puzzles and think, ""How is that even possible? The author must be insane!""When you finally solved a difficult problem and see your efficient and elegant (or not so mush so) production pipeline running, see those materials flowing in and products flowing out after some arcane transformation, you start getting fascinated, even though you are the one who built those things. Sometimes I am amazed at how good us humans are at discovering patterns and constructing increasingly complex structures from simpler ones. Maybe that is central to our intelligence.

Bah - simplicity and efficiency are for weenies (and chemical engineers, like the guy who designed this game)! Rarely has a game made me feel so satisfied with myself for completeinh one of its challenges. If you like to create and invent, you will love this game. Just don't pay any attention to the graphs of how simple and efficient everyone else's solutions are compare to yours. And if you find yourself besting everyone else in these categories, I'd venture to say you either need to become an engineer or already are one. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. :D			",935,268,52,171,148,8,265

												Spacechem... Oh, Spacechem.. Where to start!?Tax your grey matter to it's limit!Do you hear the words ""Puzzle game"" and get a general feeling of dis-interest? Do you think about chemistry and then immediately stop thinking about chemistry? Fear not! Spacechem is one of THE MOST unique puzzle experiences you will EVER have! Don't be afraid of it's chemistry topic, either - For while the compounds you'll be breaking down and assembling are real, with appropriate atomic bonds, you don't need to understand a lick of chemistry to play.The puzzles involve you designing the interior of atomic reactors, using robotic manipulators called ""Waldos"" that move on paths you specify and obey commands you place on those paths to grab, rotate, bond & de-bond atoms and a host of other actions to transform raw input compounds - one molecule at a time - into the matter you need.The game is free of bugs and has high production values. There are enough levels to keep you working for a LONG time, split into different chapters taking place on different planets with the beginning of each chapter introducing a new reactor [game] mechanic. The levels get devilishly difficult and due to it's nature, there are almost infinite ways to solve any puzzle. As long as you output the correct compunds to the waiting shipping barge, exactly the steps you take to create that compound are entirely up to you!This game will tax your problem-solving, logic and lateral-thinking. Highly recommended for those with an above-average IQ and highly recommended for anyone who wants to sink their teeth into a real mental challenge.			",53,5,2,1,13,0,15

You will probably finish the first couple of levels in a few minutes each but as new concepts are introduced it get's increasingly complex and you'll really have to strain your brain and spend hours on a single level.If you're stuck, try your hands on some user generated levels.

But you need no knowledge about algorithms, mathematics or programming, its fairly simple and some trial and error is (at least for me) mostly more useful than thinking ahead too much ;)The learning curve is quite nice, and the replayability is great due to online leaderboards for the fastest or most efficient algorithms. And you can download unlimited user created puzzles.Ive bought this game for PC and on my iPad, and can recommend it for anyone who loves puzzles, or algorithms.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are into engineering/math/programming or simply into complex puzzles then SpaceChem is for you. The campaign provides a nice difficulty curve. You will probably finish the first couple of levels in a few minutes each but as new concepts are introduced it get's increasingly complex and you'll really have to strain your brain and spend hours on a single level.If you're stuck, try your hands on some user generated levels. SpaceChem has A LOT of content, easily hundreds of hours.			",1282,492,53,167,177,21,203

												Spacechem... Oh, Spacechem.. Where to start!?Tax your grey matter to it's limit!Do you hear the words ""Puzzle game"" and get a general feeling of dis-interest? Do you think about chemistry and then immediately stop thinking about chemistry? Fear not! Spacechem is one of THE MOST unique puzzle experiences you will EVER have! Don't be afraid of it's chemistry topic, either - For while the compounds you'll be breaking down and assembling are real, with appropriate atomic bonds, you don't need to understand a lick of chemistry to play.The puzzles involve you designing the interior of atomic reactors, using robotic manipulators called ""Waldos"" that move on paths you specify and obey commands you place on those paths to grab, rotate, bond & de-bond atoms and a host of other actions to transform raw input compounds - one molecule at a time - into the matter you need.The game is free of bugs and has high production values. There are enough levels to keep you working for a LONG time, split into different chapters taking place on different planets with the beginning of each chapter introducing a new reactor [game] mechanic. The levels get devilishly difficult and due to it's nature, there are almost infinite ways to solve any puzzle. As long as you output the correct compunds to the waiting shipping barge, exactly the steps you take to create that compound are entirely up to you!This game will tax your problem-solving, logic and lateral-thinking. Highly recommended for those with an above-average IQ and highly recommended for anyone who wants to sink their teeth into a real mental challenge.			",53,5,2,1,13,0,15

There's a good amount of replayability in it if you're the kind of person who likes to beat their own score and get it to the cycles and symbols as low as possible.Worth a shot if you're a fan of puzzles and chemistry anyway!

												Different people have different tastes, and although SpaceChem is extremely popular, I find it extremely confusing, extremely difficult and extremely, urm, weird. OK, forget the weird part, it's actually weird in a good sense. As Mortlach said in his review (check below, may still be there), you need to have a different taste in games to enjoy this. It is complicated and complex, plus, I find the format a little hard to read. Some enjoy it, but some don't. I don't. From the time it took me to try and, er, uh... fail one level, I assume that it must take a whopping amount of time to complete the entire game compared to other puzzle games. Still, as I said, it's not the game for me, but it may be the game for you. BE VERY SURE IF YOU WANT TO GET IT BEFORE GETTING IT. BE VERY, VERY SURE. $9.99 is quite a large amount to spend on a game you may, in the end, realize you do not like. Read reviews, watch YouTube videos and stuff. Is this the game for you? Maybe. Maybe not. Good luck deciding.			",19,3,3,7,2,1,1

												This is not a puzzle game. Puzzles have a single solution that you must ferret out. This game presents problems that need to be solved with creativity and ingenuity. It's basically a visual programming game. It's for those who want a mental challenge and it provides that in spades. After you finish each challenge you're given histograms (histograms! Why don't more games have these? They're so much better at providing performance data than useless leaderboards) of how efficient your solution was compared to other players in how fast it is, how many reactors it uses and how many commands it uses. It's wonderful. Long live the histogram.			",358,134,4,27,21,4,54

												This game is a marvel. Zachtronics Industries proved that their sandbox games deserve a bigger scope. Spacechem offers dozens of puzzles in a story-driven campaign, where you need to design and optimize atomic assembly lines. Usually, you just need to produce given compounds, but the real fun begins when you need to manage the reactions in real time to defend yourself against exotic space monsters.For serious players, the game offers achievements, an optimization race in leaderboard statistics, and hundreds of player-created puzzles in the Journal of Reaction Engineering.While the main game environment looks very technical, you will become absorbed in building, optimizing and debugging your reactions to achieve results that initially seemed impossible. The austere environment of reactor grids is accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn visuals of various planets and cosmic monsters. The music is original, fitting, I would even say motivational, yet another high-quality element of the whole impressive piece.So, if you are actually reading this review, I cannot recommend Spacechem enough. Go buy it and make some chems!			",16,24,0,1,8,0,3

												Avoid if you're on OS X! You must install additional software, “Mono” and a fan-made(!) patcher .app, to run this game now because of ""changes introduced to Mac OS X in version 10.11"" (which came out over a year ago).Trying to start this game just opens a webpage on the Zachtronics site which gives a link to download Mono (the download for which is more than twice the size the game itself) and a link to a (fan-made) github page that contains the patcher .app and the instructions. All of this requires far more time and effort than I wanted to put into trying to start a game. (I wasn’t going to bother, but Steam doesn’t allow reviews unless you’ve ran the game for at least five minutes.)I was very interested in other games by this developer, but not when they don't properly support their products. This has been a frustrating experience.Edit: I just noticed that the OS X version is on longer available on Steam. Good. But I'm still not going to risk buying any of their other games.

Product received for free
												So uh.... I played the game back in 2014, (yes I'm writing a review after stopping for 3 years) and during that time I was in this phase where I really like Chemistry, Physics and Biology.Long story short, I downloaded this game and was really into it. It helped me a bit with the elements when I was still starting Chemistry in my school. It was fun making mechanisms and such it made me feel like an engineer (I can dream can't I?).Then I lost my interest when it got to the part where I had to fill up 3 domes and detonate it at a certain time when a bulldozer was about to rampage through a city. I didn't know how to detonate it (it was simply filling up the dome and detonating it through a button press) and so I managed to get past that level and I stopped since.So uh, yeah try the game. It's fun for the first few levels, after that it gets challenging and you'll probably just jump ship onto another game. Good luck.			",66,6,1,0,3,1,2

If you find certain puzzle games to be too easy or tedious, I'm betting you'll enjoy this fresh breath of air.However, I cannot currently recommend as the windowed mode is broken with a two-monitor setup. If the dev is able to reach out, I'd be happy to help them fix this bug, which currently makes it impossible for me to play the game.			",49,12,0,2,10,1,10

												If you into engineering or programming, this is the game for you! Very addicting gameplay and puzzles for the tech savvy; pretty educational as well as it deals with inputs, outputs, and multi-threading.My only gripe is that the puzzles get a little too difficult- even halfway though the story. This is definitely not a game for those not interested in mental puzzles.All in all I definitely recommend this game to those who have an interest\studying computer science or electrical engineering!

												I've mainly played this game on the iPad, but I wanted to express my love for this title here as well.  It is a well crafted puzzle game that encourages creativity in its solutions.In this game, there is a grid.  On this grid, you will place molecules, you will move molecules, and you will export specific, predetermined molecules.  The catch is, you have to do so by constructing a machine in advance, and then let it solve the problem for you.  Making such a machine is not easy, and it is rare that it will work as expected the first time.  The ""machine"" as I described it is composed of two tracks, with instructions along them.  A disc, which the game calls a WALDO, travels along each track, following the instructions as it comes across them.  The instructions include making an input molecule appear, making an output molecule disappear, grabbing/dropping a molecule, and bonding two molecules together.There are many ways to beat each level.  Some are more efficient than others.  The great thing about this is that it encourages you to replay old levels to try to find the most optimized way of beating them.  You get to compare the efficiency of your solutions to the solutions of others.  This is probably the hardest puzzle game I've ever played (I still haven't beaten it, even on the iPad), but it is definitely the most satisfying.  There's a real joy when your contraption finally comes together and works as planned.  And the challenge is such that it ultimately feels fair.  There's always a ""best"" way to do it, but whatever you can come up with, so long as it gets the job done, is acceptable.If you want a challenging, well made game that encourages creative solutions to puzzles, then look no further than this game.

												I've noticed that some of the reviewers have mentioned that this game is similar to programming and that you won't find it as fun if you're not a programmer. I dove into this game with no experience in programming and had an absolute blast with it. But then again, I ended up learning how to program eventually but that's not the point. You don't need any sort of background knowledge from programming or chemistry to enjoy this game but be aware that the puzzles can become mindblowingly convoluted yet incredibly satisfying when you manage to create a solution that works beautifully.I've started playing this game around three or so years ago and haven't finished the main storyline yet but I consider the ten bucks I've spent on this game so worth it for the time I've gotten out of it.Get the game, but be prepared for one hell of a challenge!

												Time to do some chemistry!SpaceChem is a great puzzle-ish game with a gripping storyline. But it's not for the faint-hearted. The first few worlds are absolutely great, fun, and entertaining. After that, things get a lot more difficult. But not difficult in a bad way! It's the kind of challenge that you'll spend a while working on and then jubliantly celebrate your victory, fist-pumping, smiling, doing powerslides... whatever your ""thing"" is! My point being, this game is really quite rewarding, and you'll feel great when you finally crack whatever problem is troubling you (quite literally in the case of some molecules).On top of all this, there's an absolutely amazing soundtrack, making this game a great experience for all.

												This is a great puzzle game, especially considering the freedom given to each player in finding a solution to each problem. Humorously, no prior knowledge of chemistry is required to enjoy or solve this game, but a grasp of logic and computer programming would definitely help. Also, the boss battles are hilarious and surreal.			",33,7,0,9,12,0,13

Product received for free
												So uh.... I played the game back in 2014, (yes I'm writing a review after stopping for 3 years) and during that time I was in this phase where I really like Chemistry, Physics and Biology.Long story short, I downloaded this game and was really into it. It helped me a bit with the elements when I was still starting Chemistry in my school. It was fun making mechanisms and such it made me feel like an engineer (I can dream can't I?).Then I lost my interest when it got to the part where I had to fill up 3 domes and detonate it at a certain time when a bulldozer was about to rampage through a city. I didn't know how to detonate it (it was simply filling up the dome and detonating it through a button press) and so I managed to get past that level and I stopped since.So uh, yeah try the game. It's fun for the first few levels, after that it gets challenging and you'll probably just jump ship onto another game. Good luck.			",66,6,1,0,3,1,2

												Spacechem is a indie chemistry based puzzle game with a high amount of depth.Even beating one level requires a lot of thinking, hard to solve but very satisfying afterwards.Price is a bit too much for this kind of game 10$, and there's no demo available so most people who get into this game won't know what to expect and might abandon due to high learning curve.

Have you ever met a problem you just can't resist shooting? What if you don't have a gun?Look no further than SpaceChem for your next puzzler. I promise you that this game has stumped and infuriated me more than any other puzzle game I've played; And I've played my fair share.You hard-core '90s gamers may call me a whimp but give it a shot and see how far you can get.SpaceChem has an awesome campaign with a pretty good story to match.  In addition to the campaign, you can also create your own puzzles and play those created by others. All-in-all it makes for many hours of puzzler goodness. Certainly a must-play!

												The hardest puzzle game I've played in recent memory. There are loads of puzzles to do so there's no shortage of content. However it's more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch.I recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions. A nice feature included is a built-in youtube recorder and uploader to show off your own solutions too so they are easy to find.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Soo worth it can get you to think alot, teaches you about chemistry if you dont know any already and doesn't tell you how to do everything it lets you explore and find solutions i would reccomend this game to everyone.			",215,15,3,13,15,3,22

												This game is pure genius. When it comes to puzzle games I have never played anything so complex. Basically its like visual programming meets chemistry in a super clever puzzle game with its own set of rules which you must complete a task in. I want everyone in the world to play this game but I can't recommend it to anyone, because its so hard and abstract only a certain type of person will like this game. If you are a programmer this game will probably appeal to you. It takes weeks sometimes to complete a puzzle later on and its extremely rewarding when it finally works.			",180,9,20,6,13,0,15

												This is an engineer's puzzle game!!  Picture having a virtual factory with simple ""pipes"" and controls that push atoms and molecules around - you have to take the inputs, add/remove bonds, and build the new molecule before sending it to the output area and dropping it in the tank.  You have to worry about timing, collisions, synchronizations and more. ADDICTIVE!!			",80,6,1,3,15,1,28

												SpaceChem is a puzzler that places the player in the role of a scientist or engineer that must configure molecule assemble line. The game challenges the player to come up with the most elegant solution (using the least amount of resources). Being an IT engineer, when I first watched the tutorial video, admittedly I thought in my head ""oh great, this is going to be like my job"" and while the gameplay does remind me a little bit like writing code, it was actually surprisingly fun. The game's overall presentation is nice, somewhat simple but it's tastefully done. The music is good, although at times it made feel like I'm watching a movie from the 90s. The pacing of the game is well done; the player is sanely and graciously introduced to game elements. The game's design allows for any number of solutions and after solving a problem the player is presented with a bell curve as to how they compared to ""other engineers"" (ie players). I really appreciated this aspect as it let me know that a more efficent and elegant solution is possible. My only complaint with the game is that it actually did feel a bit like my job (but in a good way). The feeling of satisfation I got from completing a puzzle was similiar to the satisfaction I get when writing a piece of code I'm proud of at work. It's a good feeling but by the end of the day I'm usually more keen on relaxation instead of solving complex problems.Overall this game is nicely designed and definitely worth consideration. This game engages the mind and respects the player with interesting and challenging puzzles. The world needs more games like this.Score: 8.5/10 ",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												SpaceChem is one of those puzzle games where every level has an almost infinite number of solutions and where each and every one of your reactors is your very own beautiful unique snowflake (or a horribly clumsy and inefficient one, as the case may be).

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, with remarks.This is a great puzzleing game but, stay away of it if you don't want to loose lots of hours or even days trying to find out a solution. You've been warned!.The game starts with easy to understand tutorials and easy puzzles and then, difficulty increases puzzle after puzzle up to the hell.The overall goal for each puzzle is to get some atoms or molecules and transform them, to send the results to some storage  later.To transform particles, you use reactors. Each reactor can have up to two input and two ouput spots. You chain reactors and storages through pipes. You can chain reactors to produce the final product with the help of intermediate products.Reactors have some kind of program, with some special instructions: wait for input, grab, drop, rotate, bind, unbind, sync, branch if certain atom is being detected, flush the output area, etc. You will have to ""program"" a sequence of instructions to solve the puzzle and, just with the instructions and tools available for each puzzle.Graphics are good and attractive enough for this particular kind of game. The User's Interface is clear, easy to learn and, easy to use, very straight forward. You can do everything with just the mouse or, you can use keyboard shortcuts if you like it.The game was very well programmed, has no glitches, works smoothly and, seems to be very well optimized.This game is one on its kind. The idea is very original and, even that game mechanics sound so easy that can end boring you, the real thing is that puzzles are so challenging that you don't have such a feeling.But, be aware, if you don't like games that challenge your mind, don't buy this one; after a few of short easy puzzles you will face really challenging ones.I could say this is a casual game but, believe it, once you start a challenging puzzle, you will loose hours or days trying to figure out a solution. It's highly addictive.You can learn from solutions already designed by other people, by watching some youtube video (and, yes, you will do that), To beat the rest of community of players, you should solve the puzzles by using the less ammount of cycles (production cycles), the less amount of resources (reactors, storages, etc.) and the less amount of symbols (programming instructions). If to figure out a solution is challenging by itself, imagine how hard can be trying to beat other ""engineers"" (that's how the game calls to the player).			",337,279,13,32,18,2,32

It is addictive, and anyone with an interest in programming or engineering will love this. There is some chemistry, but you need no prior knowledge to play. There is a quick learning curve, followed by challenges that become almost exponentially harder as the game progresses.It won't appeal to all, but I certainly rate it 10/10			",159,35,3,16,19,0,18

												If you like puzzle / thinking games, give this one a try. It may appear easy at first but later on it's quite challenging and rewards you with a really good feeling when you finally found a solution.If you want to get your own impression first, there is a demo version :)PS: If you like this kind of games, look for the other Zachtronics games (e. g.  Codex of Alchemical Engineering and Infinifactory) they are quite good as well.			",130,20,1,21,41,1,77

												This is perhaps the hardest game I have ever played. The complexity of the puzzles is not tedious, however. It is addictive, and anyone with an interest in programming or engineering will love this. There is some chemistry, but you need no prior knowledge to play. There is a quick learning curve, followed by challenges that become almost exponentially harder as the game progresses.It won't appeal to all, but I certainly rate it 10/10			",159,35,3,16,19,0,18

												Hardcore genius-level chemical superphysical sciences is to this game as the large hardon collider is to me with your mom. This is to say that those who think that this game requires a doctoral degree in superscience have loose moms, and are also wrong.Basically, you string up a bunch of lines, then put things on them to make the thing that slides over the thing do things, ultimately to pick up things to tie them to other things to put into the thing where the finished things go without hitting the things into each other and nuking the universe with your reckless use of things. If you've got a thing, this it the thing for you.			",120,14,0,10,12,1,22

												This is an engineer's puzzle game!!  Picture having a virtual factory with simple ""pipes"" and controls that push atoms and molecules around - you have to take the inputs, add/remove bonds, and build the new molecule before sending it to the output area and dropping it in the tank.  You have to worry about timing, collisions, synchronizations and more. ADDICTIVE!!			",80,6,1,3,15,1,28

												Quite simply, SpaceChem is the hardest puzzle game I've ever played by a wide margin. The object of the game is to use two pathways to assemble the atoms of elements in a grid from input to output, essentially programming a machine to create the desired output. This game is only for a certain type of person. If you're not prepared to have your brain explode, or you hate it when you can't get a puzzle right away, I don't recommend this game for you. It's really that hard. Solutions around mid-game will probably take you an hour or two. If you're not very inclined with logic and algorithms you may not like this game. However, even if any of these applied to you, I still think it's worth a buy, if only to experience the difficulty this game features, even so early on. If this kind of puzzler is your cup of tea, then do I have the game for you. Whenever you find a solution to a puzzle, the immense feeling of pride is overwhelming. As you're guiding the elements you'll actually feel like a scientist on a breakthrough project. When you do finally solve a puzzle after hours of planning, you'll want to make it more efficent and quicker than what you already have. You'll want to watch it work in front of you as you admire your handywork. If you enjoy working out difficult problems and like a programming-type style of puzzle then you are this game's audience.

												I seriously don't understand why I am so obsessed with thinking about this game. I feel like there are about 15 people worldwide who would find this game interesting and fun, and I am damn lucky to be one of them.This is a game about taking chemical inputs and creating, with them, chemical outputs. To accomplish this, you program little atomic grabbers to assemble or disassemble molecules. It reminds me of the tabletop game Robo-Rally, but it takes a more contemplative tone than Richard Garfield's madcap robot programming game. Spacechem is a puzzle game, a thinker, and it's fascinating. If you have the Onlive Playpack, this game is a part of that, so you might not have to buy it on Steam to try it out.

												This here, gentle reader, is brilliance in a box. I can't emphasize how dumb this game makes me feel when I'm struggling with finding a solution. Then, suddenly I feel like Einstein! It works! I'm a genius! Then I proceed to the next puzzle, play it for a bit and go back to the one I just completed. It needs to be optimized. Then I shave off a few things, make it a bit more elegant and feel even smarter.And that, perhaps, is the most brilliant part of this game: you want to go back, making an even better solution. I'd equate it with programming. Even if you code a solution you always think that you might be able to tweak it just a bit, nip off a line here and a line there. That is this game. Programming in form of a game.The story deserves a mention as well. While I can't claim to have seen all of it, due to being too stupid to progress at the moment, so far it's excellent. It does not get in the way of the game and is pretty much optional. But if you want it, it's there. Buy now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't recommend SpaceChem for a simple reason: game is quite difficult because it lacks a proper tutorial.Most of the time I played (very little, considering I farmed its cards before starting), was used to find out how things work. Am I supposed to watch other people's solutions? Should I keep trying and error until I'll discover how to bond multiple atoms in a cycle? I won't.I have little experience in Perl programming language but when I started learning, I read and watched tutorials.. isn't that the normal process you're supposed to go through when learning a new subject? You study it and then apply what you've learned to ""real life"" problems.So, you tell me, what's the point in playing this game when you don't know the rules?			",615,225,27,59,46,11,72

												I really, really, really want to like SpaceChem.  I like its metaphor, that of creating and dissassembling molecules.  The gameplay is quite simple in concept, but leads to quite difficult puzzles.   But the game just has a really horrible interface once you reach the later levels, and it becomes more frustrating than anything else.  It's not hard to figure out how to solve the problem—it's just the interface is so bad it's hard to tell which of the four reactors the problem is in, and what exactly caused it because you can't review what happened.   It just makes it frustrating, but not even difficult—just time consuming.			",90,39,3,6,13,1,24

												Complicated games usually need a nifty introduction to draw the player in and make him want to play the game and understand it, and waste days upon days on staring at the screen while playing a game. But not this game. Straight from the start, there are just pages of text, and no interactive demonstration on how to work the overly complicated system. I always say the FREE things are always better because they were free. Well not THIS game. Even though I got it for free, I can honestly tell you not to waste your time on it.

												Truly the greatest puzzle game of all time. Not for the faint of heart. Shortly after the tutorial levels your intelligence will be challenged. If you're one of the elite few who have what it takes to make it to the last levels of the game then your sanity will be challenged.I'm sure I've gotten hundreds of hours of quality puzzle time from this game (I was playing the Linux version before Steam was available on Linux) and I consider completing this game the greatest gaming feat I will ever accomplish. Mostly because no one makes games this challenging.""The second incorrect assumption we made was thinking that puzzle games need to be difficult and long to be good. Although challenge is essential to making puzzle games ""work"", the difficulty that emerges from the mechanics of SpaceChem can be bewildering, even if it's what makes the puzzles feel so open-ended. Combining this intrinsic difficulty with an abundance of puzzles that must be beaten to ""complete"" the game gives SpaceChem an oppressive 40+ hour difficulty curve that only 2 percent of players reach the end of.""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/172250/postmortem_zachtronics_.php ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome, cool puzzle idea about chemistry that's only educational if you want it to be. It may be hard to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it it's a really interesting concept which is fun to play around with. It revolves around creating your own reactors and systems to move and bond molecules together for the sake of a plot held in space, which is very interesting but somewhat irrelevant. There are even boss battles! Late-game is only for the strongly puzzle-inclined, however, as it gets quite difficult and requires a lot of outside-the-box thinking. Regardless, try it out. Definitely recommended.			",67,13,6,6,14,1,1

												I wish I could vote neutral, but I really can't thumbs up on this. Main reason: it's too clever for me. I get what it's trying to do and applaud the originality of it, but the execution brings it to a halt to me.Your task is to build certain molecules. Probably awesome if you're a chemist, but it beats others over the head with details. The actual game is layed out in a very, VERY minimal (even abstract) way, and because everything has to fit on a single screen, you either ""see"" it or you're messing around. Spacechem certainly isn't the only puzzle game that can get frustrating, but to me, this is one where solving puzzles didn't wow me. Perhaps because the field is so small most of my approaches failed to start (meaning: you better have an elegant solution RIGHT AWAY because otherwise you can't tweak what you build).At first I thought this kind of game just wasn't for me...but after playing infinifactory (which is more or less this game in 3D - by the same makers), I now think it's because this game is just too minimalistic and has a too narrow playing field.

												This is an extremely annoying game. Even if you somehow manage to decipher the various tools, sometimes you get stuck because you didn't put enough of a delay with extended pipes. I got this game for free, and even at that price it was overvalued for my tastes.If you prefer puzzles that are poorly explained, require many hours just to ""fast forward"" to the end when everything is set up for a level, or just want to search for the puzzle solutions, you may like this game. It really isn't for me.Edit:I found out that, in addition to delays with pipes, you need to guess the orientation of the bonders. That's right, you can have a valid symbol layout, but the puzzle still won't work because of how the game secretly orders the symbols. This is inexcusable in a game focused on programming by puzzles.			",111,23,5,10,11,0,15

												I am a chemistry teacher and as a teacher I had the thought that this game might help someone learn chemistry.  After forcing myself to play for aproximately 45min I feel that I can safely say there is not much learning about chemistry involved.  There is no way I could play this (seeing I love chemistry) let alone use it as a teaching tool.   Maybe the chemistry lessons get better later in the game but not good enough for me.As a gamer I can also say that this game isn't any fun either.  The idea of the game is boring.  This is basically just a really bad puzzle game.  setting up each level takes forever just to hit the play fast buttton becuase you really dont care what happens.			",141,20,4,23,6,2,37

												I really liked this game, but theres enough frustrating elements that could be fixed but never were, which is sad for a top selling game.  This is the ultimate puzzle game thats rather unique. If you like challenging games that require a lot of forethought and trial and error this game is a must but for everone else this is a pass. The UI and support can be frustrating, clunky UI and controls take the player out of the game as you fight the UI to get the puzzle done.  No cloud saving means rebeating complicated puzzles every time you re-install.  There is access to user created content but the replay value is somewhat limited once you master the game.

												I was initially put off of this game by the fact that windowed mode wouldn't fit on my screen and couldn't be resized.I started to seriously dislike it I saw the external youtube link disguised as a level.Decided to give it a chance anyway, but put it down following a tutorial level which just directed me to do a bunch of stuff without intelligibly explaining the significance of any of it.

A lot of staring at a black screen with red lines and blue lines. Youtube this. I bought it for theTF2 items and got the heck out. Never playing this again.			",1128,324,52,104,96,15,167

												A few years ago, a mother and father decided they needed a break, so they wanted to head out for a night on the town. They called their most trusted babysitter. When the babysitter arrived, the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later that night, the babysitter got bored and went to watch TV, but she couldn't watch it downstairs because they did not have cable downstairs (the parents didn't want children watching too much garbage). So, she called them and asked them if she could watch cable in the parent's room. Of course, the parents said it was OK, but the babysitter had one final request… she asked if she could cover up the angel statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, ""..Take the children and get out of the house…we will call the police. We do not have an angel statue."" The police found all three of the house occupants dead within ten minutes of the call. No statue was found.			",141,30,1,5,4,1,5

												SpaceChem Review - Raymond KTSummary: Zachtronics Industries is back with an ambitious new design-based puzzle game. Take on the role of a Reactor Engineer working for SpaceChem, the leading chemical synthesizer for frontier colonies. Construct elaborate factories to transform raw materials into valuable chemical products! Streamline your designs to meet production quotas and survive encounters with the sinister threats that plague SpaceChem.Before we start this review, the first thing you need to do, right now, is ditch any preconceptions you’ve made off the back of SpaceChem’s chemistry-related imagery, or the fact that the screenshots look, at worst, like educational software. I can guarantee that you will learn almost nothing of any value, scientific or otherwise, playing this game. Your leisure hours are safe. If I have any chemists reading this, I can also guarantee that you’ll suck at SpaceChem as much as the rest of us. Sorry, chemists. In SpaceChem you play a new employee of a profoundly sinister interstellar chemical company (called SpaceChem), with the story of your career being told throughout the game through well-written text vignettes. The actual game of SpaceChem is, quite simply, building circuits. Using an intuitive and satisfying interface, you whip up tracks for chemicals to travel down with the objective of carrying an entirely different chemical to the level’s ultimate destination.If you like those kind of games, it's probably the best of the last 25 years. It's a game of extremes, the graphics are simply annoying, but it can keep you playing one level for a whole day. ",107,29,6,13,24,1,11

												Got this for a dollar in the steam black Friday sale.  It is by far the best 1 dollar I ever spent.  Total Biscuit was doing a whole, ""best games for under a dollar on steam"" video and when I saw this game, having been a chemical engineer major in college, I had to get it.  While it may use fake chemistry, it does in fact feel a little like solving organic chemistry problems mixed with electrical circuits and a bit of programming/logic type puzzling.  The game follows a very specific model, as it slowly introduces you to each new element, you start to get used to them and are challenged with the ever increasing difficulty.  Even for the scientifically minded this game can be quite difficult and rewarding.  Pick it up if logic/puzzling interests you and if it sounds even mildly interesting then you can check out the extensive and content rich tutorial. (not that a dollar or two would break the bank)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an extremely good puzzle game where you have to design reactors to synthesize chemicals. It's overwhelming at first as you are given seemingly free reign, only limited to mechanic constraints (and your imagination), to solve a puzzle as there are numerous ways to come up with a solution. You issue commands in the reactor; the grabby-things (waldos) pick molecules up, combine, rotate and successfully (or not) send to the factory. The beauty comes from being able to come up a solution of your own which is elegant in your own way. It may not be the 'best' solution, but you'll be proud of yourself watching those waldos whizz around in a loop. The game progressively adds a challenge- it forces you to think in a new ways, often making you think about past solutions that you could improve on. It's a game that focuses on planning; you really need to stop and think about what you are trying to do. It may not be for everyone but it's as about as 'manly' puzzle games get these days.

												What kind of game?A thinking puzzle game.  Design solutions to problems.  You use a set of simple, visual programming commands to build a machine to change inputs into new outputs.  It starts simple, but the complexity builds quickly.   The small set of commands are easy to understand and the levels are designed well to introduce each new action in turn with a relatively simple puzzle before asking you to combine it with previous commands in complex ways.A successful solution isn't necessarily the end of that level if you prefer.  At the end of a solution, you are presented with your ranking against the averages of others based on things like how long your solution took, or how many commands you used.  You can continue the gameplay by working to optimize your solution.Who will like this game?Programmers, engineers, fans of games like Incredible Machine, or people who like making crazy automatic things in Minecraft.  Lego builders who ignore directions.The Good:Lots of puzzle variety in the main game, plus a whole integrated set of puzzles that are online.  Histograms allow you to work to refine designs for different goals in each level allowing for good replay value on each puzzleThe Bad:It's hard.

												An absolutely fantastic game!  Comparing your solution to other players on three different levels is a very cool feature, and it challenges you to improve your own designs.  I love the chemistry theme (I am a Chemistry PhD candidate), and the game gets quite challenging later on (I love a good challenge).

												I got this game when it first came out.  It was worth it then, and they have since added even more content!I suspect you may have to have some programming knowledge to enjoy the game, or perhaps pick some up as you go along, but even if you are a master programmer then this game will challage you greatly as well.  It is like programming on a microprocessor with severely limited memory that serves as both storage for instructions and state information, but two pages.  You'll have to make good use of recursive state-based programming techniques to get stuff done.Personally, I find additional enjoyment in coming up with the most optimised solutions as well, in either time taken or number of instructions used, to beat the curve shown for all users~			",195,120,2,11,30,2,17

												This game challenges you in ways that many other games don't - by actually making you think through the level you're solving. You'll have a damned hard time solving some of the levels presented in this game, but when you do solve it, the feeling is the same as when you have just finished putting together an awesome LEGO set. And then you can try to optimize your solution.The only downside is that, sometimes, the interface will get a little cluttered, especially if you have many reactors going at the same time. However, the clutter didn't stop you from playing with LEGOs, did it?			",112,8,0,24,15,3,38

												Spacechem is one of the most interesting and challenging puzzle games I have ever played.The unique gameplay focuses on sharpening your mind instead of forcing muscle memory, pixel-precise movement or artificial difficulty on you.Successfully completing a level with a solution you created in your own fashion is very satisfying, going back to your first levels to 'optimize' and then simply watch them (seriously) serves a good amount of replayability.Even when you are not currently playing it, you will constantly try to create solutions for puzzles in your mind. Despite the look of it, a deep knowledge of chemistry is not required, but may come in handy.Overall this is a very fun and addicting piece of software, highly recommended if you like puzzle games.

The perfect game for programmers and engineers (anyone who loves to tinker.)My one gripe is that the progress is linear so if you get stuck on a really tricky puzzle you can almost never skip it and try again later. Yes you can easily go on youtube and find solutions to any puzzle that's stumping you, but its annoying having to resort to such measures.			",272,58,0,13,21,2,32

												My favourite puzzle game. The puzzles get gradually harder and harder, but never seem too impossible. I've never had this much drive to force myself in to solving a puzzle and never felt as rewarded when I finally did. The best part is; the solution is most likely unique.The game offers countless of ways to solve a puzzle and teaches the basic concepts behind programming while doing it. There is no right way to solve a puzzle, there are faster ways, simpler ways, more understandble ways and your way. I recommend every teacher teaching basic programming to show this game to their students as a way of understanding the principle behind programming, not just the language.			",123,27,3,47,51,1,57

												A most brilliant game. It is called ""Chem"" but you will only learn a little about chemistry from this game. It is essentially a programming game that centers around building automatons (in the game called reactors). You need to design, test and debug sophisticated mechanisms that combine, decompose and move around particles. It is a puzzle game with open solutions. Before I finished a level I always stopped and examined my plan, wondering if there was a simpler, more efficient and elegant design.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Perfect game for those who like incredibly tough and complex puzzle games. Make no mistake, this game has very little to do with actual chemistry - aside from the names of the atoms and molecules, as well as some basic concepts like bonds, this is MUCH more of a puzzler than any kind of chemical engineering guide. Nobody builds molecules one by one - unless they play this game.Also, amazing music. The OST is worth purchasing.			",152,27,2,21,11,0,28

												This is the kind of puzzler that lasts a while, and I haven't even really delved into the research.net stuff.  Half the fun is figuring out how to solve the puzzle.The other half is trying to figure out how to optimize it for symbols or length of time.I also love that I can see where I stand compared to others.  However, the numerical view is a bit confusing.  I can't tell if the number with the ) is my place or not.  I'll see something like 1) 486 on a puzzle, but if I look in graph view, I clearly am not the #1 solution.Still, I would highly recommend this game if you like puzzlers and don't mind challenging ones.

												This is by far the best ""puzzle"" game I've ever played.  It was incredibly complicated and difficult, but soooo satisfying once I completed a level.  As you progress, the game becomes harder as new elements are added.  My only concern was that some of the directions were not clear enough when introducing new items, requiring a lot of time to be spent understanding the game mechanics.  As some of the other reviews indicated, this game is definitely for a specific type of person.  If you want instant gratification, do NOT get this game.  If you want to spend hours trying to come up with a solution, then go to bed and dream of the answer, this is for you.10/10			",91,12,3,21,21,0,10

												Spacechem is fun, and taxing. Ideal for people who like cold hard computer logic.Basically you program circuits to recombine various atoms and compounds into various other atoms and compounds. Early on, it's really simple stuff, and the tutorial levels are pretty good at cluing you into what's going on, but after a while you're on your own, and you really have to put your thinking caps on.SpaceChem is really challenging, but rewarding.

												SpaceChem is an absolutely brilliant and unique puzzle game.  Nothing else short of possibly Deadly Rooms of Death can compare to its depth of play while still retaining its simple foundations.SpaceChem is also dastardly tricky.  Most everyone else I know who's played it had to stop because it just got too difficult.  For some levels, I can understand that feeling.  The difficulty curve has spikes in it.  In the end though, I think it's definitely worth it.  The feeling of accomplishment you get is not just from beating the puzzles, but from your own personal solution to them.  You made this design that completed the task set in front of you.  It's yours, every single part of it.There are very few games that can evoke that sort of deeply personal satisfaction.  Of not a job well done, but a machine well made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The empty grey background stares back at you, taunting you. You respond by filling the screen with instructions and criss-crossing paths, but it's not enough, there's still something missing. ""Maybe it will all make sense in the morning"" you lie to yourself as you try, in vain, to fall asleep. You can hear it, laughing at you, mocking you for your failure. ""No,"" you shout ""I know exactly what to do, I just need to synch it so that... but no, I don't have enough room!... Unless...?""Epiphany! It all makes sense now! How could you be so stupid, it's so simple.Atoms and molecules are carried all across the screen in an hypnotic dance, carriers are exchanged, bonds are broken and reformed. You grin madly at your success, but as you watch your construction form and disassemble molecules, you realize you could cut out a few cycles by moving that instruction that way, and maybe if you rearrange those arrows you'll be able to cut out that overly complex loop.And it starts anew!

												SpaceChem is a brilliant puzzle game in that when you get a solution to a puzzle, especially one of the later ones, the feeling of satisfaction is incredible.

Most likely not. This is a complex, deep, challenging and unique puzzle game which turns a factory programming to an entertaining experience. In order to enjoy SpaceChem, you've get to learn a lot, think a lot, try and try again, discover new way to do things, systemise what you did in the past stages, then challenge new stage. Without any of these processes, you WILL get lost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great logic/puzzle game. You need to design a ""circuit board"" that breaks and creates atomic bonds to produce the desired element. as the game progresses, you need to have multiple ""circuit boards"" that feed into one another, to produce the desired elements. When designing the ""circuit boards"" you have to try and balance a number of moving parts, otherwise you encounter problems of atoms colliding into one another, or supply/delivery pipelines being filled so they cannot accept new deliveries.

												I got this game for free from PC Gamer and Bundle Stars recently. I wish I hadn't.I wish I had paid 10 bucks for it. It's worth at least twice that.From both a gamer's and programmer's perspective, this game is absolutely brilliant. I can't stop playing and I'm dreaming in logic gates, if/and/or statements, inputs and outputs. I'm obsessed with this game! If you love puzzles, buy it. If you love logic games, buy it. If you love programming, buy it. But most importantly, if you love a challenge, buy it. This game gets ridiculously difficult later on, and in a world where games are pandering to ""casual"" gamers more and more, that's a really important feature.The game makes you feel dumb when you fail and really smart when you succeed. It's a wonderful feeling, either way.			",136,18,1,12,20,1,23

												This game is extremely addicting.  The puzzles are very challenging and for some might be frustrating but if you are of an analytical mindset and enjoy programming or logic puzzles you will be in for a great treat with SpaceChem.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is that every single puzzle can be solved in a miriad number of ways (some more elegant and efficient than others) but each unique solution will take a lot of effort to complete and because of that you have a great sense of accomplishment with every one.  Even when you don't have a complete solution the progress you make toward that goal is very enjoyable even if 1/2 way through you realizes a better way to approach the problem and end up scrapping all your work up to that point only to start over from a new direction. The only negative I can give is that the story pane seems very corny and contrived and really unecessary to the game but you can really just ignore that wall of text as it has no bearing on the puzzles or their solution. Highly recommended for puzzle fans. Avoid if your easily frustrated, the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty quickly.			",93,24,4,4,8,0,4

												Very interesting puzzle. Especially for programmers.Manipulating data in a two-threaded environment leads to concurrency and syncronization problems with groups or individual instruction nodes. Later instruction nodes are encapsulated within reactors and reactor interations involve additional problems to deal with.Lack of resources encourages or forces procedure\code unification for reuse purposes.Absolutely no rush work. Pretty decent debugging. Complexity increments not too fast so u can catch up i guess.Def worth buying.			",119,29,1,8,16,0,20

												Good: Yes.Hard: Also, yes. Although I am quite terrible with efficiency in this game (I once actually beat the performance curve on being over-the-top convoluted), and I'd say quite terrible at it in general, it's one of those games that I enjoyed because of the level of critical thinking it takes to solve each puzzle. You'll really stretch out your brain visualizing ways to make the damn thing work. There's a kind of freedom in how you go about it, too. You can go ahead and make a giant tangled mess that somehow manages to sync up and fart out molecules (like I do), or you can create elegantly simple systems that use minimal commands and reactor cycles (like the people on youtube, who make me feel very, very stupid). I'm not too, too far in yet, and I hear efficiency becomes a concern later (in which case I AM SO SCREWED). And yes, you kind of have to be a little bit of a nerd to get into this game. Knowing a little bit about programming helps, but isn't strictly necessary if you're decent at puzzle games. You only really need to know the basics of chemistry, as it's mostly gameplay science, anyhow. Overall, it's a little dense, but not enough to be inaccessible. Solving each level somehow feels more satisfying than other puzzle games, like you really contributed something. Or maybe it's just really hard in spots and you feel proud of yourself for getting it. I don't know. I like it, anyhow. I'd say it's worth a look if you want a hard puzzler and a good brain exercise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Puzzle game of the year?  Maybe!No real chemistry involved here; it's basically visual scripting with a limited set of ""instructions"" (tools) and a geometric aspect. If you like coding/scripting, or if you like building contraptions and watching them crank along, then you'll probably dig it. It does quickly get complex. This is not an easy game. Fortunately the solving process doesn't (always) involve just staring at the screen, but rather building different aspects of a possible solution to see how they work out. So it's engaging even when you're not immediately solving stuff.The nifty thing is that each problem has lots of workable solutions. If you like, you can tune your solutions for efficiency or speed, and see how you compare to other players. I'm only halfway through the campaign myself, just taking my time and occasionally going back to earlier stages to tweak my solutions.You can see some solution examples at spacechem.net or on youtube.

												What kind of game?A thinking puzzle game.  Design solutions to problems.  You use a set of simple, visual programming commands to build a machine to change inputs into new outputs.  It starts simple, but the complexity builds quickly.   The small set of commands are easy to understand and the levels are designed well to introduce each new action in turn with a relatively simple puzzle before asking you to combine it with previous commands in complex ways.A successful solution isn't necessarily the end of that level if you prefer.  At the end of a solution, you are presented with your ranking against the averages of others based on things like how long your solution took, or how many commands you used.  You can continue the gameplay by working to optimize your solution.Who will like this game?Programmers, engineers, fans of games like Incredible Machine, or people who like making crazy automatic things in Minecraft.  Lego builders who ignore directions.The Good:Lots of puzzle variety in the main game, plus a whole integrated set of puzzles that are online.  Histograms allow you to work to refine designs for different goals in each level allowing for good replay value on each puzzleThe Bad:It's hard.  Very few people actually complete all the puzzles in the game (which has been noted by the developer). Special Note:In addition to this Steam playtime, I probably have equal amounts of time played on the iPad version, which I take with me for travel.			",97,11,3,15,15,1,6

												Getting an headache has never been so much fun. SpaceChem is a puzzle game where you lay down a path for two ""Waldo""s (cursors) to make modifications to atoms and molecules. These two Waldos can activate commands like grab/drop, add/remove bond, rotate, input/output ect. The game starts simple, but gets more challenging over time, but never overwhelms you. The power of this game is the complexity while it only uses these simple commands, testing your creativity and making solving puzzles oh so rewarding. And with the provided level-editor and active community, you have access for a near-infinite amount challenging puzzles. Buy SpaceChem if you like puzzles and the rewarding feeling of solving them.

Core gameplay revolves around using commands to direct the actions of two machines and have them move around and bond elements into various molecules. The difficulty comes from utilizing the limited space you have in the most efficient way possible. The difficulty in this game will make you want to throw your monitor at a wall at times, but it's extremely satisfying when you figure out a solution and watch the little bits fly around the screen as you wait for it to finish. Definitely a must buy if you're patient and looking for a great puzzle game.			",317,62,2,53,26,1,33

												You get to shoot a gigantic tentacle monster in the eye with a laser!An excellent puzzle game in which you chemistry using magical future reactors. Chemicals are moved around and bonded/fused/etc using a kind of 2d flowchart system, and the assignments get steadily more complex. Production assignments require you to lay out basic pipelines as well, and think about reaction speed and output rates so that everything stays smoothly. Compete against everyone else (MEEEEEE) on your list for the best time/fewest instructions etc.Its apparently more chemistry (and abstracted, game chemistry at that) than chemical engineering.There are also bosses, in which you generally put some of the idioms you learned in the other levels to work destroying some massive horror.With ResearchNetyou can build your own assignments and try the ones that come up in ""the journal of reaction engineering"" so there's plenty to do.

For an indie game, this is a brilliant piece of software that deserves to be taken seriously by any gamer.

You have two waldos (threads) that execute commands to produce an output. You build modules and iterate to debug and later to optimise. It's brilliant and a good deal of fun, especially since you aren't creating the game's solution to a puzzle, you're creating your own- the game simply stands back and lets you use the tools it provides.

												TLDR;Perfectionist?  Obsessive-compulsive?  Nerdy/geeky?  Enjoy puzzles or patterns?Buy first and ask questions later, such as: ""Why the f-asterisk-ck wasn't I told about this game a long time ago?!""I don't know how to describe this but I'm both relaxed and excited after playing for about 20 minutes.  Watching the demo video, after I purchased the game, is what got me really interested.  This is a perfectionist's and obsessive-compulsive person's dream game, with a nerdy ""element"" to it.  Ba-dum ch.I got this game because of a coupon making it dirt-cheap, and I saw that it was a puzzle game and the screenshots were indicative of patterns.  I would've paid full price for this, but the coupon is what drew my attention to it...I wish Steam had a way of suggesting games like this.  I've invested more time in other games, but this may be the best video game brain food I've ever played.  You create your own puzzle/pattern, aim for perfection (if that's your thing), and it's an amazing mental outlet.  Hopefully it doesn't turn into an addiction to where I finish everything perfectly yet there's no more game to play ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall: Good to Very goodLikes:- kind of like programming- open-ended puzzles where the focus is on engineering the solutions- challenging- for additional challenge, you can optimize your solutions to minimize the number of cycles, symbols, or reactorsDislikes:- the multi-stage puzzles require a lot of time and work to solve, even when you see the solution.  I felt that the short puzzles with small, achievable goals were more fun and accessible.- campaign puzzles are progress-locked			",59,40,0,9,10,0,18

												Easily one of my favourite puzzle games of all time. Spacechem is hard at first and quickly gets very hard leaving me feeling a bit dim sometimes. The machines I make are often way more complex than they should be,cumbersome and flawed for the most part. But that is what makes this game special in my opinion, there is usually many ways to solve the problems you are presented.Not for people who don't want to use a bit of grey mattter. If you like a game that will keep your brain working overtime even when you are not playing it then don't waste any more time get Spacechem now !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game is a gem.  I actually would recommend this game to anyone who love puzzles, but be aware it is rather difficult. It's a shame there are a lot of negative reviews on the game suggesting that this game isn't for everyone, yet they have lots of hours on it and enjoy the game.  It's sort of true and you can say the same thing on just about every game. I'm sure dev knows this and provide a free demo for people to try out.  So suggest the free demo and stop giving thumbs down. You're not giving the game a fair rating when you thumbs down for that.			",31,12,0,2,13,0,4

												I was looking at games the other day. Figured I’d support the Indie scene and… what’s this? SpaceChem? Okay, that looks like something I’d enjoy. Turns out I was disastrously right. Here’s why:SpaceChem is a training tool for many of the skills I value.  Process optimization, design problems, spatial layout, programming, continuous flow problems. It fits snugly in my mind.There is no “right” solution (just like in real life!), only better, worse, and wrong.I find SpaceChem really difficult. There’s a constant struggle to create a linked sequence of elegant solutions to unique process challenges.I think I’m good at it. Judging from the “others solutions” charts (which is a brilliant idea by the way) I’m coming in below average (which is good, since they are all minimize optimal) on all three metrics at once. Consistently. Often on the first try. Of course, this only drives me to attempt ever more elegant solutions, making the game even more challenging.			",27,12,0,3,13,0,8

												My rating of ""Thumbs Up Recommend"" is more a reflection of the fact that _I_ liked this game, but I have no idea if _you_ will like this game.It's programmy-puzzly.

												This is the type of game that truly determines the boundries of the mind in both an entertaining and challenging way. In addition, it loosely bases its gameplay off basic principles of chemistry which gives the game a realistic edge to it. Aside from the gameplay, the plot seems to be similar to a Sci-Fi novel that I would read, in that it was entertaining and suspenseful.Honestly, I do not find many games on steam in which I can find these qualities.

												SpaceChem isn't a game so much as a program for converting your skull into a skull-shaped bowl for tapioca pudding. Vaguely akin to debugging badly written code, graphically represented, without the advantage of logs or tools or a paycheque. But fun...and more addictive. When things come together elegantly it is glorious, when they don't the urge to punch a baby is strong. At almost 50 hours in I still can't say if I like it, but I can say with certainty that I've never played anything else like it. Probably for good reason, but you should give it a try anyway.

												Such complex and interesting gameplay. Helped me understand why GMO's are bad for the environment. No, there is nothing about GMO's in the storyline, but the allegory is there. As you build molecules and use them to trigger reactions, everything may look perfectly sound... but thousands of cycles later, an error you missed can crash your whole assembly. Kind of like how GMO's seem to be perfectly executing cycles of DNA, but what will happen generations down the line? Did that Monsanto geek honestly get it right the first time he spliced?Anyways, the game play of mixing chemicals and planning iterations is a lot of fun and takes a programmer's mind.

												Don't let the title fool you: SpaceChem is less about either space or chemistry, and more about programming automatons. The game gives you a periodic table, and that's all the chemistry knowledge you'll need for this video game.With that out of the way, let's gush. SpaceChem is legit one of the best, if not THE best, puzzle video game you can get.SpaceChem is simple at its core: you are given a board, a set of commands, a supply of set molecules and an output molecule the game expects you to make by moving and transforming the molecules you are given. Sometimes you get one board to play with, sometimes you get multiple boards to link together so you can deal with more complicated puzzles.And oh boy does it get complicated. Beyond the tutorial missions, puzzles begins with ""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THIS"". Then you get an idea, then you test that idea. And then you either rework that idea because it MIGHT work, or scrap that idea because it is obviously not working. Rinse, lather and repeat.But then you stumble upon a solution - YOUR solution. And as you watch your program go off without a single hitch, you feel like the smartest man that ever was. YOU did this. YOU have shown this puzzle who's boss.And then you see the graphs and realise you are just an average person among other average persons. And as you come back down from your high, you load up the next puzzle, yearning for another moment of elation. But the puzzles gets more and more complicated and difficult. But the high gets better and better in return.(Or until you just give up. Which isn't shameful - this IS a pretty damn hard game after all.)That's how SpaceChem works its magic. Of course, the puzzles themselves are just as well designed as the core gameplay itself, and the difficulty curve is impeccable, with well placed spikes and breathers to keep it all interesting. The graphics serves their purpose just as elegantly, the music gives a tinge of epicness to your brain wracking, and hell, SpaceChem throws in a fun story of an engineer who realises his work is a lot more complicated than it appears at first glance.SpaceChem is nothing more than a masterpiece.

												Spacechem is a construction game, where you attempt to create a contraption (with very limited space) that converts one set of input atoms/molecules into a set of output atoms/molecules.It's a very good variation on the ""assembly line"" game.  I think this is the best game so far from Zachtronic Industries.  It's a pretty large, challenging, logic/process bending, thoughtful game.  And it's got cool music, too.  And an interesting plot.  And cool charts so you can see how well you did compared with the rest of the world.Get it, play it, agonize over it's puzzles.			",310,90,7,85,82,0,95

												Don't judge a book by its cover.  It might have basic graphics and be described as a ""casual"" game.  It might have chemical symbols and a periodic table.  But this is no more aimed at the Farmville crowd than it is at MIT graduates.  It's a pure puzzle game whose gameplay mechanics would be unchanged if you were playing with different coloured shapes instead of atoms and molecules.Be warned, though.  It gets pretty mindbending pretty quickly.  There's enough meat in the demo to tell you whether you'll love or hate it, and if you love it you'll find your progress carries over into the full game.A very pleasant surprise.

												If you thought Portal 2 had challenging puzzles, or if you get scared at the thought of Tetris, then by all means, stay clear of Spacechem. On the other hand, if you love the afforementioned titles, then by all means, do indulge in a puzzlegame based on pure logic and exact science. Incredibly deep and massively engaging, Spacechem's systems and background mechanics will make your brain work like a well oiled V12 engine. In spacechem you have to program a nuclear reactor and assemble, or crack atoms. And that is just the entry level, when you get to einstein level, you have combine your atoms with more atoms, think about bindings, and load them into freighters. While making one compound is a walk in the proverbial park. You have to make make a pattern that is infintely repeatable...on all levels. Making that walk in the park a bloody streetfight in a volcano...in space.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												This is an extremely good puzzle game where you have to design reactors to synthesize chemicals. It's overwhelming at first as you are given seemingly free reign, only limited to mechanic constraints (and your imagination), to solve a puzzle as there are numerous ways to come up with a solution. You issue commands in the reactor; the grabby-things (waldos) pick molecules up, combine, rotate and successfully (or not) send to the factory. The beauty comes from being able to come up a solution of your own which is elegant in your own way. It may not be the 'best' solution, but you'll be proud of yourself watching those waldos whizz around in a loop. The game progressively adds a challenge- it forces you to think in a new ways, often making you think about past solutions that you could improve on. It's a game that focuses on planning; you really need to stop and think about what you are trying to do. It may not be for everyone but it's as about as 'manly' puzzle games get these days.

												This game is awesome. I thought I would have fun with the game for about 3 hours max at first glance, but I didn't know I would get sucked in this easily and play for so long.  This game is a gem.  I actually would recommend this game to anyone who love puzzles, but be aware it is rather difficult. It's a shame there are a lot of negative reviews on the game suggesting that this game isn't for everyone, yet they have lots of hours on it and enjoy the game.  It's sort of true and you can say the same thing on just about every game. I'm sure dev knows this and provide a free demo for people to try out.  So suggest the free demo and stop giving thumbs down. You're not giving the game a fair rating when you thumbs down for that.			",31,12,0,2,13,0,4

												Spacechem teaches you how to think link a software engineer. A light but interesting plot guides you through the otherwise grey but challenging gameplay. After the linear tutorial levels, each problem requires a freeform, unique design using simple, common principles. The main quest itself takes this format to a satisfying conclusion, but there's also a community workshop if you want more content.I wish I had this game when I was a junior in high school.The graphics and sound effects are simplistic but functional enough and of expected quality for an indie puzzle game.

												In my 25+ years of playing computer games, I've never seen a puzzle game as compelling and satisfying as SpaceChem. It's easily better than the classics (something you don't say easily), and it's head and shoulders above the often excellent contemporaries.You build molecule factories in an almost-sandbox environment, with gradually ramping up complexity - all the puzzles have many solutions, and there's great replay value in optimizing your designs. If you like a challenge, just jump into it and see for yourself :) ",293,168,25,29,36,5,62

												Space Chem isn't really about space.  It isn't really about chemistry.It's actually about programming.But, don't let that throw you! It's a great little puzzle game.  So many games in the genre are about stripped-down gameplay, minimalistic controls and ""emergent complexity"".  SpaceChem is different.  It'll throw down a complex problem, a big bag of tools, and then stare at you expectantly, like your father.  Also like your father, the only reward it gives you in exchange for success is comparing you to your more accomplished peers and then giving you another challenge.Someday, SpaceChem will love me back.

												This is perhaps one of the greatest puzzle games in recent memory, on par with Portal, Braid, and Myst. The idea is deceptively simple, yet lying beneath the surface is an incredibly complex game that'll leave you scratching your head, drawing diagrams on napkins, and generally cursing the periodic table.And you'll love every minute of it. There's nothing quite like the satifaction of watching your tangled mess of a solution actually work. I only have two qualms with the game: The boss battles often involve incredibly precise timing which leads to a necessity for optimization of your spacechem reactors. Some people may like this, but I found it pretty tedious. Secondly, the difficulty ramps up IMMENSELY on the last few worlds and some of the final puzzles can take hours, days, or (in my case) over a week to work out a solution. As of this writing, less than 4% of SpaceChem players have even managed to finish the game. Despite these two dings, the game is unbelievably fun, relatively cheap, and a great mental work-out. Prepare to lose hours to chemistry and actually have fun doing so.			",146,28,1,28,22,1,12

												A fantastic game for engineers. First off, its obviosuly a unique puzzle game, not some stupid copy and paste candy crush. Its hard, you need to think about what youre going to do, and there will always be errors, so you need to troubleshoot and then fix it.Applied very well too, youre not beating monsters by moving colored rocks around, youre unbonding and bonding elements and molecular compounds. Great atmosphere.On top of it all, you arent scored, your time and resources used are simply compared with everyone else whos ever completed the same puzzle. Time and resources; the two most prominent objects of efficiency. Your goal is to make each puzzle as efficient as you can, which, when theyre not inventing new things, is pretty much every engineers job.			",89,11,1,6,8,0,15

												Don't let the title fool you: SpaceChem is less about either space or chemistry, and more about programming automatons. The game gives you a periodic table, and that's all the chemistry knowledge you'll need for this video game.With that out of the way, let's gush. SpaceChem is legit one of the best, if not THE best, puzzle video game you can get.SpaceChem is simple at its core: you are given a board, a set of commands, a supply of set molecules and an output molecule the game expects you to make by moving and transforming the molecules you are given. Sometimes you get one board to play with, sometimes you get multiple boards to link together so you can deal with more complicated puzzles.And oh boy does it get complicated. Beyond the tutorial missions, puzzles begins with ""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THIS"". Then you get an idea, then you test that idea. And then you either rework that idea because it MIGHT work, or scrap that idea because it is obviously not working. Rinse, lather and repeat.But then you stumble upon a solution - YOUR solution. And as you watch your program go off without a single hitch, you feel like the smartest man that ever was. YOU did this. YOU have shown this puzzle who's boss.And then you see the graphs and realise you are just an average person among other average persons. And as you come back down from your high, you load up the next puzzle, yearning for another moment of elation. But the puzzles gets more and more complicated and difficult. But the high gets better and better in return.(Or until you just give up. Which isn't shameful - this IS a pretty damn hard game after all.)That's how SpaceChem works its magic. Of course, the puzzles themselves are just as well designed as the core gameplay itself, and the difficulty curve is impeccable, with well placed spikes and breathers to keep it all interesting. The graphics serves their purpose just as elegantly, the music gives a tinge of epicness to your brain wracking, and hell, SpaceChem throws in a fun story of an engineer who realises his work is a lot more complicated than it appears at first glance.SpaceChem is nothing more than a masterpiece.

												Easily the best puzzle game ever, this charming piece of a thinking man's entertainment has also managed to take a spot among my favourite games of all time.SpaceChem doesn't actually have much to do with chemistry, but it has everything to do with programming. The puzzles effectively boil down to designing programs in a language reminiscent of Befunge, and unlike with many puzzle games, there's no feeling at all that you're trying to reproduce the game designer's contrived train of thought. Solutions always feel like a work of your own, and more often than not different people come up with vastly different solutions to the same problem. This alone makes the game extremely rewarding - but there's also a ton of potential for optimizing your solutions; or simply coming up with ones that seem particularly elegant.Add to that a charming soundtrack, extremely competent writing and well over 40 hours of content even without DLC, and this becomes an undisputable must-buy.

												Let's be honest, we all love Lego. Creating things from nothing, being proud of how it works is amazing. K'Nex too~ SpaceChem is the equivalent of combining the two, with some mediocre Chemistry 101. It's not the simplest of games, the learning curve is very steep from the get-go, but once you have it (and you will understand it, trust me) then the possibilities open up. You essentially take one element or molecule, process it, and dump it - rinse, repeat. However there's many challenges, multiple ways to do each challenge and even an online mode you can submit challenges to others! A great, complex, mechanical-inspired, chemistry-laced treat hidden amongst thousands of other indie games.  ",113,21,6,21,13,0,21

												This game is EPIC. The challenge is to program reactors with a series of tracks and commands that will produce a specific molecular result. It's far more complicated then it sounds and you have to think on many levels and try to perform the tasks efficiently and in a multitasking manner with the waldos (grabber/activators) that reside in each reactor. One reactor is hard enough, but try stringing together several and producing 2 or more different results to send to different freighters. This is definetly a programmer's game as the system seems remeniscent of a programmable processor that manipulates data and seperates the results to specific outputs. An instant favorite of mine, I'll never tire of looking for the most efficient and effective way to produce the desired output.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												SpaceChem is a masterpiece. The challenge here is to create specific chemical compounds by rearranging the atomic structure of the given compound(s) and delivering them to the destination through a pipes. You accomplish this using a series of reactors which can add, remove or re-arrange the atoms of a compound: each of these is a puzzle in and of itself. Deciding how many and which type of reactor to use in each level provides a sort of macro puzzle. Many levels limit the type and/or number or reactors available, providing variety in addition to aesthetic and compound differences. You can save and load reactor layouts, allowing you to use them in different levels.Each level is so brilliantly complex in that you are not only trying to construct the most efficient way to modify the compounds within each reactor, you must also consider the overall purpose of each reactor in sequence: given that most compounds require several different reactors to change them into the desired result. Additionally (yes, there is more: bear with me, it will be worth it!), each level must be completed within a certain time frame or 'cycles'. Transporting each compound from the start to the destination takes time, as does modifying them through each reactor. If not designed efficiently, you may end up with bottlenecks in your chain of reactors, leading to the overall level time being too slow. This is usually fixed through some minor tweaking and provides another level of strategic planning to the each levels.I found the muisic to be quite enjoyable and the astheic both functional and pleasing to look at. There is an overacrching story, which is told between levels. It is very well written, and quite interesting. I fear however, that I will never see the end of the story, due to my own incompetence and to the sheer complexity and intricacy of the puzzles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked this game a lot. First of all, programming games are very rare. This is not only a good programming game, but also a fun and challenging game. The idea is genius! The design and implementation is good. The story is interesting. Even the menus look good. The boss battles are a very cool idea too. It's just amazing to use the ""boring"" thing like chemical plants to fight enemies. The switches in boss levels made it feel like I was creating a game inside a game (building the ""engine"" and wiring the controls).Liked the additional levels and the online gallery.The not so good parts (there are very few):1) Liked the music, but there's like only a single track. I've spent countless hours and the music got to me a bit.2) Non-gameplay graphics (like the pyramid) are a bit low-res and blurry when viewed on a large monitor.3) I encountered a bug: sometimes when I opened some old completed level, the plant schemes were slightly messed up (any any change breaks everything for good). Guess the save format was a bit unstable. This disn't set me back while I was playing through the game, but I'm a bit of archivist.Overall, this is a great game. I want some more of it. Don't know what exactly do I want, dut I want more =)			",369,302,5,67,30,3,49

												SpaceChem is the pefect game for anyone looking work on his or her coding skills, the game demands that one solve logical puzzles of increasing complexity within very strict confines, and encourages (but does not require) efficiency.  Re-designing working solutions for added efficiency adds to my satisfaction with this game.  I originally received it as part of a Humble Bundle, played through it on a tablet, and am re-playing the Steam version now.  This game is fantastic for all ages, but would be especially good for a young person who is interested in software development!			",108,37,0,22,49,3,27

												Spacechem is one of those puzzle games that gives you the basic tools early and expect you to figure out what to do with them. The game will seriously test your ability to think in multiple layers at the same time and give you hell when you have to account for all the sideeffects that happens when your subsolutions have to work together. The gameplay is simple, yet the puzzles are deep. This is not a game where you can just throw something together and hope that it works, you need to plan your approatches and possibly rethink it from the ground up when you realize the subtle issues that happens down the road.

I tried Spacechem expecting it to get too complicated too quickly to fully enjoy, but have been very impressed with the slow build on complexity it offers up.

												Best puzzler I've ever played.  Also has a very steep difficulty curve - I'm only a little over halfway through it, and levels are taking several hours of intense concentration to complete to my satisfaction.  Despite the chemistry theme, might be better described as a programming game - the player guides 'waldos' around a cartesian grid by laying symbols in the path of the waldo which alter its behaviour.  These waldos are used to manipulate molecules which enter the level to modify them into the goal molecules which must leave the level, by a process of splitting and bonding atoms with one another.Levels have any number of solutions, but at the end of a level you are presented with a graph showing how efficiently you solved a level compared to other players.Aside from all this mechanical stuff, it also has quite a nice sinister back-story throughout, told in small chunks of text as you complete levels.

It's worth at least twice that.From both a gamer's and programmer's perspective, this game is absolutely brilliant. I can't stop playing and I'm dreaming in logic gates, if/and/or statements, inputs and outputs. I'm obsessed with this game! If you love puzzles, buy it. If you love logic games, buy it. If you love programming, buy it. But most importantly, if you love a challenge, buy it. This game gets ridiculously difficult later on, and in a world where games are pandering to ""casual"" gamers more and more, that's a really important feature.The game makes you feel dumb when you fail and really smart when you succeed. It's a wonderful feeling, either way.			",136,18,1,12,20,1,23

												Fun and challenging puzzle game.It takes a bit to understand how to play at first, but once you get in the swing of it, you find yourself thinking things through logically a lot like programmer thinks through code.I'm curious if it would be too hard for someone that doesn't have a basic understanding of chemistry or a somewhat developed logic thought process.Definately a good ""brain food"" game.

												An amazing puzzle game unlike anything else I've seen. While it is based on a chemistry theme, the gameplay is actually more akin to circuitry with logical algorithm building and no knowledge of chemisty is actually required. New puzzle types and logic pieces are unlocked regularly making for a varied and increasingly challenging experience. Not for the impatient since some puzzles can take hours to solve, but when you do finally figure a difficult puzzle out it is so immensely satisfying. Well worth the cost of buying, even if not on sale!			",86,26,4,24,5,0,11

												This game is extremely addicting.  The puzzles are very challenging and for some might be frustrating but if you are of an analytical mindset and enjoy programming or logic puzzles you will be in for a great treat with SpaceChem.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is that every single puzzle can be solved in a miriad number of ways (some more elegant and efficient than others) but each unique solution will take a lot of effort to complete and because of that you have a great sense of accomplishment with every one.  Even when you don't have a complete solution the progress you make toward that goal is very enjoyable even if 1/2 way through you realizes a better way to approach the problem and end up scrapping all your work up to that point only to start over from a new direction. The only negative I can give is that the story pane seems very corny and contrived and really unecessary to the game but you can really just ignore that wall of text as it has no bearing on the puzzles or their solution. Highly recommended for puzzle fans. Avoid if your easily frustrated, the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty quickly.			",93,24,4,4,8,0,4

												Easily one of my favourite puzzle games of all time. Spacechem is hard at first and quickly gets very hard leaving me feeling a bit dim sometimes. The machines I make are often way more complex than they should be,cumbersome and flawed for the most part. But that is what makes this game special in my opinion, there is usually many ways to solve the problems you are presented.Not for people who don't want to use a bit of grey mattter. If you like a game that will keep your brain working overtime even when you are not playing it then don't waste any more time get Spacechem now !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a puzzle game about making working assembly lines; in goes the materials, you make an assembly line, and out goes the required quantity of the required product (the chemical compounds).  The ""chemistry"" thing is a clever aesthetic conceit to make it so the simple objects you're assembling seem to have some real world grounding and help motivate you to solve the problems.  A cool thing about it is how open-ended it is for a puzzle game; as you run your assembly line, you get a count on how long it takes to output the quota of chemicals.  I've spent a lot of time going back to solutions that were good enough to pass, just to find ways to make them more efficient.  Sometimes this means making minor adjustments to reduce the pauses necessary to avoid collisions, sometimes it means changing the whole assembly line.  There's a lot of replayability here.One issue with that replayability is that there isn't an obvious way to back up your previous solutions (within the game that is), which made me reluctant to wipe the slate clean on my nicer solutions.  Obviously you could start a new game but that means playing puzzles you're not interested in at the time.			",81,14,1,2,10,0,7

												I have to confess that SpaceChem appeared in my library a little to my surprise. I think I bought something else which unlocked this as an additional bonus.I'm glad it found me. SpaceChem is in equal parts entertaining, educational and atmospheric. The core gameplay consists of breaking down molecule structures to recombine into new substances, using a programmatic set of icons to move, break, rotate and recombine. Overlaying this is an ongoing story, told through flavour text with each level, which provides some context for the changing landscapes and ""boss battles"".I'll be honest, I learned more about the periodic table after a couple of hours with this game than I learned in five years of secondary school.If the story doesn't interest you, then the boss battles will come across as a bizarre incongruence in what is otherwise an incredibly addictive and surprisingly educational puzzler. Definitely recommended.			",56,34,1,13,6,0,10

												So disappointed I didn't come across this game sooner. I absolutely love it, coming from a person who studies, works in and has an interest in Science and Chemistry.Logical puzzle games have always been a favorite of mine, and I will play anything that is fun and also stimulates me intellectually. I love that the developers have kept it pretty scientifically realistic (periodic table, bonding, names of compounds (although some homonuclear molecules like N2 are called nitrogen, when actually should be dinitrogen, and carbon monoxide appears as a double bound molecule when is actually triple bound)). The soundtrack is also awesome, I love the track 7.ogg (doesn't have a name).			",136,37,3,19,66,0,27

Walls of text, crude mechanics and a rather high difficulty.BUTIf you have grasped the logic you can spend many hours in this game.I enjoyed testing and planning my reactors step by step and spent hours with constructing the best possible way for each goal.It's a good game if you like puzzles without time pressure and for small money			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was worth it then, and they have since added even more content!I suspect you may have to have some programming knowledge to enjoy the game, or perhaps pick some up as you go along, but even if you are a master programmer then this game will challage you greatly as well.  It is like programming on a microprocessor with severely limited memory that serves as both storage for instructions and state information, but two pages.  You'll have to make good use of recursive state-based programming techniques to get stuff done.Personally, I find additional enjoyment in coming up with the most optimised solutions as well, in either time taken or number of instructions used, to beat the curve shown for all users~			",195,120,2,11,30,2,17

												SpaceChem is a masterpiece. The challenge here is to create specific chemical compounds by rearranging the atomic structure of the given compound(s) and delivering them to the destination through a pipes. You accomplish this using a series of reactors which can add, remove or re-arrange the atoms of a compound: each of these is a puzzle in and of itself. Deciding how many and which type of reactor to use in each level provides a sort of macro puzzle. Many levels limit the type and/or number or reactors available, providing variety in addition to aesthetic and compound differences. You can save and load reactor layouts, allowing you to use them in different levels.Each level is so brilliantly complex in that you are not only trying to construct the most efficient way to modify the compounds within each reactor, you must also consider the overall purpose of each reactor in sequence: given that most compounds require several different reactors to change them into the desired result. Additionally (yes, there is more: bear with me, it will be worth it!), each level must be completed within a certain time frame or 'cycles'. Transporting each compound from the start to the destination takes time, as does modifying them through each reactor. If not designed efficiently, you may end up with bottlenecks in your chain of reactors, leading to the overall level time being too slow. This is usually fixed through some minor tweaking and provides another level of strategic planning to the each levels.I found the muisic to be quite enjoyable and the astheic both functional and pleasing to look at. There is an overacrching story, which is told between levels. It is very well written, and quite interesting. I fear however, that I will never see the end of the story, due to my own incompetence and to the sheer complexity and intricacy of the puzzles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It almost reminds me of those exercises where your partner is blind-folded in an obstacle course and relies on your instructions to manoeuvre through it and manipulate objects, only instead, your telling a teeny-tiny machine what to do with atoms.

												Intended to be a brain-wrecker, this game is extremely challenging with it's way of testing the player's logic and planning capabilities. Time simply flies by as you get immersed in the puzzles that it throws at you. It gets you thinking about where to place certain pieces, how to sync certain modules, and what you need to do to get the system up and running. Has an intriguing storyline, with a mysterious aura surrounding the plot behind the game. Nothing too major to keep your mind off the puzzle process.Intelligent use of chemistry and the elements from the periodic table. Makes you feel like a top-notch chemist working out atomic processing or something. Would recommend this game only if you're a logic-oriented person, else this might be a waste of money.ps.

												I am not quite sure what I expected when I started up SpaceChem the first time. Perhaps ""High School Chemistry: Puzzle Game Edition."" If that had been the case, I probably wouldn't have complained. What I got, though, was something rather different and much more impressive. At its core, SpaceChem is a process engineering simulator. It has a very smooth learning curve, and gives players plenty of time to ease into the systems and mechanics. But the really interesting part isn't simply managing to ""complete"" one puzzle to the next, but how well you can complete each puzzle. There are multiple factors which are measured at the end of each level, which means that optimization is almost never a one-way road. You're balancing your emphasis on the time it takes to finish, the number of reactors you're using, and how complex the instructions within each reactor are. Of course, you could always take the lazy way and just try to get through each puzzle as fast as you can to see what's next, leaving optimization as something to look at in the distant future.Why the interest in progression, though? Because SpaceChem actually has a good story. It's told largely through pure text logs at the start of every several levels, but it does an outstanding job of linking the player to the protagonist. You're not sitting at your computer or laptop solving some random puzzles, you're a chemical engineer working on complex problems with often less than adequate equipment and dire situations in the way of getting the job done. The way this is extended further to using your knowledge of the engineering processes to solve non-manufacturing problems is absolutely brilliant, and a fantastic example of telling a story through game mechanics.As fair warning, though, even without working toward optimization, the game becomes quite challenging in the later parts. People looking for more casual puzzle games may want to think twice before diving into this one if they're planning to work through to the end.			",183,119,1,63,21,1,19

												This is a fun, challenging puzzle game with a nice story within it. I find the story to actually be quite dramatic, and if you understand some of the basics of the science for this game, it's easy to have a good time. If not, it's a fun challenge! Also, if you absolutely cannot figure out what to do, the developers have a wiki to help. The game is a great experience though, and is worth the buy. Good game, I say.			",125,19,5,10,14,4,4

												This game may seem stupid, useless and confusing.It is not. Once you get the hang on the logic of this game, you wont be able to stop playing.Reaction after reaction, bond after bond, you will need all of your patience and alternative thinking to keep up with this game requests.Oh, and do not worry about finishing the game and having no more puzzles to solve. It won't happen.After all this time i passed on SpaceChem and SpaceChem Mobile (Android version, available on the Play Store) i still have 3 entire planets to complete...Also, Research.net releases featured puzzles that you can download and play, and gives you the ability to create your own productions and researches, export them, and import other players work.Reactors have a lot of options in them... varying from normal bonders, to sensors, and even quantum tunnels.Pipelines will mess with your mind, forcing you to find the correct output for the perfect input.Defence missions will test your reflexes and make you give all you have, because if you fail you literally see the planet exploding.The Story (Yes, there is a story!) is complex, relatively long, and i still haven't finished it, because you will unlock it while you play. But it will make you understand a lot of things, so i reccomend spending like 10 mins reading at least the start of it.Optional assignements for Archievents are available to make you you never run out of things to try, and Efficiency Archievements will make sure you will always try to improve yourself.Scoreboards after each puzzle will make you able to see how well and efficiently you programmed your reactor, or pipeline ^^In the end, a great game for the ones that feel like they want to test themselves, but at the same time do not want that test to be boring and repetitive. Every level is different, every reaction has its limits, and it's up to you survive in the universe of SpaceChem.-Cocaine			",112,10,5,12,7,0,8

												While building state machines is fun, I feel like this game could have some valuable lessons to teach in the realm of multi-threaded programming for those trying to optimize for the minimum number of cycles per level.Many of the puzzles are devilishly clever and the way the game presents itself it is very well done.  The UI is clear, it allows for player documentation of your state machines, and tries to give you the tools to come up with the best solution possible.  This is one of those games where the leaderboards matter and trying to eek out that little bit of optimization to get the fastest machine of your friends is something I spent a lot of time doing, even after ""solving"" the problem.

												Oh my, what a game... I DO recommend.Ok, it is more a puzzle than a game. Like abstract games are a specific category for boardgames, you know? In the end, a bit like Myst games are into videogaming. I love Myst, by the way. So be careful, and don't expect crazy HUD, action and all. It is a Puzzle.But my... great music (although not enough variety), nice drawings (outer maps), hard boss, very, very easy to learn (tutorial a tad confusing, though), but MAN very, very HARD to progress! The curve is not straight, I'm telling you. I finished the five or six first worlds (planets), and damn have I been stuck for MONTHS! But I'll play that game anytime if I have new ideas (I refuse to look at the walkthroughs or clues).Great, great, great, game.			",458,114,10,98,24,4,73

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine SpaceChem... is... WOW! This game blew me away the first time I booted up with the first tutorial and the Physics and Chemistry we all know (and love, if you love Physics and Chemistry), the game is based in space where you create atoms and bond them, then later on you have to bond even more with the reactors and more stuff coming my way as the game unlocks even more surprises.The first time I got this game with the PCGamer/BundleStars giveaway (June 2014), I felt that this game was rubbish, the first time I looked at it. BUT this game proved me wrong, and I feel guilty for calling this game rubbish because it is not!BUT BE WARNED! Don't buy/get this game if you don't like Physics/Chemistry, or very challenging puzzles as the game does focus around atoms and the bonding of atoms and all the substances from the Periodic Table etc... so if you don't like those types of games that have science in it, don't buy this game. PLUS, the puzzles are quite challenging, each puzzle from where I am which is still in the tutorial stage (Surprisingly this game is really long) are quite challenging, the puzzle length (from my end) take around 15-20 minutes each, so they are quite challenging... So if you don't like challenging puzzles such as this game, don't buy it!The length... this game is REALLY long! REALLY REALLY long! Almost 44-55 hours to finish the game, as far as I know the first few planets are just some tutorial stages!!! Which comes to show how long this game and the dedication the people had in developing this game, which is great and shows in this game! Normally I don't play long games, but I am happy enough with this game, and I'll try and finish this game (maybe in 6 years time)Overall, this game is very different from your regular indie game, with Physics/Chemistry integration with its challenging puzzles and a nice and strange Sci-Fi story, this game is a TRUE indie gem, that should not be missed at all! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hello,Firstly, SpaceChem is definetely worth the price.  Although you should watch the trailers, or try the Demo.  If you like the trailer, you will probably like SpaceChem, if you enjoyed the Demo, you will nearly guaranteed like the full version.  As of this review I have not attempted the level editor, or made it past the third planet.  The gameplay itself is very difficult after the first 10 levels or so, thus you will most likely be spending a lot of time on this game.  I would like to mention that you should not think ""Oh it has ""chem"" in it, I don't like science so I don't want to do it.""  It does have atoms and molecules as its base, but you are not doing real chemistry, so don't let that scare you off.  I previously had problems running it on Windows 8.1, but it turned out to be the game files problem.  That leads me on to the support part of the review.  I found zachtronic's website, and emailed their support about SpaceChem.  It did not take long for them to respond and fix it, so 5 stars for their support!  The only thing this game lacks is a reset button, or maybe I'm missing something.  Anyway, I highly recommend this game if you like puzzles of this sort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a fun game for programmers. It's like trying to master a multi-threaded Turing machine simulation or something. I really enjoy the challenge of creating solutions and then optimizing them.Nothing like watching a well designed reactor shuttle molecules around, turn them, bring them together just in time  and the have them carried off somewhere else. Often you make something that works and you have no idea why it works or how you did it. But then you have to go back in and tweak it. Yup, this is exactly what programming is like.My only complaint are the defense missions which often require too much player input - one can't just leave the production line running - and trial and error poking around.

												SpaceChem is an absolutely brilliant chemistry-themed problem solving game. You do not need to know any chemistry to play the game (I finished the game without even understanding periodic table). But you do need to have 'programmer/engineer mindset' such as strong logic, systemic thinking and also spatial thinking.You play as a nameless engineer whose job is to design reactors to turn some molecules into other molecules. Each reactor has two worker circle called waldo. These waldos will travel in certain direction until it got redirected by arrows/symbols, activating anything it passes by, You will then have to place these arrows and symbols in such a way that your waldo will pass an input symbol, perform modifications (such as bonding, debonding, rotating, etc.) to those molecules and then moving the molecules to the output before going back to repeat those actions for the next input until you fulfill your quota.The game has a steady difficulty curve. Each planet starts off with easy levels that teaches you new concepts (such as multiple reactors, sensor & random inputs, fusion, etc.) and ends with a difficult bossfight that tests what you just learned. The game grades you by showing histogram of your speed, symbol count and reactor count compared to other players, giving the incentive to optimize your solution. There are also some optional levels sprinkled around the main campaign and some custom levels placed on research.net that will give you challenges should you want it. You can also create and share custom levels from the editor included in research.net or create some amazing structures in sandbox mode.So for the price it is a must buy if you like problem solving.

												A fantastic puzzle game.  While you are taught the basic game mechanics, you will be thrown into a challenge early on.  Unlike most games where the answer is spoon fed to you if it's not blatantly obvious, you will be required to sit down and actually plan.  Once you get the answer though, it's extremely satisfying to watch your invention work.Definitely recommend this game.  At least check out the demo and see if it's for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SpaceChem basically makes a game out of graphical programming. If you've ever used LabView, you'll be at home here, and if you enjoyed programming with LabView, you'll enjoy this game. SpaceChem also has a lot in common with The Incredible Machine and other similar games.I'm having a lot of fun with SpaceChem, everything is very logical and it's very rewarding to beat each level. It's probably not for everyone, but I think anyone who is at all intrigued by the game should at least try the demo.			",290,123,4,48,15,3,42

												If you thought Portal 2 had challenging puzzles, or if you get scared at the thought of Tetris, then by all means, stay clear of Spacechem. On the other hand, if you love the afforementioned titles, then by all means, do indulge in a puzzlegame based on pure logic and exact science. Incredibly deep and massively engaging, Spacechem's systems and background mechanics will make your brain work like a well oiled V12 engine. In spacechem you have to program a nuclear reactor and assemble, or crack atoms. And that is just the entry level, when you get to einstein level, you have combine your atoms with more atoms, think about bindings, and load them into freighters. While making one compound is a walk in the proverbial park. You have to make make a pattern that is infintely repeatable...on all levels. Making that walk in the park a bloody streetfight in a volcano...in space.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												Make no mistake, this is one hardcore puzzle game. It's probably the closest I've ever seen in a game to actual programming. Maybe that's because you are programming robots with a simple set of instructions: turn, grab, drop, input, output and more.Still, I'm enjoying the puzzles and taking a certain amount of satisfaction in elegant solutions.

												A stunning puzzle game with an elegance that I have never seen.  The many approaches to any given puzzle allow great flexibility in your solutions. Due to this excellent design you can hone the efficiency of your production line and see how you compare to others or just solve the puzzles.   The idea is remarkable, the design excellent, the interface minimilist and efficient.  The addition of level designers and more in the most recent patch rounds out what was already one of the true indie moments of genius in 2010.The fact that it's based on chemistry brings out my love of chemistry that never died with my departure from the world of laboratories and white coats... no not that kind.

												Spacechem is less about chemistry and more a programming-puzzle game - You leave signposts on a grid, directing two grabby-thingies and several molecular bonding things to assemble and reassemble molecules.The difficulty curve is a little steep after the first few chapters: it starts you off with making O2 from oxygen, or H2 and O2 from H2O. Eventually, the puzzles become a lot more complex - the one that sticks out in my mind is a boss battle where you are given an infinite supply of water and told to make rocket fuel and plutonium. A later one that has you manufacturing ruby crystals (or a molecule I'm told is supposed to be one) for a laser.That said, it's really rewarding to manage something so complex. -- tl;dr: Puzzles that are hard but not impossibly so. No chem-classes required, but being able to think like a programmer might help.			",716,143,4,116,76,5,92

												TL;DR: Don't buy it if you often say ""too long, didn't read.""This is an amazing game, but it is designed for people who like to think, seek intellectual challenge in a game, or both. If you didn't understand what that sentence meant, or if it just doesn't apply to you, then SpaceChem is not for you. Don't buy it exclusively for the TF2 items, or you'll have wasted your money by not being able to get them-- the last puzzle is a bit confusing.Nevertheless, if you think you can handle a series of thinking puzzles, go buy it now. There's an interesting story to be had here, plus the music makes you feel like an scientific badass as you work on the problems.Also, did I mention Robin Walker thinks it's the greatest game ever?http://steamcommunity.com/id/robinwalker/recommended/ ",95,29,0,2,7,0,14

The perfect game for programmers and engineers (anyone who loves to tinker.)My one gripe is that the progress is linear so if you get stuck on a really tricky puzzle you can almost never skip it and try again later. Yes you can easily go on youtube and find solutions to any puzzle that's stumping you, but its annoying having to resort to such measures.			",272,58,0,13,21,2,32

												An absolutely gorgeous puzzle game. Not so much about chemistry, as you essentially have to make assembly lines for atoms which can be split and fused at will, it is nevertheless interesting when you get to make Uranium out of water for a nuclear warhead to send agaisnt an attacking monster. The music is lovely, the animations in the reactors a joy to watch as they busily work for you, and there are sooo many levels and extra challenges you get hours upon hours upon hours of fun (and some of the later levels are real doozies that will give you quite the feelign of accomplishment when you finally crack them).Wholeheartedly recommended as a great chillout brain teasing game.

												Let's be honest, we all love Lego. Creating things from nothing, being proud of how it works is amazing. K'Nex too~ SpaceChem is the equivalent of combining the two, with some mediocre Chemistry 101. It's not the simplest of games, the learning curve is very steep from the get-go, but once you have it (and you will understand it, trust me) then the possibilities open up. You essentially take one element or molecule, process it, and dump it - rinse, repeat. However there's many challenges, multiple ways to do each challenge and even an online mode you can submit challenges to others! A great, complex, mechanical-inspired, chemistry-laced treat hidden amongst thousands of other indie games.  ",113,21,6,21,13,0,21

												This game is EPIC. The challenge is to program reactors with a series of tracks and commands that will produce a specific molecular result. It's far more complicated then it sounds and you have to think on many levels and try to perform the tasks efficiently and in a multitasking manner with the waldos (grabber/activators) that reside in each reactor. One reactor is hard enough, but try stringing together several and producing 2 or more different results to send to different freighters. This is definetly a programmer's game as the system seems remeniscent of a programmable processor that manipulates data and seperates the results to specific outputs. An instant favorite of mine, I'll never tire of looking for the most efficient and effective way to produce the desired output.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												A puzzle game about chemistry but that aspect really only serves as a stylistic vehicle because the problem solving is essentially mechanical engineering. Grabbing, moving, dropping, rotating, bonding, fusing, but instead of applying those actions to tenable objects, it uses atoms and molecules, perfectly fitting the abstract environment.Conceptually it's a brilliant game and same goes for its execution and the challenges it provides.A puzzle game succeeds when it's able to make the player feel smart and Spacechem excels here.

												Not only is this puzzler one of the finest around, but learning comes hand in hand with fun in this. Not forcefully either. Mind bending at times, but you feel so satisfied afterwards, partly because of the real world knowledge you take away from it.			",182,44,1,17,11,1,34
