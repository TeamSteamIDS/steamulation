												Chalk another one up for the simulators this one has you piloting the MIG-29 Fulcrum. You're not missing anything if you choose not to play this one, but if you do than this is a great game to get into.			",139,3,0,15,11,0,33

												This game is very easy. Most of enemy planes were based on the remote airfield. So the player just need to fly there and destroy them on the runway before they could take off.			",60,13,0,15,23,0,8

												The thing is...this is an older game. It runs fine on win8.1 64bitSure the graphics are dated but not bad at all for a game of this age.Gameplay is kind of drawn out but you can use time compression toget where you want to be. Hitting the ?/ key displays onscreen key assignments.Got it on sale today for $3.39 and it is worth every penny of that. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like most Novalogic flight sims. Brillaint and underated. If your into jet fighter sims, get it!Always Loved Novalogics fighter games. It does seem a shame that games like this are not being made anymore. The worst example is as a Star Wars fan I loved the X-Wing series, XWA was made over a decade ago now and no signs of another fighter sim to come. Seems the same with novalogic and jet fighter games too :(			",127,29,30,7,28,0,22

												Definitely recommend this game even though you will only get software rendering out of it since it depends on Glide drivers. Keep in mind this game is from 1998, yet I can't really find a game today (other than IL-2 with mods) that comes close to the depth of this game.			",119,6,1,4,11,2,20

												TL;DR: There is no difficulty level and it's difficult.Main reviewExcellent simulation; flies really smooth with keyboard as long as you don't use yaw function too often. All Novalogic flight sims are excellent. Still, there are a lot of keys to remember in order to master this. However you can get by using only the suggested keys in the tutorials. Not too complex as Falcon 4.0 or Janes F-15 in which both require the use of a joystick. I hate games that forces players to fork out additional money to use specialized hardware. I don't have time, nor money nor space for that so i KIV till last. I believe there's nothing those games can offer in which other games can do just as well with keyboard and mouse.Graphics still hold-up to this day but only support up to 1024 x 768 resolution. Tutorials are well made with excellent voice-overs; choice of English or Russian radio chatter. Aircrafts look good and sound realistic. Plenty of camera controls and views to keep an eye on what's around you.Definitely a flight simulation but intermediate level, not arcade like the recent Jane's Advance Strike Fighters or HAWX or HAWX2 with their ridiculous weapons loadout and many other gameplay methods that cater only for fun and not realism. If i just want fun, there's tons of space combat with spinning balls in space. Correction: My bad. There's also a similar option here; it's called double loadout. That means that the Mig-29 can load twice as many weapons without any weight penalty. So that's like arcade or essentially cheating. Normally it can carry a pair on each pylon set, with double you can load 4 of each type of ordnanceGameplay is similarly excellent because there are many tactical commands you can issue to your wingman. Here you need to learn to land not just shoot; an ace who can't land is just a joker right? Correction again My bad. Landing is optional for most missions. This applies to both Quick Missions and Campaign mode but if you opt to land, you get a higher score which carries over to the next mission and gets you faster promotion. I'm not sure if the landing score applies to Quick Missions and Multiplayer mode though. So far it doesn't seem to add to the score in Quick Missions. Update Jan 8, 2017 0329hrs - About landingThe manual states that landing in Quick Missions can get your plane rearmed and repaired but in Campaign mode only rearmed. Well that was obviously outdated. Your plane gets instant repairs in Campaign mode too. A bit of cheating yes? Wait Wut? Manual? lemme see that. Hahaha some peeps just can't be bothered it seems.end of updateNot sure which sim came out first but of the 3 fixed-wing crafts in Machines of War, this one is based more on analog instruments, very retro, so i think i should complete this campaign first. Definitely a keeper since there aren't many new modern military sims in the market. If you're even slightly serious about flying, you should give it a shot. Highly recommended 8/10.

			Quick Mission - The first few missions are tutorials. There's also the campaign mode. I will probably upload more of these in my Dailymotion channel when i do the campaign.		

Update 2 Jan 9 2017 0014hrsFinal mission of campaign 1. There are more campaigns but it has to be completed in sequence.

			Campaign 1 Mission 8 (final for this campaign). It's hard to get close to enemy fighters without getting shot down by missiles. Incoming missiles are hard to spot and they are very fast.

												A great classical game! Nostalgic! This is part of the first games I played. And the first games I played are simulations. This belonged to the pack Flight Mania. Great flight simulation games. Memories! All flight simulation games may be hard to play but they are fun! You fly, you shoot down enemies, you land, so cool! Sigh, the good old days. 10/10. If I can get all these games back, then it'll be awesome!			",156,6,3,3,12,1,19
