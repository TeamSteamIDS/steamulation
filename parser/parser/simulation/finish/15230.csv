												Same problem like the first iteration, ""Blazing Angels Squadrons of WWII"", this game simply will not work on other Operating System except Windows XP!Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII supports WINDOWS XP ONLY. I'm on Windows 8.1 Pro x64, tried to run the game normally -the option window opens up but tells me out-of-date graphics drivers- and can't recognize the running Windows. I tried to run the game in the Compatibility Mode (Windows XP SP2, SP3, Win Vista, Win 7) and still won't start. Maybe it could run on ""Windows XP Mode"" or in some Virtual Machine but at this now, there's no point in fiddling around trying to make this ""OUT OF DATE"" game run.OVERALL:DON'T BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM IF YOU DON'T HAVE WINDOWS XP!!!!RECOMMENDATION:NONE! DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE WINDOWS XP... until if someday, this game get's updated for modern Windows then maybe it could be worth a shot but as of now, stay away from this game.RATING:0.0 / 10			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

												A decent game that is hampered by its indecision on what arcadey flight game it wants to be. It has elements of Rogue Squadron and Ace Combat, but mixed in a way that is unwieldy and slightly worse than either on their own. Almost every single mission has some sort of gimmick requiring a certain plane or tactic, such as one mission requiring you to fly a divebomber that doesn't have any guns. Basically it has loads of unique setpieces, which can be fun, but usually aren't that interesting the second time around. The game is at its best when it has large airbattles and dogfights which allow the player to choose any plane and weapon loadout. Unfortunately there are only two or three such missions.Unlike the first game, Blazing Angels 2 tries to have a storyline, which is told through filtered photos with speech bubbles like Max Payne. Most of it is really campy and not intended to be taken seriously, so it is hard to hate.Overall a fun distraction, but lacking in replayability.			",195,20,5,14,22,0,28

												Perhaps it's just me, but I found that this game is becoming increasingly more difficult and I can't find the fun of playing it until the end. Luckily, I've got the cheat for this game so that I can at least go through the levels more easily (though it's still difficult indeed).The control of this game is uncomfortable for me, and what makes it even more uncomfortable is that I need to map the control manually to my XBOX 360 controller, which is a great deal of stress for me.The graphics is, I can say honestly, just average. Not too good, and not too bad. But, I like the sound in this game. I really like the main background music.I also heard that it is only available on XP. Well, luckily again, I still have Windows XP on my hand, so I can play this game without any problem. I haven't tried playing it on another OS, though.Overall, this game can potentially become a fun experience, but the uncomfortable control and hard missions are a real turn down.I can only recommend this game if you have Windows XP, and are an avid fan of this type of game. It's worth to include to your collection. But, for those who want real experience on this type of flight combat game, I suggest that you look for better games in the same genre.My overall score: 6 out of 10.			",23,3,4,6,0,0,1

												In my case, this game won't work on Windows 8.1. So any WIN8.1 user should think twice before buying it.Even if launched successfully, it is very hard to play without a control pad. Mouse control is very weird, and overall control is sluggish.If you wanna play this game, find a local arcade. Maybe there is one. That would give you a much better gaming experience.

												I don't know why people say this game will NOT work on windows 7 when I played and finished the game on my Desktop running windows 7 Ultimate without any problems. Now that I have Windows 10 I'm not sure if it will work now but like I said I finished the game so no need to install it again to find out.

												It's amazing how only one year elapsed between Blazing Angels, and Blazing Angels 2, yet how different the game feels despite based on the same engine. More exotic planes including rocket planes and jets, a bit of sci-fi bent to the WW2 ""alternate"" history, and a more coherent storyline, plus animated story panels involving special operations, beautiful spy, and an evil Nazi General, makes for a much better game over all. The game basically is pretty much the same as its predecessor... It's an arcade turn-and-burn WW2 flight combat game with a bit of squadron command (you can issue commands to your up to 3 wingmen, generic ones like ""attack at will"" or ""defend me"" along with 2 special orders: berserk, and taunt them away from me. However, this time, there's a bit of a story line... You are a special guy tasked with finding 3 other misfits for your ultra secret special squadron, flying even captured enemy planes if needed. As you fly around the world combating one threat after another, you get to do some really fancy stuff... Like fly slow enough so your ""passenger"" can jump onto a moving train... or fly through tunnels to bust tesla generators, to intercept V2 rockets launched all over the place, to taking out enemy air patrol... without raising suspicions by doing it outside view of local air defense nets. There's even shooting parachutes, directing Katyusha rocket fire, canyon buzzing (don't fly above level X or you're toast). Most planes are your typical WW2 planes. All the classics are here: Hurricane, Spitfire, Beaufighter, Tempest, Mosquito, BF-109, Bf-110, Stuka, Zero, Val, Kate, but there are also more exotic ones like Swordfish, Barracuda, the push-pull Do 335, the twin-engine He-219, Japanese Shinden, and Russian planes beyond the Il-2, such as Yak-15, La-7, Pe-2 as well as jets and rocket planes from Germany, England, and Russia, including the Meteor, Me 262, Me-163 Komet, Go-229, and so on.  The game gives each plane up to three weapons: the primary weapon, probably a machine gun, unlimited ammo, but subject to heat restrictions, a heavy weapon (could be seeking missiles, rockets, bombs, or heavy cannon) with limited ammo, and finally, rear defense weapon with both ammo and a long cooldown period (about 15 seconds) after each use. Here's when the game starts going into sci-fi territory, in that some planes have added a ""rear defense"" weapon... There's the ""flasher"", a set of rear-facing flashbulbs that will blind pilots behind you, at least for a short while. Others would have a ""tesla coil"", a flash of lightning disabling all planes within a certain radius (affected planes will not be controllable for X seconds), as well as defense fog (a stream of ""smoke"" disables engines of someone who ran into it for X seconds). Both heavy weapon and defense weapon ammo can be ""recharged"" by shooting down or destroying special ""ammo"" enemies (designated with a ""bullets"" logo on radar and in the HUD). The game also gives a bit of RPG feel (but again, ahistorical) by give you options to upgrade whatever plane you fly (even if you never flew it before, or that it belonged to some other air force, such as Russians) with ares such as ""improved sights"", ""hypergolic fuel"" (missiles and torpedoes move faster), ""proximity fuse"" (easier to kill targets), ""armor piercing bullets"" (for killing tanks), and so on. You earn ""points"" per mission by accomplishing objectives and killing enemy units. On simpler missions you get 3000 points, but on really tough and long missions you can score more than 10000 points per mission. On the other hand, cheapest upgrade is 2000, so you'll have to do very well to get enough points to buy every upgrade. The missions are much better designed, with less boring parts. You get to play with all sorts fighters and bombers to jets to rocket planes. A few missions in fact, ask you to land, then once you did so switch to a different plane to continue fighting. The overall plot is your special squadron was called upon to deliver a spy into occupied France... by dropping her ONTO a train (with some fancy flying by you). Then you get to fly to Africa and engage the Nazi colonel there in charge of ""special projects"" there. Which lead all the back to France... where the spy, Marguerite, is in pursuit, but she needs to steal some documents BEFORE she leaves. As you keep discovering various special projects by General Von Kluge, with help of Marguerite and the allied commandos, you find Nazi special projects all around the world... A hidden base hidden in China with help of the Japanese, a ground based tesla tower that is capable of destroying dozens of planes at a time, a secret base in the Alps, a plan to hit San Francisco with missiles and kamikazes... You and Von Kluge became arch-nemesis of each other. It's cheap, but it works.  Each mission, while filled with lots of enemies to kill, also has sections that are at least somewhat creative. Escorting a train out of Austria is interesting, as you need to clear its path of enemies, while under attack by both AA and enemy planes. There are two missions where you get to take down a zepplin by taking out its outside turrets then try to hit its soft underbelly, for example. After you played through a mission you can replay it flying a different plane, or perhaps even different weapons, as you unlock more paintjobs and planes. The voice talent this time is good, except for Von Kluge who sounds American, rather than German. The sound effects are quite good in general. Music is a big overwhelming at times, and repetitive at others. There's nothing really really new in Blazing Angels 2, but Ubisoft learned a lot from their previous release. Now you can man the controls properly, though I would have preferred a more visual map then just a list of commands and corresponding controls, and the plot now at least makes some sense for the squadron to be jumping around the world, always one special mission after another. The planes also gets more scifi to make Multiplayer balancing easier. The missions are also more varied, and while some of the missions get a bit difficult, I can attest that so far all missions CAN be won. It's just a much better package overall.

												gg @ 2nd mission. Playing this on Win 7. Works perfectly fine. Pro: as of 2007, everything looks fancy. As of 2016, brings me back memories of Lucas Arts' Secret Mission over Normandy. Con: as of 2016, which is almost 10 years later. none. 1. You cannot edit controls. 2. Some controls (i.e. Mouse control) don't work at all. If it doesn't work, why do you even include in tip?3. Ubisoft sucks (playing other old games such as Prince of Persia which has similar control issue). Most of Ubisoft games are based on console controls. If you have console controller such as xbox, it should work. 4. Mission 2, train hitbox is so small that you have to fly low, slowly (yet still faster than train because, it's a plane), and right above the train. If you are off the train by 1 inch, the mission resets. This train hitbox is seriously a pain so if you are looking for some easy action WW2 game, stay away from this. If you are good with console controllers, do grab this game. Otherwise, play War Thunder.  ",153,32,1,25,18,0,38

												I have Windows 7, and Blazing Angels runs perfectly. I have not experienced the problems everyone else has seemed to have with this game and Windows.I thoroughly enjoyed Blazing Angels on PS3, and I have been able to play it as if it were on PS3 with my Windows 7 PC and PS3 controller.This game has unique story telling, much like a comic. Multitude of upgrades for your planes and squad, which you will most likely fully acquire a couple missions before the final mission. Easy gamplay mechanics; it has a simulator setting in the controls as well for those who like that, versus arcade. There is some amount of replayability, certainly more for anyone that plays multiplayer.Great to buy on sale.			",55,1,5,1,4,0,3

												An old game I used to have on the 360 (yes, crucify me for playing a game on the 360). And this game was pretty fun.  The Graphics weren't too bad, a tad bit generic, but nice. The scenery and small details were rendered beautifuly. The story: not too shabby. A bit cliched here and there, but nothing to really rave over, but nothing that's cringeworthy either. The music was heroic and fit the events occuring around you quite well and was quite enjoyable. The Menu theme and end overture are my favorites. Now what you've been waiting for, the gameplay. While it is sad that there is no controller support, the controls for the keyboard are intuitive, but are a bit tricky to get yourelf adjusted to when you first start playing. The tutorial is nice and unlike most other games, is not shoehorned in. The difficulty curve is nice and balanced. The spikes in difficulty, if any, are far, few between, and are negligable. A very enjoyable WWII Dogfighting game indeed. I recommend you pick it up.			",67,11,8,6,8,2,2

Firstly, there're a lot of crashes, every time I tried to install the game it simply freeze at the "" creating local cash files "" then gave me this  message ""connection timed out "" there was no thing wrong with my connection, I've tried 2 other games and it worked properly, it took me like 3 hours until finally I was able to install it!!! I don't even know what was wrong with it Secondly, about the crashes you will encounter a lot of them during playing the game, it will take you like a day just to know how to apply your xbox or joystick configurations Finally, till this moment I don't know how to play the multi-player mode, there's no  simple or easy way to figure out how to play it, every time I insert the cd key that is required to play the multi player mode it simply tells you "" the key u entered is invalid"" I'm really disillusioned with this game. I was dying for it and I couldn't wait to install it but It seems that this game doesn't even worth to be played for free			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
