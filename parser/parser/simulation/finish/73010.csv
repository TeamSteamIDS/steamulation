												If you've ever been annoyed at public transport, here's one for you. See if you can do better.Cities in motion is a simulator game where you can be the one to work out the public transport of a city. Sounds easy enough, just some bus lines here and there. A tram line on this road here, and everything is connected.And then you give it a while, and there's 8 busses waiting for that one bus stop with a waiting line of 250 people. Clearly you didn't think that one through. But that's okay, where a normal job as public transport planner would have you fired for that, here you can try again or fix it somehow. So then you can add subway stations, boats, and helicopters, and before you know it you're covering the city and hours passed.The interface and controls are easy to learn(If a little odd at times), and the game mechanics are easy enough as well. However, mastering the game mechanics and planning out the city public transport is much harder. You'll have to go through several attempts to figure out what goes wrong and how to fix it, and you may want to take a look at the actual public transport system in your city for ideas.Edit: Also, it has some inaccuracies. Amsterdam does not look anything like that. And you can just build a subway tunnel under the Berlin wall. Replacing old vehicles is a pain too. As for the technical details, it's surprisingly good. Every citizen appears to be modeled*(*I didn't count them. at least a large enough amount of them to make the cities feel alive), and you can follow them through their morning commute, shopping trips, and visits to others. And this is all supported by the game mechanics, you can set a citizen as interesting person, and the game will show you a portrait of him where he goes. (Warning: Long) In my latest case, I looked at a factory in Vienna, and found a red car driving from the top of a parking garage(Mentally following it through the roof as it drove down) next to it down to the ground floor and onto the streets. So I asked, why is this person not using the public transport system to work and back? Wilhelm Klein, factory supervisor - Drives by car from his home, connected to the public transport, to work, also connected to the public transport system. He then went shopping at a big department store, which too was connected by public transport.After that, he went to a church far outside of Vienna, in a smaller village where I did not yet expand to. He then returned home.I didn't have the money, but I figured I'd have to connect that place somehow when I did get money. So I went on to look around town, just watching people board the bus and go around. After a while, Wilhelm was moving again. Another day at work. This time, he wandered to the tram stop down the street and was quickly picked up by one of the passing trams. He then got out at a connection to the subway, but instead took the bus at that same subway station, and rode it all the way down to work.A while after, he boarded the bus again and I watched him go back to the tram station for what I assumed to be the way home. But not this time. This time he went into the subway, so I look at his info screen and see his destination is a ministry building near the town center and then back home with a direct tram line. I connect the extra village with a busline, and I speed up time a bit.When I check back on Wilhelm, he has a new job. He is hired as secretary in the ministry building he went to way back then. Perhaps he couldn't handle his supervisor job at the factory, or perhaps he never really wanted it in the first place.But either way, Wilhelm is happy now, and he can go with a direct tram line from his home to his work, and from there, anywhere in Vienna he wants.Mission succesfull, the citizens of Vienna can stay in motion			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												It was for me great fun to play this game in the begin - However there is a super enoying bug that will happen eventually in any city with metro trains and renders the whole system unplayable.Usually in the late stage of the game there will be always an important metro station where trains rediculously will just not leave before they are completely full (which takes very long because they are waiting very long for single people who are just entering the station)!!! This causes heavy jams in front of the stations where trains que up infinetly. People on subsequent stops can hardly enter the train thus get angry. Also you can not add more trains to the line because they will only add to the que in front of this one faulty stationThis is messing with the whole (!) metro nework and there is absolutly nothing what you can do about it ...The bug is known but the developers sadly don't care about it.Also beware of high CPU Loads and memory leaks. After some time the Game will slow down as hell.The missions are mostly funny, but instead of encouraging and guide you to build a reasonable network, it rather forces you to build non-profitable lines.There is in general not much assistance or feedback to understand why your system is working or not as well as the statistics are not so useful.The mod system is great - very active community.bottom line: In the beginn it's a good fun to play this game but it lacks long term motivation because of enoying bugs and lack of reasonable feedback.PS: The screenshots are very misleading about the actual gameplay! Please use google picture search or steam community tab if you want to get a real impression of the game interface.			",532,186,18,80,62,5,125

												Initially, this game was right up my alley.  I am a huge tycoon / sim junkie and I was able to grasp the basics right off the bat.However, the main issue I have is the sim engine itself is incredibly difficult to work with.  To make money, you need to move passengers from point A to B.  Optimum lines for doing such tend to be a little too popular and in order to keep up with the demand, you need to add more vehicles.  More vehicles clog up the roadways (which don't seem to thin out no matter how many people you have using the public system in the first place), which deceases your efficiency even more.  In the midst of this entire mess, you have to constantly babysit your wages and ticket prices as the in-game economy fluctuates.  Too high, and your already angry customer base will ignore you completely, leaving you with no income.  Too low, and your lines get flooded, which then turns into a rinse and repeat of the first problem.I managed to successfully beat the first scenario after a countless number of restarts, and I am still hung up on the second after 22 hours of play.  In the end, you always end up broke and PO'd unless you did things 100% the way the designers intended.  Deviate just a little, and you're toast.In the end, CiM is just a puzzler pretending to be a sim.  Avoid unless you have the Buddha's patience.			",130,44,0,39,82,0,54

												Paradox were kind enough to gift me this game on their previously owned Gamersgate service for taking part in a survey. I later picked it up in a bundle, so excuse my modest playtime.The very first transport tycoon game I've ever played, and might as well be the best one. I love all the different eras, the cities, the music...It's relaxing to watch, challenging to succeed and even tense If you're like me and think along the lines of ""go big, or go home!"" as that is exactly how imminent bankruptcy SHOULD make you feel. I particularly love the high metros, like the ones in Chicago or New York.You need a nice CPU though to avoid lag, anything over 3 ghz would be mighty fine I'd wager.Also, avoid the sequel.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that takes a certain kind of player. If you love building and management games than this is a lot of fun. I have played both this and the second Cities in Motions. Both are fun, but in different ways. Cities in Motions 2 offers you a lot more control of how you can lay down your tracks (and roads because the sequel allows you to build your own roads) and now limit you to the four cardinal directions and diagonals. But the cities feel a little bare bones because they just have buildings.In the first Cities in Motions the cities have train stations, ports, airports, and the roads and highways actually go off map instead of a loop leaving you in this mysterious cities that is completely cut off from the outside world...Though Cities in Motion 2 compell you to build depots where you buses, trams, and subways which makes repairs and maintainance much easier on you.While the game play is honetly a little better in the sequel the city feels more alive and real to me in the first game. I actually recommend both, but check out let's plays on youtube to get an idea of them if you want to know what you're getting into.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I spent many MANY hours playing Transport Tycoon, OpenTTD, and both Aerobiz games for the SNES, and this falls into the same vein of transport business simulation. Thankfully, it also lives up to that standard of excellence. It's very easy to grasp some of the core concepts, but it is definitely more difficult to master the game. If you're into business simulations, this is absolutely worth playing.			",83,20,3,18,22,0,31

												Brilliant! I've spent more time on it than steam says (offline play) - a lot of it as well. It's a great transport strategy game. The work of a genius, and can run on my laptop with only 6GB RAM and awful everything else. From that point of view, it's even better than number 2. The campaigns are great fun, and challenging, for example, they ask you to build a tube link...but you only really have enough money for a bus route, so do you save up, or hope the line is a success.Also the ability for custom games, and map creation make this a truly amazing game!

												Cities in Motion is one of those games you just cant help but enjoy playing.  Its got a lot of positives going for it and then.... inevitability the longer you play it, the more frustation creeps in.  In the end it will wave goodbye to all that goodwill that it built up in the many hours of previous play.The game tries to be at its core a simplified mass-transit simulator.   You take control of a company looking to build several transport routes across a number of recreated cities in the hopes of gaining enough money to expand the network and eventually complete a number of mission objectives.  All the while you have to deal with maintaining the infrastructure and vehicles, keeping your public reputation as high as possible and generating a profit to pay your workers.  There are 2 campaigns.  I only completed the first, which consisted of 12 scenarios, each of them stand-a-lone so you are not penalized when you begin the next one.  Objectives come in the form of petitions, which tend number around 12-18 per scenario.  Their content is a variation upon a theme, such as; build x number of lines, build a line from a to b, keep your vehicles maintained above y, transport z passengers, increase or decrease prices, remove n number of stops, stop a line for x weeks, etc.  For the most part these are all fairly easy to carry out and you are only restricted by money, at least at the start.There are five types of transport lines which you can use to carry passengers around the city: bus (road), trams (lines), metro (underground), ferry (water) and heliports (air).  Each has several (around 35) vehicles in total with their own strengths and weakeness such as; carry capacity, reliability, speed, attractiveness, which provide benefits and weaknesses to your strategy.  Add to this the need to tinker with prices as an abstracted economy rises and falls, the ability to finance through bank loans your next big project and you get the picture.  Take all of these ingredients and you get what is a fun, enjoyable and not to difficult game to play.  For the most part the game works.   However... as you play more and more you get to see that the game isnt exactly well designed.  Or built.  You can essentially perform gamey actions to circumvent the restrictions that the developers have in store for you, allowing you to build up cash reserves quickly without any bad effects.  Once youve completed the first few maps there is little to tax anyone looking for something with a harder challenge.   The first campaign maps encompass four cities; Berlin, Amsterdam, Vienna & Helsinki but, once you have figured out the best strategy for each one, you can re-apply the same strategy over and over, despite the different starting circumstances.The biggest let-down has to be the bugged campaign scenario 2 petiton that never triggers.  This means you can never complete the associated achievement, unless you find a user-made editor, that allows you to access the relevant file and edit one word in the code.  One word!!  Thats unforgiveable given that many patches were released for this game and this major fault is still not fixed!  The other major issue (if you are an achievement hunter) is that another achievement requires purchase of 34 base game vehicles.  Of which I have attempted to acquire twice.   The base game even includes more than 34 vehicles.  Unfortunately the counter stops at 15 for me.  I know others have had the same problem.Despite having many, many dlcs, you do not need any of them to get all the achievements.  The fact that the developers (and publisher) do not force you to buy all the extra dlcs they made to get 100% achievements would have otherwise been a great plus for this game.... but alas no..... I highly suspect  that you will need to purchase at least some other dlcs (with extra vehicles in them) to get this ""all vehicles"" achievement.  Its really disappointing... because if not for these core issues I would say that overall Cities in Motion is an above average, if slightly lightweight mass-transit simulator.  One that I would have recommended to those of you interested in the genre or looking for something non-violent.  As it is all that good work was undone on the final straight.* If the developers ever fix these two achievement issue I will happily change this to a YES recommendation.** The Complete Collection achievement can be triggered by downloading a MOD (of all the vehicles reworked)  For some reason in their unpacked form they register.

												It's one thing to build a city, but another thing entirely to manage it. Games like SimCity are high-level simulations that let you build services like trains and bus stops and then forget about them, trusting their operation to whatever imaginary middle-managers you have. Cities in Motion is the game for them, a simulation entirely concerned with developing and managing transit systems. And while that might not sound like the most thrilling thing in the world, it's presented in such a relaxing, charming way that it's hard not to find joy in.Each scenario in Cities in Motion sets you in a fully-realized 3D city, where every building and landmark is named and given uses to the populace. You run a startup transportation company, charged with arranging bus lines, tram routes, subway tunnels, and more to achieve goals and turn a profit. The first part is pretty simple and fun, as you get regular missions to connect different parts of the city in various ways. This can be anything from running trains from downtown to the suburbs, to building a bus stop for one very lazy fellow's house.The second part, turning a profit, is where you might get stuck. There are a LOT of factors to consider when drawing a bus line or even just placing a stop. There are seven classes of people to ferry around, including blue-collar workers, tourists, and retirees. They all live in different parts of the city and have different transit needs, so just running lines from apartments to shopping centers might not cut it if those apartments are where students or CEOs live. There are also a mess of vehicles to outfit your routes with, each with different price tags, speeds, safety ratings, appeals, and fuel consumptions. Add to that your control over wages, ticket prices, and advertising, plus a full economic model for the city that can change the business landscape during recessions and crisises, and you may very well have trouble grasping why you're not making any money.At least the interface won't be what's standing in your way. Cities in Motion has some very helpful information overlays for the city, as well as useful graphs and charts of your company's performance at all levels. Routes are shown in clear paths overlaid on the city, and floating tabs over your stops display all the key information you need to make informed decisions about your service. The 3D models of everything, from the buildings to the busses to the people, are surprisingly detailed and pleasantly animated. The sound design is exactly what you're expecting as well, with pleasing jingles and chimes over a mostly relaxed soundtrack. You'll find plenty of content to keep you busy as well, with loads of campaigns, scenarios, and sandboxes spread across the many cities of the world. It'll take some effort to break into, but Cities in Motion does everything it can to make the steep learning curve a fun one to climb.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												I actually prefer this original CIM more than CIM2. It is its own unique game, so you can't really compare it to another game. Its not without its bugs and annoyances though, which include Traffic Jams (Saving, Restarting and Reloading sometimes helps) and more passengers than you will be able to transport.. The DLC vehicles also get added into timeframes they do not belong in, making it unrealistic to the point where you will ignore the small vehicles and just go for the larger\bigger DLC vehicles which carry the most passengers and non DLC vehicles are stupidly slow and handle small numbers of passengers. However overlooking this, it is possible to play with an erection and you can find yourself either quick playing to complete campaign tasks or modifying, changing and adding to existing routes. A few have complained about DLC price but this often appears in sales and cheap on Bundle websites with the DLC, so keep looking and if you see it on sale with the DLC or in a bundle, its worth a go.

												Cities in Motion is a city simulation game, where you build and run a public transportation system in one of several European cities; Helsinki, Vienna, Amsterdam, and Berlin. You build and maintain lines for buses, trams, metro trains, and more. The game has tutorial city where you learn how to build and implement each system of transport, purchase and build various vehicles and stations. The learning curve is fairly low, and you are given wide discretion on where to build your transportation lines. I like the fact that real cities are used, which gives you a basic rundown of each cities landmarks and layout. I would like to see more cities added and I believe the DLC available offers some new cities. Visually speaking, the game looks a lot like Tycoon City, New York. It has a great deal of detail and is pretty cool to play. I tend to be very particular about the types of simulator games I play, but this one isn't bad at all. I would have liked to be able to manage more than just public transportation, but then again that was the purpose of the game. Thumbs up.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												If you don't like building and management games like SimCity and Transport Tycoon, this is no game for you, move on.For all the others, Cities in Motion is a fun little game where you try to get money by transporting passengers. Don't make the mistake I made: CiM transportation doesn't follow the same rules as real life, and sometimes you keep wondering why passengers make certain decisions. Also the grid makes it look possible to place a certain structure there, while it isn't. Breakdowns are very frequent, and traffic jams are very common.But none of these comments aren't game breaking, it is still a very fun game, where you need some trial and error to find out what is the most optimized transportation network. But after that, when you get the hang on it, it's loads of fun.			",43,11,0,6,15,2,15

												I do like transport sims and this game has all of the necessary components - complexity, balance between micro and macromanagement, modability, slow learning curve... but it is also incredibly bleak, dull and lifeless. Cities look dead, colour palette is mostly made of grey, brown, muddy and depressing tones. Weather doesn't changeYou can't deselect with mouse clicks and developers notoriously ignored all requests for this feature. You can change your cities slightly but it wont affect traffic or population. ""Quests"" involve building lines to specific places in a city, connecting buildings and reaching certain amount of traffic usage. There's no rush and no competition, you can simply let the game run, amass money and build all over your city.It's not a bad game overall but unfortunately it gets boring, bland and repetitive very quickly. I've played for 28 hours few years ago and never started it since.			",103,15,1,19,33,0,33

												Being a massive fan of Strategy/Transport games ever since I got Traffic Giant back in 2001, I bought this game as pre-release expecting it to be as good as it looked, I now part regret it. The maps are well done, the vehicles look ok, but the gameplay is terrible. - I have tried 10 attempts to make a profit and every time I have failed, even on easy mode - I like to be able to just lay out what I feel is a decent transport system and still make a profit, in easy mode it should work! - At the start, a route becomes so popular that you have to buy more vehicles because their capacity is so low compared to real life that you can only cram about 10 people on a bus and under 25 on a tram? WTF. So you buy more buses and that just cloggs up the road, and passengers are still left unhappy... - There is no option to lay single track/tram rails so it is impossible to do a loop at the end of a tram line, therefore you can only have routes doing clockwise and anti-clockwise circuit.

												Cities in Motion is an AWSOME sim, with buses, choppers, trams, trains and boats you can do whatever you want, whatever route can be in the game, whatever TRANSPORT, but I would like the airplanes to be moreover like in real life, and be able to add airports in the game to have routes to other cities in the world, and if you have a ferry port like Calais, Dover, Portsmouth, etc., please add ferries for services to other countries and do small ones if the need to sail is over a small river, and please, do it for me and all the people in the world, add coaches to travel to other cities as well.

												I came at this with some skepticism, but after sitting down and getting sucked into it for 5 hours I have to say that this is a really fun take on transportation sims. It's especially nice that you're able to just focus on transit planning and don't have to muck about with modifying cities directly. The graphics are solid and the game performs reasonably well across a variety of hardware.			",142,64,0,18,44,0,50

												I have mixed feeling about this game. I would say 50/50. My recommendation, jump directly to ""City Skylines"", which is made by the same publisher. ""Cities Skylines"" is a much better more complete game. In ""Cities in Motion"" you only control the transport. And, all your work doesn't have any real impact on the city. The transportation system is well done, but since you don't have full control over the city, your options are limited.			",26,15,0,15,22,0,15

												I am amazed by this game, every deatail is astounding! The graphics are not that bad, and the mechanics are excellent! A great transport tycoon game, but its not for some one who likes to sit back and admire what he's done so far, no, you have to keep working or the stops will fill up and get pack with grumpy customer. Biuld new routes to expand coverage to the business section of the city, with any luck you will have one passenger taking your busses to the trams to the subway all for just getting to work! Cities in Motion really is Cities in Motion!			",601,130,37,38,82,5,82

												This is one of my favorite games of all time.  If you enjoy city simulations and especially the old transport tycoon deluxe, this game is a must have.  The game has about an hour learning curve and I play with the ""double capacity"" mod.  The game focuses on Helsinki, Berlin, Amsterdam and Vienna throughout a fantastic campaign with enjoyable music.  The DLC adds many more cities and vehicles for hundreds of hours of fun.  This is the game I play when I need to relax and it was the first game I've ever bothered to 100% achievement on Steam.  It's that good.  I played this for many hours to distract me from the pain after a couch was dropped on my foot and blew my entire toenail off.  This game is losing your toenail distracting good!  Get it- P.S. so far it's better than the sequel so get this one before CiM2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What to expectA RTS where you need to manage a public transport company. You need to keep al your customers happy with fast services, while keeping that bankaccount showing black numbers. Watching your metro lines gulping up masses of customers can be very satisfying.Plus Very detailed cities Plenty of methods of transport Good customer AIMinus No way to distribute vehicles, making congestion sometimes unavoidable Long loadingtimes ",85,37,1,4,7,0,15

												I've been playing this game since it came out, and still find it interesting at times. It's a shame that it has been superceded by some newer games, so no new content is coming out—if new city DLCs were made, I'd probably still buy them.Cities in Motion is a public transport planning simulator that lets you build bus, tram/monorail/trolleybus, ferry/waterbus and metro/subway lines. You can control many of the costs involved, and the idea is to make a profit while at the same time making the best public transport system for your city. This is not an official goal by the way—there are (admittedly disappointing) scenarios with clearly set goals, while in sandbox mode you have no specific goal.The reason I highly recommend this game is that it's surprisingly addictive, and while it cannot serve as an accurate simulator, can give some idea of how public transport planning works; the game calculates the routes taken by all city residents and tourists and calculates if they should or shouldn't use your public transport system. It's extremely fun and rewarding to take a city from 100% car usage to almost everyone using your amazing system!Unfortunately there are certain major drawbacks. The biggest one by far is technical—the game is not optimized well, and games in large cities with developed transport systems slow down to a crawl even on my top-of-the-line PC. Other than that, there is some imbalance between transport modes, some poorly designed areas in the official maps, almost no ability to customize metro stops (entrances, multiple tiers, etc.), and of course no new content because the game is ""outdated"".

												Lots of people try to compare this game to Transport Tycoon. Let me clarify, this game is very different from Transport Tycoon, especially the gameplay is more complex and deeper than Transport Tycoon. In this game, you can't randomly build anything and expect to make a profit, you have to inspect which kind of people will use your service, where they want to go, plan your routes so the vehicles can travel faster, which bank you'll get loan, which kind of advertisement you'll use and how long, it also has a single player campaign with mission-based scenario alongside with sandbox mode and map editor. I'll have to say this game is pretty good. If you love tycoon game, love a complex gameplay and bored with sandbox-only game, you gonna love Cities in Motion.			",249,148,5,25,18,1,25

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Cities in Motion is a transport tycoon simulation game developed by Colossal Order, the people behind the fantastic Cities: Skylines, however Cities in Motion came out before Cities: Skylines and published by the strategy masters, Paradox InteractiveCities in Motion is a simulation strategy game in which you run a transportation company in a few realistic countries such as Amsterdam and others such as London sold seperately through DLC. Over the years, starting from the age of transportation, roughly 1930 onwards and you have a choice of either buses, trams, metro, ferries or helicopters and with the more money you make the more transport services you can addOverall the game is fun and challenging, however, I do feel that there were certain gameplay functions that were needed in this game but were added in its sequel, Cities in Motion 2. Also, sometimes I feel angry when I can't create the perfect transportation system, however, in the real life, none of the transportation services are perfectThe only thing I would complain about is it's game's performance. Once you add too many things, the game chugs like mad, it looks like the game couldn't handle it. Sometimes even crashing the game and losing your progress thus far, Also, the huge amounts of DLC is kind of ridiculousHowever, if you played such classics as Transport Tycoon or you would like to play a game where you manage your own transport company, then Cities in Motion is the game for you!

												Very good transport manager game. It has a very detailed simulation of passengers, who hop from one means of transportation to another to get to their destination: you can actually see them walk to leave the tram and take the metro, and so on. In that respect I like it better than classics like Transport Tycoon, since that one never bothered to properly model passengers traveling around (OpenTTD attempted it but IMO failed so far).I can be tough to manage the hordes of angry passengers waiting at your stops, but that problem is handily solved by raising prices for the corresponding transport type really high (thus attracting less users) and using the largest capacity vehicles you can. Don't use too many vehicles on a line or you'll cause traffic jams. Reading community guide on Steam or reading the official Cities in Motion FAQ is recommended if you want to understand the game mechanics in-depth.I don't find many faults to this game but there are a few:- Given a crowd of angry passengers at a stop, it's hard to figure out where they want to go. You have to check them one by one. Also some statistics that would be useful are not shown, but you can add a few more by the installation of the Line Statistics Plus mod (see this group for a mod archive: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/cimx ).- Missions are silly with writing that feels childish.- Game quits out of a mission as soon as you complete the last main objective. I would've prefered to keep playing around with my network until I decide I want to end the mission.- Placing tram rails can be fiddly, sometimes it looks as if the line should be able to pass between two buildings or across a curved road, and it doesn't.Overall though, very enjoyable. I do recommend playing on Easy if you're just starting out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This a really enjoyable and addictive simulator with such amazing features as mobile pedestrians. The detail on the maps is incredible and often I find that the cities' layouts are faithful to thier real-life counterparts. This is much the same with the vehicles which are particular;y enjoyable as they are each suited best to a certain role and great variety is offered.I find that the sandbox mode can sometimes be challenging but it is certainly rewarding when you can turn a large profit. It is essential in this game to bear in mind each variable at your descretion as each one can have such a large impact on many others. I find it hard to close this game as it's addictive nature just leaves you wanting to play more. The expansion packs are the best part of this game, not only with the map packs but also features such as Design Classics and Design Now add so much to the game in terms of variety and enjoyment. I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone with an interest in strategy or buissiness simulations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thoroughly engaging. Despite it's on the surface simplicity, Cities in Motion is an in-depth public transport manager with excellent communter behavior. The tutorials are excellent, completing them gives you a basic understanding of the game, but a fully fledged, more functioning system requires experience and additional guide reading; the game doesn't hold your hand all the way through.It must be said however, that much of the game's flaws lies in it's engine. It's extremely limited in functionality (you can't rotate stations at a 45 degree angle for instance) and at times, rather clunky. With that aside, this is an excellent game and  I highly recommend it for Sim City and management affectionados.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thought this would be a great game, but there are some basic problems with it.  The graphics are beautiful, the music is peaceful, and it is a relaxing game to play.  Playing the tutorial is great as it features a small modern city, and in time you are able to create a wonderful public transport system. But then when you start playing the actual missions, the first mission is Nazi Germany just before World War 2.  I mean, come on?!!  Isn't there a better city and time period to start with?  There were very few choices of vehicles, such a the only bus being a very slow bus that can only hold 10 people in a city with thousands of people wanting to catch a bus.  Have they never heard of a faster double decker bus like you can choose in the tutorial game?  Before long, hundreds of people are queuing at your bus stops, and you are losing money preventing you from building more transport lines.  Then there is a traffic jam which holds everything up.  Cars will randomly stop for no reason, or vehicles will stop to allow people to cross in the middle of the street, some vehicles will drive along at what seems to be 2mph.  In the meantime, all your empty buses are building up at the back of the traffic jam as they can't reach the bus stops!This would be a brilliant game if they gave more choice to the vehicles such as faster vehicles, and vehicles holding more people, and improved the traffic system to prevent every car in the city stopping and driving so slowly that nothing can move on the roads!  Perhaps they should have started the first mission with a modern city with more transport choices, and perhaps a research lab to design new vehicles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm now on the last scenario of the first campaign - tens of hours in the game (offline).The game is fun enough to keep you playing, although it could be so much better. The scenarios are really boring with bad missions (e.g. long bus or tram routes that'll just ruin your reputation if you don't close them immediately after completing). The way you are forced to play the same cities over and over in campaign isn't very fun. You don't get to keep your stuff between scenarios. And the scenarios all end too soon. There's no way to lose - there's no due date on missions, and banks are willing to lend you money endlessly. You can even complete 'get X money' missions by borrowing from the bank!While you get different ways of moving peeps around, there's no balance. Underground, while expensive, makes you a lot of money. Buses and trams cause traffic jams everywhere they go (btw, trams have as much capacity as buses for some weird reason). Helicopters don't have enough capacity to service a popular route and are too expensive for unpopular one, and boats… there aren't many good spots for boats.Building interface isn't great either. With trams its just annoying. With metro it penalizes trying to optimize. Since every part of an underground line is so expensive, you can't really experiment with placements (for example you might think that building a short part of your line on the ground/elevated might be cheaper, but it requires so much trial and error to make it all fit, that it'll probably end up being more expensive).Managing prices is really boring and needs to be done pretty often. Every now and then you have to adjust ~10 values to make them green/white/bright red and that's it.Despite all this the game is playable and pretty fun. If you are done with Roller Coaster Tycoons, openttd and sim cities than sure, get this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A magnificent and time-consuming game if you are a builder of public transportation systems. The good thing is this game gives you hours of entertainment without having to learn difficult concepts (Lines are easy to build but you need to figure out where the lines should transport people too.)  The downside is the constant breakdown of buses and the limited capacity of these vehicles. Additionally more cities should be made available through DLC's (I have purchased most of the DLC packs and am currently going through them but more would be nice).  A good management game but would recommend some changes to how lines affect the computer population and better breakdown % of vehicles, but do not mess with the easy way lines can be built.This game is recommended but would be nice for a few changes. Let's hope the producers make these changes!			",0,0,0,0,9,0,4

												If you are expecting Transport Tycoon 2, turn back now. In Cities in Motion, you will be operating the public transport for your city, a beautiful landscape of skyscrapers, industrial workshops, and residential houses. Setup your bus stops and routes, get people in with trains, and move people around your city/s. It will grow as your population has the opportunity to get around.While fiddling with bus stops is not my cup of tea, it's still a tight little transport game, and if it sounds like yours I would suggest buying it! Just make sure it's on sale :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like transport tycoon but on a smaller scale, you actually have to worry a bit more about road traffic. It is also completely focused on passenger transportation, so there are no mail and parcels. Other than the size and scope change trains can no longer crash. Though since this game actually has a population reputation system that would be bad for business. This game provides you with information on the citizens living in an area and where they would like to go, and leaves you to find the best form of transport be it bus rail, subway, or helicopter and other forms of transportation.

While in Sim City you have to manage everything about your city including zoning, roads, and utilities, in Cities in Motion you focus exclusively on public transportation.  Try to anticipate your citizen's needs and set up tramways, bus lines, subways, and water taxis... The game does have a significant learning curve, however, so make sure you go through the tutorials.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has an initially steep learning curve that goes beyound the start tutorial. A lot of trial and error in the sandbox is needed to get the hang of it. I personally enjoy this game because of that. In addition, there is a secondary learning curve to get from I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING to being profitable and then being able to organize large networks of transportation. The game is a challange but can stall out when attempting to bet past the second learning curve required. I burn through more sandbox instances than campaigns to try and get a the hang of this game. Over time I hope to master it. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys the likes of Sim City.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's strange, I didn't even actively play this game for much of the time I was in it, I just sat and watched all that I had created work, mesmerized by it all. The DLC is mostly a waste, since you get the best vehicles in the vanilla game anyway. It's hard to find a balance between all the payrates for the drivers, keeping customers happy with rates, and building new things, but once you find that balance, you'll rake in the money. Sadly though, once you find that balance and have finished all the objectives, there isn't much to do except start over. PROS:Easy to get intoA great time wasterObjectives help you build throughout the city and give a good place to startChallengingCONS:Not many objectives, and once they're finished, there is no point other than to see how much money you can makeNo ending???

												Would seem to have potential, but overall a waste of time.  Very steep learning curve with little information given to you on how and why things are wrong.  Impossible to ever turn a profit.  The game always requires extensive micro-managing to employee wages and ticket prices.			",96,4,0,15,5,0,26

												Awesome and vivid public transport company business management game;  however since the release of Skylines, the subsequent takedown of principal modding site CIMX, and the extremely niche community typical of the genre, this game is now officially dead. Not much to describe, TL;DR: Better than the sequel in everything except FPS rate, map size and customisability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm now on the last scenario of the first campaign - tens of hours in the game (offline).The game is fun enough to keep you playing, although it could be so much better. The scenarios are really boring with bad missions (e.g. long bus or tram routes that'll just ruin your reputation if you don't close them immediately after completing). The way you are forced to play the same cities over and over in campaign isn't very fun. You don't get to keep your stuff between scenarios. And the scenarios all end too soon. There's no way to lose - there's no due date on missions, and banks are willing to lend you money endlessly. You can even complete 'get X money' missions by borrowing from the bank!While you get different ways of moving peeps around, there's no balance. Underground, while expensive, makes you a lot of money. Buses and trams cause traffic jams everywhere they go (btw, trams have as much capacity as buses for some weird reason). Helicopters don't have enough capacity to service a popular route and are too expensive for unpopular one, and boats… there aren't many good spots for boats.Building interface isn't great either. With trams its just annoying. With metro it penalizes trying to optimize. Since every part of an underground line is so expensive, you can't really experiment with placements (for example you might think that building a short part of your line on the ground/elevated might be cheaper, but it requires so much trial and error to make it all fit, that it'll probably end up being more expensive).Managing prices is really boring and needs to be done pretty often. Every now and then you have to adjust ~10 values to make them green/white/bright red and that's it.Despite all this the game is playable and pretty fun. If you are done with Roller Coaster Tycoons, openttd and sim cities than sure, get this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cities in motion 1 is a good game if you are good at Budgeting or good at cheating money instead.. Anyway The way routes work is alot better then the second game as they do NOT go through a terminal (At-least for buses and trams). The only game this needed was a unlimited money mode like the second game. This Had some more features like Advertising, Better Train stations, They actually looked and worked better in this game.. But overall good game if you get it on sale...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some people would say this is better than Cities in Motion 2, I don't understand their way of thinking, I now have both games and after only an hour and a half this one has become very boring and repeatative. OK so CiM2 may not be perfect but it has far and away much more going on, much more content and far more choices on what you can do, sorry but even at £5 (10$) this game is boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cities in Motion is a transport management sim.The interface is a little cryptic and this game is by no means Transport Tycoon, the campaign is a little clunky and the graphics are acceptable.Railroad Tycoon 2 and Transport Giant are better games, but they're old. There aren't that many transport games out there and this was the best at the time I bought it.The game doesn't explain itself well at times and can be frustrating but is overall an enjoyable experience.

												a big yes, put the dlc's with it, wish they would have concentrated on making this game bigger and including more options for inter city travel and vehicles than doing the armpit that is cim2.  sometimes does not make sense and you may have to restart a scenario as you can run out of cash quickly, but worth the effort as you see hundreds of little people going to your stations.lines also have to have a purpose, just covering the map in green wont make it a success, if you enjoy TT, railroad tycoon etc this is a must.maybe company should do away with cim2, and make a build option for increasing the size of cities for this.dont sit on the fence, buy it!!!!

												It was tough to get into, but once I did I fell in love with this game. If the concept interests you from the description and video, then you will enjoy the game once you give it a couple hours and figure out how to play and not go bankrupt all the time.Once you get into the meat of the game you'll discover some flaws that can be pretty annoying (eg, not being able to easily replace old transit vehicles, not being able to distribute vehicles on a route, not being able to set different fares or schedules on routes) but overall you can make do and still enjoy the game. And unfortunately, the sequel is crap, so I'll be reinstalling CiM1 if I ever want to play this type of transportation sim again.			",189,81,1,40,71,0,51

												Perhaps I should have read the description more closely when I purchased Cities in Motion, as I was expecting a SimCity like experience in the same vein as Cities XL 2012, however Cities in Motion focuses exclusively on the transportation aspect of city management.  The game difficulty can be high as their are numerous options and menus to remember, but the presentation is polished and the tutorial is adequate to get you started.  Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are supported, and the graphics are servicable and comparable to other similar titles.  Fans of the Tropico series and Cities XL will find a lot to love about Cities in Motion, with the addition of helicopter and triple tiered underground transportation a welcome addition above and beyond what those titles offer.  In short, if you like a deep, lovingly detailed city management game, you will undoubtedly enjoy Cities in Motion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just messy. When you come to play this game after you've played Cities Skyline, you can't appreciate the way the game works and you start missing the semplicity of the design in CS, which is still more realistic than in CIM.I suppose my expectations were different coming from CIM. At the end of the day, the game deliveres exactly what it claims. Still I can't help feeling it falls a bit flat: once you've accomplished a few tasks it just gets boring.The main fault is that some actions which should really be easy become very complicated - I found it was almost impossible to build a tube station. Again, when compared to CS this game becomes redundant. Taken alone, it's still not essential and I've learnt more from CS - I'm sorry but despite the different aims the 2 games have the comparison it's almost impossible to avoid.			",4,3,0,0,4,0,0

												A surprisingly fun transit sim. Build bus, streetcar and subway routes through a city that grows and traffic patterns that shift based on your coverage and reliability ratings. Better routes = less cars on the road to clog up your route. Stops in major roadways = traffic stoppers. You get the idea.Definitely recommended for strategy fans. The wide variety of DLC keeps the game fresh, and the learning process of how to build good routes and manage them is fun.			",208,60,1,33,17,2,39

												Standard sim game, not to difficult to play once you grasp the fundementals.  I find the gameplay rewarding trying to manage all transit lines to move the imaginery people from one place to another.  You can also click on each individual person to see where they are coming from and where they are going if you like that much depth in sim games.  Has good assortment of vehicle in the regular game.  You can buy more with DLC for more efficiency.  If you like all things effiecient and sim games this game is pretty fun.  A game I will play for years to satisfy my Sim fix.

												No wonder this game was 75% off.I really was looking forward to this game and if it wasn't for the traffic issues and lack of tutorial on how to fix it or manage it. It would possibly be a great game.Have tried several times just on the tutorial to learn this game to no avail.Couldn't be bothered to start a proper map.Update.Played The Paris city.I used Cheat app and provided myself $16,000,000. Couldn't stop playing, was actually quite enjoyable.  I am quite confident to start a normal game without cheats now.Massive subway system, and I reallly got into it.Advise if possible don't start with Tutorial as it turned me away from the game. Use unlimited funds or similar and start a game in a proper city, until you get used to it.Start with a subway and work down to trams then buses.I will keep a thumbs down due to the fact that it took all this time to get into the game. And almost gave up on it due to the stupid introduction.As a score would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars after becoming more familiar. It ended up being a hidden gem in the end.			",10,14,2,16,63,0,40

												If you like transport management sim, this is without a doubt one of the best ever since Transport Tycoon Deluxe. What's great about this game is that it is very mod friendly. If you don't like the default balance, just go find a few mods (or even mod it yourself) to find the right fun vs challenge ratio for yourself.There are tons of scenarios and themes to choose from with tons of DLC to pick up for cheap these days. However, even after all these years, the graphics still looks very well done, and you can always download some new maps and vehicles to further expand your game.The only problem with this game is that it is only single-threaded. That means if you run a giant map and have tons of lines and vehicles running around, it will slow your game down to a choppy mess even with a fast CPU. But if you can overlook this point, this game is extremely fun to play as a sandbox transport sim.			",466,134,56,83,92,6,121

												I like this game as it portrays how to manage a city well, and has many modes of transportation that can serve the many different classes, it can get a bit confusing at times, but that's what makes up accurate CIMulators! Plus, it has achievements :p			",204,36,5,11,29,0,30

												While this is a great game for sure, I strongly recommend you get Cities in Motion 2, which is basically a much more improved version of this game. Road options in this original is just too limited to make full use of its potential.My score: 6.5/10 (Get CiM 2, seriously.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												5-10Its hard to say if this is good or not. I played about 5 hours of the game. I feel like if i spent more time I would have fun and it would be something like a 7-10. I guess i would recommend you to buy this and give it more time unlike me.			",24,5,0,5,6,0,3

												I haven't beaten the first scenario! Despite the impossible difficulty of actually turning a profit I've played this game for over 20 combined hours. Angry at my lack of city building skills each and everytime, but drawn to how well the game is balanced and the idea that I can upgrade forever. It's fun, addicting and upsetting. All at once.I have finally beaten a Scenario. It took 30 hours because I am sometimes not the sharpest. I can say once you figure out how to get money and link your lines together the game goes from fun to engrossing and fantastic. Each Scenario takes 2-4 hours. Eacha  new challenge. I had to actually go to a forum and see what I was doing wrong, but once that got sorted out. Happy days.			",113,32,2,21,15,1,31

												If you enjoy Roller Coaster Tycoon or any of its many versions, this may be right up your alley too. Although it is limited to just the transit systems for the campaigns and scenarios, the graphics are insane, and the city layouts are near perfect to real life. Prefer to make your own cities or maps? Theres a sandbox mode for that too. Lotsa fun for those interested in mass transit!			",38,0,1,0,14,2,1

												No wonder this game was 75% off.I really was looking forward to this game and if it wasn't for the traffic issues and lack of tutorial on how to fix it or manage it. It would possibly be a great game.Have tried several times just on the tutorial to learn this game to no avail.Couldn't be bothered to start a proper map.Update.Played The Paris city.I used Cheat app and provided myself $16,000,000. Couldn't stop playing, was actually quite enjoyable.  I am quite confident to start a normal game without cheats now.Massive subway system, and I reallly got into it.Advise if possible don't start with Tutorial as it turned me away from the game. Use unlimited funds or similar and start a game in a proper city, until you get used to it.Start with a subway and work down to trams then buses.I will keep a thumbs down due to the fact that it took all this time to get into the game. And almost gave up on it due to the stupid introduction.As a score would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars after becoming more familiar. It ended up being a hidden gem in the end.			",10,14,2,16,63,0,40

												I've found that I like CIM more than CIM2. The interface is easy to learn.There are some quirks, especially when building subways, but I find I can play it for hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty fun transportation simulation game...just found out about it a few days ago and bought it. Easy to play but not that easy to earn a profit. Either way, it's a good price for a great, open ""problem solving"" type of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game to spend your free-time. If you like managing games, this is certainly a title you must have. The only flaw is that, after you finish the campaing on every map, you'll see that the sandbox mode is hardly challenging, and tiresome within a short time.			",58,27,2,16,40,1,19

												Cities in Motion is a unique strategy game. On the surface it seems like a pretty standard business management sim, where for many in the genre, the business you are managing is rather simple, strategically: choose which animals for your zoo, which rollercoasters to buy, which employees to hire or fire, these choices don't make much of a difference overall. Not so for Cities in Motion: the route management section of the game is deep and involving; combining bus and tram routes to minimise traffic in trouble areas is an example of the meat and vegetables of a game which delivers challenges outside the economic norm for the genre. It also helps that the graphics are gorgeous, the interface is, for the most part, slick and easy to use, and the play experience is restful and calm, without being boring in pacing. The city layouts are challenging and diverse.On the downside, it could use some balance tweaks (particularly in the DLC), but these are easily obtainable online.			",118,40,0,23,29,4,40
