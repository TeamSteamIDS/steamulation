												Manage FC tokyo in the j-league, epic team.Overall, it's a very cheap game and can help you waste time if you enjoy the strategy sports games.However this game is very out of date but that for me doesn't bother me since I'm not the biggest football fan but enjoy the strategy and training 16 year olds to become worth millions later on.The alternative is Football Manager which offers a lot more in terms of everything and is up to date, but you have to pay 5x more.  In conclusion, if you enjoy normal strategy sports games and looking for something to play for a few hours when you have nothing to do, this game can be a bargain once you get your head around it. //Updated more detailed partChampionship Manager 2010 is a simple football manager game that allows you to take control over your favourite clubs or country and manage the club such as buying and selling players, renewing current player contracts, picking the tactics and formations etc.Is Championship Manager 2010 any good?Yes and no.In reality it has no comparison to what the Football Manager series can offer in terms of mechanics. An example of this would be interaction with the media and players; in Championship Manager you can talk to players if they have concerns but it doesn't really matter what you say to them as it will only change their morale and nothing much else.However for what it may lack in, what it has is adequate enough to satisfy my needs for what I wish to do: set up formations with the players I want and watch my team win.The good:-Once you get used to the long dull menu you will find that it is easy to get what you want and each menu is simple and easy to use and there is also a help button to explain what the current menu is for and how to use it.-Plenty of pre-made formations, tactics and training schedules for you to use as well tools to be able to make your own (I find creating my own schedules a lot more benficial to developing players quickly).-Simple mechanics; some may find this a bad point, but sometimes all we need is just the simplicity of being able to manage the team we want and get the players we want to be able to dominate the leagues.The bad:-Outdated, obviously with 2010 in the title you won't be surprised to hear that most current famous young players won't be in the game or will be put in as bad young players, as well as any current superstars having average stats back then (Bale I'm looking at you).-Some of the features such as the training ground where you select players or individuals to engage in certain training drills feel that they have no impact in developing players in the short or long term. It seems that a player develops best when they are young and have good game time where as once they reach around 30/31 their development slows down and decreases - but training will not change anything from what I have witnessed.-Not enough indepth tatics. In Football Manager you can select what type of role a certain player will player (e.g. Ball Winning Midfielder) and it will highlight the skills that will be needed most, where as with Championship Manager you have to second guess what skills would be needed for a certain role.-Just not as good as any Football Manager title.Overall I feel this game was worth it when I bought it on sale, and I've enjoyed all the time I have spent on it and will continue to do so until another management game goes on sale.I'd reccommend picking up an early title of Football Manager if you wish for a cheap manager game but this game will satisfy your needs enough if you have nothing better to do.

												Chamionship Manager 2010, 5 years out of date and no longer a running series , is it worth buying? Yes and No. +A 3D match engine, watch every match simulated in 3D+A Huge range of teams, and i mean huge. You can play as Ayr from Scotand, they have a transfer budget of £500+Import new Player data from the internet allowing you to play with modern teams+A huge raneg of tactics+80p on a sale-Does not compete with the Football Manager Series anymore-Requires a basic knwledge of football-3D is very basic-No Music so keep Itunes or Spotify openIf you have a spare 80p and you feel like managing football team for an hour, this is the game to get. Personally i would wait for a sale to get to this price. But if you like either the Football Manager series or are a fan of the older Championship Manager games but dont want to pay the price for a newer game in the series this should be your first stop.No issues were found when running, runs fine on Windows 7 & 10. This should run on anything with a graphics card and will probably even run on intergrated GPU's. ",94,6,1,15,14,0,5

												If you want a cheap yet really well detailed footy manager sim, look no further then this.CM10 has taken what CM08 had and built on it to produce a bigger and better game then its predecessor.  If you played CM08 then all you would need to know is how the additional things work in game, because its all familiar territory when you look it over.New additions include the Scout Network in which you can scout a region for talent.  More money you throw at that, the faster it gets done, however the game REALLY wants you to use your scouts, no matter how bad they are.  Theres a thing called Player Knowledge and that means the more you know about the player, the more accurate you will see his true stats.  For example at a 1% knowledge, that striker you are looking at, his finishing could be anything between 5-70.  Get more knowledge on him and you will get that stat down to a more accurate figure.  So that means constant scouting on your chosen player target, which can be tedious, but I guess more realistic.You can even now set-up set pieces to how you want them done by your players, so for those with set piece ideas in their minds can be creative in this department and you can watch the set piece in action by seeing them practise....kinda funny when you see your players failing hard and falling over.Formations have a lot more flexibility now.  Before, in older games, it used to be a set position for  example FBL ( or Left Sided Full Back ) you could play your Wing Back there if you chose to.  Now you can alternate roles, so that FBL can easily be set as a WBL for your formation of choice, so that is really useful indeed to have.  A lot of additions have taken place and I wont list everything, but it is more detailed and in depth.  Good to see other leagues make a return as well ( yay Welsh leagues :P ) so you got good variety to pick from.Its cheap enough to warrent buying, its fun ( if a bit frustrating when bad things happen ) and a sound game.

												This game is unbelieveable crap. Totally unfair and somewhat random, not regarding at all what you do. I can't believe I spent almost 2 euros to this ridicilous thing.			",16,1,12,3,3,0,5

												Excellent game, albeit 4 years old I really cannot find any fault, if you want a simulation engine which is playable, easy to manipulate and is realistic based on player attribute numericals then try this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seriously disappointing game that I really, really, really tried to like, but failed. Let me see - I have at least 1 injury in each game. sometimes even 4 or 5 in one game, the transfer negotiations are rather poor, not to mention often at the end of long negotiations I'm finally informed... that player is not interested. Match engine has some gliches and overall is unrealistic - players with plenty of space to dribble try hopless long shots, etc.It is cheap, but at the same time really poor.			",51,17,0,5,29,0,24
