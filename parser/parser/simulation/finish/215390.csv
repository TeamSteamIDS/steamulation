												Pros: This is a very nice enjoyable combat simulator. Its's arcade style, but you can fly it with a joystick or gamepad. The game makers put a lot of effort in the missions.  Some of them seem to actually have a historical source. In this game you get to dogfight in multiple World War 2 fighters. You can even choose to get into an Axis fighter to fight the Japanese. Also nice are the multiple views like 3rd person, from the hood of a plane or  cockpit view. So you can always choose what you like. This game has a full campagne coop. Yes people you can play this game with 3 online team mates. So I had many hours of double fun with this game. Cons: The game always starts with me in windowed mode. Also I have to adjust the settings for my screen in game all the times when I start this game. These are just minor bugs and more a nuisance then a real burdon. Also the volume in the game is quite loud making it difficult to hear my mates on teamspeak. So before I start this game I have to adjust the volume settings in Teamspeak. Also a minor bug. All and all a very good game with nice graphics. It brought me back into the fierce combat  of World War 2 Pacific theatre. Definitely a good bang(s) for a bug.			",234,2,7,4,27,0,42

												This is an ok arcade flight sim.  A little choppy but workable frame rates.  It will do until someone makes a decent flight sim again.			",18,3,0,0,3,1,1

												It is quite possibly a reasonable game. I cannot get the keyboard, a microsoft freestyle pro or a logitech extreme 3d pro to work with it. So I guess I will never know.  More programmers who obviously don't have a clue.			",43,0,9,0,14,0,4
