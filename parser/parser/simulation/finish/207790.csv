												JASF is a travesty that should have never received the Jane's name. It's  a turn-and-burn game that has realistic looking planes, but they don't feel that different when flown, and weapons are completely unrealistic. There are also no friendlies in the game: you are ALONE in the game, making 20-80 kills PER MISSION. Yes, your weapons regenerate. The game also relies on throwing a lot of enemies at you. Missions are lame as you seem to be the only person in this country's air force... and you're a Western mercenary! Graphics are good (1680x1050 is supported) but not spectacular accurate like HAWX. All in all, I should be playing HAWX or Ace Combat.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												In the 90s, Jane's Combat Simulations was a whole series of flight simulation games published by EA (you read that right, it was EA before they became the stupid EA we all know today) with the branding of Jane's Information Group, a publishing company specializing in warfare. I have limited experience with flight simulation, and didn't discover it until way after Jane's games stopped being made, but I haven't heard anything but good things about the series.Now ignore everything I just said because it doesn't apply here at all. That's right, just like all the other reviews said, the ""Jane's"" name has nothing to do with this game. It's an arcade game; think HAWX or Ace Combat, but Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters is way more like HAWX 1 (I haven't played HAWX 2 so I can't say). Which I'm okay with - HAWX 1 was actually enjoyable for what it was, especially in multiplayer co-op... but where HAWX failed to capture the essence of Ace Combat, Jane's fails to even capture the essence of HAWX. And that's just sad.First things first, no camera control and limited controller support. You have to go into the controls menu and rebind the keys for your controller before you can do anything, and even then you still can't control the camera nor can you use the controller for the menus - you gotta have your keyboard handy. Plus, I don't know if this was just me, but some of the graphics seemed really weird - I had some werid light flickering every now and then, and explosions didn't look like explosions at all.On that last note, the graphics are passable. The aircraft models aren't very-well detailed, but they're not mishapen blocks that don't look like the Super Hornet or A-10 - they're passable, at the very least. Music and sound design are... poor, really. Nothing stuck with me at all, and I'm not trying to look for the soundtrack online or anything. Adding on to that, voice quality is really horrible. I mean, the writing can be okay at times, but the main character doesn't seem to give a damn about anything. He always sounds so upbeat, even when someone you're escorting is about to die. The guy voicing Control sounded like he was reused for some of the ground forces, which really confused me during one of the early missions.The gameplay of JASF is the worst part, unfortunately. Nothing seems to be obvious enough, especially concerning incoming missiles, which you can't dodge normally unless you use countermeasures. Seriously, those things stay glued to your butt like hell, and it's not like you have an infinite amount of flares when the enemies gang up on you. You'll find yourself dying just because the missiles are magically homing on you. Not like your missiles have the same capabilities. Additionally, when using bombs, your aircraft can be destroyed by those very bombs. Of course, you have no way of knowing this (and no other arcade flight game has this feature AFAIK) until you do it yourself, and even then you'd be hard-pressed to figure it out.Mission variety is also extremely broken. First mission is a patrol, followed by an escort. Second mission is a low-altitude attack, followed by an escort. Third mission is a low-altitude attack, followed by an escort. Am I the only one seeing a pattern here? Escort missions are the bane of some players' existence in Ace Combat games, so if you hate escort missions, stay the hell away.For what it's worth, I spent exactly $1.00 of my Steam wallet (so, technically, free since it was from trading cards), so I don't think it was wasted - I did enjoy what I was doing until I got shot down by a swarm of MiGs in... the third mission? Hard to remember since they're so easy to forget.In all honesty, HAWX 1 is better than this, and most Ace Combat games are better than that. Go look there. Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters isn't worth anyone's time or money.			",342,77,19,57,40,3,51

												3 out of 5, its fun, but not a true Jane's game.  Jane's used to make hardcore flight combat simulator type games, not this time.  This game, while fun, is a port of a console small downloadable game.  At first I didn't like the game, I felt cheated, but in the end I had fun playing through the short campaign.  This game and Hawx 1 are the last of the good arcade flight combat games.  For more realism play DCS World.  This game is fun, but shouldn't cost more than $5 in my opinion.

												I really don't get it, why is everyone bashing this game around? Sure, it is a H.A.W.X. clone, but it really doesn't deserve all the hate it got!The good:-Nice graphics- The graphics aren't spectacular, but they get the job done (especially considering the fact that this is a 2011 game)! The plane models are detailed and belivable, the terrain looks really good too!-Large map- The map in this game is pretty big, and it's really nice to fly around. Sadly there is no free-flight feature, so you can't explore it outside of the campaign.-Fun gameplay- The gameplay is fun and addicting. I would say the general feel of the game is even better than H.A.W.X.The bad:-Obviously a H.A.W.X. clone- It is a negative point, merely because the game doesn't introduce antything new.-No cockpits for the airplanes- While it is not game-braking, the lack of cockpit view in the planes, hurts the immersion a bit. There was cockpit view in H.A.W.X., and it was a nice feature.-The story- The story is the generic, one-super-human-pilot-wins-the-war in a fake-arabic-island-nation devided into the ""good"" south, and the ""bad"" north. No surprises here. I have to say though, that the story is not too bad, certainly not worse than H.A.W.X.All in all, a solid ARCADE, flying GAME. That's right. NOT a flight SIMULATOR. I think most people have a problem with this game, because it is called Jane's. I personally don't. The game is fun and enjoyable. Don't buy it expecting a simulator, but rather a fun flying action game, and you will be fine. I am a veteran of many a flight sim (Falcon BMS, FSX, LockOn Flaming Cliffs...), and it doesn't make me enjoy this game any less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This should not have the Jane's Name attached to it.  ""Advanced Strike Fighters"" would be a better name as it is an arcade like flight simulator, nothing like the in-depth realism of the other Jane's titles.  I am going to reccomend this game, but for a very specific reason, skip to the last paragraph if you want that break down.  The rest of this review will be focusing on all the problems with the game.The game has some serious flaws.  The most jarring is the voice acting.  It's horrible.  The voice actors don't know what accent they are trying to replicate, and the end result is that 'control' (the guy giving you missions) sounds like a caricature of a middle eastern terrorist, your allies all sound either Russian (maybe) French (sometimes) or just stupid (almost always).  And then there is the main character you play, 'Razor', who has less personality then a cardboard box.  There is also the stupid decision to reveal major plot points while you are dogfighting multiple enemies.  I've screamed 'Shut up control! KIND OF BUSY!"" while the middle eastern terrorist is rambling about president Karzei or Dimitriev.  Shutting the radio off is probably a good idea in this game, because it will be less frustrating.  And the plot is generic and bad anyway, make up your own story as you shoot down enemies.Moving on, the gameplay.  It's not great.  Enemy fighter planes spawn and then go after you like a cruise missile.  The force balance is blatantly unfair as well, enemy fighters swarm you very quickly, and 10 on 1 furballs are never very fun.  Enemy missiles track rather well, and your countermeasures are basically only good for one missile.  If you have three flares, and you pop them, the game stops the tracking on three missiles (not all 12 headed at you) so again, not really realistic.  AAA fire can't shoot at you until you are within 2 miles, but can then track and hit you constantly (even through mountains) until you are 10 miles away.  Enemy SAMs always outrange ground munitions, so wild weasel can be interesting.  Now one by one, all of these enemy elements can be dealt with, but usually the game spawns 10 fighters, 4 sams, and an AAA site all at once and tells you 'GOOD LUCK!'.  This can be extremely frustrating at times.  I played one game where I died five times, but at the end, I had 94 ground kills and 138 air kills, achieveing a kill ratio that would be envied by any air force.  But to beat the level, there was no way you could do it on a single life, and this is a gameplay decision that bothers me.  Skill should be a factor here.So that's enemies, what about your plane?  Well there is a good selection of aircraft, and they are all sort of rendered nicely.  I mean, the graphics in this game are not that great, but they get the job done.  One jarring thing for people who like planes, is that when maneuvering the planes surfaces do not move properly.  The ailerons and elevators and rudders all work, like on a Cessna, but these are Fly by wire aircraft.  Elevators work in tandem to roll planes along with elevators, flaps and ailerons should deploy to aid elevators in pitch maneuvers, rudders function as pitch and yaw assist on most aircraft as well.  This is not modeled, unlike say Ace Combat, where the planes are basically pornography.  Your weapon selection could best be described as generic.  There are no real munitions in this game, all the munitions are made up names with different capabilities.  You only really need three to win at this game, the Shrike, Eagle, and Basilisk.  The Shrike is a AA-11/sidewinder equivalent, the Eagle lets you pop enemy planes at long range (20 k in this game...) and the Basilisk is a cruise missile with submuntions.  You can't loadout your aircraft with anything other then pre-set loadouts, so I'll just tell you that the SU-35BM has this loadout in a 4/4/4 config.  Use it the moment you unlock it for every mission.  So your weapons are pretty generic and the explosions/missile traces are boring.Ok, so why am I listing this game as recommended.  Well I am saying it is worth buying if it is on sale for only one reason.  It is fun to play Co-op.  Single player this game is dissapointing, but every mission in the game can be played on co-op mode, and you can have a lot of friends in a single session.  The enemy count doesn't change, so the game actually becomes more fair when you fly with wingman, about the only concession to reality the game makes.  If you have some friends to fly with, this game is pretty fun to play and the aircraft selection means you can all be flying your favourite modern jet.  If you don't intend to play co-op, stay away from it.			",474,95,17,54,90,5,120

To my surprise it is not a bad game at all. Mutliplayer doesn’t work. But the campaign is fun. The plane 3D is very nice, and you can unlock more planes by passing each level.  So don’t expect a top notch game, but the game is not broken and it’s worth $2 if you get it on sale.			",58,2,6,3,51,1,45

												Fun game. Not great, not award winning, probably not worth the $10, get it on sale.But it's a good way to kill some time, especially with the recent lack of flight games. It's not a realistic simulation, but I wouldn't call it arcade either - it's much less arcadey than Ace Combat, but it's simple enough that anyone can pick it up, have some fun for 45 minutes then go back to reality. If I were to pretend to be a game critic I would rate it 7/10 for the casual gamer that likes military stuff but doesn't have time to learn the ins and outs of a full sim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming into this game I was hoping for a more simulation style Ace Combat, unfortunately that is not the case. First thing I did, as I do in all games, was check the key layout and controls for flying with a keyboard. It was doable in writing, unfortunately, it's poorly executed in-game. The throttle up key (arrow key up) does exactly that it throttles up, however it also turns the camera  in-cockpit 90 degrees left. Slowing down (arrow key down) does the same thing, it throttles down with the expense of turning your camera 90 degrees right. Also, before purchasing JASF, I read in multiple places that the game can be used with a joystick/gamepad/Xbox 360 controller. Nope. I restarted the game (with Xbox 360 controller connected) and was prompted with the ""Enter"" key as well as the arrow keys for navigating the menu. Fair enough, the menu is keyboard exclusive, I can understand that. As I went in-game I soon noticed that there were new icons. For instance, instead of an arrow key, it was the ""A"" button. I pick up my Xbox 360 controller and press ""A"" for a solid 10 seconds... Nothing. The voiceover is still going, droning about my important task at hand. I keep pressing ""A"", then ""B"" then every other button on my controller. Nothing. For a game that is ALSO on Xbox 360, there was a transition error or flawed coding to not have a smooth transition to PC. Graphics: Not much concern. Although, I did experience some screen tears and occasional stuttering throughout my loop-de-loop camera turning spiral into the end of the runway. Nothing gamebreaking however. Planes look good, environment is minimal but effective. Cockpit perspective looks alright. Not much criticism here.I'm a huge fan of the Ace Combat series, I've played hours upon hours of IL-2 Sturmovik for PS3, even more on Heroes of the Pacific and Secret Weapons over Normandy for PS2 and many more airplane specific games (I'm not going to include Battlefield games because that's somewhat taboo to flight simulator enthusiasts). So, it's safe to say that this is no user error, this is a game with potential, but failed to properly execute the most basic of video game tasks, the controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is truly an awful game. Having played the old Jane's ATF I agree with other reviewers, this game is completely undeserving of the Jane's name. Even in the vein of arcade arial combat games like Ace Combat, this game is poorly made. The missions are boring, the story is extremely thin, the voice acting is quite literally some of the worst I've experienced in a game, and the graphics are subpar for a game as new as it is. In all honesty, stay away from this title. It's truly a waste of money. You're much, MUCH better off with the original Jane's titles from the 90's, Strike Commander from Origin Games, or going out and buying Ace Combat and a PS2 to play it on. Bottom line, don't buy this game!			",163,11,2,17,18,0,26

												There is a lot of hate for this game, but it's really not that bad.  Some people say they can not run it..  That WOULD be bad.. But it wasn't a problem for me.The game is casual fun with ho-hum voice acting.  The screenshots in the Steam store exaggerate.  It doesn't look that good, but the graphics are adequate.Plug in your flight stick because the game recognizes it and that is a good thing. Go in below enemy radar and with lowered expectations.  When the game goes on sale it gets steeply discounted.  Timing is critical for success.  Grab it at the right time and you can enjoy a set of simple sim-cadey jet missions for very little coin.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did, but it just felt like a really cheap ripoff of Ace Combat or HAWX. Janes always seemed to air towards simulation games, but this time they've gone total arcade. The flight simulation was terrible, even more arcade-like than HAWX. I disliked it so much, I stopped after about 20 minutes and won't go back. Unfortunate waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game most likely sets itself in the description as ""Simulation"", it's not.  And for that matter, I do NOT recommend it to the average player. This being said, I did indeed like the game, but I do not recommend as it has a mislabel.Jane's Advance Strike Fighters is completely arcade; the only physics to the game would be your thrust with minimal turning resistance based on the plane. Upon playing it, I do not feel any other force such as the pull of gravity when pushing the nose down, so divebombing is mainly an easy tactic on ground forces.It's a great time killer, but the difficulty is pretty hard even for 'Normal'. The one thing I'd hate about this game is that the physics also applies to missles- they are not realistic.   To dodge a missle, your plane has to be a good 80-100 degrees perpendicular to it... and a certain speed. Or else you will be spammed from all angles no matter what your manuevers are. I personally do like this as my hobby of airplanes is the A-10 Thunderbolt, which is useful at the beginning of the game, but soon gets overwhelmed and hit by missles from all angles JUST because the SPEED isn't fast enough. I have no problem handling this airplane in 'simulated' games such as Ace Combat, Hawx, or DCS Universe. This puts VERY hard aggression on difficulty and on levels you will face many deaths because of this flaw- the good thing is that every in-mission objective is its own checkpoint to restart from... but your time flying from point A to point B and repetition of in-game voice will be super annoying. This game does feature some level with friendlies... but they mostly get killed in the first few minutes, even if you're quick to destroy the enemy fighters. And by ""Some"" levels, I mean about 2-3, out of a good 20 missions it has. (approximate)   You will be mostly alone listening to the dialogue of your Base Control and your Pilot... which in honest opinion Base Control is a very stupid decision maker sometimes and often contradicts himself... let alone your pilot sounds like someone who's very enthusiastic... but doesn't know anything that's going on in the world around him.  Most of the time I'd just want to fly back to base and bomb it. Gameplay is quite fast,  as said it's arcade, but it's pretty good in non-heptic moments.  There's bugs in the game, sometimes it will crash on you in-game so expect those grudges. There was even a moment in game where a convoy I was supposed to protect was killed... I got overwhelmed. Yet a fail screen never came up: the dead convoy's dialogue continued regularly and I ended up finishing the mission with a completion.  Okies.... The game does offer some challenges, perhaps a third to half the missions require you to fly low through enemy territory (which amusingly the enemy territory is down the block from your base... I don't know how they never bothered to send a bomber squadron over) so many of of the missions are air-ground combat with missle defenses shooting at you and you looking for a radar tower nearby before continuing with whatever objective you are to destroy. What I do like is a nice double-tap boost the game offers, makes you flick your afterburners to ridiculous speeds close to the ground, the graphics is nice, and the pressure on turning changes dramatically, so make sure you want to do this where you can fly straight. Soundtrack is repetitive, but quite calming at times.  I do like how ever engagement changes the music, so you'd know if you're being attack and you won't go crazy with the same sounds over and over.Overall, likable game to the Arcade person. Completely disliked by those looking for simulation. For the price... I'd say get it on sale. It's not really worth a full price. Pros Very Arcadish, Time waster if not too serious Soothing Soundtrack, not obnoxious. Good airplane graphics and building detail, terrain graphics could be better made.Cons Not Simulative: Querky missles will RUIN your day Poor Dialogue to the main roles Lonely feeling many of the missions- Enemies can easily overrun you Enemies have slightly LONGER firing range than you- WATCH OUT. Take the easy one at a time to win. Hitboxes on ground units may be bugged.. rendering machinegun partially useless (But it still helps) ",104,14,7,5,22,0,9

A poor mans Ace CombatLets first go over the good points of this game:It is fun to fly jetsThe planes are prettyNow that that is done, a few of the bad points:The graphics are bad, and the options avaliable are extremely poor: ""AA: yes/no"" and resolution. Thats it!It tries to present some grand war, and you in it, but you never fly with wing-men. Always alone. So lonely...Oh dear god the story. I just can't be bothered, I can see the ""amazing"" and ""unexpected"" betrayal coming from a mile awayThe voice acting... No. Just. NO.The UI, you can never tell from where you are being shot at or where the closest hostile is. The radar is tiny and mostly pointless.Don't even try to play the game with anything other than a Xbox controller. Because it will fight you, and fight you hard.The extremely uneven difficulty level, some missions are a breeze and some will make you tear your hair out.All in all AVOID!			",111,34,6,25,43,3,43

												Consider this a flight ""simulator"" for those who really don't want a flight simulator. It reminds me of some of the very old Sega ""flight simulators"" that just threw you in a nearly indestructible plane with unlimited ammunition to blow up the Red Baron (or whatever badguy you prefer). If you want to kill a little time flying planes that ""feel"" identical, with the only challenge being repeated attempts to find control combinations that work rather than conflicting, it may be your game. I grew up on some of the older, better Janes simulations and this was a real dissapointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Friend sent me a coupon for the game which brought the price down to $1. The funds in my steam wallet dropped the price further to a total of $0.55. Probably still too much for this bad HAWX/Ace Combat knock off.If you are like me and played the older Jane's flight simulators long ago, this is nothing like them at all. Gameplay is at times incredibly boring and at other times can be frustrating due to the terrible UI. If you're interested in aviation at all, this game will probably confuse you with some of the things they decided to do, like the F-22 having external hardpoints, or the A-10 having afterburners.The planes all handle roughly the same with the biggest difference being their weapon loadouts, which is still pretty same-y across the board. Excited to fly the A-10 because of the GAU? Too bad, it is the same as every other plane in the game. Excited to fly the F-22 to be super stealthy? Too bad, stealth doesn't seem to actually do anything in the game.To end - This is nothing more than a console port of an already bad knock off. There is nothing to enjoy (besides maybe the hilariously bad dialogue) in this dark spot on the Jane's legacy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible game. Jane's should be ashamed to be associated with this. They have sullied their name as far as I'm concerned. If you're looking for a sim, keep looking. If you're looking for an arcade-style shooter well, maybe give this game a look. It's typical arcade shooter fair with terrible voice acting, crappy controls, tons of enemies and only a limited grasp of physics. Got it because I thought it would be fun with my new Thrustmaster HOTAS. I was wrong. The throttle is terrible. It always wants to go to a neutral speed no matter where you have it set.

												If you're a veteran gamer, there's a good chance you'll remember the Janes series of flight sims from the late 90's, which excelled in detail, but were playable by casual gamers. Forwardwind 22 years, and I was excited to see that there was a new Janes sim just released.After playing it for a few days, I can honestly report that the only thing in common with the earlier sims is the name.It is rare that a game will come out with less features than it's predecessor, but that has been achieved here.Full of game killing bugs, altitude limit of 10,000 ft (WTF ?), crappy dialogue, laughable scenarios, graphics barely better than the original, it is a sad and underwhelming addition, and certainly not worth the $30 paid for it.In fact, I'd bet the original games are still better than this pile of tripe.Please Jane's, don't end it here. We love and miss you, and just want you to try harder. Much harderCome back, make us proud again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: September 10, 2016
												My first review of Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters, and any game for that matter.So first things first, it's Jane's......Yes Jane's, mostly known through NATO recognition books and it's WWII simulators from the 1990's, most famous being Jane's WWII Fighters which came out in 1998. After that no one heard from Jane's again until 2011 when they released this game.I want to point something out, I have no idea why this game got SO much hate, it's the first time that the team at Jane's ever came forward with a developed game with consoles in mind, XBOX 360 and PS3, PC was already on their cards for this game.Onto the game itself, now, in the style of the early Acecombat games. You are flying as part of an air force of a tiny but overrun republic which is in itself, close to collapse at the hands of the Northern government and the NPAF forces. There are 16 missions overall and dare I say it they are nicely laid out! Plenty of area to fly around in and having the ability to carry more than 2 weapons on your fighters, which is something Ace Combat never did, so pat on the back to them for including this.Another good point is the amount of aircraft you can choose from, again in Ace Combat style you have factual aircraft, prototypes that flew or mysterious/fictional Superplanes. All handle well and some are a bit overpowered than they should be. The 3D models are quite nice, however the damage model is non existent, but with what you get into it doesn't really matter.Looking at Mission design, Yes a couple could have been tweaked a little bit but it's not really noticable, how you execute the missions are down to tactics and what logic you can utilise whilst carrying out these missions, and also it depends what type of plane you choose as well, well with the large selection of 30 fighter jets you have a nice pick and mix bag on how you want to go through your missions. Next, the AI, now given credit where it's due the AI DO FIGHT BACK, which is a nice touch, and they often outsmart you when you're being blase towards them and they don't mess around either! from the Hedgehog AA's to the defending fighters you WILL have your hands full when the mission is at it's climax!Onto the final points, and a bit of personal thought on the game, Yes it's not as and never will be as good as Acecombat, but give it a chance and it can be enjoyable if you love a not too hard paced flying game. Unfortunately what they DID try to do with this game, was to try and get a ''Simulaton'' feel to it, which it does feel like in SOME areas of gameplay but not all of it. Another bit of personal thought and I have a feeling it's why Jane's got so much hate, was Acecombat Assault Horizon was released the same year...I don't think it was JASF's fault. It WAS against hard competition so I feel that the game was released when it's far superior cousin was on the shelves and it ran into the obsolete trolley instantly.Do I like it more than Ace Combat? in the long term no. Do I respect the game for what it is? Yes a lot! Do I like it better than Assault Horizon....?....Actually Yes! It's a good throwback to the original Ace Combats on PS1 and PS2! Which I think if Jane's had come out on PS2 with these graphics...it would have had fair competition.Overall I think this game is great and it DOES deserve to be played for what it is. I guess I am probably one of the few users that stands up for what this game is.All the best to everyone and thanks for reading my review of Janes Advanced Strike Fighters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is honestly a mixed bag. I played Jane's United States Air Force around 2000 and it was a good game. This game came out years later and it looks worse than it's predecessor. The aircraft list is awesome and the dog fights are fun. However, the level design is uninspired, radar missions are attrocious especially in Co-Op, voice acting is terrible, and the story is bland. This could have been a much better game if those points were improved. If you are REALLY itching for a combat flight sim, put this game on the bottom of your list. I'm still recommending it because the flying is good but you may have to deal with problems that could have been fixed if more time was put into them.			",158,4,1,7,13,0,9

												Game returns a .net framework/directx error on launch. It can be resolved by installing an earlier redistribution. It's locked at 30fps. It supports gamepad, in theory, but on Windows 10 I haven't been able to get the thing to read either my Logitech Flight Stick 3D Pro or my standard X360 variant. I don't have the patience to play what's considered to be a very subpar flight arcade with the keyboard, at 30fps. Do not buy, when there are few, but better alternatives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just doing well enough for me to stick with it together with my friends, going through co-op campaign.Pros:+ Well-done aircraft models+ Co-op campaign (sadly, most of games today lacks this feature)+ 30 different planes to fly around including F-22, F-35C, PAK FA, my favorite Eurofighter Typhoon and a fictional SR-77+ Big maps (it's really big)+ Somewhat challenging because the enemy keeps spawning like zerg swarmCons:+ The bullet particle effects and models are too simple, you just can see some orange-red stripes coming from the gun, not the true bullets.+ Lack of cockpit camera+ Weird control+ The camera in reconaissance mode is very bad, it makes me crash to the ground many times+ Weapons are almost the same+ Guns have no cooling time so you can just fire the gun non-stop+ No steam cloud support (every time I play with my friends from a internet cafe we have to play the campaign from the first mission, although we can upload the save to some cloud storage but lack of steam cloud support is somehow unacceptable and inconvenient)*REMEMBER: this game is not a simulator game, it just an arcade one, so don't expect any flight simulation in this game :D And just buy this if you're going to play co-op campaign with your friends and only when it is on sale or you have a discount code :D			",283,58,12,53,35,3,44

												Honestly, this game sucks.The basic idea isn't bad at all (even tho it's nothing new), but the game is very lazy developed. First of all: The Tutorial didn't get redone for PC. It shows the X-Box Gamepad icons, while it doesn't even Support a Gamepad Control. Secondly, the Control of the jet is way to hard to get into. You're gonna crash a ton of times, and as you might guess after 50 explosions, crashing isn't funny or entertaining anymore. I can't tell you about the Story because i quit the game after not much time at all. All i can say is that the Voice Syncs suck badly and the accent of the speaker isn't too easy to understand (No Racist).If They'd put some more effort into the game it might be worth it money but right now its not even worth 1$.GG Devs  >:/			",73,16,0,10,7,1,2

												1/10Absolute Garbage. Do not Buy. Not even set up for controllers properly, graphics look like something from the early days of PS2 or Xbox, and does not even run properly. Worst single buy from my collection.			",293,97,5,50,32,3,34

												Post mission stats:Ait Targets Destroyed: 11Ground Targets Destroyed: 16Missiles Evaded: 107Mission Time: 11:10.... that's 1 missile that missed every 6s of play. Its insane, you're just bombared with endless warnings and demands to launch counter-measures. Taking into account the missiels that hit and the time spent flying to and between combat areas I probably had missiles being fired at me every 2-3s during combat.This game is not a simulation, its an arcade game pure and simple. Mission 4 was the last straw for me where you get unlimitted F-10s spawning from an airfield right next to your ground targets which launch and before reaching you fire off about 3-4 missiles each ... you can't even clear them from the sky and then focus on the main targets as they relaunch and are on you within about 30s. I finished the mission by forgetting all tactics and proper target priority and simply taking the defenders fire while I hit the main targets, praying my armour would hold out. Another problem with this game are the guns. Its almost impossible to hit anything with them. Its good that all your missiles/bombs get re-stocked every 5s or so because you're entirely dependent on them, even the thunderbolt is there solely as a platform to launch ordnance. Trying to think of some positives to keep this review vaguely balanced all I can think is that once I started using my controller (rather than keyboard/mouse) the flight controls were quite easy to master with low level flying quite easy to get to grips with (although I was a bit disappointed when I accidently flew through a tree and it just ghosted through me). Yeah I know, even my positive section isn't hugely positive. I guess the best part of this game was that with a 90% off coupon I bought it for about 80p... I'm not really sure it was worth it.I have Lethal Skies II for my PS2 in a cupboard somewhere, its over 10 years old and better than JASF in every single way imaginable...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worst flight sim I've ever played, and I really wanted to like it. 360 Controller doesn't work, random crashes, no support from developer. Stay away, this is junk.			",50,1,0,5,4,1,2

												Good fun, a bit of a dodgy Xbox port so be prepared for possible bugs and is using KB+M a pretty naff tutorial. Having an alright time with it ATM. Would recommend if you can get it cheap or are into the specifications of the planes as although I don't know that they are correct it has history about each plane which I liked.

												Its genre is listed as simulation, I'd call it arcade. I used to play F16: Aggressor, so the move from that to Jane's was like leaping from a hanger roof face first into a field cacti below a silk tarp. The game promotes itself very well hence why i decided to buy it but after only 5 minutes in game i called it quits as it feels as read as Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X, very fake and physics that children enjoy. I'm done. Don buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, I bought this on special so I don't feel so bad. I managed to crash because after remapping (up from speed up to pitch down) my keys it flips to an annoying ""check my afterburners"" view when I pitch (instead of speed). So I feel cursor keys should point the plane? And there is no way to fix this in the menu. Ah well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The price it's too high, I bought it for 1 euro and that's the real price with the coupon. It's a low budget game.I'd rather recommend you to get HAWX for the same price and much a better game. The planes are aren't real nor the place so yeah, not too many good points about this game.

												Arcade game without any realism or flight physics. Has nothing to do with those Jane's simulations. Bad controls and no tutorial. Absolutely dumb AI in single player. Graphics is pretty enough to take beautiful screenshots of the plane, but no more - terrain is terrible. Not worth the time.			",90,12,1,14,15,0,36
