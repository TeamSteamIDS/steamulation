												1 install; that's all you get before the hoops begin! Your purchasing the right to install this simulator without hassle ONCE; after that you have hoops to jump through; if you ever reformat; switch rigs or bought this on steam for the convenience of it being in your steam library your in for a shocker of  ""this key has already been registered"" if you ever reformat, change hardware or switch machines. This archaic form of DRM completely negates any product review I would have given as it overshadows every aspect of the simulator. This guilty until proven innocent DRM needs to go.

												Don't buy it, just don't.The game itself is nice, fancy stalite images and stuff. The reason why you should not buy this is the following:This game uses not steams licensing model. You need to enter a Serial-Code to unlock it. You get one of them when you buy the game through steam. But as soon do a clean reinstal (for example new OS setup), you have to enter the key again and you get a message saying ""The key is already in use"". I contacted their support three times (with 2-3 weeks between every email) to ask them to reactivate my key. They just ignore you and dont answer. Even when I thread them in the 3rd mail to take legal steps they just ignore you and don't answer.After that I contacted Steam support and asked for a refund, as I obviously paid for a product I can't use now. They just told me I have to contact the Ikarus (author company of aeroflyFS)...To this day I still have this game in my library that I waste 50$ on and cant use it because of their bad customer support.Please do not buy this and do not support such a company! They just want your money and leave you with an unuseable product after!			",62,8,1,4,24,0,21

												I will admit this game has outstanding graphics and game-play, BUT. once you change OS or buy a new rig, you need to ALSO re-buy the game... in order to play the game you need the CD key they give you which can only be used 1 time. and thats it. uninstall the game, or use a different computer it will say that your CD key is already in use... and trying to contact someone to refund/re-activate your key is not going to help, I have tried contacting them multiple times and gotten nothing helpful at all... I also tried getting my refund from steam support and got no where either... if you are down to spend $40 to use the game on one PC only... and one install only... go for it... if not... avoid this game and the developers...Gameplay 8/10Support 0/10Pricing 2/10Overall... Don't buy this game until price drops to around $10-15... maybe not even then... steam should either get rid of this Scam of a game... or atleast get rid of the 1 use only CD key ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												I always wanted to fly, and I bought aerofly FS a few months before starting real life flying lessons. The idea was to be in a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) airplane and familiarize myself with flying, but skip (unknown) procedural parts. aerofly FS isn’t a full flight simulator like MFSX or X-plane, but to my opinion, it succeeds very well in introducing VFR flying. Flight dynamics are accurate; I spent most in-game time in the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, flying VFR over Switzerland, and landing/taking off at all airstrips. I use real VFR circuit patterns and airspace classification information to add to the experience, and just fly VFR flights from one place to the other. I also do a bit of airwork, e.g. maneuvers (stall recovery, steep turns, slow flight, crosswind landings) and procedures (emergency, circuits), but lack of resistance of joystick/pedals and lack of G-force loadings are not making the experience very close to the real deal. But none of these is the game's fault. In that regard, I miss other AI traffic, radio telephony with ATC, simple procedures (e.g. start the engine, turn on landing lights, VOR navigation), and maybe recording capacities. Few additions are planned, but it is still unclear when and how they will be released. Nevertheless, I love flying & I love aerofly FS. Out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, i don't really find this a simulator, it's basically just FSX gone arcade. First thing i noticed when i was in a plane, there is not one button in the cockpits you can touch, something i love to do is start my planes on my own. You can't even assign keys to like Fuel Pump and such. The game just tosses you on the runway and thats it. There is also no Air Traffic Control and the world is completely dead, there is no traffic what so ever, no other planes, cars, or boats. The towns are also complete wastelands, it looks like they just took google earth scenery from Switzerland and placed them on the game world, and the only place where you can find some buildings is the airports. The graphics look nice but the scenery when you are up close are not nice to look at. From kilometers in the air, they look nice but on the ground not at all, at one point i was taxing off the runway onto a road that looked like someone took a smear of grey that was the road on a smear of green that was suppose to look like grass. This game is not worth it at this price and should be at half its price.			",85,6,3,1,17,0,5

												If the Alps looks the same as it does in this simulator in real life then I better pack my bags because Aerofly FS is one of the most beautiful and well optimised simulations out there.Unfortunately, the detail Aerofly has put into its scenery has meant the sacrifice of detail in the simulation aspect of its simulator. Fuel mixtures, Air Traffic Control, A.I. aircraft and Autopilot are amongst a handful of things that are simply not present in Aerofly FS. It is very clear that Aerofly is meant to be a VFR simulator, with its comparatively small gameworld, small range of aircraft, and lack of radio communication, and whilst this is ultimately all-right, it may deter more experienced simmers from investing a lot of time into it.Despite lacking in a detailed simulation, however, Aerofly FS has understood and captured the joys of flying and sight-seeing very well. And with its simple control-scheme and variable flight dynamics, its a considerable investment for someone looking to get into the flight-simulation genre.			",91,8,2,6,29,1,20

												Good flight SIM, nice and easy setup. GOod flightmodel and scenerey. Only a few aircarft though, and you only fly in one well detailed area. That said, it's a little like the old MS flight SIM games in terms of UI and easy setup. Doesn't take a while to setup like X-plane, and it's a lot more poilished in the UI area.Good controller detection support as well.It's a great starter or casual SIM experience.

												If you live in switzerland or want to explore this country, its the best you can get.  You can overlay mountain, city and even town names. I used it to familiarize with unknown Airports and regions, before travelling there. But if you think you need extra realistic flight model, then buy Xplane or FSX and dream flying realistic... Anyway with none of them you will get the feeling of an real VFR flight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Announcement: aerofly FS Update to Version 1.2.0.7 
Aerofly FS 1 Flight Simulator, Jul 27, 2015

			Dear aerofly FS Users, we have published a new version to Steam. This updates fixes some smaller bugs we have encountered.		


I've played this game only a little bit and absolutely loved it.  Flying through the topology of Switzerland is the only reason I bought this and it did not disappoint at all.  The flight controls are fairly easy and it has surprisingly realistic physics.  Terrain and textures are really great compared to most flight sims.  Wish it had support for the Oculus Rift CV1, would be even more amazing with that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												aerofly FS is a flight sim for beginners and more advanced pilots.The glider and ultra-light flight simulation is really rather good.The sim can be used for training approaches and landings with single-engine propeller aircraft as well. There are plenty of airfields and nice scenery from Switzerland to fly in.The simulation is not that good for fighter jets, you need to look at DCS for high-quality simulation of those.However, jets in this can be fun still even if not most accurate flight simulation.The developers of aerofly also have different product for RC-plane and helicopter simulation and training (hook up RC transmitter to PC for example), if you aim at improving RC skills then that might be better choice.Depending on what you are after this does have good points and value for money.For relaxing and training with glider or ultra-light this is a good choice. For combat with modern jets you need to look at other choices.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I read all the negative reviews and was very reluctant to buy this flight sim. But boy am I glad I got it (for around US$8 equivalent). This is an excellent game for the money. Yes, it only covers Switzerland, but it does so in stunning detail. There is nothing generic about the scenery and no repeating patterns. Everything is exactly as it is in real life, towns look like towns and appear where they should, rivers and lakes are where they should be. The scenery is breathtaking and you will have to do a lot of flying to see all of it. The aircraft look, feel and sound real and they are fantastic. Yes they don't have alll the intricate details of a study sim, but they do the job just fine. I've come a long way with flight simulators such as FSX, X-Plane, P3D, DCS World, IL-2. You name it, I had it. And this sim is fantastic. I like the moving map which you can pop on or off and the info panel which you can hide or display. I like the way that you set up the controls, it is so much better than FSX, P3D or Xplane. I like the way my TrackIr works with it. I like the challenges (mini-missions) and Dovetail can take some lessons here for their crappy Flight School. I am simply having a ball with this sim and cannot believe how cheap it is. You're getting a whole game with 8 great aircraft, detailed scenery for a whole country, a bunch of missions/challenges, and something like 34 airfields, all for the price of one heavily discounted FSX add-on. Perhaps it is a good thing that I waited this long to get Aerofly FS 1 and for all the problems to be sorted out, because all I can see here is a really cheap, really enjoyable and really good-looking flight sim.

												High quality graphics and very smooth keyboard controls make this an excellent flight sim. The detail on the aircraft itself is impressive, ranging from seeing the steering components actually move to minimal, but visible, damage on the airplane. Landing and taking off is simplified.The biggest issue I have with Aerofly is the quality of the environment. Clouds are not highly detailed and the ground is very barren. The occasional cluster of buildings you might fly over (or through), are the ""large cities,"" while the rest of the landscape has nothing besides Google Earth-like textures. The mountains are nicely done though.Overall, if you are looking for an easy to pick up, quick to learn flight sim, it's hard to do better than Aerofly FS, but if you are looking for a serious, challenging, realistic flight simulator, look elsewhere, such as MS flight sim. It will entertain you, but not really challenge you.			",187,71,12,23,52,6,41

Have had great fun just flying about in the planes and flying fast through the canyons in the F/18. More to come for this game as the team behind Just Flight is getting on board too to help the sim progress.   So in short, beginners to experianced players will enjoy this, but if you're looking at getting under the skin of how flying really is, head over for FSX or X-Plane.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not alot of planes, water is solide and you can land on it, water color is a very light blue that i've never seen before, there is not much to do besides take off fly around and land, no missions that i could find, It is also kind of expencive for what you can do in it.I would like to see more to this game like:-Fix the water-More planes like big passenger planes and/or cargo planes and Seaplanes-Missions, or make them easer to find-Time trial races-Fun obsticals, like bridges to fly under or tunnles to fly though-Add a stunt plane course bolth for the time trials and on free fly			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With beautiful Switzerland landscape and nice flight models this flight simulator looks good if you haven't flown it yet. But first thing you will notice is that nothing really works. Try switching something via your cockpit buttons and you hit a wall because there is no functionality on the buttons.Being only limited to Switzerland is also a very big downside. The world also seems unreal with only sun shining all the time and bright colours. Because the sim is so limited it cannot really compete with X-Plane and FSX. It is only good for soaring. Unless the developers expand the world and give more indepth features for it i dont recommend getting this. You can get quality addons for fsx with the price of this game that give as high level of detail to Switzerland as is presented here and you can use it with much indepth simulator FSX.

												I played this game months ago, and it might be some of the reason I am so addicted to other flight sims now. I played this with a Logitech Extreme3d stick a few months back, and I would recommend using a joystick for any and all flight sims. This game has some fun achievements that will get you white knuckled at the stick (stay below 500ft for 55 minutes in a jet through the alps??). That kept me busy for a little.Map isn't as big as I'd hoped when I bought it, but it's set in a beautiful area under the Matterhorn.Would fly again 9/10PS I was casual when I flew this and didn't have my a10c hotas, rudder pedals, trackir5, etc etc... just a Logitech Extreme3d from like 1999... also I wasn't into simulating wind so IDK if this game does that.EDIT: Just reflew with my a10 stick rudder pedals and track IR. all work great, The textures aren't as good as I remember (like a 480 photoreal.. the mountain textures look like potato au'gratin with spinach...) and no good autogen. I can barrel roll and backloop and Immelman (IN A CESSNA 172 BAHAHA) So not too realistic, but fun...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good but basic Flight Sim. The flightmodels are absolutely magnificent a very close replica to the real world equivalents. The default scenery is the best I have ever seen in a flight sim by a large margin especially on the highest of settings. Its a shame that you can only fly within one area and other world locations arent currently present. The number of default aircraft is slightly limited all thoughh it appears there are DLC aircraft available to purchase created by Just Flight (Only 2 at the moment). There is no AI so you are literally flying around by yourself, on a similar note there is currently no multiplayer mode available. That being said I think it is due to be added in the next version/ patch. The weather physics (e.g. Wind) is absolutely brilliant, it feels very much like real life especially through the valleys where there are updrafts and downdrafts & thermals etc, very good. The user interface is easy to use and looks decent. There is good controller detection support as well & the game in general is very easy to setup.As im sure others have posted it's a great starter or casual sim experience. It is worth noting its simulation experience is probably not on the same level as some products such as FSX, P3D & X-Plane but it is still an excellent product in its own unique way. Would deffinetly recommend to others.Cheers			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I belive this game does indeed succeed in producing a good flight simulator, different locations and planes, this game is extremely relaxing and good if you need a game to play after a long day. While the graphics could do with an uplifting and perhaps render water physics and more 3d models, it definetly succeeds in being a good flight simulator.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, I recommand for some fun times.I just wish the support was better, there is also a huge lack of communication from the devs...The content is lacking... I was under the impression more content was coming this year with an updated graphics, but nothing has been spoken, they're just concentrated on the stupid version of their game on iphone...

												This is only worth $5 at best. And hardly that.NO AUTOGEN buildings or structures ANYWHERE save maybe 20 around 3 different airports. Flying from one place to the next you will only see TREES and blobby ground textures, PERIOD.I am so utterly disapointed in this title, it just does not deliver in any way at all.Heed the warnings of all the complaints listed here. MS has screwed and tattooed the Flight Sim community yet once again. Thank you so much for KILLING the Flight Sim market Microsoft with al of your lies and false reporting on what it takes to run your outdated and bloated flight software[s].			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HEY KIDS!!! EVER WANTED TO FLY THROUGH THE AIR AT 100 MILES AN HOUR WITHOUT CRASHING!!! IF SO THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!any way it's perfect for flying semi realistic flying because flying planes is hard or else cars would not be a thing any more, also the land scape is smash your brains outwith a bar of gold beutiful. few problems it doesnt run on many computers, the water in the game is solid terrain... and lots of it looks like google maps towns. but i like it better that microsoft flight sim and doesn't my opion matter right now or else you would not of read this...

												I like flying games and racing sims of all kinds. This looks pretty good but I got bored with it pretty quickly. Maybe flying sims aren't for me. Landscape looks good from far away but there are no real details to building, trees, etc.			",42,9,8,4,11,0,1

												Excellent game - Great for glider pilots who want more practice or for trying out ridge soaring etc. Superb realism and good graphics of Switzerland. Must note; it is a VFR simulator, so don't expect ATC, traffic, and you can't operate all controls for example lights and engines (Turning them on/off, adjusting mixture controls etc.). Other than that, 10/10.			",55,2,4,3,4,0,2

												I do not recommend this game. Graphics arn't great and the controles are bad, and it's far too expensive. If you are REALLY desperate to get a flight sim, give it a try, you can always refund.			",130,18,4,6,29,2,20

												Devs probably put hundreds of hours of work modelling the interiors and exteriors for all the various planes... All of that so I can just skip through them and crash the fighter jet. 10/10. Would crash fighter jet again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a good flight simulator. Great physics and very good looking models. The terrain looks very good from altitude, but when you ascend to lower altitudes it wont look that good. There arent too manny planes, the map is very limited as its only switzerland, but atleast there is a jet :DUnless they give us a big patch with goodies like planes and other stuff, its not worth the 40€I give it 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I`m a long time Flight sim fan and this is a pretty decent sim if not as involved or technical as the likes of FSX or X-Plane 10. The flight dynamics are believable and the graphics and frame rate pretty darned good. It`s more focussed on looks than the tekky stuff so is a nice Casual program for taking a plane up for a spin. Would like to see helicopters in it.For Giggles and ♥♥♥♥s take the F14 through some contour flying through the valleys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
