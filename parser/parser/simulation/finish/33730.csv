												Driving is realistic. But the turning radius of the trucks is poor, and not much different than older games. But the graphics are much better, as well as the weather. But this game is a different type. It is not a serious simulator, it is an arcade-style game. But there is nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that the player can get tired of it quickly, with only three environments included. I do suggest that people buy Extreme Trucker 2, but this is not a bad game, but one that has room for a LOT of improvement.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It feels like I'm playing the original classic series of Euro Truck Simulator (ETS).But nope this game still can't beat the old classic ETS.It got no truck selection, no song, no profit management, and no job selection.Just plain move from point A to point B to finish a job.And the price is more expensive than ETS itself.It's better that you buy ETS, you will enjoy that game more than this one.

												The extreme thing about this game is that it gives you a chance to slide off the road in icy conditions. Its like the other games you need to get from A to B as fast as you can without loosing your load. This game puts you more into the wild conditions that truckers face everyday. It still is fun to drive a big truck. Its alot of fun to play when you have time to burn and want to know what it feels like to be a real trucker. Get it if your ever interested in that field of work.			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,477

IntroductionA simulator game where you work on your business of transporting and driving vehicles and goods all across the world, with environmental challenges to improve your business empire.Title: 18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme TruckerGenre: SimulationPublisher: ValuSoftMain ReviewThis is my first truck driving simulator game that I have ever played. The controls  are well crafted I think. The truck responds   and it's pretty immersive the way the perspective works out when you're driving. You do jobs and missions to collect points and some missions have harder vehicles or environments to drive in than others. Who would have thought doing such normal, everyday driving activities could be so engaging? I like the graphics and ingame sounds which continue the whole immersion feel. However I am sad I can't get the game music at the title screen to play. I would totally play this game for that alone.Pros and ConsProsDriving!Realistic controlsGood sounds/musicConsThere is no music in your truck :(No GPS (need to press esc, and press map) TL;DROverall VerdictThis is my first truck simulator, so my recommendation is not based on experience with this game type. Otherwise from my POV as a first time try-out, it seems good so I would recommend it from a pure game POV, maybe not for the price it goes for, though.If you like more of these review stay tuned forhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/jigglesandgiggles ",628,256,9,95,99,4,82

												In this game, you'll do only 'move A to B' task with no cash or new truck reward, no any music, under unrealistic physics condition(such as no collision with stacked snow. If you ram them, you'll just pass through like there's no snow in there.), annoying steering and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics.And also, no free roaming the universe after deliver. Totally not worth of 20$ seriously. Please consider 10 times before buy this game. Really! DON'T WASTE 20$ ON THIS! Buy ETS2 as instead!			",38,3,3,1,8,0,6

												Just got done playing 18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker. I was surprised that it was actually developed by the same company as the fantastic Euro Truck Simulator (SCS Software), but this played like a really shoddy prototype for that much better game.I played a few runs straight, one of which pretty much extended from one end of the first map to the other, got bored and tried to ♥♥♥♥ around a little and cause some chaos. The only thing that I could really do is knock other cars around the road and go offroad a bit -- which was more or less no different than staying onroad -- so there honestly just isn't much to do in this game, especially since I've played other games that do what it does (and more) so much better.The one nice thing I can say about it is that it does at least try to simulate ice (and apparently there are some other environments but I'll be damned if I'm going to bother to unlock them), which is something that ETS2 doesn't have. At least that I know of.Play ETS2 or American Truck Simulator if you want a trucking game. This just feels like shovelware trash, and based on the fact that it was published by ValuSoft Software, I WELL HMM MAYBE I THINK I SEEM TO HAVE ALMOST HIT THE NAIL ON THE CLICHE.

												Throw your weight around - Jump behind the wheel of over 25 different rigs and 30+ types of loads.Extreme Caution - Feel the power and adrenaline of driving terrains that no sane trucker would take on!Extreme Location - Travel across 3 hair-raising terrains including deadly ice, boiling desert and gnarly jungleYour Life is on the Line - Drive terrains that don't forgive your mistakes - do the job well or you might die trying.Extreme Loads - Transport loads that would scare even the most fearless drivers - maximum loads, oversized loads, high risk cargo and more.Extreme Deadlines - Achieve the unachievable by delivering your loads on time.These beasts don't drive themselves - From subtropical to subzero environments, manage your fuel and maintain your truck in peak condition.No matter how mighty or dangerous your load is - it is up to you to deliver on time.

												Just a quickie review.Bought it on the Summer Sale 2016 for 0,49€.The graphics are serviceable, not as good as ETS 2, but it's older, so it's to be expected. There are 3 maps, first about 170-220 miles long in-game. Going from one side to the other at full speed usually took me about 10-15 minutes to drive. You get 2 random jobs with random modifiers on things like weather, load's weight and the time of day. The driving is arcade-y and overall it still feels solid enough.The music's forgettable, but it serves its purpose. The winter atmosphere's quite good. Still haven't had the chance to drive during night time. Trucks are not customizable. There's no money. All you do is earn points which level you up. Leveling up seems to serve literally no purpose. I'm almost lvl 3 and I haven't received anything yet. You can't look outside of the cabin window, like in ETS 2. There are some custom events like seeing a toppled truck or a flying helicopter. Nothing much, but spiced the game up.EDIT: I made it to the Outback. This map is bigger and more detailed. But it also  has less branching road. There's basically one branching path. Also, the trucks have fans in them, which are a good entertainment to look at. Some of the trucks have pieces of metal fencing in front of the bottom of the front window. I love this Mad Max style truck! EDIT 2: Well, this playthrough is over for me. I consider this game finished.I managed to play the last area, the Southern American, Peru-like mountainous area. Definitely the most difficult road, Peru has nothing interesting going on for it, except for the more unique looking structures, like the junkyard and the beta version of the quarry that can be seen in Euro Truck Simulator 2. Overall: You can buy this game for a cheaper price than a packet of crisps. The game's fun enough for at least an hour if you have something to listen to/watch in the background.7/10			",544,172,24,62,101,8,72

												Bought within a set a long time ago and decided to play it again, so price isn't a factor in this. Also, I do not normally play driving games (racing or otherwise) and have not played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (newer by the same developer).I only played this game for an hour on easy and did not advance out of Canada. I did, however, complete 4 hauls.Pros:- Graphics were good enough for this game for being 5 years old.- Decent AI who would me and the fissures.- Good handling of the transitioning traction from snow to ice or ice to snow.- Simpler gameplay to 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul.Cons:- No tutorial (why do I need to slow down on ice).- Limited replayability.I enjoyed this in a ""drive a big rig like a Ferrari"" kind of way. This felt very arcadeish compared to the aforementioned predacessor to this game. Because I didn't fear falling through the ice, I enjoyed drifting my trailer around corners. I did enjoy the traction change from ice to snow or snow to ice, definitely can tell the difference between the two in the handling of the truck.tl;dr: In summary, I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of the genre, otherwise I wouldn't. 3/10 ",95,11,3,14,60,0,33

												Do you like Big Rigs? I sure do. This game is actually pretty awesome. Gameplay is fun, and much like that of an arcade game. Players take on the role of a truck driver, and you choose different missions to gain points to unlock other levels. Players generally get 2-3+ choices each level of what difficulty they would like their haul to be, the more difficult, the bigger the reward. Difficulty is determined by a few factors, mostly on trailer/cargo size, weather, time of day and other special conditions.			",669,397,8,131,131,9,122

												One look at this game and you'd think ""This is some stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"". You would be correct in that surmation, but what you fail to realize is that this game is actually god damned awesome when you get past the fact that you're just driving from point A to point B with some silly environments. It's fun as hell to go over median going 85, or drifting in the snow with a load of precious diesel fuel. They have these little hills in the snow levels, you get a good speed going you can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up when you launch off of em.This is a silly game for a select audience, but if its on sale for like $4.99 or less, I'd say get it, it's a nice distraction from those FPS' you play all the time.

												This game is very repetitive, don't get me wrong I think it is an awesome game especially when I’m at college and have to play in offline mode which limits the amount of games I can play, but it is very repetitive. By repetitive I mean that there are 3 maps and I thought there was only 1 map as it wasn't easy to find how to change between maps. The 3 maps are very straight forward literally! Because the maps are very long and that's it, there isn't many roads on each of them, they have a few turns hear and there but it is 1-2 main roads and a couple more smaller roads. Another negative about the game is how unrealistic the game is yet again don't get me wrong, the graphics aren't bad but the AI are awful, I will be driving and a truck will flip up into the air or a car will just suddenly roll over or disappear. Also on the Australia map there are fire engines that drive around, just fire engines no other emergency service and the problem is they do nothing, they aren't going anywhere which is something I can deal with but they are a normal vehicle, there state is as a normal vehicle; same speed, doesn't overtake. Last negative point I would like to mention is the trailer, the trailer in itself isn't registered as an obstructive object as cars and trucks will just drive into it, this can be easily tested by parking your trailer in the middle of the road and detaching it (Press 'T') so you can see the crash. I can be driving slow and a car will ram up behind me which loses me points and I like to maintain a 100% delivery rate (I'm sad like that).Okay now for the positives, the graphics to me are spot on, and the extras like indicators, window wipers and hazard lights are all there which is something I love. The road trains are the best things ever to drive because to me the longer the vehicle, the better. The physics feel good as well.Overall I don't recommend this game, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the way to go if you are after a trucking game, the maps are bigger and everything is much more realistic.

												OK, here goes...This game plays well, finnaly!I have a couple of things to mention though. The Option buttons are not very well thought outTo get a Steering Wheel to play in a driving sim, should be second hand, but finding the options button for Manual Transmission, Controller Activation, and such was a mistery? Until that is, I found the Manual, and noticed the author mention in small print about a ""BUTTON"" at the ""TOP"" of each  Option tab.With this in mind, the Mystery was soon solved!These ""BUTTONS"" are ""Orange in Color"" BTWHave Fun, I am now too!

												GHAWD WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!! do NOT buy this game.  It's the worst game I have bought in years.  The gameplay is boring; the physics and driving are from a game that's 15 years old; you can't even buy trucks; there's no in-game currency; it's just a dam rip-off. I wish steam allowed refunds for such terrible games.  The least they can do is take this game out of their store.  Yuck Yuck bleh bleeeeehhhh@@@!!!!			",1,0,0,1,9,0,5

												Not a bad game but not great either. It's not bad as far as enviroments and driving but it does feel bland compared to the Euro Truck series though. I will recommend it since its not terrible and glitchy like so many other discount simulators but I'd only chose this over Euro Truck if i couldnt run it but a decent game none the less.

												Worst game I ever got the grapics are the only reasonable, the map is so tiny you can go the full lenght of the map in about 1 minute (unless you crash badly). Also you have no freedom what so ever you can only pick missons from a very small list of jobs, and then it gets soo boaring soo fast and it's only a short distance and there is bearly and traffic. Also there is no reward what so ever just gain xp in the trucking carrier which opens more trucks and maybe same misson can't even buy a truck and customize it like you could in ""18 weels steel convoy"" If you buy this game you will be a major wast of money.

												I really tried to give this game a chance. I find something postive in almost every game. Almost^^Oh wow am I happy this game didn't cost me a single coin.I mean.. no tutorial whatsoever, no goal, no motivation.. every second of driving in any other non-driving-simulating-game brings more pleasure than this.Also, couldn't get this tanker to explode. 0/10			",62,17,0,7,6,0,6

												I'm not sure how qualified I am to rate this game as I only have it from a bundle and played it because I want to play every game in my library. However for me this was boring, I try to play 10 minutes of every game I try and I could only made it to 8. If you want to do crazy stuff for a little bit with a semi, play this game and do crazy stuff with a semi. If you want to drive along a predetermined route in a semi with no reward whatsoever for doing so in a plain setting that isn't the best quality, play this game. If you want to have fun driving a semi and feel like there's point to doing it, like getting new trucks or making money you can spend to get a better truck or having cool places to go or cool things to deliver or even just getting to choose the colors of your semi, don't play this game. I'd also not suggest paying $10 to do the things I said you can get from this game if you do want those things.			",350,137,5,74,41,4,46
