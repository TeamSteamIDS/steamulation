												I got this on sale with all 3 DLC expansion packs for 10.19 during the Black Friday sale. I'm an avid fan of the Port Royale series, and loved Port Royale 2. I was nervous getting this will all the mixed reviews, so it took me well over a year to finally go through with it.Overall, I thought it was pretty good. For anyone wanting a comparison of this to Port Royale 2, they are very similar in most aspects, with some differences good and bad. First off, trading in port looks very different. There's a slider to select the amount, as well as green and red bars to tell you how over or understocked (and priced) a particular item is. A lot of people hate this new layout, but it's really not that bad if you can get used to it. The town palace now holds both a town administrator and sometimes a governor to hand out distinct missions. This is a bit unbalanced, especially once you advance in rank, as bringing lets say 67 crates of tobacco can get you a hundred thousand dollar bonus. One thing I HATED was the nation's reputation system. It drops way too quickly on it's own, that unless you're constantly doing missions you're going to be stuck at 25. Also, when two nations form an alliance, your reputation between them gets averaged. This is the most frustrating thing when you're trying to take over a town economically and suddenly your 100% reputation gets dropped down to sixty because your mother nation decides to form a treaty. Fortunately, this also means that nations that hate you get bored pretty quick. Still, they can pack quite a nasty punch if you're not prepared. War is also completely different, but in a way I enjoy. Each convoy uses 3 armed ships each battle, and you control all 3. It's a bit tougher to fight and board enemy ships, but now you can't make a fortune capturing and selling Ship of the Lines. There's a really dumbed down system for attacking in the harbors. Most nations will first have anywhere between 3 and 10 military convoys you have to fight through to make it to the harbor, instead of the max of 1 in the previous game. And thank goodness they got rid of those annoying harbor cannons that would completely obliterate your fleet one ship at a time. Instead, you send in your three ships that park, bomb the heck out of a fort, and then unload your soldiers for a land battle. Pirates have no fort, just a gazillion soldiers. Luckily, they are a lot easier to take down this way later on, if not more difficult in the early stages. The last part I really like is that you can take over pre-existing towns forming your own nation (Long live the free people of America!). This can be done either economically (own 75% of a prosperous town, and then go whine to the Viceroy and he'll probably just give it to you). Or you can attack the town and annex it for yourself! If the nation you attacked liked you enough before, they'll let you keep it. Also, there is no more waiting til a nation is weak enough to annex a town. The only DLCs that seem to do much is Harbor Master. None of the campaigns seem to amount to much compared to the sandbox game. Still, the new buildings are very effective in preventing droughts, outbreaks, pirate attacks, etc. Ship building is pretty cool, if not expensive and time consuming. Still, it's better than having to travel port to port searching for that particular ship you want.Overall I recommend giving this game a shot. Not sure if it's all worth $30, but if you get it during a good sale I say go for it!			",35,14,2,17,18,0,13

												I grew up playing Port Royale 2. This game is a huge disappointment compared to that, you don't need to ever trade manually, you can simply start out with a strong trade route on the first day that generates 20k gold each month. If you try to fight pirates, you need to get at least 400k-500k gold to spend on warships to have a chance of defeating the weakest convoys even on the first day they appear.The campaign maps are horrible, they're just long tutorials (and can be finished within an hour or two).If you haven't played PR2 and are looking for a trading sim, this game might be good for you, though I'd still recommend trying to get a working version of Port Royale 2 instead.So, what does the game offer?Trading around the Caribbean, production differs in each city, prices change with supply and demand.Possibility to attack convoys and cities to plunder or even capture them.Missions (get X amount of Y goods in a month, find something on the ocean with some hints and deliver it), treasure maps, random ""drops"" you might find in the water (and you have to spot it and pick it up because it disappears after some time).Dynamic wars between the 4 nations, respect with each of them and reputation in every city (modifies possible missions).Setting up production facilities in cities to create your own goods (which is cheaper than buying them, so more profit).Events in cities like plague or gold rush, they modify production, life quality, demand for some resources.Control over multiple fleets (based on rank), each having one or more ships, they can be set on automated traderoutes (very easy to set up a profitable one, once you've done it it's AFK Simulator 2000).Mutliplayer (haven't tried it, can't say anything about it) - the only thing Port Royale 2 does not have.

												That's one of the best games I've encountered during the last couple of years. Despite starting to play a buggy and unstable release, I really enjoyed it. The gameplay is amazing, in my opinion, and by now all the bugs are gone (as far as I can tell, at least).The main idea in the game is to either be a pirate and build your own naval empire, or be a trader (my personal preferred choice) and build a huge merchant fleet, and later on gain control over cities.The game takes place in the Caribbeans, during the European colonization in America. Therefore, you can choose to be either Spanish, English, French or Dutch, but you're not limited to trading just with your country's own colonies. Also, even for people like me, who aren't die-hard fans of ""Pirates Of The Caribbeans"", it's impossible to miss the connection. :) The trading mechanism is quite realistic, and is a lot of fun, as you need to start small, trading stuff yourself, until you get rich and famous enough to buy more ships and more goods, so you can buy more ships and build businesses in cities, so you can manufacture goods yourself, which is obviously cheaper than buying them from someone else. If you're into trading simulation, get this game. You won't be sorry.			",233,98,1,103,60,0,70

												The internet claims that this is a mediocre game, and I disagree.  In fact I disagree enough to positively recommend this game.  Port Royale 3 is a trading and economy simulator with minor RTS elements.  It's not a perfect game, of course: boat combat is best left on autopilot, as is most of your trade empire.  That said, the challenge lies in learning the somewhat mystifying AI, fanaggling trade routes to suit the needs of the economy, and so on.If you are an econ nerd like me or simply fall for the simple charm of the story spun around Elena, daughter of the Viceroy of Port Royale, then give this game a try.  At its sale price, it's not too shabby.I would be remiss to not address the Metacritic score of 54 however.  Upon review of, uh, these reviews, I have determined that most of Port Royale 3's detractors succumb to puerile ""it's not as good as Port Royale 2"" grognardism.  For better or worse, I never played Port Royale 2 and therefore take this game solely on its own merit.  And for what it is, this game has been enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start with the end first.If you like the idea of trading in a pretty large scale, then this game probably fits your taste.When it comes to the actual trading aspect of the game, it's pretty straight forward. Different towns have different produce and needs. You buy where it's cheap and sell where it's expensive. The more goods you buy of a particular type in a town, the more it rises in cost and vice versa. Later on it seems to get a bit more complex, you'll be able to establish trade routes and so on, but on the grand scale of all, it's simply buying and selling.But there is so much more baked in. Maintaining reputation, new ships, crew, equipment, battling pirates and different factions, plundering, gathering influence in a town so you can start your own production, managing settlements, doing quests. I was incredibly surprised by the sheer massiveness of a game that seemed so simple.My only ""gripe"" with this game is that the different ways you can lose is not emphasized enough. 4 hours in and I was almost completly wrecked. The game went from ""this is to easy"" to ""is this the same game?!!"" in such a small time window. Still, I'm looking forward to restarting as much as it takes to win (Shogun 2 player haha).

												I'd recommend this game if it went on sale, but beyond that it's up to your discretion. If you're buying it for the trading get it, if you're buying it for the combat look elsewhere.The trading simulation is very good, much better than PR1 or PR2. Auto trade routes are very easy to set up as well, and it's easy to become a millionare fairly quickly on normal. If that puts you off just select ""my strategy"" and see how that pans out. Having buildings that produce and need various goods adds another aspect to think about. It's a bit difficult to plan without a map listing the resources, but I'm sure they have one online somewhere. In any case, if you hit the middle mouse button over a town in the map view, it'll show you the resources that town produces.The combat is... terrible. There's really no reason to do anything but auto battles anymore. I remember PR1, where you had massive battles (I think 10v10, it was a long time ago), and here you're stuck with a maximum of 3v3. As far as I can tell, you can't adjust the speed of your ships (or even tell how many knots they're going), and sometimes they randomly switch ammunition from what I selected. And trying to board a ship makes me want to pull out my hair. I had a set of 3 Liners with 250 men apiece lose 4/5 of their health and half the crew against a ship at a virtual standstill with 1 sailor and 3 hp left until they finally managed to board after I held down the spacebar for three minutes and my ships grinded against it for twenty seconds at a time until the boarding icon showed up. This happens nearly every time I attempt to board. And taking control and ramming the enemy ship myself never helps either. It's aggravating, to say the least.I also remember the challenge and feeling of accomplishment when I annexed a town after expertly manouvering my ships to avoid cannon fire from shore. Now all that happens is you click a ship, click a spot. Click a ship, click a spot. Click a ship, click a spot. Wait for fortress to be destroyed. Repeat for other fortress. Click a spot for a land battle. No more picking formations for your sailors. The lack of challenge and variability is awful.Other minor things:The graphics are fairly nice and it's fun to be able to rotate the map, something the first game couldn't do. The ""campaigns"" were very similar to each other and even had some tutorials on how to do the same stuff. And a tiny gripe is that there weren't a ton of flags to pick from, maybe seven in different colors. Not very fun. It would be cool to have an option to make your own flag. I also think player mods would be great, maybe someone would fix the combat system. And a few achievements seem broken. I've captured several towns but none of the ""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" ones have popped, and it's impossible to get ""Checkmate"" as you aren't allowed to annex a town if there are only two left. Frustrating.			",134,33,2,13,15,1,11

												You could spend your life playing this brilliant game. Well I have - .Just imagine being in a time where you have more control over life - no atomic bombs just cannons swords and primitive guns and your own skills.You travel from town to town as a merchant buying and selling and if you are good at it you amass quite a lot of money.You make a lot more when you gain experience and title then you get assignments from towns - and oh how good is that - you feel good because the town folk or government leaders talk with you and want you to marry there daughters.Going into a harbour which you eventually govern yourself if you take it by force or earn the right because you set up your businesses succesfully.It is simply idealistic when you have a wife who feeds you gossip and says nice things to you and you put on a fair for the town via the church then when the fair is going you look back over the ocean , parks beaches and watch the fire works at dusk and all your town folk are happy and celebrating.You watch the sun setting over the ocean at dusk with the golden cloud wisps - just brilliant.when you get good at fighting then when you aquire a letter of mark to fight a governments enemy you attack their treasure ships and really make a lot of money, like $1,000,000 plus their ships where by if you are systematic and patient you can build your towns, you govern, to the maximum defence and then they are fairly secure. You also collect taxes.It is great to have all these business's making goods for you and if you are savy you can sell all of it and keep the money flowing.Fighting is just so rewarding - my method - don't know whether it is the best or not, but works for me - is you build up to a convoy of 2 liners, 2 carracks, and 2  caravels. You go in with  a liner a carrack and a caravel. The graphics are the best I cannot emphasise how good it is and also the music is very very beautiful.You have to have tons of chain shot, grape shot and regular shot (infinite).Immediatly when the battle starts you select ""attack my convoy"", and chain shot for the sails  and all 3 boats shoot the sails out of one boat quickly then choose another boat to attack shoot its sails out etc.Follow up by shooting all the crew and boarding 2 of the enemy boats if 3 enemy then after that run around and collect all the swimming crew in the ocean by clicking ""give me a hand""  then board the last boat after you have shot out its remaining crew.Having 3 different boats to fight with makes it a lot easier to choose which boat to control.The trading is so well set up - that is the trade route convoys - which you need to do early as my memory isn't good enough to remember where you are upto with many convoys and tasks to complete etc. So some automation helps imensly.The harbour graphics are simply beautiful except when there is a drought.The minister in the churches where you can get missions but more importantly you get married and have celebrations etc is a kindly voice very rewarding.The governor cgi is very good although more could be done there - like your father in law could have more interesting things to say to you when you take his towns by force etc.I think the world view to harbour view is the best in this game the down side is when you look seaward  at convoys coming and going they just appear (only way you can do it) or dissapear aproaching the horizon. In ""rise of venice"" the different aproach is good but loose the realism of towns being a long way apart so look like suburbs instead. Still good just the choice the devs need to make.I liked port royal 1's  lots or a little business per town better than always 5.  Some gamers must have winged about it but more realistic to have maybe just 2 items say wood or corn at one town then 7 or so at another. I think if you start a new game then the goods need to change at the towns but keep the area produce still like dyes up north , tobacco in the middle and cocoa south etc.That way you have to learn the town roster again which keeps you interested.Allthough I liked the ex pirate den as your own town, as it was in the original port royale but  the way it is done in this version is better much better just that the pirate hideouts are so attractive with there smaller cabins etc i wish you coud get one of those and develope it but only cabins a warf a shipwright for free repairs etc and maybe the larger infinite supply hall.The only down side to this game is I liked the extra jobs you got from the governors like raiding an enemys merchant fleet and steel a shipment of wine or whatever or sink an enemy captains convoy etcBottom line -- I really wish the developers would grow this game to version 4 with the same beautiful or better if possible graphics etc. Use the same town to world map switch. A few more business'sSimply brilliant - 10 out of 10.			",22,4,0,3,6,0,0

												A great trading sim and empire building game. I kept a game going until I was ruler of the seas and was pretty much supplying every town on the map! The option to randomize goods produced in cities in freeplay mode game it a little more replayability.The loading times to load cities was a little annoying.The sea combat is actually pretty bad (I always let them autoresolve). Invasion battles also needed some work too (It would have been great if they handled like the sea and land battles in Sid Meiers Pirates!)			",73,28,3,27,37,1,48

												Surprisingly addictive.  I picked up Port Royale having never played any of the labels prior.  I was looking for a decent single player game to play while I was waiting for friends to finish a game or a match.  I ended up playing into the morning hours trying to capture every town and build them all into a force to be reckoned with.  The gameplay is simplistic, yet can be complex if you desire it.  Graphics are quite nice, and unlike most games in existence these days, the imagery is quite pleasant and calming. I would however, like to see more in the ways of campaigns or special missions etc to add a bit more to the game.  The pirates DLC was a nice touch, but it was very lacking.  Why can't the pirates take over towns, and then become the target of the royal navies?  This is such an untapped area of the game which would add so much to all the gamers.Overall scores as follows:Graphics/Visuals: 7/10Easy to learn:       9/10Enjoyment:           8/10Replayability:       7/10Overall Bill Score:  7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I may change my opinion if I ever play it again and discover more, but I found this game very lacking. I got it because I was interested in the exotic trade gameplay, but the gameplay is essentially this: on a map each town shows an icon of the product it is lacking. You then buy that product somewhere else and send your ship to sell it in that town. There is a little bit more to it, as you can buy buildings in towns and at some point there are enemy ships to worry about and such, but in a nutshell this is it. I thought the trade aspect would be much deeper than that. Despite all the changing numbers and stats in various menu's, this seems like a shallow game to me.An important aspect is the graphics. The game looked good in screenshots and I could really use a mini-vacation. Although it does at first look appealing, you qickly realise that all the cities and islands look the-bloody-same! I don't get it....maybe someone can explain it to me what I missed, but I do not get it, and so I kind of lost interest very quickly.			",69,5,6,5,12,2,7

												This would be a terrific economic simulator if the economics, y'know, worked.  What we get instead is a rather shallow system (oddly similar to the X-Beyond series) in which prices arbitrarily follow supply levels, without any regard to taxation, government, or anything else for that matter.  Likewise, buyout costs for existing businesses have nothing to do with the economy at all and are instead just linear figures based not any economic factors other than how much stuff you already own.The combat aspect works... mostly.  You're not going to see anything more in depth than you did playing ""Sid Meier's Pirates"" back on the Commodore64.  Grape shot for crew, chain shot for sails, ball shot for hull.  It's a trope-worthy as elves & dragons in a fantasy game.  Zzzzzz.  Actually, I take that back: Ye old C64 version was more invovled, because you actually got to participate in boarding actions and land combat.  This game just counts down numbers, and the bigger number wins.  The same is true of land invasion - it's a static sit & shoot against towers, followed by tossing more guys at the town than it has.  Again we saw more combat depth in C64 games from the 1980sDevo was Right.While automating trade routes can be interesting and appealing to any EvE Online ""Spreadsheet Warrior"" types, even that has been rendered mostly pointless in this iteration of the series through liberal application of random salvage finds and endless randomly generated mini-quests that pay far, far, far more than you'd ever make as an honest trader.Yes, they've added a few new buildings and game tweaks since the last version of the game, but they've left all the old problems from previous games intact and even added a few new ones.  The ranking system is just an excuse to add pointless grind time, the influence system is nothing more than an annoying, artificial obstacle that doesn't add anything to the game and the new pirate system makes about as much sense as the aircraft spawns in Silent Hunter 4.Mind you, I was one of those ""Spreadsheet Warrior"" types from EvE Online and even I can't enjoy this.  I can deal with the shallow combat, I can deal with the slapped on quests and the needless new pirate features... so long as the economic part worked right, worked fairly, and was believable.  Sadly, it doesn't, it can't and it isn't.  I've seen 1990's x4 wargames that put more depth into their economies than in this game that's supposed to be about trading.""You had one job!""The game isn't without it's merits, and I would love to see an ""Age of Pirates"" types game with a strong economic model and an empahsis on trade over combat done right.  Unfortunately, while this game gets most of that description down, it fails at the ""done right"" part.Note: ""But.. but.. pirates!  Action!  Adventure!""  Ok so maybe you don't want to play Book-keeping, the Game.  Maybe you just want to go out and smash some ships.  Fine.  Read above again.  You'll be even more disappointed than me.

												Good and Bad parts of the game;+ Taking over towns, that's really cool and you can also build your shipyards and i love that. Also it gets better with harbour master DLC.+ Being able to change the Nation's fate, being part of wars looks cool only bad part of that after the war is over your reputation with the other nation isn't rising after your letter's of marque ended, so it's like nation you're fighting for leaving you alone on the war zone.+ Pirates+ Effects of captains+ Sea battles+/- Too many advice...- I couldn't find any option about rising the populations of towns, looks like they're only rising with your own buildings(In fact you can change the town population to 0 and it won't rise back). If you consider that trading is limited with the population and it's not rising itself you can't do any mass production and if you do, you can't sell it. Ofc if you can rise whole 60towns populations on your own. But then you gonna feel lonely, it was much better at PR2- As much as i see military convoys don't attack to pirates and again you're all alone to do that. That's good when you have your own warships but if you don't, pirates gets too strong and plunder your trading convoys all the time. Pirates aren't big problem anyway but military convoys are looks like allies with pirates.- An other big problem about the game trading convoys aren't effecting your reputation with nations it looks like a bug(I'm saying that because it was effective on PR2 and it's really make sense), so it doesn't matter how many trading convoy you have, you have to fight with pirates, do misions or fight for nations all the time.    Tips;* Start the game with trading convoys(as much as you can, one or two ships without any sailor) make at least 8 trading routes and only use short and safer routes away from pirates or nation you gonna fight against.* Don't destroy the hideouts, put strong convoys to nearest town or at the sea activate patrol so whenever pirate convoy gets out the hideout your convoy take it down automatically so you can gain reputation and money. But don't forget the check your convoys.			",156,9,6,23,44,2,28

												I really like this game, you can create a lot of convoys and gain a lot of money, you can just get a city and build a lot of products and sell them or you can just focus on pirates/other nations convoys and play with the naval battle system.Too many tips and the tutorials are good to discover the controls but after that the Free Play is much better. The game can keep you hook on for very long time (I'm still in the first save that I had) because you take a looooooot of time to save a lot of money, buy lots of ships to make rotes, reach the highest level to unblock everything, get married, be the owner of the most of cities (I still only own like 2-3 and have the majority of 5-7) and everytime that I thought that I exterminate all the pirate activity another one appears x_xTip: don't try to attack the others nations till you have some good attack convoys.

												While now you can actualy take control on the citys,  you have lost the ability to create your own, which was the thing i loved the most. While this means you can make your own empire and eventualy own almost all the citys its not has good has having your own.Also you can only have 3 ships in a fight, which it is better than what happened in Port Royale 2 which you could have 5 ships ready to fight but you could only field 1 at a time and the A.I didnt have the restriction, but its still worse than Port Royale which allowed you to use the max 10 ships and field then all making realy awesome battles.Not a bad game, but i still prefer Port Royale 2.

												This game is ever so much fun. Here's how it works:Buy some ships and tell them where to go trade stuff. Watch the money go up until you can afford more ships. That's about it.Everything else is basically a sandbox. You can fight pirates, for example, but you can either do that very early with an inadequate fleet that gets killed all the time... or sit around with your thumb up your butt until you have oodles of money and can afford big powerful ships the pirates can't kill. Or anything in between, really. But you're the one who decides when or if you fight pirates at all. Similarly, you can buy a building permit in any town, and build a warehouse and residences and plantations and stuff, then run around dragging settlers to the town so they can live in the houses and work at the plantations and put stuff in the warehouse. Or you could, you know, NOT. Or, again, anything in between.But if you combine this with telling your fleet where to trade stuff, you can make one city produce a whole bunch of bananas and another city produce a whole lot of cotton so your fleet can trade cotton and bananas back and forth between those cities and make oodles of money. Then you can combine this with fighting pirates and use the oodles of money to buy big powerful ships. There's also some sort of diplomacy thing that goes on, but it's very shallow and pointless. If people don't like you, sell them stuff until they like you. By the time anyone is trying to fight with you, chances are you're filthy rich and sailing a fleet that can drop-kick them over the horizon. It's honestly difficult to make people dislike you, anyway. You essentially have to attack their ships and steal their stuff, but why would you do that when you can just sail your own fleet around and make oodles of money? Oh and there's some kind of campaign or something that is basically a bad animation playing in a window while a bad voice actor tells you what to do. Then he sits around and waits for you to do it, unless of course you don't care, and then you'll be playing for hours before he pops up all suddenly because you accidentally did what he wanted. There's no actual challenge here. It's very casual. If you like this sort of a thing, then this is the sort of a thing you will like. Also, I like the word ""oodles."" Oodles, oodles, oodles. It's almost as much fun to say as ""quark.""			",144,59,3,42,71,2,48

												This is one of those instances where the review system needs a ""neutral"" option.  I can't really say this game is ""Recommended"" or not.  Instead, I'll provide one or two angles to consider if you are pondering a purchase (hey, it aint that expensive so...)If you are taking this game out of some nostalgic feeling induced by hours and hours of PR 1 or PR 2 gameplay - get ready for a cactus in the rear end.  You'll love it for the first four, maybe five hours but then the dissapointment will set in.Why?Well, each of us who have had the pleasure of playing PR2 (and lets face it, those of us who really love games like PR2 are well underserved in the current market) will have had specific attributes of that game that we loved.   The obvious candidates there are:  Building up your very own trade enterprise, building up a fleet through combat or cash (face it - taking em is better and you get better ships too), getting your own island and MAKING it the way you like it (i.m.o the best part about the game).  Then there's the cheesy sword fights which I personally got bored of quite quickly, the ship combat which was rather well done even though it can get a bit monotonous after a while and so on.  Right?  Well remove about half of that and you have Port Royal 3.You can't win a patch of land anymore to build your own town and see it grow.  The trading dynamic, although majorly the same as PR2, just feels horribly less than what PR2 had to offer.  The supply and demand system from PR2 had been greatly lessened (or dumbed down?) and seems to be less dynamic in PR3.   Ship battles, although still barable in PR3, is a far cry from the enjoyable model we had in the previous title.  What would you have expected in a new Port Royal title?Well - for one, everything that made PR2 awesome plus the multiplayer that just about 99% of all loyal Port Royal 2 players CRIED for (and we cried...).  Sure enough we have multiplayer, but dear god what a lazy attempt at a multiplayer experience this has been.   Fair enough - a title such as this where gameplay isn't measured in one or two hours, but days or even weeks, mplay is a very challenging thing.  Out of the seven or so possible routes to go for such an experience, they opted to go for the tecnically simplest and quickest to implement.  That's just cheap.  One would also have expected that the AI and the dynamics of the supply and demand system be tethered to some kind of tangible link that leads all the way to colonists within towns.  Though this is in SOME measure true, it falls horribly short and this is where a massive failure from the studio rears its ugly head.  This is a game that attracts those of us who like to tweak, fiddle and tinker, crunch the numbers and see the results in terms of profit and the likes.  You took that away from us in some attempt to make the game (i guess?) accessible to a different crowd [is that the case? stop making games please]It is almost as if this game is trying to build on the marginal success of Port Royal 2, yet trying to aim at a different crowd..but not quite sure which one.   I might obviously be very wrong here.  Either that or games like this, which require some mental fortitude (i mean the previous title), has become dumbed down (by design or perhaps by the quality of those at the helm of the development) over the years.So this all seems horrible - it is, only if you come from the Port Royal 2 camp.If you are NOT familiar with the previous titles and a mangement style game is your thing then THIS is the game you start with before you move UP in the ladder to play port royal 2 (no mplay in pr 2 unfortunately).For you new guys to the title:It's a quaint and simple introduction into management style games based on the colonisation boom during the 1600's (more or less?) in the carribean.  yarr pirates and all of that.  You'll figure out quite easily how to set up trade routes, make a buck and play with the very simple concept of buy low sell high vs volume and demand manipulation.  Unfortunately the latter is not as much possible as in the previous entry of this title.  Look at this as a colourin book of sorts which will prepare you for the more mentally satisfying experience of games like PR2, the guild, patrician and so on.  It's a great gift for your 12 year old or if you have a friend who recently suffered a severe head injury and is struggling to add apples - this is the game you'll use.Personally [THIS IS AIMED AT YOU, DEVS] I do hope that a new entry in this title comes - Port Royal  4.  I hope the devs take the experience gained from the franchise thusfar and build a superior product.  [granted also, the company has changed hands and changes obviously affect such things - not to be too hard on pr3].  Here's to hoping (the gaming industry...god help us..) ",41,5,1,9,4,0,15

But once you get a handle on what the game is actually about and what you're supposed to actually be doing, you may enjoy this game.... that is you might enjoy it.

												Not a bad game if you can get it on sale and have already played Anno 1404, Sid Meier: Pirates, and Tropico4. Anno is the closest comparison, but the other games are close enough and far superior. Trading sim. Combat is absolutely horrible. Was a fun multiplayer experience with Venetia, but it took quite a bit to actually get the Multiplayer working. The developer doesn't seem that great and has already come out with a nigh identical sequal with no fixes to the existing problems. I vote no on this simply because the developer has no investment in making their games better and I would rather say no than say pirate it.			",349,27,0,55,39,1,54

												Nice and fun. For a while. Then it starts repeating, and you need to write down somewhere what sells what and what you already own and where. For example you basically need to write on paper how many different kinds of factories you have already built on a city.. but then you have already won the game I guess.74h, I am unlikely to play more, but I have still not uninstalled it.It is a mix of Pirates!, Colonization and Settlers. Too bad the battles are only with first 3 ships, and you cannot do a real Line Battle with your Ships of the Line. The battles are funny Pirates! battles, but not really authentic, but that is forgiven. The taking of towns is tacky, just clicking ships to ""dock"" on attack points and sacrificing them and your men to take a port. Could as well be automatic when you have enough of them.A lot of microing the boats, unless you have your trade network all unarmed and unmanned going automatic routes, not caring if pirates do this or that. After all the unmanned boats surrender their cargo and go for repairs. ""Striking rich"" is dependent on the availability of cargo on ports, and thus you need to make the factories, or have a cap on your worldly dreams. Otherwise you will never have enough, when you already have too much to even control.Still recommended for a few hours.			",41,9,0,5,16,0,20

However, you start to run into disheartening shortfalls (can't defend towns, clunky combat, tedious micromanagement to get around simple flaws) and you have to cut your losses and stop playing. There is a lot of potential if only the developers had been given a month or two to finish smoothing out the rough spots. Maybe an expansion pack will clear up these issues			",233,27,8,31,51,2,41

												I played it almost 20 hours and liked it, but I think Port Royale 2 is better. PR 3 obviously has better graphics, but that is it. The combat in PR 3 is very annoying because you have to control 3 ships at once but you have to switch between them all the time to get them to do what you want and generally you get a better result if you just let it do the auto-fight. In PR 2 you had always one ship against all others and had full control over the fight until you let your ship retreat.Also in PR 2 you could take out a pirate nest with a little ship, if you had the skill to do it. But in PR 3 you can only do it with brute force and giant fleets, which is way less fun.Basically PR 2>PR 3 but PR 3 is still ok.			",93,19,0,23,16,0,33

												I'm a veteran of the Port Royale Games.I like it. I feel like most of the Negative reviews come from comparing it to Port Royale 2, which in all honesty it doesn't improve on. But the game in no way deserves the heat it's gotten since release. If you want Port Royale 2, go buy Port Royale 2. This game ain't as deep, and it does lack a few features when compared to that game.One thing it does improve on is the Nations, and town ownership. in PR2 you could own 4 towns which you had to found from the ground up, and♥♥♥♥♥♥somebody off each time you did it. They'd also be dominated  by the Nation that gave you the right to plant the colony and your borders would never be continuous, you cold never lose them, never declare independence or anythjing of the such. Port Royale 3 fixed all of that in my opinion.Like a town? take it. build it. own it. defend it.			",58,15,4,34,34,1,41

												The strategy needed for this game is absolutely amazing!!!! Easy to play hard to master.  The town building is a blast.  This game alone is fun.  This game with the dlc is GREAT!!!!  The naval battles are a little plain but still challenging.  The replay-ability seems to never end...literally.  I recommend the PC version over console (more detail and the keyboard causes the menus to be more user friendly).  You can choose to have an adventure filled experience, and buisness filled experience or some compination of the two.  The amount of adventure or commerce experience is almost entirely up to you.  Story line/campaign modes are a little dry but the free play is well worth the money spent.  Overall this is a solid game that can be educational and causes you think.  May not be the game for hard-core gamers who want non-stop, heart pounding, breath holding action; but for everybody else...well this is the game for you.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,3

												Ah Port Royale, This is a great game based on trading goods and gaining fame and fortune. Eventually you will start to amass a fleet of trading vessels and own a monoply in both trading goods manufactoring and transportation. Once you start building up a naval fleet things start getting fun.    Port Royale 3: Pirates & Mercahnts did not quite turn out how it should have. With over 6 years in development the games base premise and overall play style did not develop much over Kalypso Media's previous release in the title, Port Royale 2.   Amoung the issues with the title is that is lost support within the first year of being released. Some bugs include Not being able to completly destroy a enemies military convoys. Some saves it will be possible, some it won't. Steam achievements are the same way. It all depends on the beginning and how the game plays out.    ",73,9,6,12,21,0,27

												This is my second try on this game to realise it's not as bad as it feels after Port Royale 2.This is certainly different from the previous game (Port Royale 2), it's hard to tell wheter for the best or for the worst. I'd say the combat is more survivable since you fight 1+2AI vs 3 in the newer version rather than 1 (with 4 in reserve) vs 5 like in the previous game. I did like the city takeover in the previous game however, I miss that land action combat, it's much too simplified in this game. I enjoy having your own town in this version better, since you can capture nearly all the map for yourself, however I miss feeling that starting from 0 and filling those empty spaces on map. Port Royale 3 seems to be a bit unrefined, but still enjoyable though. You would really benefit a lot from getting the DLC for the game, but that's extra €€€. If you're short on €€€ consider getting Port Royale 2, i'ts only slightly different, but still very much so enjoyable (I'd say you get more fun for € spent on PR2).I'd give this game 8 missing workers out of 10.

												A quick review:If you arre looking for a game to while away the hours (days) away on, you could do far worse than this game. trading is fairly dynamic, and resource management for your settlements can be as simple or as complex as you want it, though it  definitely rewards you for putting in the time. When you finally stop getting alerts that one settlement or another is lacking some resource for production, there is a real sense of accomplishment.Where I feel this fame falls a little flat is combat. It's a rather simplistic system, that feels more like it was ported from a smartphone app, than built for a PC release. And attacking towns is even worse, giving you absolutely NO control oncce your trrops have landed. In addition the fact that there is inly one possible map greatly reduces replay value in my opinion. Given what I know about the previous games in the series, while having upgraded graphics, seems to have downgraded gameplay in exchange.That said, do I still reccomend it? Absolutely YES. You will certainly get your monies worth out of it, and I can see it being one of those games you pick back up every few months to take further advance your conquest of the Carribean.

												A fun trading-simulation game about being a trader/pirate. When I play this I think of Jack Sparrow. Although I never played the previous installments of Port Royale, I do not have any issues with this game at all. The campaign is short, but a freeplay is available after beating the game. 8/10			",276,24,5,43,18,2,34

												I like this game! I first played this on the XBOX 360. It has not lost it's appeal on the PC. I was a little worried about how the controls would work, but it is very straight forward and quite easy to control everything. If you like trading games I would definately reccomend this game for you!			",18,7,0,22,23,0,17

												A quick review:If you arre looking for a game to while away the hours (days) away on, you could do far worse than this game. trading is fairly dynamic, and resource management for your settlements can be as simple or as complex as you want it, though it  definitely rewards you for putting in the time. When you finally stop getting alerts that one settlement or another is lacking some resource for production, there is a real sense of accomplishment.Where I feel this fame falls a little flat is combat. It's a rather simplistic system, that feels more like it was ported from a smartphone app, than built for a PC release. And attacking towns is even worse, giving you absolutely NO control oncce your trrops have landed. In addition the fact that there is inly one possible map greatly reduces replay value in my opinion. Given what I know about the previous games in the series, while having upgraded graphics, seems to have downgraded gameplay in exchange.That said, do I still reccomend it? Absolutely YES. You will certainly get your monies worth out of it, and I can see it being one of those games you pick back up every few months to take further advance your conquest of the Carribean.

												Bought this game about one week ago and just finished the trader campaign. Actually I was going to buy this game just when it was released in 2012. But as creator and administrator of the russian Port Royale 2 forum, i saw a lot of negative reviews of Port Royale 2 players. So i decided not to buy the game. What can I say? It was a big mistake! One should always get his own experience with a game!For me, Port Royale 3 is a really nice game and a worthy successor of former Port Royale games.I just want to list some of the advantages of PR3 as compared with PR2:- the story is more interesting and complex- the missions are not so monotonous and primitive- graphics are really nice (3D incarnation of PR2)- the ability to compete in the list of the best in various campaigns- multiplayer- sea fights are more realistic as all ships participate in the fight- the strategies for trade routes make it easier to handle thoseJust some disadvantages which i saw only a few:- the goods list shows only the half of all goods (on my notebook - maybe on higher resolutions all the goods?) and you have to scroll down - this issue is perfectly solved in Rise of Venice- If you attack a pirate hideout the land fight is automated and there is no possibility to operate it manuallyI recommend this game, especially for those who are fans of economic simulation games.

												If you are going to get any game from Kalypso, I would say this may be your best bet, maybe. If you can get Port Royale 3 or Rise of Venice for less than $5 than get one of those, but don't expect it to be fun for long. All of their games use a very simplistic trading system, used in Patrician Series, Port Royale, Rise of Venice and Grand Ages Medieval. They unfortunately use less and less commodities and seem to shrink the map they use for every new game. The very thought of making a game that uses the entire earth, and a much larger range of history? No, because they would have to actually do some design work, instead of sending out the same game over and over again, with a new location, for $40. Again I would suggest avoiding Kalypso games altogether, unless they are extremely cheap. Don't reward their laziness, buying game retreads.			",258,59,2,96,112,1,124

												As someone who played Port Royale 2 (of which this game is little more than a re-skinned version) years ago I'm sad to say that I can't recommend this. Many great features in PR2 are absent without much in the way of compensating innovation and the new UI is a bit too fiddly. I admit that my expectations were of course biased by my experience with previous titles. Maybe someone who has never played a PR game before will appreciate PR3 more. Still, if you want to get a taste for this sort of game then I strongly suggest that you instead pick up a copy of PR2 which in my opinion has aged fairly well.If you want to be a pirate, you'll have more fun torrenting this game than playing it.

												I have been considering buying this for some time.   I read some reviews.  They are not favorable (Gamespot's for example).  This is currently on sale for 75% the Gold edition with all the DLC.   I bought it last night.   I could not disagree with the reviews more strongly.   I often have strange taste in games compared to the majority.   This may be one of those cases.   This game feels a lot like Sid Meier's Pirates.    It however is focused on fleets that can run trade routes without you controlling them (other than telling them how you want them to handle the routes), while you can be sailing any of the ships or fleets around yourself.   You get to build and place buildings in ports, and run your economy.   I have so far only been doing the campaign that is based around trading and have only engaged in combat a few times where I was outgunned so my fleet handed over a bunch of cargo and I went on with my business.   I am enjoying this game and plan to play it some more today.   It has multiplayer as well, and I have not yet tried that.			",607,180,10,144,130,2,205

												This is one of the best games in the genre.  Similar to the original Koei New Horizons, Patrician series, Port Royale 2, Sid Meier's Pirates, Anno.  Buy ships and make trade routes.  Quests, taverns, ranking system, build boats, take over your own towns, grown the towns and build business and improve the city defense.  Pick your nationality and help them, maybe help others or go pirate.  DLC is worth having mostly for the harbor defense.  The steam achievements do not work properly... some work, many do not.  Great game overall.			",16,2,0,17,3,0,9

												I really don't know what to say about this game. It isn't very good and certainly lack upon a lot of things compared to port royale 2. Although they tried to replicate that old carribean feeling port royale 2 had, it feels souless as it lacks the big and tiny bits that bring out the wow! factor. It's patrician 4 into blue seas. Patrician 4 was great. This is just ok, especialy for the one who loved port royale 2.I will give a thumbs up cause i feel it will be unfair to lower the general score even further.

One addition i do like is the manufacture and town updates.Graphics 6/10Gameplay7/10I believe it is ver repeatative game play but each location you attack/visit has to have its own approach.Graphics are ok but can be ""jumpy"" at times. i had to turn mine down as i would see through ships that were docked.

												I really wanted to like this game. I have a bit of a soft spot for Mechant Trading games, and it has pirates! Honestly, I put about 45 minutes in to this game. A good 20 of it was frustrated swearing. I suppose if you have the time to invest in trying to learn the clunky controls through the painful tutorials, it might be pretty fun. However, my experience was as such. I jumped in to the campaign and I mean that quite literally as there is no tutorial given to you, you have to find it buried in one of the screens under a tab. And that hunt portends to the rest of my experience. ""Go trade some goods to another town."" I'll make this short, you load the world map, look at towns, try to decipher their system of icons (which I'm sure is welcome if you know what they are, but I don't, and it's a pain to learn them all right off the bat), then figure out the weird way of sending your ship to that town, load that town, go through the clunky interface of buying and selling, wash rinse repeat. If you change the time rate to sail, be sure to change it back when you get to your spot or it screws up your quests. Really, there are so many things I disliked about the game, that to name them all is as much of a chore as playing the game. I bought it on sale, but I'm still irked.  The gist is, if you are familiar with these kinds of games, this might work for you. If you have time to invest learning the strange way it's set up and manuevering it's poor interface, give it a go. Buy it on sale though, just in case.			",135,19,1,28,15,1,15

												Kalypos Media strikes again by producing something that is full of potential, and just falls flat on its face.For anyone who's played Tropico 5,  and wished for greater control of your trade fleets....here ya go.  This is exactly that,  only without the whole Tropico 5 deal.  Theres minor city building, but it'd need quation markes to be proper....Regardless,  We have a game with a gimmick that isn't entirely well done.  If you can get past the learning curve (There's no shame in looking up toturials) Then you get a classic concept of a game.   Put stuff on your ship, sail it somewhere, sell the stuff, buy stuff, sail it and sell/buy again.   Battles happen.   apparently an economy happens,  staleness sets in.  Lack of variey in ship choice, lack of variety in towns,  it really just plays like a very pretty facebook game.  It's unfortunate that there already is a game that mixes trading, city building, and combat.  It's called Anno2070.   This, I feel is the game that Kalypso wants to make, but just can't figure out how.  Which is a shame really because if they did,  it'd probably be quite good.    But no,  we'll just cut it up into three games (tropico, port royale, merchant of venice)  and keep rereleasing the same game ever so many years with a graphical update. TLDR - You won't regret not playing it.  Maybe if it's on  sale for 80% off,			",82,8,3,13,33,3,33

												There's not as much naval combat as I thought it would be and you don't have a ship that is ""yours"". It's not like Cptn. Jack Sparrow and the Pearl. Rather, you are more of a ... corporal or commander that gets to control larger groups of ships. The focus is a lot on the trade in the game and there, I can assure you, that it does not disappoint. Once you understand the controls, the trade becomes a complex task that is presented in a simple form. You can still enjoy naval combat in the main story, however playing a free roaming game takes at least the first three hours to simply force you to make money and upgrade your town (you can upgrade towns for profit btw, not great and not bad) before you can get all the cool ships.I'd say it's worth it if you like games like Democracy, Mount and Blade or SimCity.

												Waste of money. I played Port Royale and it was much better than Port Royale 3 in my opinion. As big disadvantage is that you have all cannons and cannonball on your ship right after purchase. No need to thinking about what to buy. More cannons, or more cannonballs? In Port Royale you must have money to buy ship and go to fight enemy. Now? Just buy ship. No fun for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game to people only if it's on sale and if you like playing games like chess. In game you can battle but I find I spend most of my time building and setting up trade routes. Also, the game freezes up alot and I have to log off and back on again to restart game.The company that makes the game does a bad job with updates. No suppport from what I can see. I say that because the freezing up should be fixed. I'm also getting mad about buying games that have bugs and glicthes. It's B.S. when you buy a game not a pre release and they want you to spend 40 dollars when it's broken from the word go. It's been a couple of years since this game came out and no fixes and no new DLC content = crappy support from a crappy company that's makes a crappy game.I think I did a bad job on explaining so i decided to update this review by saying this.If they called this game Port Royal 2 HD with new dlc content I would have no agurments about it and as a results proably would have given a thumbs up.

												I played a lot of P2 and P3 many years ago. I recently purchased the PR3 and P4, for ~$7, hoping to get back to it. P4 was a huge disapointment. It is a much lesser game in every aspects compared with P3: graphics, trade routes, battles, bugs. There are absolutely nothing I like. I did prefer PR3 to P4. If you are new to this, you could get going with PR3, it is simple, betterlooking and overall better than P4. The problem with PR3 is it is way to easy and the battles are also really boring.So back to P3 for me.			",13,3,0,4,6,0,5

												Horrible, absolutely horrible combat controls I've had to run the main campain mission 12 times because trying to board a ship is nearly impossible unlike the other games like Patrianer you can't even assign your AI ships to help you capture a ship you can only control the ship you have selected and only that ship even then you are more focused on when to click your mouse to fire off your broadside than your postion or tactics because you can't coardinate with your other two ships at all. I love games like this but the naval combat controls of this game are so horrible it turns you off to the game entirely.			",107,10,0,44,48,1,58

												I bought this hoping it would kinda be like Pirates of the Burning Sea...except without the PvP camping.  Or maybe something similar to a cross between Sid Meirs Pirates and POTBS.Turns out I was wrong.  Strange how there are few GOOD pirate games these days.  Oh well, maybe next game cycle around...

												The Caribbean, in the turbulent 17th Century. The mighty kingdoms of Spain, England, France and the Netherlands fight over the colonies. And there you are, a young sea captain whose only goal is to become the most powerful man in the New World. To achieve that goal, you may choose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an Adventurer or a Trader? If you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign for the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting, raiding; do whatever it takes to build your own empire in the Caribbean. And of course, trade will have a less important role to play in your rise. The way of the Trader is, on the opposite, mostly about developing your riches and your economic power. To be the most powerful Trader of the New World, you have to create trade routes, build industries and develop the economy of the colonies. Of course, in Free Play mode, you can mix both of those in any way you want, letting you create your own unique and exciting story. For the first time in the acclaimed Port Royale series, you are not alone in the beautiful and seemingly so peaceful seas of the Caribbean. The Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to play through LAN or over the Internet. Develop a successful trading company, lead your ships in beautiful 3D naval battles and force your opponents to their knees!			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												One of the worse games I ever played. Maybe I just can't seem to get the graps the of the game.Took me forever to figure out trade routes. Any of the pre-made settings sends you stright in proverty. You need to carefully map out the price of every item, the second I did I had pirate attacks nearly ever 30 seconds. I wish I was lying about that timing. When you lose a battle they plunder every thing you have on your ships. It forced me into so much poverty I had to sell everything I control. The second I was getting back on me feet the pirates hit me again. Once again sending me back into proverity. This time I have nothing to sell. The pirates are always, without a fail, twice as strong as me. If I stay in fight, my ships sink, if I run they take everything I have.Once again, maybe I'm just failing to get a grasp on the game but it seems the game wants you lose.			",3,1,0,4,12,0,13

												I put a lot of hours into this game expecting something decent to come at the end, but I came away disappointed. The game starts off fairly accessible and is fun to grind through what 'campaign' there is, but once it's beaten and you get thrown into the free-mode limbo of boredom, you may as well unistall there. There's no way to 'beat' the game. The only real ending is when you've decided that you've hit your personal best 'score' and uninstall it out of boredom.			",108,24,1,9,27,1,23

												Port Royal 3 is a turn-based strategy game based around building up a selected society into a world power.Port Royal 3 has no campaign, instead it simply allows the players to create a world of their devising and jump right into it either by themselves or with others in multiplayer. The biggest choice a player will make is what port they're going to play. And hell yes, this is the type of game that you want to just play over and over. Like its predecessors, Port Royal 3 is amazingly addictive, with games commonly drawing more than five or six hours out of me in a single sitting. The reason? Because win or lose, Port Royal 3 allows players to guide an entire society and craft their own story, taking them from the dawn of history and far into the future.I say Port Royal 3 is only ""good"" -- and not ""great,"" as I would have said about Port Royal 2 -- at crafting stories because I feel like the game's taken away some pretty important tools for customizing your society.Port Royal 3 is one of the best turn-based strategy games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the game’s endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. With all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first Port Roayl for PC that I feel is worth just about every person’s time. Go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. Do as Firaxis has done, and bring Port Royal to the masses.4/10 Could use some work.			",549,73,2,52,25,5,41

												With the exception of the combat this is a good replacement for Sid Meier's Pirates for this sort of game. They tried to do a carbon copy of the SMP battle system but ehhh, your AI fleet is dumb as rocks, and the targeting seems really flaky. I resorted to letting the CPU do the battles as it was better than me at it. Otherwise it's a pretty good game.			",172,25,2,26,28,2,11

												Just bought it on sale today, played it for 15 minutes and uninstalled soon after. While I have had this on my wish list for a while now (I became interested after seeing the screenshots and reading what the game played like in some reviews), I just could not handle the poor UI/interface that was presented for the player. The game looks okay and I can get past graphics for good mechanics, but the game could not keep my attention after 15 minutes or even make me care to continue to read or watch the tutorial videos given.  Most of the icons/buttons you can't simply mouse over for a pop up text saying what exactly what is was. I probably could make a guess as to what the ""house"" > ""ship"" icon means, but then there are even more menus, more items that you can't mouse over to understand. It wasn't that I was overwhelmed by the menus, it’s just that they lacked an ease of understanding to the naked or were presented in a manner that let the player understood what was going on simply. It’s a shame that the game did not work out for myself, but my suggestion for other that really want to dive into the title is that this is definitely not a game you cannot play without reading a manual and memorizing what certain the icons mean. I will also say, I could not find an easy command to highlight all buildings or highlight certain ones. For instance, a lot of the farms on the islands match the somewhat nice looking terrain in the background. What you may think is just another doodad is actually a useful tool for the player.  It would have been nice to have an icon to turn on/off to highlight certain buildings. IE: green highlight for farms; blue for government buildings; orange for businesses/factories and etc… Maybe I will come back to this game after seeing if there is any mods that fix the UI, but for now I cannot recommend this title even at 75% off for $5.00.

												I've played Port Royale 3 and I can reccommend it.There are two campaigns and a Free Game mode. The campaigns serve more like tutorials. Besides, each of them has a story. The first campaign will guide you in a path of a trader, in the second you will take a role of an adventurer. After you complete them, they will transform to a free game, so you can continue playing them if you wish.The principle of trading remains the same. Buy cheap, sell as expensive as you can. After some time, you can build your factories, hire workers and build residences for them. The products will go in your warehouse. In Port Royale 3, you can hire a steward for your warehouse. This will automate the warehouse and make your life easier. You can tell him to sell goods, buy raw materials for your factories, keep raw materials so he won't sell them or specify which products should stay in the warehouse(and the amount of it too). Trade routes are now easier to manage. You just choose a convoy, select towns which will the convoy trade with and choose a script. Then activate the route and watch how your wealth grows. But if you wish, you can still create your own script and tell your captain where, what and how much to buy/sell or transfer between convoy and warehouse. In my opinion, this is not necessary, as the scripts are well made. There is even script for supplying your factories and selling the goods they produce. This makes life of a merchant in PR3 much easier.The path of an adventurer includes many naval fights, attacking towns and pirates hideout. Frankly, the combat system from the first Port Royale is still unbeaten, as there you could use all your ships in a naval fight. Here, you can select a maximum of three ships from your convoy that can fight. But at least you can use them simultaneously, unlike in Port Royale 2, where you can only use one ship at the same time.  Convoys will have the basic crew available automatically. But it's vital to hire more sailors if you want to fight other convoys. There are three types of ammunition. In Port Royale 3, you don't have to buy the basic cannon balls, as they are always available. The other ammunition types are chain-shots and grape-shots, which you have to buy in towns, along with sabers and muskets. The rest of combat is very similiar to the games predecessors. You can sink, plunder or take ships from enemies convoys.You can also marry a viceroys daughter, as you can in the previous games. But first, you must have your own manor in a town which you rule. You can obtain your own town either from a viceroy, or by force. A viceroy will give you a town if you are popular there, if the status of the town is Prosperity(the satisfaction of citizens is 75% or higher), if you have enough workers there. In addition, your popularity in the nation of which town you want to rule must be also quite high. A viceroy will not give you command of a town when the nation have 5 or less towns in possession. I don't know if you are able to have your own hideout, like you was in the first Port Royale. I think yes, since I believe you can become a pirate in PR3.Another novelty lies in acquiring higher ranks. In the previous games, you only had to increase your wealth. Now, you also have to hire more workers and enlarge the storage in your convoys(which you can do simply by buying more ships to the convoys).  The rest of the game is the same as the previous ones. You can buy pieces of maps, save castaways on sea, etc.In general, I find Port Royale 3 a good game. In my opinion, it's better than Port Royale 2, but the first Port Royale is still the best from the franchise because of the combat system. Port Royale 3 is the easiest game from the franchise. The campaigns won't last long. I finished the trading campaign in 3 days(cca 9 hours) and the adventure campaign in one day(cca 3 hours). The only problem I have with this game is the flickering when I turned on anisotropic filtering. That I think is problem related do AMD graphics cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
