												as of ... November 27th 2014. the game is dead. servers are no longer up. its been abandoned. from what i can tell - it was due to lack of players in the first place. might have one or 2 personal servers up every now and then like any other steam nearly dead game. =scratch that.

												Awesome game by itself, destroyed by the P2W. I have an almost fully upgrade Scout spaceship, and I get destroyed by Bomber ships that are FASTER THAN ME. If this game was as balanced as games like Tf2, I would say it's one hell of a fun game. And it is. When there are no P2W players it really is fun. You just have to hope that no one payed for a better ship in your game. I would recommend it because it needs more players.			",183,32,2,15,11,1,9

												Terrible, the players here are all either P2W or are ancient and have fully upgraded ships that can instantly kill your beginner ship which has nothing. Earning money is hard as you get remotely no kills unless you steal them and upgrades just take away all of your money. This game is the definition of a bad game			",204,16,7,18,16,1,10

												Moon Breakers brings back the epic dogfighting of games like Xwing Vs Tie Fighter & Freelancer mixed with a bit of BattleStar Galactica style physics. Each ship has its unique tactical advantage, but winning a battle is more about your skills as a pilot and the strategies you use. This includes smart use of your afterburner (which also highlights your location when used adding another dynamic to the fights) and the presision piloting thru the awesomely detailed asteroid environments; this can be the key to winning many a dogfight. Its F2P but you can buy ship and booster packs or simply grind these out in game. Graphics are good but not jaw dropping.The game had an excellent balance, was accessible, and most importantly was a heap of fun! There isnt a lot of variety in this game though and regrettably devs seemed to have dropped support so what could have really been epic is now a game with server issues and zero community in 2013.Try Star Conflict if you like this sort of game; this one is frozen solid, floating aimlessly in space!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												This is a great game!  If you're an older gamer, you'll probably remember Star Fox and Crimson Skies.  Imagine if these two games had a child... it wouldn't be Moonbreakers.  lol  But, it would be something like it.  If you're considering getting this game, I'd definitely recommend it.  There are some downsides, however.  The devs have all but given up on it, as it's down to one server and there aren't anymore updates.  The community that still plays is small, but holding out for some new players to get into the mix.  It's a little difficult at first, but if you stick with it, you'll do great.  It's worth checking out at the very least!			",544,79,20,29,76,10,19

												this game is fantastic fun for all ages, its playable by kids and also appropriate due to having language filters,you can choose from more than 18 ships, spread over 4 ship classes, a great variety of affordable upgrades for each ship is included.you can get everything on the menu without paying a single cent (however you may choose to support the developer) and its heaps of fun to play, especially with such a nice game engine.the downsides:+servers: you cant select any servers apart from the east american server, its not very accessible for alot of countries+maps: the existing maps are good, but they are too few, there needs to be more variety to spice things up a bit+game modes: likewise the game modes are indeed good fun, but they take too long with few people on the servers,                         if you could create short 5 minute maps for multiplayer and a single player mode with 5 minute objectives                         that would be great :)the upsides:+wide selection of ships: makes it very adaptable to play for many different people+child friendly: no foul language and not graphically violent, just focussed on a little fun with torpedoes and space ships+no lag: im playing from australia and i have never experienced latency, this is amazing and beautiful to play on short notice+hangar access between respawns: not something i would usually mention but it allows you to change your ship between                                                         respawns and it is very good due to being able to change objectives mid game +ship classes: as i mentioned before, there are four ship classes, each with their perks and i think you can find a ship you like                       no matter what kind of play style you prefer+ingame credits: the credit system is incredibly well balanced, its easy enough to get credits to upgrade your current ships                           and even though it is still expensive to progress to the next space craft the price range isnt too stretched                           out with about 100,000 credits between each of them mostly, but i have only checked the bomber section+the bounty system: after a player does well enough they get a bounty added to them for every few kills or turret kills,                                  torpedoes wiped out or hit etc, this makes it easier for people to get those credits they need quicker                                 and speeds up the time of getting the next ship alot.                                  if more people played at the same time this would be a great balancing feature, for getting an extra 15k                                 credits when you kill the target saves alot of grinding for your next ship. makes good competition as                                  well.+round time limits: time limits are well balanced and you dont take longer than 15 minutes to blast your enemies, not too                                long and not too quick. +credits saved upon disconnects and errors: this is remarkably useful, if you are in game and suddenly it does stop working                                                                      for whatever reason you still get your due credits from that match when you                                                                     re-open the game. very player friendly.in conclusion i cant see a reason not to get this game, if you are a scifi nerd you will love the ships and weapons and if you arent you will love the atmosphere, its few glitches [i have not experienced any of them personally but i have heard of some]are not even anything crippling to your game progress and you forget about them just as quickly as they happened,great game to play after work, just before school [not recommended], or when you have 20 minutes to spare, you couldeven play it on your lunch break at work if you had a laptop.WARNING: this game is VERY absorbing, always be careful not to lose track of time when you play itps: all you pilots have fun out there ;)			",80,5,1,2,3,1,4

												A while ago, I wrote a review of Moon Breakers saying that it was better than I had expected. I was not mistaken... much.I stand by my claims that this game has amazing graphics, brilliant music, fun gameplay, a smooth framerate and virtually no technical issues; but this could all be because the game has few, if any people playing it.The servers are dead. Nobody plays on them. The master-server is almost always empty. I have only been in the games-design buisness for a few months so I don't know everything about designing a game, but I do know that if you have an all-current-player server which is more often empty than not, YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG.Perhaps because of Moon Breaker's unsuccess, the developers have put little development and effort into the game which is a shame because it actually has incredible potential and is already really good.It's a step in the right direction. If there was more content, less repetitive gameplay, a higher beginner friendliness and more people playing it, Moon Breakers would be tolerable. It was designed for masses of people to be playing it.So I invite you, one and all, to download Moon Breakers and push this game to its full potential. If you like Science-Fiction, you owe it to yourself and your fellow gamers to play this game.Based on gameplay, this game gets a 7/10. It is ruined by blandness, something that, in this situation, can and should be fixed.			",19,3,0,2,1,0,2

												What a shame.I truly enjoyed playing this game, but I bet it would be better with others playing.That's right... Unfortunately it seems to be a dead game.Was actually impressed. I expected a crappy little space shooter with low quality graphics, and it was the total opposite.For a free game, there is impressive graphics, sound, and the gameplay was solid.Smooth flying, and accurate shooting mechanics, make for a great little package.Definitely worth checking out, if only to see what it could have been.But like I said, sadly seems to be a dead game.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												Moon Breaker is a free to Play 3D space combat PVP game, that is pay to win.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Only has 1 server active and NO players on it.  There are no bots flying out there so the game relies on players to fill the fighter and bomber combat roles.  You can try attacking the Carrier but looks like impossible to destroy, carrier has AI flak guns.   Look like the store is pay to win, all the ships require crazy amounts of in-game credits to buy, but all the ships can be bought for cheaper amounts of store cash.   I thought the maps were rather small for a space combat game, it don't take long before you are in range of the enemy base flak guns. You can try the game but the game is dead because of No players, has No Bots playing and Pay to Win.For more info:

												Started off really well, with a lot of hope - sadly, it's devolved into an unmaintained P2W with only one server available.  Flight mechanics were pretty good, the dogfighting was fun, but there were only three types of missions available, and the game was glitchy at times.  MB had a lot of potential, but the combination of P2W and developer problems killed it.If Uber ever comes back and decides to revamp the game, I'll give it another shot.  Until then, though, this moon is broken and can't get up.  I hope Star Conflict doesn't go this same route - good space sims (think Freespace) are few and far between.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Moon breakers is a hardcore space fighter game, similar aspects to eve online and also starwars battlefront 2 space combat gameplay. It delivers fast pace combat on many scales and 'if thats your thing' will satisfy your gaming experience. The game itself is great in terms of the play but can become repetitive as experience is low progression and in many aspects you have to play hours to be able to achieve decent upgrades on ships to help the competitve edge. The manuverability is not as great as star conflict but still becomes a great game. My Rating - 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is trash. Prepare to waste a decade of your life putting up with the nonexistent UI, zero feedback on anything you do, crappy menus, and junky ships unless you're ready to drop 25$ per ship on the best stuff. Yeah, that's not an exaggeration, they price individual ships at 25$ each.If you play, just click to spawn whenever you get killed by the idiots who wasted their money and rack up the millions of credits necessary to get the ships for free instead of paying for them... 1000 credits at a time.If you're patient enough to do it, then... well, frankly, just kill yourself.

												This game is awful.  Unlike Call of Duty where any noob with skill can hold his own against a lvl 55 with perks out the♥♥♥♥♥ this game punishes you for being new until you blow up enough times to buy upgrades.  As far as I can tell there are only a couple ""maps"" which look like old Starfox rejects.  There are no dogfights, and most head to head battles between pilots last all of three seconds.  Not worth the time.			",195,68,1,26,18,1,14

												Though i do love this game i have to not recommend it For one sole reason(there is more but hey :\): It is a pay to win game.Dont get me wrong i love this game but its really really REALLY REALLY really tough to get it started when youre just learning to play.Now Uber entertainment has some fun games(annihlation, planetary annilahtion*i acually have it but my 13 year old pc cant handle it EPICNESS* and so on) but this one, meh.And now for the technical problems:Poor menus(to an extent)PAINFUL new player awareness/helpsemi-ok graphicsframerate drops(probly just for me:\ )and finally( and my biggest pet-peev) NO SERVER BROWSERReally you can get it if you want to pay to win or wait for 8 years of matches to get some cash.

Me , my teammate, and an enemy. The enemy quit after about 10 minutes, and I won 1700 Credits.And the next ship to buy is 150K...And last of all, ship upgrades are Linier. (enrgish) so the more you play, the stronger you become, No stragity.That sums that up just fine I think. Now go download Eternal Silence (Mod for hl2)			",165,20,1,8,15,0,21

												the game play is farely smiple but fun. but you only get 2 ships to pilot from the start  and to get more ships you need to pay like $12.00 to get 1 ship or like 200000 CR.But the 2 ships are fun to fly and you can upgrade the ships to be faster, have more ammo, get more armor. you name it.  The maps are big and some what diffrent, most take place in massive rock fields with tunnles and stuff like that.  Over all i give this game a 6.6 out of 10 at the moment they will probly update the game to fix some of the small probs. Over all its a good game			",97,8,0,10,8,0,2

												I played Moon Breakers when it wasn't on steam, when the developer was still on this game, developping it.A this time the game wasn't bad, an arcade style, dogfight game. Plenty of player, I was one of the best with my Cobra.I even paid 27 bucks back in the time to support this game.Unfortunately the developper forsaken the game. No more patch, no more new content, server empty... You can download it to play it for free, but I don't recomand you to buy anything, unless you have too much money on your bank account.

												I'm not going to lie to you; It's bad.The game itself is a neat concept, but it's muddled and ruined by simple Pay 2 Win. You can buy Helium-13 (which is a currency equivalent to mass amounts of credits) or simply earn credits through the field. People with Helium can buy ships faster, and thus, get better weaponry/shielding/tech. If you're JUST entering the game, you're not going to get far, unless you have a good team.Oh... There are none. Because the servers are dead....Huh...3/10, It was fun at first, but then the skill/ship difference clearly showed.[note, most game-play was around 2013]			",88,9,0,14,11,0,26

												There are not a lot of space fighting games, and this is one of the few. While I did enjoy playing this, this game reward system works on pay for advantage. and the pay is steep, I mean £10 for a ship.... one ship out of 15 of them and even then after that you have to apply upgrades to it. There's only a couple of maps. and while they are both okay, that's not a massive range. It's nice that you can go miles from the map and not be blown up.. but isn't that poor design? The voice acting or rather the lines even are poor, why do pirates have Black beards in this timezone? I mean there's story but it isn't well built or delivered.I do like how the ships handle, it's nice to be able to boost and then drift as zero gravity takes hold but over all the ships fly pretty slow which is why I reckon there are upgrades. But a system that gives a clear advantage to that who pays the most works badly for both. The non payers can never get there and the payers will never have a challenge.			",109,6,3,12,5,1,13

												I played this game about a year ago or so, and liked it at first, but after a bit I noticed a pattern with everyone. Everyone just likes to shoot at each other. Nobody wants to actually try to go for the goals like for example in capture the flag. Everyone just dog fights and nothing else. I also had difficulty maneuvering as well as everyone else and everyone seemed to be able to auto lock onto me or something just from my perspective while I couldn't even hit anybody. I couldn't get my friends into it either, and now from the current reviews, it seems that the game is shutting down. Ships back then also costed tons of money and in order to get them you'd need to play for like 30 days straight. There weren't enough maps, either. Yes it is free to play, but with all the pay to win stuff and everyone buying it, you'd think they'd have more maps. I had hopes for this game, but it was a let down for me.			",99,41,2,19,42,0,5

												This is a fun game that deserves more attention. The trailer is mostly lies. Muliplayer online battles? Pffft. The game is dead with the most ive seen in a battle is 6. 6... YOU CANNOT CALL THESE BATTLES WHEN ONLY 6 PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING. As far as thrilling 3D combat goes, its you drifting around a map trying to find someone else, and when you do, the ""battle"" lasts only a few seconds, but hey, it is 3D drifting. While the loser waits to respawn, the winner runs into a rock or does barrel rolls untill some one else comes along. there are no customizable ships. Yes. they have an upgrade system. Yes, they are slightly better after the upgrades. But, no, you cannot change your ships details or color. They are fixed for each ship. There is also a definite ship hierarchy. Higher level ships will always win over the lower ones, unless the higher ship is piloted by a half-witted monkey. Needless to say, even a half-witted monkey will get lucky most of the time here the balance is so out of wack. Yes, you could get lucky too but that is far less likely giving the game an addicting feeling kind of like golf.Yes, there are good parts of the game, hence I recommend it. One of the greatest of these moments is when all 6 of you end up in the same spot with the same ship. This is fun because the better team will win. In other words, the combat is not completly random luck. There is no better feeling than destrying a whole team in 30 seconds. The music accompanying this game also sounds slightly Irish, which has made drifting much less boring. The combat in the game does not have a lock on feature so you will have to lead your opponet, as well as them leading you. There are ships however that have homing missles that can lock on but the missles can be outrun and shot down but not usualy.Like I listed earlier, the game has flaws; however, I am recommending this game. The game itself would work much better with more people. With more and more people playing less, the game is becoming deserted, dead, and much less fun. The game does have the ability to change you mood for good or bad depending on how you do. Because I am recomending this game, I will say I had a good match. In a bad one I will probably go kamikaze with my Mamba (dont know what a Mamba is? play the game and find out, you should hate it when you finally use it). Therefore, this game does have a very immersive gameplay style that will easily let others in the room know how the match is going. So, I recommend this game, given its flaws, and ship hierarchy, and homming missles, it is still a good game that deserves more attention than it currently has.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing and it runs on low end pcs with no compromise. It is worth the time and space lost while downloading. It is fun and has a kind helpfull comunity who will teach you and help you with the game if you ask for help(even if they are on the enemy side). Great game I'd recommend it to anyone who likes plane flying games and dog fights. It is AMAZING.			",26,0,1,0,2,0,2

												seams to me to be a very solid concept space sim, its in development and from what i get no longer really worked on and thats too bad coz it seams fun enough, it lacks server population so when you just start chances are big you wil just die and die becoz of a learning curve how to aim, asuming one gets better and can find a few peepz to play with i give this a 8/10			",1900,678,67,173,198,21,267

												I played this game about a year ago or so, and liked it at first, but after a bit I noticed a pattern with everyone. Everyone just likes to shoot at each other. Nobody wants to actually try to go for the goals like for example in capture the flag. Everyone just dog fights and nothing else. I also had difficulty maneuvering as well as everyone else and everyone seemed to be able to auto lock onto me or something just from my perspective while I couldn't even hit anybody. I couldn't get my friends into it either, and now from the current reviews, it seems that the game is shutting down. Ships back then also costed tons of money and in order to get them you'd need to play for like 30 days straight. There weren't enough maps, either. Yes it is free to play, but with all the pay to win stuff and everyone buying it, you'd think they'd have more maps. I had hopes for this game, but it was a let down for me.			",99,41,2,19,42,0,5
