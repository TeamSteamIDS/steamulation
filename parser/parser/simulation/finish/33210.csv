												First of all, this game is better known as ANNO 1404.I always wonder why is this RTS game so unfamiliar to players in general.But the very few people who I know that played this game, also loved it.For me, it is easily one of the best games I've ever played.And there are several reasons for it.You normally start your game with a small fleet of ships and need to find a suitable island (the map has lots of different islands) so you can start your civilization in it.The initial population consists in humble peasants who demands simple things such as fish, street markets and religion so they will be happy. You can fulfill those needs without much effort. Eventually (if some conditions are met), the peasants will become citizens, who demand more expensive resources, which you'll only be able to find by trading with other societies, or if you start to explore and colonize other islands. This may create several itinerary routes of different sorts of material that will be circling around the map in ships. With all this material, you have to manufacture goods required by your population so your society will continue to grow. You'll be challenged to maximize your production levels and try not to waste resorces and/or money in this production chain.This was a very short description of the game's mechanism, but you have lots of other stuff too, like: * a very good campaign mode;* small ""side-quests"" during the gameplay, that will help you on getting some extra items/resources;* pirates trying to loot your trading ships;* other civilizations/colonies with alliance/neutral/enemy diplomacy;* different islands, each with its own fertilities;* wars;Pros:+ Stunning and beautiful orchestral music soundtrack, featuring a mixed choir, recorded in a very spacious acoustic, which gives the music an indisputably churchly feeling. ... JUST EPIC!!!;+ The campaign mode is very good, intuitive and draws you into the game;+ The strategy is all up to you;+ It can be a very relaxing experience or a very hard duelling one, it just depends on the player's style;+ In both cases, the experience is really enjoying;+ The routing/itineraries system is very good;+ The prodution chains and trade system are pretty big and somewhat complex to manage, which is pretty challenging;+ The medieval setting drags you back in old European times;+ It is addicting;+ Sea battles are good;+ Very good graphics, even today;+ Did I mention the ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SOUNDTRACK?Cons:- The land battles are not so interesting in my opinion, since they are proportionally too slow in comparison to the world's time. Sometimes it seems that they won't ever end unless you put a lot of effort into it. Not very exciting.I haven't played its expansion yet (Venice), but surely will one day.Just buy and enjoy it.

												If you know the Anno series games, then you already know Dawn of Discovery -- it was released as Anno 1404 in Europe but (for some reason) renamed for the North American release.   Like all the Anno games, it can be a little bit micro-managerial, but it's delightful nonetheless.  A good sound track and lovely graphics are definite good points, and the trade system is one of the best around.  If I had a complaint it would be that the computer players/NPCs natter at you constantly.  That could really be toned down but it's easy to handle by adjusting sound settings, too.  But it's completely possible to just get lost in this game and spend hours upon hours enjoying it.			",196,69,2,34,43,0,35

												Anno 1404 aka Dawn of Discovery is an excellent city manegement and building game. First even though the game is relatively old (2010) the graphics are still beautiful but even more than that, what truly shines in this game is the attention to detail. Watching your workers roll barrels, or some peasants celebrating at a tavern or even the performers at the juggler's camp is highly entertaining. The gameplay is extremely satisfying with excellent depths however it's simple enough and the campaign does a good job of introducing the gameplay elements. The storyline is meh, but the campaign is still enjoyable with varied scenarios and objectives like all good strategy games. The scenarios will also add decent amount of gameplay hours after the main campaign is clocked and the continous mode will further still add more gameplay hours. If you do buy this game and enjoy it then the Venice addon is higly recommended as it essentially add more content is an already excellent game.			",33,4,0,13,8,0,24

												Dawn of Discovery has to be one of the greatest Trading/Building games out there. If you like Port Royale you should totally get this one. It can be a bit hard at the start, but once you get the hang of it. It will become addictive especially in Free Mod were you can approach your empire without the hassle of finishing a campaign chapter. The only downside is that it has no multiplayer. Dawn of Discovery : Venice does have it, but if your looking for the original look then get this one. 5/5 pyros			",298,30,7,50,20,1,46

												Also known as Anno 1404, the game makes it's mark as an absolutely gorgeous city builder. A stunning entry in the genre.This game is markedly different from the followers of Sim City. It focuses on the details and needs of a very class based populace as you grow and attract more and more wealthy and powerful individuals. The peasants are happy with just some fish and cider and a chapel, but a Noble has much more extensive needs like steak, fur, books, reading glasses, beer, jail, candles, and a church. The needs of the peasants and citizens are simple enough, but the desires of the patricians and nobles require an extensive amount of land and resources that you might not have. Which gets us to the second part of the game, trading.The Annos takes place in Islands. The map is large, but you will quickly run out of land on your main island and will have to start looking to other islands to get new resources and expand your production. These resources are sent to a warehouse in that island, you will need to ship them if you want your population to use them. To help is a very easy to use strategic map which will let you build a trade route to pick up and deposit from locations. The trade routes will get sufficiently complex as you run out of land you have to keep track of more and more resources for more and more people. Additionally, you will have transform raw materials to usable consumables as well, so building a good layout is important.All of this to achieve your final goal: to create a metropolis so that you can build a Cathedral or a Mosque.There IS an army, but it's very abstracted out and really has a boardgame feel than anything. It's something that could defintely be improved, do not play the game if you are expecting/wanting battles.The only thing that I am not sure about the game is that you are supposed to build two cities. But I only ever had the attention or care for one. If you are going to do it, I would highly recommend getting the Venice expansion so that one of you can build a Occidental city and other the Oriental. I have spent 40+ hours in the expansion, so don't let the number of hours played fool you.			",234,20,5,21,21,0,49

DoD has absolutely stunning graphics, whimsical art design, endearing characters, complex city-building and trade mechanics, and immense replay-ability! Oh, and the music is so good, and the sound design creates such alive environments. Everything is good about this game. I have zero complaints. Related Designs has totally outdone themselves here. This truly is sleeper hit. If you have even a slight interest in city-building and historic sim games, play this game.			",322,70,5,41,12,3,36

												The good - Fantastic game if you like city building and empire building. Graphics are fantastic. Tutorials and basic fundamentals are easy to follow. I have spent hours enjoying the aspects of the game that work VERYwell !The Bad - AI is exceptionally poor after the basics have been mastered. AI opponents go to war when they have no economy, and no money. Magically, they advance several levels higher than you can, and go to war with you with armies that appear in a puff of smoke. Extremely poor AI. If this title is on special - go for it - you will lose hours on this game. But after enjoying hours of fun, be prepared to walk away once any element of war from an opponent eventuates with their magic armies and resources that are attained through poor development, testing and AI which is utterly laughable against you ! You can spend 20 hours on a level and be wiped out in 5 minutes from an impossilbe adversary !			",32,0,0,0,2,0,15

												TL:DR. BUY THIS. This is the North American release of Anno 1404, a much desired sequel to my favourite Anno 1503 (1503 AD here). It's a perfect economic, city-building, and progression simulator with series-specific quirks that make it unique and unimitable.If you have ever been a fan of the old American release of Anno 1503 (it was called 1503 AD here), this is exactly what you might be craving. Released in Europe as Anno 1404, this title serves as a modest remake/sequel game that really replaces the old game (that's why I say remake). Everything here is exactly how you want a real Anno game to be. The newer ones (2070 and 2205) cannot capture the true feeling Anno 1503 used to give me all the time, but this one? Well, I played a random game with easier opponents and swiftly lost almost all my money even though it said I had positive growth and change in finances. I was lost, confused, and wasted 4 straight hours of building on 4 islands simultaneously because each had a different resource I needed. Ultimately, my failure to understand the trading mechanics, the financial mechanics, the building mechanics, the war mechanics, and the general development progression of the game left me stranded and lost...Well, same time tomorrow!To be utterly fair, this might be one of the smartest games I have. I love games like Port Royale 2, where the whole point to to develop a strong economy, but I'm very big on conglomeration, or making it all myself. I believe the strategy is to make only what you have to and slowly trade for the rest, but my ten-year-old-at-heart-self continually sees the building and just makes it. I love games like this and will happily burn an afternoon sitting at my computer for it.This was a much-needed treat because 1503 AD was one of my favourite games from my youth. If any of the comparisons I made or descriptions I give can assist you, then this was time worth spent writing this. Usually these contain a rant or a joke, but this is a geniune thank-you to the team that made these games. You all rocked my childhood, now, my adulthood can make more sense. Thank you.

												Much like its predecessor, Anno 1701, Dawn of Discovery is an addictive, fairly slow-paced, real-time resource management strategy game.  The premise of the game is that you need to fulfil the demands of your population. You harvest resources to build houses; you build houses to increase your population and secure taxes; as your population increases, their demands for other resources increase; and as you fulfil those demands, you garner greater taxes and unlock the rest of the tech tree. It's hard for me to recommend this game over Anno 1701, this plays more like an expansion than a sequel (they both use the same engine), but I can assure you you can sink many hours into this game.

												The best way I can describe this game is one part tropico and one part dwarf fortress.  It's a city builder, trade management and hapiness management game.  I love nearly every bit of this game, with the exception of it's moderatley boring combat.  Luckily, combat is a relatively minor point of the game and, even though not very exciting, still works and is quite easy to grasp.  Another strong point in this games favour is it's gentle learning curve.  Dawn of Discovery introduces game ideas throughout the well crafted campaign.  It could even be said that the Campaign almost functions as a tutorial for the enormity of the game.And enormity is what you get!  Like in Dwarf Fortress, you don't just make items.  For instance, if you want to supply your nobles with lether jerkins then you first build a farm for the cows, then a skinner, then a tanner, then ship them to the clothes maker, etc.  It is luckily somewhat more simple than DF.  A great game to scratch the itch!			",326,77,9,59,23,2,75

A bit like the Civilization series, but completely different as well.  Balancing resources, building epic cities or numerous colonies on islands, expanding into the orient to build a new culture complete with their own resources/building and so on.  I get sucked into this one for hours.			",231,27,0,57,49,0,54

												I really liked this game.  It's a fun city builder with a interesting storyline.  What I really liked about is you could build several cities in several different regions.  So you can interconnect their needs and wants.  Some regions can't manufacture certain items but another region can so you transport it over in boat.-The only negative is that in the story, with each new chapter you need to re-build your cities.  It's kind of like Tropico in that regard			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of Discovery is an Ubisoft game which of course comes with it's own set of problems, such as multiplayer locked behind verification servers that don't exist.  That said, the single player version of both this and the associated expansion have enough content to keep you playing for a while.  The idea of the game being multiplayer in the first place is somewhat just for kicks, as regardless of single or multiplayer, your goal will basically be to generate the largest economy in the shortest amount of time.  (While there is a military/navalcomponent, those components of the game are severely watered down compared to other titles.  The important thing is that you set up an economy chain good enough to just have more units, which are more or less identical to one another.)The campaign itself is short and the meat of the game is entirely the randomized games, which you can add complexity to in a variety of ways.  With mods you can add a lot of extra content to the game (just look in the community section!)  Overall, It's an ubisoft game that works outside of multiplayer, and a great game in the resource management space alongside such contenders as Dwarf Fortress or a A game of Dwarves.

												I'm about 40hours into this game, and I bought it 4 days ago... I think, that basically says it all. It is not a RTS per se, but it will test your planning and multi-tasking skills to the limit. The game has no manual, or even a real tutorial. The campaing kind of explains a bit, but i quickly started playing the continuous mode, which is insane. Most campaign levels are 4-5hours long, and continuous never stops. I love the interface and graphic, and how great all work together. I was not familiar with the Anno series, so this is my first one. I bought it for $4.99 on the Ubisoft discount day. I don't regret it at all. This is a gem.			",61,36,1,9,19,2,20

												I love the game but is full of bugs/or glitches not sure what to call them like on mission 4 of the campaign it wont let me items causing me to restart not once but like five times, then after finally getting it to work then next objective might bug out causing me to restart wasting many hours on having to redo what i;v already done and this has happened to me on every mission so far except on mission 3 of the campaign causing me a lot of headaches I hope this gets fixed cause its come to the point where i don't wanna play the game an wish io could refund but of course i've played over the two hour refund limit. Please fix as this has come to be my favorite game but is quickly becoming hated, and i bought both the 1440 Anno of course would have bought just one if i knew this was gonna happen. sincerely concerned player and game buyer Sean-AKA KillerKen22 ",29,3,0,10,11,0,12

												though released around the same time as Settlers 7, DoD is more of a simulation than a RTS.  DoD focuses on complex large-scale trade routes than Settlers 7.  while Settlers 7 could be played in a couple of hours DoD can easily take several days. Both DoD and Settlers 7 offer something unique and are both gorgeous to look at.  why not get both?!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played much of the series (except this one and Anno 2070), you build cities across several islands, unlock different citizen tiers, make houses, manage trade routes and resources and try to survive and slowly wipe off the competition off of the map or co-live with them; it's a lot more complex than regular trading games with more depth. If you would light a trading game with light touch of true city building, I would get this game.			",332,94,7,94,110,3,129

												***Disclaimer***All the words below are just an opinion I've came to while several hours of campaign playthrough.All of these could actually been said about Anno 2070 which is the same game re-skinned to futuristic looks.This is almost a copy of my review on Anno 2070. As much a copy as DoD is a copy of Anno.***/Disclaimer***This is not a good game, actually.This is a wannabe Settlers remix of german-style RTS mechanics with a few notable UI/UX choices and one relatively new naval trade mechanic. Given these ingridients one may mix a pretty good game for the fans of economic RTS with indirect control, but Dawn of Discovery fails to deliver anything but its shallowness of gameplay.There are a few primary resources here, as you could expect from a decent german-style RTS. But the number of said resources is, well, as low as if you're playing your usual RTS: there are only about three or four of them. Secondary resources are, too, low in numbers, but what is worse - they're used in a very few combinations. All the resource chains are started and terminated almost immediately.Buildings are not being built - they just appear.Roads look like they've been added only to satisfy the economic-based strategy guidelines. You make roads only between a groups of buildings, but if you have a building cluster somewhere else - just forget it, you won't need a road to connect your clusters.Economy in this game just works. As long as you have a basic buildings set, your economy will grow. After a while your peasants become citizen and will ask for more advanced products. You click a few times, build a few linen factories, and that's all - keep yourself busy with staring at sea or whatever until next time. The reason I am so frustrated with this is that it takes all the best from Settlers and turns it to a meaningless crap.Your people don't even go anywhere - they just pointlessly roam in the living cluster doing nothing. All you have to do is to make their number grow to unlock new building chains. Compare this roaming to the Settlers - or as I am already full with Settlers' comparisons, compare it to Skylines, where every citizen walks somewhere because he has a reason: to work, to get resources, to home, to work again. Installing this game you think you'll have to maintain a complex logistic system, roads, passways - but no, you just point and click to make another building appear.Finally, the supply chain clusters. See, if you have a building A which makes primary resource A, and you have a building B which uses resource A to produce secondary resource B, you obviously should consider a supply line between them. In case of Settlers you have a central hub, where resource A is put before taken to the B building, so you just maintain the lines between A, B and hub clean and unobstructed. In case of Factorio you build an effective supply line to bring the A resource, buffer it and feed to B building. What do you make in Anno? Nothing. You just put a piece of road around those buildings, and here you go. If the secondary resource B is, say, electricity, you don't even have to build a road to anywhere else. What? Electric poles? Nah, forget it, everyone knows electricity is magic.That makes your supply chains look like clusters - you have a mine up in the hills, next thing on the road is your melting factory, and next thing is your tool makery building. All up in the hills, and no traffic except a worker mule which takes fresh made tools down to market.Let's now talk about what's good in this game. I liked the naval trade mechanic: you can manually deliver your goods for trading with other islands and then, later, you can build ships, make trade routes for them and assign which goods are to be transferred and in which quantities. This is actually a cool idea for a strategy game - I've wanted this for Civs and for Settlers for a long time now. But in DoD (and Anno 2070) its just useless because there are no additional systems to support it. You just mark some surplus of your goods as ""for sell"", make a trading route and that's all. This system reminds me of a train mechanic in Factorio: goods, routes and vessels. But in Factorio you have to build a sustainable supply system to make this work, and here, in Anno, its just plug-n-play.After all, I hope that these series someday will be a decent Settlers-inspired strategy to play, with its own smart design choices.

												It starts out okay, but there are problems.  Market Places are suppose to allow a new area of building.  This occurs iradicaly, with usualy not allowing you to build (grayed out) near the newly created Market Place you just built.  Then I could not get either of my two stone huts to produce.  You have to click on two different characters to see the content of the storage dock.  Many hts say they require people, even tho you have plenty of living huts and people in you town.

												Overall, 6/10. See below for detail. This game reminds me of ""Romane of the Three Kingdoms: Iron Triangle."" It looks a lot better, but it suffers the same issue of not knowing what to build. The missions give you very clear goals, and sub-goals to get you there, but the build trees are downright draconion. It's difficult to understand why you aren't allowed to build such-and-such a structure. Resource managment isn't really present, it's more a question of getting certain things done before starting cash runs out. Overall, gorgeous and fun, but only if you have the time to grind your teeth over it.			",66,23,0,14,17,0,19

												The only game i paid 50$ on steam for. Couldn't launch it for few weeks, before i found a solution (non latin characters in a game folder path) and shared it with everyone else on forums. Meanwhile ubisoft didn't reply on forums or tickets and introduced a fix TWO month's later. Disgusting.The game itself is good enough though - graphics are pretty, music is nice... gameplay however is slow, especially multiplayer since you can't speed it up.I can't recommend it since Anno 2070 has been out for a year and its basically the same game with different graphics. But it instead if you want classical chain production strategy game.			",103,15,1,19,33,0,33

												This game is fun, but kinda weird.  Apparently very little of it is actually about sailing around discovering things, and most of it is about building Renaissance cities in the Age of Empires style.  The actual missions are kind of cartoony, and don't have any real relevance to actual history.  However, it's a fun and addictive strategy game.  It's worth giving a try if you can find a demo or get it on sale.			",173,89,2,73,37,2,52

												This game is great, I have nine playing for a good 7 hours and I have biuld up a good economic and town. Claimed two islands and made many friends, the citizens got mad because I forgot to feed them and burned half of the town, but that was my fault, then one religious girl got mad at me for not having enough churches so she burned my many island, I had to pay her and we were at peace, I would recomend that people should not get so mad on middioum but it was fun. I am currently rebuilding from my smaller island. I recomend building on two islands and have deffence on the harbors. 10/10 for this game. It is just great for city builders			",18,1,0,0,9,0,0

												I really Enjoy this Game. Granted i played alot of ANNO 2070 which is a futuristic version.The trading in this is a bit more complicated but that's just extra gamey goodness.			",42,21,0,28,24,4,19

												Dawn of Discovery is an excellent simulation game, letting you take control of a fleet of ships to establish trade routes and, at the same time, build up your own city by taking advantage of the resources available to different islands. For those fond of city builders and such genres, Dawn of Discovery is certainly a good choice, and an easy game to get addicted to.			",322,57,3,40,42,3,44

												This game is fun, but kinda weird.  Apparently very little of it is actually about sailing around discovering things, and most of it is about building Renaissance cities in the Age of Empires style.  The actual missions are kind of cartoony, and don't have any real relevance to actual history.  However, it's a fun and addictive strategy game.  It's worth giving a try if you can find a demo or get it on sale.			",173,89,2,73,37,2,52

												this is a very good game it's one of the better city building games i've played despite the fact it is based in the 1500's or something like that i prefer modern city building games though but this is still very good lol it's incrediably hard and i won't lie i've been frustrated with it at times but that's just me of a few who have struggled trying to build up their city lol but it's the good kind of frustration cause you really gotta know what your doing or you'll never get any where the graphics and everything are very good it's pretty to look at so that's a plus and rare lol			",47,2,0,2,16,0,35
