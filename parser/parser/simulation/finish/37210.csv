												This game is brilliantly addictive for anyone who likes a time management sim. Really annoying they seem to have stopped making the Chocolatier games.			",3,1,0,0,11,0,4

												This is a fun Tycoon style game. Takes place post WWII. While 'Alexandra' is off trying to find her husband who was shot down during the war -- she places you in charge of resurrecting the now defunct Baumeister chocolate factory. You begin as a Novice chocolate maker, working your way through the game to become a Master Chocolatier. The storyline isn't much -- but with this style of game, it really didn't bother me. You receive tasks - some of which have strict time limits. You progress by completing tasks and filling orders efficiently. By doing so, this will open more ports. The more ports, the more ingredients you can obtain. Most ports have a variety of ingredients ... however, there are some ports that do have the same ingredient within their inventory as another port. Obtaining your ingredients at the ports selling them at the lowest price is key. As the game progresses, most ports increase their ingredient inventory. Thus, check ports for any possible additions that weren't available prior. Your progression is measured by purchasing ingredients and producing items at your factories which include chocolate bars, coffees, infusions, truffles, exotics, and your own creations. You can haggle with a shop owner for a possible decrease in their ingredient price - being careful not to be too pushy or they become agitated and immediately increase all their prices. You are tasked with collecting ingredients, preparing orders, keeping your factories well stocked with ingredients for whatever product you're producing there, purchasing your own shops which will give you the best price to sell your own wares, and ultimately bringing all the Baumeister family members back together to resurrect the Baumeister chocolate empire.   At a certain point in the game, you will be given an opportunity to purchase an airplane --- do it!! The travel costs and time to get between ports will deplete your money and your inventory. ""Chocolatier: Decadence By Design"" is the only game in the ""Chocolatier"" series where you can make your own creations. You have the ability to pick the ingredients, create the appearances of, name the creations, describe them, and they become integrated into the game/inventory that customers will be asking for.SIDE NOTE: especially when very, very, very tired, it is funny to see a particular character ask for X cases of your ""________"" creation. Meaning, don't let children play your profile -- make one especially for them. Else, you may get questions such as ""Mommy/Daddy/Auntie/whomever, what does ""________"" mean???""  Yeah, you can get real ... uhhhhhhhh ... creative with your names, appearances, and descriptions of your products.(HINT: As soon as Havana opens up for you, hit the casino and the slots - not the other game - and you will see your money reserve explode! Bet max every time. Even if you hit ""0"" ... don't close that window! Just keep hitting max bet and you will get your money back plus a whole lot more! Time doesn't advance while you're in the casino ... so don't worry about that. Also, each factory can be retrofitted to produce any creation. Costs money, though. Thus, hitting the casino is well worth your while!) Anywho, it is a simplistic time management/tycoon game that is fun to play when you don't want to immerse yourself into a game that takes a great deal of thought or strategy.

												This game is utterly delightful and brilliant. You build a chocolate empire while traveling the world in search of ingredients and the many mysteries within. You even get to invent your own chocolate! Play if you like:* Matching three items: The chocolate mini-game is oddly relaxing and entertaining, and directly impacts your profits.* Item-shop games like Recettear: Ingredients/inventory management gets very entertaining here.* Linear stories: This is not Mass Effect ;).

												Its an interesting little trade sim that pushes you to learn when certain goods are generally lowest price, explore for more kinds, and exploit them into profitable concotions which go in and out of fashion. It's built for dynamic min-max play, so people who like metagaming and optimizing will find an enjoyable experience here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start with the conclusion: Chocolatier is a great game. One of those games you can't just simply put down, which is a very good thing. It's very addictive and I always have the urge to do one more quest. I can't quit before I do at least one more, it's crazy !Anyway... You start the game as a beginning chocolatier and you have to work your way up by finding/collecting recipes, creating (by playing minigames) and selling chocolates or chocolate related items and buying ingredients. The more quests you complete the more things you'll unlock, so there's always an incentive to play.The sounds are graphics are very simple, so don't expect anything fancy. There are basically no animations and the sounds are minimal. The graphics do look sharp though (windowed) and it gets the job done for a game with this style of gameplay.If you want a fun game, look no further.[Rating: 79/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												It's definetly a 'mom' game, but one you won't mind playing if you're into trade games. You have to mantain tasks such as creating your own hit chocolates and coffees, playing ingredient shooting minigames to get a bigger weekly production, and balancing buying costs with selling price, tied together with a tidy, but lackluster, story. I guarentee you won't care much about said story, but everything else makes up for it, and the game makes for a great distraction when you want to listen or watch something else at the same time.

												A very fun Tycoon game. Won't make you hungry actually, you might not like it, it's a different game style. Make cases of Chocolate, Coffee, Truffles, etc. over time while completing tasks, selling goods, unlocking new locations and progressing through the story.It's 10$, I hope I get a prize for being I think the only person to recommend it. Hopefully they put it on sale so that all you cheapos feel like getting it.			",62,7,6,6,6,1,3

												I used to play these games a few years ago (when I was like 8).  Out of curiosity, I searched for it on Steam one day, and later bought it. It's a fun game, but I've played less than 15 hours, and I've beat the campaign.  I rescued Alex's husband, became CEO, and then a Master Chocolatier, and now I fly around the world to keep my factories operational, with the ocasional special order.  It's  fun while there are quests, and I suppose I could start over, but it doesn't give much play time.  It'd be nice if there was a longer campaign, or a secondary one.  And I'd love to see more story, maybe a secondary campaign could include the people I'm constantly warned to be careful about, or maybe the person who hates Alex and her husband.  That said, it was fun while it lasted and it's only $10.  Now, would you like to buy a case of our Spicy Rose Coffee Blend for $10,000?  How about Sweet Orange Chocolate Stars?  They're made with real butter and are only a few thousand dollars a case.EDIT:I just got a new computer, so I was going to play through the story again.  Only problem is the mouse gets all screwed up.  It worked fine on my old craptop, but the mouse lags really irritatingly with my new i5 and GTX 970.  It's trailing, and the area immediately around it lags and shows the background of where the mouse just was when the screen changes quickly.  I did a quick search, and didn't find anything, so I need to dig deeper when I have the time and initiative.			",5,2,0,5,5,0,2
