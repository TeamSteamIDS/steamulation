												Incredipede is basically a functional and fun version of QUAP. This is one of the coolest paltformers I've ever played, because unlike other games of type you can't just hold down right arrow key and expect you creature to reach the end of the level. With every creature you have to sit down and figure out how to actually move it's body. I really annoyed making sense of the seemingly random movements of the more complex pre-made creatures.And let's not forget Incredipedes unique art style. You don't get to see animated wood cut illustrations every day. Thomas Shahan, who was the artist for this game, really deserves a giant bag of cookies. And the same goes for Colin Northway, who programmed this game in flash! I never would have thought that a flash game could look this well and still run at a consistent framerate. Note that the base game isn't all that long. It took me 2h to clear all levels(60) in normal mode(normal - play with pre-made creatures, hard design your own creatures). But there's always community levels if you crave more Incredipede action. So if length is a factor for you when it comes to this kind of games you have been warned.			",463,116,7,36,28,4,50

												Incredipede might be the easiest game on Steam to 100%/Perfect. Using an ""out-of-game"" system relying on you doing task that is not checked in any way let you confirm your own achievements with the click of a button so you can simply earn them all in seconds. Quite like the look of the game as really has its own style with a very fitting soundtrack.Personally I think its a missed oppertunity as the game itself is quite an interesting physics platformer-puzzle I would have enjoyed playing through in the hunt for achievements. Reminds me of a mix of World of Goo and the Triachnid avalible in The Basement Collection. Time to 100%: < 1 minute.			",945,372,36,86,96,14,164

												Incredipede is a physics based contraption puzzle game.When I saw that Sarah Northway (The dev behind the browser games Rebuild and Rebuild 2) developed it, I got giddy.I had purchased this game years ago, but only now noticed it properly, since AStats told me that getting 100% in this game is easy. Turns out, it is. You can literally tell the game that you did the achievement and it just believes you and awards it to you... I loved that!Now, to the game itself. The artstyle is beautiful and fun. The gameplay though... it's tedious and boring. On the normal difficulty you just move a creature from one side of the map to the other. There's no danger except your own incompetence with the creature. The gameplay for this is just not really fun. Would I recommend it? For the general playerbase, no. It's just not worth it. There are even browser games that do what this game tries to do, but better. For the achievement hunters out there? Yeah. You will have the game 100%-d in less than a minute. PERFECT!

												Incredipede is very interesting and can actually get pretty ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I honestly didn't pay attention to the story, which involves 2 cutscenes or so I think. You basically have to solve each level with 2 to 4 buttons. While it sounds simple, it gets you thinking in some of the harder levels. Then in hard mode you actually have to create limbs and muscles to make your creation move through the level to the end.Each level is really short, and most of the time is spent just trying to figure out how to complete each level. There is also a sandbox / level editor mode that lets you create your own levels and share them online. You can also select levels and rate them from other users.Overall its a short cute little game with some replay value if you like tinkering with level editors. Glad I bought it!Edit: Spell correction! :(			",1230,377,57,124,120,15,133

												Ironically, Incredipede is far from an incredible title. It has a couple things going for it. First off, the art style is spectacular and really looks like a great deal of time and talent was invested in the art assets. Secondly, the primary mechanic (on paper) is a really neat idea; in order to complete a level, you have to design an insect-like creature complete with limbs and ligaments and then independently control those appendages to navigate the world.Unfortunately Incredipede suffers terribly from the whole mobile port fad. Everything about it screams 99c iOS/Android app and when brought the the big screen and input methods of a PC, the experience is just abysmal.I think there’s a lot of potential in the game concept, and they clearly have a talented artist(s) but Incredipede is just not a good use of either resources.

												Incredipede is a strange game, it's like QWOP but instead of a regular human it features a various selection of mutant creatures. It is a very simple game, one where you're tasked with getting from point 'A' to point 'B' but the main challenge comes from how the physics engine works against you and your lack of mobility. Trying to figure out how to hook a three-legged insectoid onto a ledge and simultaneously pick up an item is quite a daunting feat yet rewarding when pulled off successfully.The soundtrack features droning didgeridoos accompanied by tribal percussion and the occasional monkey's screech. The achievements are also quite unorthodox as they encourage you to explore your garden outside, in search of actual wildlife, and aren't related to any in-game accomplishments at all. There isn't much content or a story to Incredipede but the unique style and premise is enough to satisfy any casual gamer.			",827,302,26,81,66,10,105

												I like the idea behind this game, and it shows what can come from the rise of indie devs.  There is no way a game like this would have been made by a major company, or have the same feel if it did.  Incredipede is a game about nature, in a sense, and the diversity of life.  At least that's what it says on the package.  The game is a simple concept that is difficult to master.  You get to move a strange creature with different joints and muscles, to find the best way to complete the level.  The controls are awkward by design, and it shows the difficulty of adaptation and challenges of different designs.  This game also has the most awesome achievements ever.			",175,41,6,32,22,4,50

												There's a whole genre of games that I don't know the name of (this happens a lot) but are based around wrestling with controls. Everything from QWOP to Surgeon Simulator fits into this niche of struggling to do something and then giggling at how badly you ♥♥♥♥ it up. Sometimes there are more serious takes on it, such as Incredipede, and I'm glad someone is trying to give the genre more substance. As it turns out, though, that's a really tall order when even walking in a straight line is a challenge.Some colonial-looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s showed up one day and sacked a village full of green eyeball critters, leaving only one to escape. Your job is to guide the wayward thing in its quest to reunite with its lost brethren. Instead of an epic journey across a strange and mysterious land, you'll be helping it crawl about five feet to the right over and over and over again. This is because whatever this thing is gets a remix of limbs and muscles every level that you'll have to flail about with until you find a way over the finish line.Every one of Incredipede's many levels sticks you with a bizarre amalgamation of limbs and expects you to work them to the goal and perhaps grab a collectible or two along the way. Starting out you only get two buttons to move them but that gets expanded later to four, giving you separate motor control over parts of the creature's body. Sometimes it'll look like windmill you have to tumble across the ground, sometimes a coiled spring you have to bounce, sometimes a car with long, spoke-like legs to spin, and sometimes stranger things still.This is just on normal difficulty, mind you. There's a hard mode where you actually have to design the critter yourself and then pilot your abomination to an even trickier goal. Normal mode isn't too challenging on account of the few actual interaction options you have. Starting out with just left and right keys, there's only so much you can do to get the thing moving. Later on with more keys and more complex levels you'll be facing Trials-style bouncing and scaling to get to your goals, often flying right off the open sides of the level when you push instead of pull or unclench at the wrong time.It's a decent setup for a game, and I enjoyed my first 20 minutes with it, but that's about all I needed. There's very little depth to Incredipede, with no secrets to delve into or complex mechanics to explore. Levels rarely span more than a single screen and have incredibly obvious paths through them. What's going to trip you up isn't puzzles or level design but just the difficulty of getting a floppy, misshapen creature over simple obstacles. I know that's the point but there ends up being little to motivate you to put up with the floaty, flailing movement for much more than a few levels.I love the art style and the presentation, with its thick lines and faded colors and earthy tones. The game looks and sounds like it could be painted on animal hides, a unique aesthetic for the gaming world to be sure. I just wish there was more to do with it than struggle. There must be a deep, engaging game to be made out of these mechanics somewhere but Incredipede is hardly any deeper than its Flash brethren. It's not bad, it just doesn't bring enough to the table to make me want to climb over it with stumpy, malformed limbs.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Strange anti-colonialist messages aside, the play value of this game is incredi-ble. I don't feel like there's tons of replay value once you've beaten it, but if you like to try to do better than your previous efforts or make your own puzzle levels then you may get more of your money's worth out of it. Having said that, my daughter likes to play this game and I think it's been semi-educational.  The achievements are interesting and intended to inspire people to get out and interact with nature. I got it on sale, but would probably spend full price on it if that were the only option available to me.  I like it.			",135,27,5,27,19,0,17

												There is a beauty and a curse that flows through Incredipede. For the creative, this game offers a wealth of fun experimental puzzles to work around and solve. Little is restricted, and that is a gutsy move in its own right, but that is where Incredipede stands out. Not only is the art style beautiful and the music lovely, but the gameplay and freeform puzzles make it worth playing.Sadly, the very reason why this game succeeds is also why it fails. Numerous missions can lead to nothing more than trial & error sessions, leaving the player far more frustrated than enamored. Some of the earlier pre-constructed missions are evident of this, as I found myself struggling to succeed after making even the most minor errors. I often found myself knowing exactly what to do, but still ended up trying over and over until luck saw me through. This is the price a game of this design has to pay, and luckily it doesn't break the feeling of wonder, but risks embittering the player after so long. Incredipede is a rewarding game for the patient player, and is not for everyone, but the lush artwork and immense customization for both the monster and level maker offers anyone who can overlook its flaws a great time, even if it grows stale after so long. Above all, its small pricetag all but frees the player from buyer remorse.If you like what you read or still feel uncertain, please, give it a try. Incredipede is definitely worth your time.

												Incredipede is a 2D puzzle game where you control a variety of limbs on a creature in an attempt to make it past some obstacles to a barrier, optionally getting a specific dropped item along the way.The individual levels are not all that difficult, some of the challenge comes from getting all the collectables. Control is done via two separate directions for multiple muscles, effectively being able to flex and retract muscles individually or in groups. It's like a slightly easier to control QWOP.The graphical style is appealing, but ultimately I can't say that I feel that there's that much depth to the game. It's okay, and for folks who are really into 2D puzzle platformers, it's probably a good pick-up. Otherwise, well...it's okay. Not great, but satisfactory. If that sounds good to you, then by all means.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												This is an awful non game, I'm lucky enough to have it on Android too. Each level you get a new creature to manuver. A is to rotate limbs left, S is to rotate limbs right. The object of each one screen level is to cross a beam of light finish line. Between getting to the beam of light, you can collect a cherry or knock a green apple or square watermellon into the beam of light to collect it. Each level has a cherry or two if not a green apple or two. Each level takes a few seconds. Each world has a string of more than a dozen levels to complete in order. To enter the next world, you need to have obtained enough cherries, apples and square watermellon.There's not much of a game here. Somehow this is considered a puzzle game, because its puzzling to figure out how to move your creature? The puzzle here is to manuver your creature. Have it crawl, roll, and do whatever you can to reach the finish line. That's the game of it all. It just doesn't seem like a puzzle so much as deliberately movement. It is like if you have a bucket crawl NOT ROLL to a finish line. Is that fun? Would rolling be easier? You don't get to roll. Just crawl.Maybe there are people just rolling over on the floor giggling over how odd these creatures are and their movement, but I think its sad. A one eye creature who's life is so incredibly difficult that every movement to get from point A to B is such a challenge that its 'a puzzle'. Imagine if a person just had a torso, head and an arm, crawling or swimming around.Hard mode is still really easy, but the complexity is with that mode is you'll get to customize your creature with limbs, arms and so on. Depending on what the level allows for. Most levels can be solved with any kind of creature without any real complexity. Tougher levels like those entirely over pits require you to use trial and error to make it through.There is a sandbox mode to let you make your own creatures and even a level editor, but when the game just isn't much fun, why bother?This game is just not fun. Most all of the creatures have slow movement if its not overly complex to even get it to move by using the simple controls. On the plus side, it has a unique art style and it is a soothing game, like watching paint dry. I just feel that its not entertaining.			",1129,324,52,104,96,15,167

												This is the exact definition of incrediphillia. One of the best indie games on steam without a doubt. There are no physic engine based games that can compare to Incredipede. I'm sure most of you have played some sort of flash game some place where the whole point is to create some sort of contraption, building, or any kind of construct. What I think makes this stand apart from the rest is the mere fact you create a simple character with odd physics, like some sort of construct, with movable parts. You are really only limited to your own imagination. You can create pretty gnarly stuff and get through the various levels. The game itself has some replayability as well. The game allows you to do the levels on Easy, which gives you a premade design to finish the levels, and then you have the Hard mode, which starts you off with the base of the character Quozzle, which is just her round eye. By the way, when you finish the game, don't fret. There is a level editor included in the game. You can create some fun levels and you can share them with your friends as well. I really can't think of any negative things the game has. It is a pretty solid title, and I believe the price is just right for such a game. With that I say, whatever you do this Summer, it won't be as fun as Incredipede. All bugs wish they could have as many limbs as the gal in this game. Every purchase of this game helps fund research for limb growth of bugs, so open those wallets to make their life easier.			",92,9,2,5,6,2,6

												Incredipede is a fun physics puzzle game about a strange organism on herjourney to rescue her people from enslavement. You'll be challenged to build the most efficient creature to beat all the levels and the posibilities are limited only by you imagination. Admittedly the game isn't very complex. Once you get the hang of controling Quozzle and building new forms for her, you'll go as far as you'll get in the inovation department, but there are an enormous amount of levels and countless ways to design new incedipedes that the game doesn't lose its edge. If you like physics platformers, this is a good one.			",157,54,1,10,8,0,11

												This game is a fun casual with a unique take on the, ""awkward flopping around"" genre. It's similar to Beseiged, but with a much more better art style. It's worth buying just to check out the art, the surprisingly fun gameplay is a nice bonus.			",87,14,0,10,4,0,13

												You move deformed bugs from left to right and sometimes collect fruit.  If they have challenging, interesting levels it's past level 5 and LONNNNNG after the average person has fallen asleep.On the plus side, it has really nice graphics and music.  But maybe these guys should hire somebody who can make compelling gameplay.			",1036,410,52,140,110,14,195

												You get to finish puzzles based on movement and physics with different creatures made from a head and several limbs. You also get to create those creatures before a level starts in the hard mode and there's also a sandbox mode where you can create you own creatures, levels and challenges. The visuals are pretty enticing but when the entire game is based on struggling with controls (and rage-quits) and bare bones game modes and challenges, I really don't feel like this game can be recommended. Music is bland and everything outside the singular creature designs and possibilities factor are pretty run of the mill as well.I was pretty amused with it for the first 50 levels but by god I'm definitely going to finish the entire 120-or-so levels or even recommend the game to anybody else. You'll find much better puzzle + pretty games out there believe me. Keep searching.			",500,214,5,52,27,2,32

												이 게임은 과거 플래시로 만들어졌던 각 관절이 따로 노는 묘한 조작감의 육상 게임과 흡사하다.하지만 묘한 조작성에서 그치는 것이 아니라, 퍼즐게임으로 승화시켜버린 작품이다.스테이지 초반엔 그냥 열심이 앞으로 가면 되는 쉬운 난이도지만..점점 진행함에 따라 묘한 조작을 통한 이동으로 해당 월드 클리어를 위한 재료를 모아야한다.스토리가 없는건 아닌데...쿼즐이라는 주인공(눈알괴물)이 바다에서 출발하여 숲을 지나, 날고 기며 그녀(여자다!)의 동생인지 언니인지를 찾아가는 스토리다.(근데 몸집 크기를 보나 포스를 보나 만나러 가는 대상은 언니인 것 같다)월드는 3개로 이루어져 있으며 있으며, 각 월드마다 여러개의 스테이지가 존재한다. 여러 스테이지를 클리어하며 다음 월드로가기 위한 재료를 모아야 되는게 기본 진행 방식이다.해당 월드를 클리어하기 위해서 굳이 모든 스테이지를 완벽 클리어할 필요가 없다는게 맘에 들었다.스트레스가 적은 퍼즐 게임이라고 보면 될 것이다.PC용 말고 모바일용도 있는데 라이트하고, 종종 즐기기 위해선 오히려 PC용보단 모바일용이 더 좋을 것 같다.하지만...하다보면 흥미를 느끼기가 개인적으로 좀 힘들었다는게 단점이라고 할 수 있겠다.가면서 점점 더 조작 난이도가 괴랄해지기도 하기 때문이다.뭔가 풍요로운(?) 느낌의 BGM을 들으며 진행할 수 있는 플탐 짧은 퍼즐 게임.다만, 유저들 끼리 스테이지를 창작하고 공유하며, 자신의 크리쳐를 만들어 퍼즐을 풀 수 있는 샌드박스 비슷한 모드가 크게 장점이라 흥미만 있다면 플탐이 기하급수적으로 늘어날 것이다.

												While the concept is innovative and exciting, the design is poorly thought out. The game seems to promise both fun and funny levels, but the fact that it forces you to sludge through incredibly tedious beginning ones means you'll likely be bored before reaching them.I did not care for the (first?) watermelon level and simply decided to uninstall somewhere after my 6th attempt, when it became apparent that I would not see World 2 before ""solving"" it.

The game tries to be kinda cute, but the genetic engineering/mass abduction storyline is just a little too out there.  Those limbs also look like they would be delicious fried...

												Very beautiful game... Simply astonishing. I honestly have never played a game as beautiful as this one. The concept is similar to QWOP, but this game is more smooth and fun; less frustrating. You play as Incredipede, a bizzare  creature who's had her sisters kidnapped by humans. She has the ability to infinitely grow limbs from her body (distance limited). Four kinds of muscles are attachable controlled by AS and KL buttons.The game takes about 13 hours if you play the Hard mode (in hard mode you have to create your own Incredipede for all levels, levels are harder as well) and probably 15 hours if you're dedicated enough to play player-published levels. At first though, the game can get pretty damn hard to control.Another thing is the achievements. The game demands you to go outside and explore the real-world nature and learn about it more. The achievements are not checked in any way but I thought this was pretty damn genius. Good game to get little kids'♥♥♥♥♥outside.Downside is that I actually expected each levels to be much longer than that - like an indie platform - it would've definitely been fantastic. Some players may also find the limb movements to be slow, but well, it didn't bother me.If you're planning on buying this game, go ahead. I bought this for $2 during the sale and don't think $10 is worth the contents (even though the game is superb-eautiful). Emoticon should be added!			",77,14,0,7,4,1,5

												QWOP with better art style and music, but the controls are the same, abismal.There is absolutely no point, frustration, i can walk right and move freely, this makes me worse than real life, it's a fail.These type of games should be free, like others online.Indie games very rarely give us some real deal.For me it came with a bundle, so that's that.4/10 rating.

												Incredipede is a puzzle game that celebrates the vast diversity of life in the world. The game follows Quozzle, a lone Incredipede on a quest to rescue her sisters. She has a unique ability to grow new arms and legs wherever she needs them, transforming into a snake, a spider, a horse, a monkey - anything you can imagine. You can give her antlers or a tail, use nature as a blueprint or strike out in weird new directions. Control Quozzle as she learns to swing through the trees, climb sheer cliffs, dance over rivers of lava, and even soar through the air on thermal winds.Incredipede was made by a small team headed by Colin Northway, author of Fantastic Contraption. It was written while traveling in over a dozen countries including Honduras, Turkey, Japan, and Costa Rica.- Make and control a staggering array of creatures- 120 levels in three beautifully crafted worlds- Send your creatures to your friends to try to control- Use the Level Editor to create your own puzzles- Immersive ambient soundscape			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												What a funy game. XD It's a puzzle game with a creature which always looks different, you have to control the arms with A+S or K+L, different directions. The Singleplayer has ~150 Level, some of them are really hard to solve. But really interesting is the Level Editor where you can create your own levels and creatures and share them to everyone. You can decide if the other players have to build the creature or if they have to use the one you've made for this level.The creations always looks really funny then they walk or crawl on the ground.Great game idea, creepy, funny and many challenges. 9/10Check out my ""Humanoid"" creation.

												A beautiful 2D puzzel game. The artstyle might be a bit discouraging at first but you get to appreciate it after getting used to the scenery. The point of the game is to make your way to the end point while also collecting the collectibles in the level. This can be quite challenging, since the movement of your charachter, Quozzle is not intuitive and it takes some time to get used to. In a weird way, this game made me empathize to some extent with the people with physical disablities, who have to make a lot of efforts for doing even the simplest tasks. I don't know if this has been intentional or not, but in any case, it is an interesting experience.What's interesting about the puzzles, is that unlike many puzzle/platformer games, when you can't get something right, smashing the keyboard and doing that part over and over, usually doesn't get you anywhere. You will have to be patient, and know what you are doing. In that sense, the game has a meditative aspect which is quite refreshing.All in all, it is a unique game which I would strongly recommend for anyone interested in puzzle games.

												Wow a long time coming. I remember this on greenlight. Anyways, incredipede is essentially a weird slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SNES platformer on steriods. You control the contractions of muscles in a creature with numerous assemblages of legs and hands and such. It seems simple at first, but what you quickly learn is that you have to think about force, and how the muscles and legs interact to pull off increasingly complicated, but never quite exact muscle movements to move your incredipede between the stages. He also likes fruit! Incredipede is straddled between the think a lot strategies of Briad and the sheer virutosity of Mario, it requires reflexes and brains and a little patience. I wish some of the levels had a little more explanation or gave you ideas on how to move your incredipede, because the solution is not always obvious and you might find yourself mashing buttons to get the right movement, but if you take a little time to figure it out, and a little luck comes your way it'll be alright. I like this game because it teaches you to think in different ways and then employ those ideas reflexively. Few games out there marry intelligence and foresight with the stop goness of Mario Brothers. All in all a great game and compulsive once you get into it.			",192,67,3,11,13,0,16

												This is a simple puzzle/platformer game that  follows Quozzle, an incredipede on a quest to find her sisters (that's pretty much it for the story). The main focus of the game is, by creating different limbs and muscles on the incredipede you are able to make her move across different terrain and puzzles. e.g.  Swinging through trees, climbing cliffs, crossing lava and flying through the air.The gameplay is very simple, just press ""A"" or ""S"" to move.

												I was pretty disappointed to discover that, with only two independently operated muscle groups, Incredipede’s critter design mechanics don’t really allow for the sort of elaborate spiders and monkeys that I imagined. The fact that the puzzles almost never call for anything elaborate, and are better solved using very simple and comically situational designs means that Incredipede is, however, well-designed to its purpose and makes for a perfectly serviceable puzzle game. That still leaves me dreaming of what might have been, though.			",194,73,1,27,17,1,23

												So..this game. Yeah o.oHonestly, it's not that bad. If you can get it for 50% then it's definitely worth a buy, and I only say that because I always try and wait for good deals. The game basis is kinda simple from what I can gather. You make a monster by clicking and dragging towards and away from the creature to make legs and/or grow them. You then also have to choose what type of muscle it has, the choices being either clockwise or counter-clockwise. From then on, you have to beat the level. I am unaware how many levels that there are, but it's broken down similar to how Mario games used to be. Such as there are a number of levels in a number of worlds. If you enjoy puzzle games by using your own mind, then this is definitely the game for you. I have a video underneath if you wish to check out some gameplay. I hope you have a good day! ^.^

It was challenging for me to find out what kind of creature I have to create in order to finish each level. And if that isn't enough for you the game even has a level editor where you can make your own levels and share with other people!Just make sure that you play through the regular levels first because it teaches you a lot of the interesting mechanics the game has to offer. Only then can you excel in the hard mode and in level editor.			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												Wonderful art style, wonderful music, and an extremely immersive gameplay. Sadly, it has a rather steep learning curve that might leave the daft ones scratching their chin for quite some time.

												I would recommend this game, but only when it's on sale. Or if you're a millionaire and just don't care.The game itself is pretty fun, although it can get frustrating. Sometimes it feels a bit like QWOP, but your actions are more successful. It has two modes, the standard one where you play with a creature that was already made, and hard in which you can make your own creatures. I haven't played the hard mode. I suppose half of the fun is creating your own levels and creatures, and if you're not the creative type, reeeaally think twice before buying. It's very short, so if you're not into making content, you'll be done with it pretty quickly. It also hardly has any story, the whole thing is like two cutscenes right at the start and at the end, and it's pretty anticlimactic. But the art is really nice, and the music as well, although it strangely turns off and on randomly, I don't know.Oh, and it has stupid achievements. I remembered when I was adding the tag ""casual"" (it does feel like it), it has a tag ""easy achievements"". Easy? Nope. They're not in-game, they're like ""go outside and let a bug walk on your hand"". All of them, six or something, are outsidey, and almost all involve interacting with insects. I mean well, nature, okay, that's nice, but, you know, tell that to someone with arachno- or entomophobia.So, all in all, if you like creating your own content after you're done with the basic game (or even don't care about the gameplay), it's probably gonna be great for you. If not though, think it through and maybe wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic, creative, physics-based indie game. Just messing around in the sandbox and level editors are games in themselves, let alone the actual puzzles for you to solve. I could see this having a very strong, creative, and active community and the developer is quick to offer feedback I give it a. 5/5 Inevital♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Creatures!			",257,34,6,21,22,1,19

												Incredipede was interesting. The puzzles were fun and difficult at times, and the idea of using the incredipede was fun. However after several levels, it became sadly similar. twist this way, fall that way... Twist that way, fall this way. The visuals were wonderfully unique... The incredipede itself was fun to look at and the world was very appealing. All in all, if you've got a few extra bucks it's a fun time killer, but I don't know if we have anything ground breaking here.			",117,10,0,4,9,0,5

												Not really sure what to say about this game. On normal the game is fun with minimal challenges and only takes a few hours to beat. By the time you get to playing it on hard (where you actually create your own Incredipede) you're just kinda over it. The Steam Achievements are fake, you can just get them by buying the game. I bought it on sale for 3.40 and I wouldn't pay anymore than that for it. Overall, fun for a bit but not worth 9.99.			",63,34,0,2,1,0,4

												Incredipede feeds the builder in me.But it's also very challenging, that the builder in me forces the rest of me to sit down and play an hour and a half of this game in one sitting. I couldn't leave until I finally figured out how the muscles worked. Ultimately, I had to stop playing because I still couldn't get how the muscles worked, and I'm sure I could have played another couple of hours still trying to figure everything out.I really like the Cheevos too. They're simple and encourage you to step outside and do things, observe nature and all that. It was a nice breath of fresh air.Ultimately, this game gave me a deeper understanding and appreciation of my limbs. If there was one thing I learned walking away from all this, it's that I will never again take my legs for granted.I mean, how are we able to walk on two legs?! We shift our weight from side to side, one leg moving in front of the other, alternating as we lean forward and let momentum lead us. It's amazing!			",322,102,11,40,26,3,25

												An INSANELY charming QWOPish exercise with beautiful art and soothing music. You're made of various assortments of limbs and you can either flex or relax the muscles barely holding them on. That's is. So legs and other appendages just go circling around in sometimes unpredictable ways. It's marvelous.			",393,152,2,69,21,2,56

												I played it on hard in a single weekend. Kinda felt 9,90 was steep for that. I expected it to have double the levels. I think it said 150 levels but they are tiny few minute puzzles. I would have liked to see larger levels also.Apart from that, it's a very polished (a bit grim) and well tought game. I also got it for android but found it almost impossible to play on a Galaxy S4. It requires a lot of intricate controlling that touch just doesnt provide.			",28,6,0,4,3,0,3
