												I'd call it roguelike RPG-less first-person shooter with no blood but *lots* of scary moments. Permadeath and full pistol mechanic implementation turn the game in survival-horror at first, but as you progress and learn to reload your gun properly the game rewards you with the warm feeling of protection granted by the gun you hold. I'd give this game 10/10 if you look for a game to play a session every now and then. And if you don't, then just give it a try. No blood, no monsters and a lot of survival has made the game perfect in my eyes.			",519,123,26,106,44,2,67

												Straightforward game, Complex gunplay.Receiver is a new kind of FPS with a mix of a rogue-like RPG game. The great first person shooter takes the handling of your guns unto a whole new level. This very realistic gunplay requires you to know how to handle your pistol knowing each and every step to perform an action. From changing the safety lock, emptying shells, and removing and reloading you magazine, all have their steps that wipes all the realistic shooters into the dust.Because of this complex use of guns you will die a lot, pretty often actually. It takes time and effort to put to this game in order to complete. Everytime you die you’ll restart in the beginning of this randomly generated world. If you're not a person of patience then this is not the game for you. As you might start in different places on the map don’t expect to receive the same guns, same ammo, and other equipment like a flashlight. Those and as well as placed items are randomly generated. The foes you face in this game are only robots, two kinds stationary sentries, and airborne ones which are equipped with a taser. The lack of variety of enemies can make this came quite boring for some. Knowing how to approach a corner when you hear the beep on a turret or the lights of a flying saucer can make fighting these guys very repetitive.   The dark, mostly enclosed setting in a tower gives this game a fighting like theme that fits the unknown exploration well. Learning how to conserve your bullets, finding a working flashlight, and collect these tapes that hold a mystery that involves all of mankind really makes it fun for me to play. As playing a easy game is never fun.  ",78,23,0,12,6,0,1

												Okay, so this game is a ""How-To-Suck-With-Guns-And-Die-Horribly"" simulator. Gun physics are AWESOME, the backstory is told through tapes which you risk your life to obtain, and the enemies scare the crap out of you, even though they really shouldn't. I love the aspect of the non-automatic reload systems, which this game does quite well. Want to reload your gun? Press at the very least 2 buttons multiple times to do so! Want to have enough magazines so that you don't die from having to reload the same one over and over again? Get the whole ""remove mag, place in pouch, take out spare mag, place  in gun, release slide(if needed)"" maneuver down! If you wanna play this game, beware that you will die. A lot. The two enemies do well in covering the randomly generated map, and when you encounter your first one, your trigger finger and aiming arm better be accurate! Locational damage plays a big part with your survival, hit a vital system on one of the two enemies and you'll be a happy camper. Er, Receiver. But hit some useless bit of metal, and you're gonna find yourself out of ammunition real soon. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys shooters where you can actually appreciate the parts of a firearm.			",155,13,0,34,11,0,24

												Receiver is one heck of a free game (was a giveaway). You are placed into a randomly generated texture-less world. Your objective is to collect tapes. You need to shoot or avoid sentry guns (there is only ground and air). It is a one hit kill’s type of FPS game, so it can be challenging.The title of the game is somewhat of a pun and has no relation to weapon mechanics. As you collect tapes you hear a recording of a guy’s voice (sounds like Lone Wolf). He tells you the situation of what is going on. The story is freakish in the way that it gives meaning to the texture-less level with basic 3D models that you are strolling through. Each time you die and have to start again, the recordings are played in random order, which means eventually you may have a great understanding of the story even though you have not even made it halfway through the game.I’ll also quickly mention that the soundtrack also is very fitting and gives an atmosphere to the levels. It reminds me of Islamic prayer type of music sounds like in the film Black Hawk Down.The most interesting part of the game is undoubtedly the weapon reload mechanics. The learning curve is not too steep in my opinion. It will help to just crouch down somewhere upon first play and fiddle with the buttons on your keyboard to understand how to reload your gun. There are two different reload mechanics to learn … the semi-automatic pistol (Glock and 1911 if I remember correctly) and the dirty harry revolver.It is just cool. I find myself pulling back on the slide to eject the bullets which all go onto the ground. You pick up all the bullets which goes into a reserve (like your pocket). Then you need to put the bullets back into the magazine one by one, but you cannot do that before holstering your weapon (because you need two hands to fill a magazine). Then you need to draw and put the magazine back into the weapon. The first time you pull on the trigger, it may not shoot anything because you need to pull back on the slide again to load a bullet into the chamber. All this is an OCD persons dream come true.The magnum revolver is a little simpler. Although you start to notice a difference when running low on bullets, you need to make sure you spin the cylinder to align the bullet filled chambers with the barrel. And because there is less bullets you are always having to pull on the ejector rod.With all weapons you have a safety switch which is useless and you can pull back on the hammer for extra readiness. You can also turn on smart tooltips which highlight what you can and cannot do with button presses.I find the randomly generated levels made more sense compared to say Hellgate: London which did not make sense to me and felt more like a selling point gimmick. There are sections that you will familiarize yourself with. So even if the level is randomly generated, you know what to expect in each section anyways. So that is definitely a positive for a game that could have just been based on a single static level design.One thing that I find stupid (and I am not 100% sure about this) is there may be a random luck factor when disabling sentries. It is actually the one thing that has really put me off the game. All sentries supposedly have these weak points. But if you shoot a sentry exactly at a weak point that disables it in one round and then try it again in another round, it will not work. And you can tell because when you get close to the sentry you can see where your bullets have hit exactly. Sometimes you can disable a sentry from a distance that looks like a pea on your screen with one bullet … sometimes you have to fire three shots at a sentry that fills up a quarter of your screen just to disable it. It makes no sense to me. I really hate luck factors in games.The last thing I would like to mention is this game could have been great. I mean really big. But it is clearly unfinished and from what I heard was part of a competition in designing a game within a week. The thing this game lacks is arms, hands and textures applied to everything including the weapons. But seriously this game could have been amazing! I can actually visualise many FPS games that could utilize this mechanic. Tom Clancy type of games in particular, but even the Battlefield series. The reason why I mention this is because it is one of those revolutionary ideas that gets put out too quickly and is drowned by games with too common typical boring one button reload mechanics and nothing new (albeit finished). I really do hope to see something better made in the future with this idea … not everyone in the world just wants to gun down stuff on the screen senselessly. This is a needed option!

												Receiver is a strange little title. I think if you've even heard of the game you know that it was the result of a game jam and was put together in a very short period of time (7 days I believe). These game jams have a knack for putting out some very intriguing concept pieces but understandably lack substance.In a nutshell, this game is a rogue-like first person shooter with absurdly detailed gun mechanics. There is no “Press R to Reload”. First you must eject the magazine or spent casings, you need to reload with fresh ammunition bullet by bullet. Once you reinsert the clip, you can’t pull the trigger and expect a bang without loading one in the chamber and pulling back the hammer.While I would be outright lying if I tried to argue that Receiver had no lack of substance, the mechanics that are in place are undeniably engaging. My first few runs were rather frustrating but when I finally got a hang of the key mappings and how the different guns operate it was inexplicably rewarding. I felt extremely in touch with whatever gun I had been bestowed and more aware of my use of ammunition than I had ever been with any other FPS.There is certainly no jaw dropping narrative or deep philosophical thesis on the blight of war buried within Receiver, but the depth in which the mechanics of firearms are explored here really shows the possibility of a seriously strategic and skill based first person shooter.

												The game that depicts guns at their most accurate. At the beginning you'll do everything games and films has taught you, assuming that everytime you insert a mag, you have to pull the slide back (Which is a good way to eject your bullets from a magazine without firing them). With practise you'll be handling guns like a pro, reloading swiftly and with ease whilst feeling awesome.It's cheap, It's fun, it's very immersive. Get it. Only issue I could bring up is poor optimisation, whether they plan to release updates to combat this, remains to be seen.			",141,37,5,29,33,2,45

												The game takes a realistic approach to weapons handling, and while initially the controls seem overwhelming and overcomplicated at first, you'll quickly fall into the groove.What follows is a genuinely challenging game, one that rewards preperation, caution and planning. One single slip up will cost you your life and you'll have to start from the beginning.It's a true testament to thinking outside the box in game design, and much like Mount & Blade dared to attempt realistic melee combat using very rudimentary systems and controls, that game attempts to do the same with firearms.Interesting and very tense, would recommend if you're up for a challenge			",639,171,18,117,49,5,117

												If you're a fan of guns or want to learn how a gun works, how to eject a bullet out of a pistol, How the ballistic's of a pistol bullet works, and so fourth, you may like this game.Story: Well, when I started out on this game, I had no idea what I was doing, but there are cassets that you can find that will give you the backstory, I found two. So far it has too do with some kind of.. war that will happen.Gameplay: Simple and bare with mechanics hardly found anywhere else.  You start in a abandoned building with a pistols which ranges from a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and a Glock 10 with full auto mod. Everything is random, your ammo count, placement of ammo, and enemies. I should mention that ALL enemies make a sound and lights when they spot you. These are only two enemies in the game that I have seen.Enemy types:Sentries: are stationary, but once they spot you, they fire at you as you would expect.Drones: These little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chase after you once they spot you, choosing to close in at close range to taser you, I have yet to see with with a gun mounted on it.. or destory one.Challange: Think Dark Souls, but First Person Shooter with mechanics that fit more in a military sim. (Roughly)Replay ability: This one is a hard one for me, but it does get a bit tedious after a few tries. So it's doesn't have much replay value.Verdict: 8/10 With deep mechanics with the weapon types and detail of how it works. The Enemy types is dissapointing and the variety of weapons is quite lacking. The reply value is a bit hard for me to say due to the fact you spawn with different weapons at the start of every game and the enemy placement appears to change.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gives of a nice dark vibe to the game, also a serious tone to support the amount of detail they've included with the gun handling.Bit of a naff review as I've only played 30 minutes, but I was so fascinated by the detail in handling the guns that I got carried away from playing the actual game!

												I really wish I could recommend Receiver.The base weapon-manipulation mechanics are complex, and fun, once you get the hang of them. Problem is, that's not what the game is about. Most of my time in-game is spent wandering around, only to get killed very quickly by a robot.And then there's the random aspects, my biggest gripe. One game I started with no ammunition - at all - and in a hallway guarded by a sentry gun. I couldn't run past it, and I couldn't shoot it - I had no ammo. It brought a quick death. I'm not against random aspects to a game, but there has to be boundaries. Randomly give me between five and fifty bullets. But at least give me one.Personally, I don't think the game is worth $5 - I bought it on sale for $2, and I don't think it's worth that. SUPERHOT released a much more exciting proof of concept, and that was free.			",142,16,1,11,12,1,19

												Receiver is an experiment with realistic gun handling in a game setting that hasn't really been done before (to my knowledge). It gives you full control over weapon operations - you can release the magazine, insert/remove bullets, release the slide lock, toggle the safety, and even use full auto - and it lets you see real gun mechanics at work. It may seem mundane to some but you'll soon find that reloading and operating a virtual firearm becomes mechanical as you play through and is quite satisfying - and it's a lot more interesting than simply pressing R to reload.The game itself is surprisingly tense and suspenseful. Because your opposition (turrets and flying stun-drones) can kill you in one hit, you are forced to be practical and careful in your movements and actions. And, as you DO have a task in the game - of collecting 11 cassette tapes that are lying around in various places in the randomly generated world - it's a lot more challenging than you might think! All in all - it's an interesting experiment in realism and definitely worth checking out.			",292,87,5,29,8,2,23

												The random number generator rolled 31... and 31, was Receiver.""What is this guy talking about?"" I assume you ask. Well I'm talking about the ""unplayed games"" month. You know, like every Steam user out there, he buys a game and never plays it ever™? Yeah, true stories. I recommend you do that too: choose a month(emphasis on ""month"" and not ""day"" since be honest with yourself, you're never gonna do it ""one day"", are ye?), google random number generator and go ham! Every day a new game.And quite frankly, I like this game. I like it a lot.Why though?Well here's why:It's a proper handgun simulation quite unlike any other ones out there. And I mean it, from ejecting shells from a plain revolver, to loading bullets in a magazine, and even experiencing the recoil that a full-auto Glock has to give! I'm no Hickok45 when I'm talking about guns, but I still know the basics and rules for handling one, and since my country is no America(cuz muh europe) it's rather difficult getting ahold of one(quote difficult, not impossible), so fooling around in a virtual environment with all the right tools is a blessing.And let's say you're not willingly to either A. get a gun or B. visit America anytime soon.That's ok, since if those two options aren't on your list, then these shall do:-You are a civilian and just want to experience a handgun without actually going out of your way of actually touching one(believe me, from where I come, people avoid guns like the plague)-You are about to and/or will attend in the future either the Police or Military academy. Now remember, just because one will teach you to run after bandits and one will teach you advanced military stuff, that doesn't exclude basic training in handgun usage. For example the police in Sweden uses Walters and I'm pretty sure the rest of Europe(and America) has the Glock17 or later models. And for the military, keep in mind that not every country has the possibility of giving each soldier a ♥♥♥♥ing Desert Eagle, so they'll have to make do with what they're given.Additionally, there is a mod for extra guns. That's right! Extra. BIGGER. GUNS! As of making this review I haven't tried it out yet, so expect a lil' edit here sometime soon.Now I've given my point for the purpose of this game in the world. How about the game itself now?It's an action packed rogue-like in a futuristic funky world.The rogue-like part is essentially what gun you are starting with, the amount of ammo you carry right off, the starting spawn point and the spawns of enemies.  Your main objective in the game is to collect 11 tapes that are scattered around the level, and I'm not gonna lie, it can be pretty infuriating as one time I found 2 tapes in the spam of a minute, and another time I've spent 20 minutes looking for one to no avail.There are two enemies in the game. *ahem*. TWO ENEMIES. That's gotta be a new record for the least hostilities in a rogue-like, period! I guess you can count the third one as fall damage kek. Anyway, there is a turret and there is... Clifford's lost freesbie idfk, it's a flying drone, or that's what I think it is. Both of these guys will one shot you, as the player has only one health. The turrets are usually not a problem as long as you spot them first and keep out of sight, and the flying freesbies are the survival horror aspect of your whole life, as they will charge you like a god damn Apache helicopter, John Cena style, and sap the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your entire existence. These things will be the #1 thing which will kill you, and don't even dare try to contradict me.The guns require a lot of your concentration in order to progress. Albeit the revolver is the easiest to pick on, the Glock and M1911 sure aren't, and will take some time getting used to(when in doubt, press |?|). And even then, it requires a lot of button operations: one opens the cylinder/ejects the mag, one is used to point the gun when needed, other is for holster, yet another to add bullets, and so forth and so forth. This is the beauty of this game, since even if there are only 2 enemies, your main one is... yourself! YOU ARE WHAT HOLDS YOU BACK! To understand the gun, you must be one with the gun. A quote which no liberal will ever say since they haven't shot a gun in their lifes LMAOOOOO amirite lads or amiriteThat's some political humor right there.You haven't asked for it, but you sure got it anyway.tl;dr So what's the conclusion on this? The conclusion is that I want a sequel, and I want it now. The foundation is here, and doesn't need to be changed in any way. It just needs adding: more enemies, more guns and gun types, more diversity in level generation, more of everything, and let me tell you, if it ever happens, it's going to be one of the greatest rogue-like simulations of the century. Receiver is without a doubt, a special little gem. Everyone should own it, it's gun education afterall, unlike... gulp... religious games...This has been your anonymous reviewer, signing off.Have a swell day. ",222,29,7,14,9,1,6

...please take a moment to confirm that the firearm you have been issued is in working order and has one full magazine.Receiver is an experimental First Person Shooter, developed in just 7 days to partake in a Game Jam challenge.The plot is told via cassette tapes, that you must collect 11 of in a single playthrough. Almost every surface is untextured and there's minimal, if any, post processing. Surprisingly good lighting effects. The most detailed models in the game are the firearms, conspicuously floating in front of your invisible player avatar as part of the developers' conscious decision to not obstruct the weapon models with your mortal except not arms.The soundtrack is only one dynamic, tense and somewhat electro track which changes in intensity depending on your proximity to enemies and certain items. Weapons sound distinct and accurate to life. You'll quickly learn to dread that BEEP.It has elements of the roguelike genre: the levels are generated by stringing together rooms in a random order and randomly placing enemies, items and even leaving your firearm in a random condition every time - means you are just as likely to spawn with two full mags as you are to spawn with nothing but a single round in your magazine. Death is swift, taking just one bullet or one zap from any enemy to start generating a new level.It stands out from other games through its incredibly detailed portrayal of the firearms. Every weapon has keys associated with different functions that are part of an intricate reloading and readying process. The standard M1911A1 handgun has you: ejecting the magazine, holstering the pistol, loading live rounds into the magazine, drawing back out the pistol, loading the magazine, then, if necessary, racking the slide to chamber a round from the magazine. The two other handguns in the standard game, the Glock 17 with a fire selector and the S&W Model 10 revolver, have their own unique functions as well: the G17 foregoes an external hammer and traditional safety toggle in exchange for a larger magazine capacity, reduced individual shot power, and a full auto toggle that should really only be used in emergencies. The Model 10 revolver, meanwhile, lacks a traditional magazine; you must open the cylinder, eject all rounds that may or may not be spent from the cylinder, insert up to 6 fresh bullets, then close it back and optionally pull back the hammer for the fastest trigger response. Ballistics overall are highly detailed, with bullet drop-off over distance, muzzle velocity, impact penetration and even ricochet chance depending on surface and angle of firing - be careful of shooting yourself in the foot!The gameplay is part first person shooter, part horror (limited resources all around, and attacking poses a significant risk of wasting precious ammunition; running is a risky option) and part stealth (the two enemies featured require line of sight to engage and can be detected early by an attentive player via their projected lights and buzzing/droning sounds). The stationary turrets spin in a 360 degree angle and are easier, relatively speaking, to avoid or to disable, while the hoverbots... are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. A huge part of their bodies are not vulnerable to being disabled, while the weak points are much more difficult to hit on a small, constantly moving and especially zipping-towards-you target. The control scheme is such that you will fumble with it the first dozen or so lives, but an in-game help menu can provide guidance on quickly getting your gun ready to fire at a moment's notice, so it becomes a matter of muscle memory - just like real life reloading, in fact.It's a $5 game but it's most likely worth your investment if you're any shade of gun nut or if you enjoy first person shooters. For anyone else, you should grab it as part of a bundle.			",82,7,11,7,10,1,7

												So, yeah, it's difficult.How difficult?The game spawned me with a 1911 that had no bullets or magazines, and the nearest two rounds available were sitting under the stairs in a room guarded by a hovering taser drone.Literally, this game can be more evil than all of Hitler's incarnations, up to and including Keith Lemon.It's great.

												Horribly optimized for even high end systems. Go check the discussions page, I'm not the only one with this problem. The guns are fun to fool around with, but the moment an enemy appears the world generates its low textured, low modeled setting and it tanks hard. Avoid unless you are looking for a gun loading/unloading simulator.			",136,21,2,12,20,4,57

This is basicly the ultimate shooter trainer with mechanics that no ohter shooter will ever use. It's just 5 euro's and that's why it's good for some fun.If you don't like games that are difficult, don't buy it.Don't like having to git gud to play for fun??

												Receiver is a detailed pistol simulator with procedurally generated levels.  Shoot and dodge drones and turrets while collecting tape cassettes and ammo. You will spawn with one of three guns: an M1911A1, a Model 10 revolver, or a selective fire Glock 18, and a random assortment of ammo, magazines, and flashlight. The game has a short cyberpunk/dystopia narrative told over eleven tape cassettes. Receiver is challenging and addictive, definitely worth it in a sale for shooting or action fans.

												Receiver is more or less a proof of concept that actually comes off being a reasonable game. The primary focus is on mastering gun control. This includes ejecting the magazine, filling it with bullets, replacing the magazine, engaging the slide, and turning off the safety so it's ready to fire. It takes some getting used to, but it's not that difficult after a little practice.The game part ends up being a permadeath environment where you search for and collect audio tapes while trying to avoid being shot by randomly placed turrets and flying drones. The player spawns with one of three guns that may or may not be ready to fire, a random number of bullets and magazines, and sometimes a flashlight. The one aspect that makes this game engaging is that you always have to be aware of your gun state, especially how many bullets you have in your magazine before you decide to engage a target. Ammunition is scarce making shots that much more valuable. The turrets and drones are quite tough which, combined with the weapon control elements, makes for some very cautious gameplay.Make no mistake, Receiver is certainly rough around the edges. The environment isn't randomized; only the enemies and audio tape locations. The graphics are not interesting, nor optimized. It feels laggy at times. It can even unfairly spawn you with no gear or in a bad spot. However, it does master the element of weapon handling. It can become quite intense if your magazine runs dry while a drone is hunting you down and you need to pull off a precision reload in the moment. And for that aspect, I give it a thumbs up.

												Below you'll find both a written and video impression on the game


YouTube™ Video: Receiver: Impressions (Indie game gun simulator Gameplay and review) 

			Views: 320		

			Receiver: Impressions Receiver is an indie FPS by the developer of Overgrowth. The ""S"" in the FPS stands for simulation? This Receiver video was requested by our fellow subscriber ""plane crashers"".		

Receiver certainly is an interesting take on the FPS genre, but this time, the ""S"" stands for simulation.  Rather than your standard run and gun gameplay most FPS features, Receiver is much more deliberate where the focus isn't just on the shooting, but also on the gun itself. In Receiver you must manage every part of the gun, the slider, the hammer, the magazine, it's chamber, etc. If you don't take care of your gun, or understand how each part functions you will die... a lot. The game does a good job at simulating what it takes to handle a real gun. Due to it's vast amount of controls there is a definite learning curve with this game. It will not play like other FPSs you've played previously.The game is only $5usd, which isn't asking for a lot, but do know there are limited amounts of options, features, and content. There is only one play mode, only 2 types of enemies, and not much in the way of customization. Although the game does it's best to incentivize reply with it's procedurally generated maps, enemies, and load out, and each play through will be different from the last, but it will be ""different"" with a lot of very familiar assets.Certainly the game is challenging, and at first may even be frustrating to some, but it's also very rewarding. Once you manage to get over the difficulty and control hump, the game will feel like none other you've played. Each kill feels like a huge victory, and the game does a good job at instilling a legitimate sense of tension and danger around every corner.Overall Receiver is a quality product at a low price point. The content might be limited, but through the creativity of it's mechanics, there are also endless possibilities to play through.Pros:- Procedurally generated maps and load out offers endless play potential- Very unique mechanics and concept- Best gun simulation I've played (only gun simulation I've played?)- Challenging- Very fair priceCons:- Limited content- Moderate visuals- Large learning curve			",1483,526,23,180,133,13,163

Some other revolver I don't know the name of...+ROBOTS+Decent controls+Ability to ACTUALLY control your gunCons:-Only 3 weapons :(-Only 2 different enemies-Due to it using Unity, don't expect it to run if you have an ancient computer or really crappy laptop like mine.Summary:Great overall gun simulator, really needs some more weapons though.The three weapons you are given is.... Not enough. For a game like this, IT NEEDS MORE!However, I don't think it's worth it's current price.It's worth about two dollars less. It's a fairly small game.Also, there is this mod thingo that adds many more weapons, a shooting range, the ability to change what weapon you start with, and fixes a few bugs.I recommend getting this game.

												On the technical aspect, it really requires something with some power to run it, and that's suprising considering it has very few polygons, no textures, and not much that really would require a physics engine besides some things that kinda float around.That said, the more realistic take on firearms operation brings something new to the table for shooters, and the realistic take on your ability to not get shot and walk it off like nothing happened makes it hard, but I still keep wanting to try again, and that's something coming from me who easily gets bored/frustrated and walks off.

												The main selling point of Receiver is to ""explore gun mechanics"". This would be fine and all, if exploring mechanics did not mean having a horrible atmosphere, incredibly strange controls, and a very unpolished feel.Don't get me wrong, the guns are good. But there's only 2 of them. I understand that this was originally created for a 7-day game challenge, but I believe Wolfire could have worked on this a bit more to make it complete (oh, and updates are halted indefinately until Overgrowth, which has been in development for 4+ years, is out).The environments are randomly generated but you will see the same rooms put carelessly next to eachother over and over again. And I know that there are some things that can be considered the ""art style"" but almost every room has the same bland, unfinished texture for both the floor and walls. What gives?Finally there are the controls. It would be nice to really explore gun mechanics if I was able to use them easily. For Christ's sake, there are 2 different buttons to take out the magazine and put it back in. If you get back in the game after a break, you're going to have no clue what in the world you're doing, so you'll mercilessly slap your keyboard and memorize controls that should just be common sense.There are also 2 types of enemies. One is a turret and the other is some sort of flying robot that doesn't detect half of your shots and sometimes gives the impression that it is disabled when it really isn't.It's bland, it's boring, it's unresponsive, it makes no sense, and it won't change for a while.

In Short:This game... is very unique.Don't try it if you don't like trying new gimmic-esque things.If you do enjoy things like that, get Receiver on sale.  To startI first got this game a while back after remembering the gameplay from a random youtube video.I thought it was pretty basic ingameplay, in graphics, and story. I went in with fairly standard thoughts, ones you'd make yourself if you just took a couple minutes too look at this very storepage of the game.In Depth; GameplayEver play QWOP?You know, that weird relay racing game that was severely hard to control? Receiver is that, ""With guns"". Guns are very tricky and keybinding to use- that's the point of the game- to be very close to the real life counterparts. Press V to load bullets, holding a flashlight under your gun, turning off the safety, aiming down your sights, sprinting, all of that. Each key press feels impactfull and refreshing, and this game has a lot of keypressing - the good kind.You start with one gun, such as a Glock-18, Colt 1911, and a revolver, with a random selection of equipment. Such as extra magazines, bullets, and a flashlight. Using these guns, you must find more bullets, to fight more enemies (which I'll delve into later) which makes finding cassette tapes easier which are needed to finish the game.Each gun behaves differently. The revolver is a single cylinder based pistol, forcing you to reload every bullet (in total of 6)  that shoots fairly slowly. Enemies only take a few shots to kill making this weapon completely inferior to the others. The revolver still behaves differently with how it fires, and the keys you need to press to use it, which makes it fun to use.  The Glock-18 can be used in automatic fire mode as-well as single fire, has a big magazineYou'll find yourself emptying a entire magazine into one enemy that scared you.The Colt 1911 is the standard point 'n shoot, no gimmicks here. Great to use when you start with it.The enemies are 2 types of robots throw about in the fairly big map (The only map) you are on.Turrets and Drones. Each has their own unique sounds and lines of sight. The line of sight the two robots share add an element of stealth. Don't have ammo but see a turret perched up on a ledge?Try to sneak past it when it's not looking.Turrets are exactly as they seem. A rotating sentry that has an ammunition box that feeds bullets into a barrel, that goes straight into your body. Spawning in bathtubs, on stairs, sitting on a dinning room table, you know one is near due to it's very specific beeping, and sounds of the turret's motors rotating.Shooting it on the tripod it is on, immobilizes it. The turret can still shoot you if you are in line of sight but it can't rotate.Shooting the sensor will turn off the turret completely.The drones are much different. They are high up in the area, either in the sky or banging around near the ceiling. These bots will follow you in-till you successfully escape their line of sight. they are equipped with a tazing rod that forces the drone to charge at you from the sky. You'll either be running away hastily or pumping bullets into the poor machine hoping it will fall. Shooting the fans that power it's flight will result in the drone falling, though still being  able to taze your ankles, killing you. Shooting the light sensor (the line of sight) will make it blind and fall instantly.This robot however, if shot enough will eventually fall. It does have some significant armor though.You will find more ammo, (maybe another gun or flashlight too if you're lucky.) magazines and most importantly, cassete tapes while exploring. Each cassette tape enables a voice over explaining a part of the games overall story. Getting the required amount of these will take you a few times, either dying by a robot our clumsily falling off a ledge. Getting closer and closer to finding all the cassettes is very fun and rewarding. The Story Story is the standard ""Ooh, reflect on yourself!"" type story. pretty much all I can say without spoiling. I'll be hiding the story behind the spoilers. You are a ""receiver"", or a person who can listen to a few cassette tapes, literally hundreds of times, and then discover a hidden message in them. These cassettes are the ones found in-game, each one explains more and more about media, government, companies, etc all being corrupt and controlling the average consumer. Nothing special. The ending adds some decent closure, and a nice real life picture or two. It's not rememorable in any way, and doesn't make you think about a real life scenarios of the same thing.  Graphics and AestheticThis game has a basic polygon shader-esque aesthetic and art-style.It makes clear on whats happening but leaves out small details and designs. Which is fine.Games such as Grow up and Grow Home have similar art-styles. It's just player preference. Nothing noteworthy. Final ThoughtsAlthough the game has ~5 hours of content ~2.5 if you know exactly what your doing and dont screw around. I had quite some fun with it, some heart racing moments with some encoutners. 15 hours for 2.50 is a pretty good deal.Receiver doesn't have many bugs but it doesn't have much content either. Overall, it's a pretty well rounded game for it's price-point on sale.It's definitely worth to get on sale for 2.50 or below, but only if you are up for gimmicks and controls like QWOP or similar games. It's pretty unnoticed and considered a ""tech Demo""Regardless-It's a great pick from me, one of the games I'm most fond off.			",163,26,1,7,12,2,6

												Receiver is hard to rate, because it's an example of very abstract, unordered storytelling. I personally enjoyed it and enjoy doing run throughs of it occasionally, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone who either doesn't appreciate realistic gun mechanics or OHD (one-hit-death) games. Receiver is a game that was programmed from scratch in a mere 7 days for an FPS challenge, and it shows. Level geometry has nearly zero detail, levels are simple, and there's essentially no post-processing. However, the game works surprisingly well; everything is (weirdly) easy to tell apart, including enemies, and weapons make satisfying firing, chambering, and reloading sounds. The game's emphasis on survival and conserving bullet by bullet makes every miss on enemies all the more punishing, and by the end of a playthrough you'll wind up being a crack shot.The story isn't much to explain because it's unordered, on audio tapes, and abstract. It's a neat concept and it meshes well with the abstract nature the game exemplifies.The drawback to Receiver, which is less so a flaw and more a mechanic, are OHDs. Getting hit by any enemy in any form will instantly kill your character, and there's no kind of saving or checkpoints; you either gun it and get all 13 tapes, or you die. This isn't a big deal on its own, but falling a certain distance will also instantly kill your character, and unfortunately there are tons of chances for this to happen on accident.This isn't really a flaw since lots of games do this (like rogue-style games) but because of its fickle nature and difficulty, those looking for a stroll in the park won't find it.Ultimately, Receiver is a cool project that any shooter fan would probably enjoy experiencing. It's only real drawback, its simplicity, is also its greatest strength, and as a result I can't really recommend paying full price for it unless you seriously need to play it or you want to help the dev. Otherwise, goodluck beating the Mindkill. You'll need it.			",189,17,3,28,3,0,26

												The main gripe for this game for all the negative reviews is 1) the lack of content and 2) difficulty.1) It costs £4 and goes on sale frequently, not to mention it's free with Overgrowth, a brilliant early access title by the same devs. Not to mention it was made for a 7-Day FPS challenge, and acts as a proof-of-concept rather than a fully finished title brimming with content.2) The point of the game is to be difficult. You can't just press R to do a reload animation. You have to conserve ammo and fire accurately, while learning to reload the gun manually. That's the beauty of this game.The point of this review is, it's an amazing game for its price, and considering it was made for a challenge the length of a WEEK.			",333,44,9,28,20,2,21

 Recieiver Games rarely consider the details of ammunition. The amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface, and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button. Actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task, however. Receiver, an first-person shooter (FPS) from Wolfire Games, wants to remind us of that fact. Unfortunately, it never makes it clear why we should care.Receiver drops the player into a randomly-generated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration (without subtitles) and that explain the game's story. The player begins with an unpredictable loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition. The player may also start with a flashlight or, if his gun is semi-automatic, a spare magazine or two. He must then move through the multi-tiered linear world looking for the tapes, which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one. I myself haven't managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dying.The game only has two kinds of enemies: a stationary gun turret and a flying drone, both of which can kill the player with a single hit. Each has some associated visual cues, but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when he's been spotted and when it's safe to move. The distribution of enemies changes, and on rare occasions they can be avoided. Because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see, however, killing everything in a room is generally the only option.Receiver started as a response to a seven-day FPS challenge and definitely feels like it, from its spare graphics to its room-entry stutter. The hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail. The HUD has no ammo count, and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath. Rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand, with the gun safely tucked away. If there's no spare magazine, the player has to eject the empty, refill it, then shove it back home again. The only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eye.Receiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters. The detailed reloading scheme doesn't speak to the story, the aesthetic, or the other mechanics. Receiver doesn't treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading, and doesn't fiddle much with the basics of movement, yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game. By making the world randomly generated, the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters. As a consequence, becoming more skilled with the game's most intricate systems doesn't make a player any more likely to succeed. Receiver's complex gun-handling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger design.That's a shame, because the larger design has nothing to recommend it. The perfunctory story and low-poly world of Receiver aren't interesting to explore in their own right, much less when one must overcome the game's unforgiving difficulty. The choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value, but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics. Receiver has a neat idea at its core, but that didn't translate into an interesting game.Final Score:  3.5   4 /10  ",17,0,0,1,3,0,8

												Reciever is a realistic FPS designed for players who want to get the most out of gun games and realism. It gives you the ability to really understand how guns work which games such as ""Call Of Duty and ""Counter Strike"" don't provide to you.The game has suspense so you do not know what is around the corner so you must make sure that your gun is fully loaded and ready to go.Some things I would recommend added is machine guns and smgs of some kind instead of stinking to pistol classed weapons. I sometimes find the help A.I to be annoying because it is telling me to put the gun to automatic, etc. I highly recommend this game for people who like the way guns work or a looking for a gun game full of suspense.

												This game has a fantastic concept. The mechanic adds a tension to first person shooting that I've never felt before. If you're into analyzing games, it's worth checking out, even in its current alpha state.I would love to see this kind of mechanic worked into a survival horror game. It would make shooting in a horror game finally add tension, rather than take it away. Even with the graphics as basic as can be at this stage, and even though you're just shooting turrets and little flying robots, the game makes me feel more tense than many of the horror games I've played.I can't wait to see where this goes.

												I've spent over 50 hours playing receiver and I still have mixed feelings about it. The reloading mechanics are fantastic and I hope to one day see the same mechanics in a more fleshed out game.  Sadly past the reloading mechanics receiver is quite a shallow game. You only ever come across 2 types of enemy; turrets and drones, neither are practically fun to fight. There is only a small number of possible rooms so after you've played for a few hours the level design becomes very repetitive. The only objective is to find the tapes which can either be very tedious or ridiculously easy depending on the random level generator. Most of receivers problems come from the fact the bulk of the game was made in 7 days with only one real update after it's release, It's just a shame no more content was added afterwards. I hope one day a game developer will notice Receiver and make a properly fleshed out game built around It's gun mechanics.  but until that game comes out I'll just have to keep playing reciever and you will.

												One thing that should be noted is this game was made for a contest in a week so I am going to ignore most of the problems other people may have already said and I think this game should not be judged on those at all. This is more concept demo then a game with very realistic gun management and bullet physics I find it fun and actually quite addicting especially cause it is quite difficult. I only have two problems with the game the main one is I would like to be able to choose my gun istead of it being random and I really don't like is the voice of the guy on the recordings, if he reads this I hope he is not offended but somthing about the voice annoyed me it also sounds like it was recorded on bad tape recorder but you can easily turn the voice sound off so not a big deal. I think this is a very viable concept for a full game and I hope someone makes one some day and I would say that and the fact that it was made in 7 days allows me to ignore the problems I would usually judge a full retail game on, so it gets an 8/10. Pros:Unique conceptDetailed gun managementDecent replayability from random map and enemy placementGood controlsMakes you feel like a badass when you have the commands memorizedCons:can't choose pistolbad voice audiogenerally is not polished and has bugs(overlooked because it was made in 7 days)GOD DAMN DRONES(play it you'll know what I'm talking about)			",96,13,1,17,7,0,11

												Since I noticed many of the people who are reviewing this title have less than 10 hours played, I will write from the perspective of my hours playing it. The good? -The main attraction to this game is the ability to do everything like engaging the safety, racking the slide, an extra round in the chamber, and other stuff. -While the base game only has 3 guns(m1911, glock, model 10 revolver) there is a mod on the wolfire forum that adds new guns like a shotgun, Thompson, C96, and more.-VR. Not built-in though. On the Receiver steam forum someone just added a VR mod that works with oculus and vive. As of writing this review, the extra weapons mod doesn't work with VR just the base 3 guns.The bad stuff?-The main thing that this game suffers from is the lack of different rooms/environments. Even though they are generated, the game chooses from a list of different rooms and puts them together.-Lack of guns. If your not into modding then this is a deal-breaker.-Gets repetitive. This relates to the two points above.-Complex controls. I noticed that many of the people who wrote negative reviews are ones that didn't like the controls. Plus, they have low hours. But if you have played for a while , they become second nature. -When entering rooms it always freezes for a couple frames to load them up. This has gotten me killed plenty of times!Extra thoughts:I think that if your willing to mod it, get it on sale($1.50), and don't expect to play for hours at a time, this title will be a pretty fun game to come back to every once in a while. This is one of those games that is good to play for 10-20 minute bursts. It's easy to jump in and jump out of.   ",125,12,4,10,22,3,15

												I personally feel that this is one of the best firearm simulations available on steam, while the ""story"" is weird it is still fun to play. I also feel that this game deserves some credit due to the little amount of time it was issued for it to be produced, there a re three weapons including a colt m.1911, some form of the automatic glock series (i'm gonna guess a G17) and finally the classic colt revolver (I cant put a finger on the exact model). I personally also feel that a full game would be downright awesome, hopefully including something else than just pistols (assault rifles, shotgun etc.) This game actually ends to give a sort of tactical feel as well as a form of rage inducing. The ""rage"" (more annoying) is the F***ING flying tasers are incredibly hard to hit however not impossible (i personally think that they fit perfectly into the game). The other understandable point that is still annoying is that whenever you die, you start all over. Once again, I feel that this an understandable piece of the game and is completely rational, however it is still annoying.All in all I feel that this would be an amazing full game and is still a great game as the ""competition edition"" (the thing that it is right now)9/10			",181,18,2,13,17,2,18

												I hate this game with a burning passion, one hotter than the final breath that escapes you after you've been plastered with bullets from a stationary turret in the most ridiculous and unsuspecting spawn. If you don't prefer your blood being painted on the canvas on a wall then you can enjoy making your art on any ground surface as you find yourself making an incorrect leap or looking over the edge a bit too much. Otherwise, expect terror from a faint beep and the silent buzz, the robotic humming that will inch ever closer and even terrify you as to whimper as you knew not what would happen to you. The challenge the drives you to a point of insanity but forces you to keep returning only to repeat what you've tried contless times. I've, at long last, finally beat this game. ♥♥♥♥ You Receiver.

												This game is tense like no other. By creating a shooter based solely on realistically simulating a gun you're forced to start treating it like a gun. Ammo is precious, reloading requires you to concentrate on a process and aiming is delicate and precise. The controls may seem clunky and weird at first but once muscle memory kicks in it becomes a game about knowing your limits. You're not a run and gun badass, you're just a dude with a gun. You have to know when to kill the robots and when to walk away. In short, fantastic for the asking price.			",108,17,2,12,5,1,13

												How does one describe Receiver? Tis a weird little game with a bunch of cool features. Aight, we're gonna hafta split this up into pieces. STORY: The story of Receiver is similar to the first Hotline Miami in that the exposition is delivered in cutscenes in the form of various cassette tapes you find and have to play to finish the game. The story is that you are a Receiver, a survivor of the Mindkill event, an event that wipes the life off of the world you're on. Done by machines who had begun controlling the world, you are tasked to find all 11 cassette tapes and ascent to The World Not Filled With Turrets and Flying Tasers all the while dealing with the fact said machines are dropping in sentry guns and taser drones that can both drop your♥♥♥♥♥in 1 hit. GAMEPLAY: Gameplay in Receiver is the most interesting. It is similar to realistic shooters such as say Red Orchestra 2, Project Reality and so on. You get one of three guns, a Colt M1911A1, A S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver and a modified Glock 17 each with their own specialties, the Glock can fire in full auto, the Model 10 can be fired in single and double action and so on and so forth. Also different in Receiver is that you have to do many things via key presses, ranging from loading individual rounds into gun magazines, releasing slides, using the ejector rod in the Model 10 and so on. It seems complex at the beginning but become almost instictive after an hour or two.ENEMIES: As I said earlier, the enemies in the game are very basic, one is a sentry turret, the other a drone with a taser, or the ATF Special. Both of these are different as if you shoot specific parts of them, they do more damage. You can disable sentries by either shooting the CPU off to break it, disable it's battery or break the camera. As for the tazer bots, shoot it repeatedly, cause they're more annoying than the tazers in PAYDAY 2.IS IT WORTH IT?: The gameplay is rather solid and the gunplay is fun as well as realistic, and it sits at a nice $5 dollars. If you feel like spending $5 dollars on a small FPS then go ahead, if not, wait for a sale and nab it for cheaper.			",198,18,4,17,32,3,23

												Long story short: This is what deus ex would have been if it was done by the director of fight club. Minimalist, beautiful, hard, mesmeric. Utterly recommended.----Now more detail: Receiver is a minimalist and realistic FPS. The game features 3 different models of guns: a S&W Model 10, a Colt M1911, or a Glock 17. It also features procedural levels (generated from patterns), and randomized placement for enemies (of which I've seen two different types, so far), items and objectives. That way, you never get the same experience twice. In addition, you spawn with a random selection of items, which can make the game difficulty range from moderately easy to very hard, depending on what you get.The idea behind the game is to be as close to a realistic gun handling experience as it is possible with a keyboard and mouse. It means that the game maps to the keyboard/mouse a lot more interactions with the gun than existing titles, and also, does so with much greater details than usual FPSes. In addition, the difference in the power of each gun is very noticable, making the experience feel even more authentic.A must have.			",706,186,26,65,52,9,100

												as a firearms collector, the only downside of this game is it's difficult controls.  But all I can say is ""GET THIS GAME""now as for the firearms, stated earlier I am a firearms collector and had some pretty interesting addition ideas.1: Polish P63 MakarovThe P63 is a polish knock off makarov that fires the standard Makarov 9x18mm cartrage, it's slightly less powerful then a glock, but it's very slim, has an excellent sight picture, and is not prone to jamming.   It can make for an excellent concieled carry firearm and is readily available on the market for 150 dollars.2: Hi-Point .40 S&WHi-Point is another company for people on a budget, but what they build really hits a mark.  The .40 S&W cartrage is a mix between a .45 and 10mm, giving you the power of a .45 and the accuricy/mag count of a 10mm.  Why a high point?  Because we should all give some oddball guns some love.3:  Mauser C96 Broomhandle This would be a good fully/semi automatic model to add to the game for a few reasons: 1: it's gorgous2: It's full auto and semi auto3:It uses a stripper clip, and I feel you should add some of the more awkward loading mechanisms to the game4: It's gorgous... need I say more?Please consider these firearms.  They are all very easy to use and maintain, making it less of a pain on the user to fire them.  That and these would all be excellent additions to your game			",130,16,1,6,9,2,2

												There's a reason they were giving this game away for free. Cool gun mechanics don't make up for crappy and repetitive design and unfinished, empty gameplay. This isn't a finished title, it's an experimental pistol simulator that doesn't make any sense and is confusing and ugly to look at.Gun nuts might enjoy it for its realism, every one else is better off giving it a miss.Full video review:

												Awesome shooter. The game give some feeling that you can't reach plaing COD or same shooters.Your gun here is not only a TV remote where you just press one button to fire and another for reloading. Here you should control each mechanism of a gun independently and learn how to do it faster. It's very cool at the beginning and it is still cool after hours plaing, because you always feel how you raise your mastery.Here every hit is fatal. You cannot heal your wounds just sitting in a cover. If you injured you can't survive. It give another nice feeling when you don't want to die and trying to survive as harder as it possible.Random generation is very good. Every play is something new. You cannot predict where should be a turret and where will be bullets. Every time you should search each corner and be ready to use your gun.			",69,18,2,6,4,0,2

												Aside from it being a labor intensive shooter, it's pretty good.By labor intensive, i mean, you have countless buttons to reload a gun. You actually have to take your time, rather than just pressing R.Also, i'm not a fan of the story. It feels like a Youtube tutorial or something. I'm not a fan of listening to tapes of a droning 50 year old about a story somebody thought up during a night at the bar.While i'm here, a tip (If you get it): Check your gun on each spawn. Trust me.			",106,22,0,13,18,0,16

												Receiver is an INCREDIBLY challenging game. You will hate it and love it at the same time.You play an unnamed protagonist navigating through various indoor and outdoor areas in a structure located in an unnamed city. Many of the rooms are guarded by randomly-placed sentry turrets that shot you on sight, or helicopter/taser sentries that fly at you when you are detected. You come armed with one of three different handguns, all of which are nicely-rendered. Each one is operated in a realistic-manner that may be off--putting to the gamer used to relading by simply pressing the R key. In this game, reloading could involve five distinctly-different operations, depending on the gun you happen to have on you at the time.  The sound effects of the guns are nice, and have an authentic feel to them.The environments you travel around in are randomly assembled, and comprised of flat-shaded textures and occasional lights. The assembly of the rooms means that you occasionally find passages to nowhere, but that doesn't really detract from gameplay. Repetition is high, and some of the rooms/areas are confusing, but since you are just passing through, it's not really a big deal. Your goal is to locate ammo and tapes, and the threats are there to stop you.Audio is pretty good, with a couple of notable exceptions:1: the helicopter sentries are loud enough to be heard from one room over, but it becomes difficult to pin down their locations based on the audio alone. 2: The sentry turrets also make sounds while they rotate, but you can't hear them until you're almost right on top of them. Their sounds, as well as the helicopters,  also pass through walls/floors at the same volume level. This aspect of the game is bothersome if you are searching a room. I prefer to play the game with the music silenced so I can try to hear the threats before they spot me, and often I find that I am shot dead before ever hearing the servo motor of the turret that nailed me. 3: The audio tapes are well-voiced, but remind me a lot of the sort of thing you might find on a webiste run by fringe-science/conspiracy theorists. After playing for a few hours, I completly silenced the tapes because I became bothered at having to hear them over and over again. Kudos to the devs for allowing this option in the settings. The main goal of the game is to find all 11 tapes, and ""absorb"" them by listening. Listening occurs while you continue exploring, so that's a good thing. I did find a couple of small problems with the exploration/survival aspect:1: Sometimes the game allows you to access an area that does not have an exit. The only option is to exit and restart. 2: You are assigned a random firearm and random loadout upon starting. Rarely, you will find yourself without enough ammo to eliminate enough of the threats to be able to find more. 3: (Extremely rare) you begin the game in the direct line of site of a threat, and get killed immediately.For a game created in a week as part of a contest, the developers have done an admirable job! The simplicity of the design and the addictiveness of the concept keeps me coming back over and over again. I've only managed to get as high as 4 tapes before being mowed down by a threat in a moment of complacency. The game forces you to be on high-alert at all times, and punishes relaxed attitudes brutally. You will learn to use expletives effectively, I guarantee.Worth every bit of the 5 bucks it currently is. Get it. You'll be glad you did.			",54,4,0,5,5,0,0

												Fun game.Gets real boring when you realize it's the same old same old thing over and over and over again, though, and once you get all tapes, that's it, you're gonna be pretty done. Enemies are the same two over and over again. Flying sentry robots, and turrets.Operating the handguns in Receiver is the only part of the game what will keep you engaged. If you don't have a weird hardon for guns then you're not gonna be into this game.One thing I find weird - I've been shot a bunch by a turret before, then had time to duck into cover, only dying a couple seconds later. Just peculiar.I still recommend it, because, hey, a weeks work resulted in this? Eh, fair enough. It is what it is.			",433,58,5,45,25,5,63

												First be warned that Receiver is more of a short demo than a full game. Personally, i love its concepts, and i would love it to become a full game. Here is why.It mixes in two of my favourite things in gaming: survival horror and attention to detail.You start off with either of the three handguns: M1911 Colt, a double action revolver, or a Glock, and random amount of ammo with you. The point of the game is to wander around in search of the cassette tapes, and there are eight of them. The levels are random generated, and have enemies, ammo and/or cassette tapes scattered inside.The trick is that you can manipulate your gun. You can manipulate the slide, the hammer, take the magazine out, safety switch, and each gun works differently. For the colt and the glock, you have to check whether the bullet is in the chamber. Or for example, the colt requires you to pull the hammer to be able to shoot it. The revolver also has a hammer, but it is a double action, so it does not require you to pull it back, but you can still do it and it makes it more accurate that way.I also want to mention the enemies in this game - turrets and flying drones. The turret is stationary and it rotates. It has a camera and if it spots you, it starts shooting from its machine gun. The flying drone is a mobile version, with a tazer. One hit from either of them takes you down. Each enemy is made up of some parts: motor, battery, camera, weapon, and depending on where you shoot, you can either partially or fully take them down.You shoot a turret or a drone in the motor, it will stop spinning or flying, but its camera and weapon are still active, and if you get into its line of sight (turret) or close enough (drone), it will kill you.If you shoot its camera off, it will still fly around or spin, but it will be harmless.Also, the turret's machine gun has an ammo box, which you can shoot preventing its machine gun from shooting, but there is still one round in the chamber.Here is for the visual representation:


Enemy hitboxes 
A Guide for Receiver
By: Maxwell218

			  Greetings   Hi there receivers, In your training formation, we forgot to teach you something essential for your mission's completion: enemy weakpoints!		


As for the survival horror part, i think you have already guessed it. You start off with a pretty low ammo count. You must carefully use what you have, and try to actively find more ammo.The game is pretty hard to complete though, but what matters is not the ending, but the experience. That said, there are cheats to provide unlimited ammo, invulnerability and slow motion. I highly suggest using the slow motion cheat - just type ""slowmo"" and use to tab to switch back and forth in speed.			",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

												Receiver is a Procedural Death Labyrinth originally developed as part of a 2012 ""7 Day FPS Challenge"" by Wolfire Games, who've gone on since to develop Overgrowth forever. Right off the bat, it's more tech demo than game - everything about Receiver is incredibly barebones in every aspect. There are three different weapons you start with, randomly decided on startup. There are two enemy types and only one is a real threat. Aside from collecting 11 short tapes that detail the world, over and over again, your only real pickups are bullets for your one gun with the occasional moderately useless flashlight. But despite its barebones nature, Receiver is an incredibly fun tech demo. You control each and every minute aspect of the weapon. From manually ejecting the magazine and inserting each bullet, to inspecting the chamber and messing with the slide lock, your firearm is a precise instrument of beauty when being handled. This has the side of effect of slowing the gameplay down to a crawl, which when provided with the mostly stationary enemies and emphasis on not being seen, and especially that each enemy has five or six weak points that mandate precise aiming, Receiver is the essence of a survival game. Perhaps even survival horror, given the stress.It's not difficult to explain why Receiver has captured the interest of so many. It is an incredibly engrossing game. It's far from a perfect or even polished game, however.All of the art in the game is incredibly simple - apart from the looming cityscape, it's all very simple geometric shapes with no textures and no complexity. It is, therefore, such a surprise that the game runs so badly. Even running at the lowest resolution with the fastest graphics option enabled and no other programs or windows up, I was still experiencing slowdown. Whether or not this is a side effect of developing for Unity is for someone else to decide.As mentioned before, the procedural generation is incredibly vapid. There's also only about two dozen room types, and whether or not you succeed at the game very quickly becomes a question of if you can avoid an encounter of a room packed with flying killdrones long enough to gather all the tapes to hear the story and end the game, which just ends the process. There's not even a save function.For the story itself - there's a sense of enlightenment that you can experience regularly on the internet. It's when you're viewing a perfectly normal image, and then it dawns on you that you're actually flicking through pornography. This is like that, except with somebody's paranoid fantasy. The ""Mindkill"" and the media being instruments of mass destruction is a hilariously tinfoil to say the least.However, with all this in mind and that the biggest disappointment is the lack of content, the gameplay itself is ultimately fun enough to override all concerns. It's fun enough that despite being one of the most shallow ""rogue-lites"" yet, it's also one of the best.If you're in the market for a ""one of a kind"" survival game set in a Cyberpunk Dreamscape, then I couldn't recommend Receiver more. Just don't expect an overwhelming amount of actual stuff in it.			",167,32,1,20,5,0,2

												Surprising indie gem. One of the tightest FPS experiences I've everplayed. Premise of the game is simple--you're dumped into a kind of 'dream world', and you need to recover a series of tapes to 'wake up' (think The Matrix meets Videodrome meets Vanilla Sky. Or something.)You're moving through a series of what are, apparently, interconnected apartment buildings, each with multiple floors that connect across. There are enemies scattered throughout, but only two types: flying kill drones, and turrets. Kill drones will fly straight for you and electrocute you at close range, turrets will shoot a spray of bullets at you from afar.So far, so generic, and a lot less content than most FPS. So why play?Well, what makes the game work so well are the detailed mechanics.First off, if you're struck even once, or fall, that's it--you're dead. Going gun blazing into a room is pretty much game over.Second, you control every mechanic of your gun with a separate keyboard key. Just arming and firing your weapon will take you a few playthroughs to learn, but when you do--it's amazing how rewarding your actions feel.Third, running requires that you 'tap' the forward key, lending a neat kinetic element to the game.Fourth, ammo is scarce, and you'll have to selectively choose which fights you want to engage in... and which to bypass or run for it.Despite the sparse world and somewhat rudimentary graphics, sound design and aesthetics are brilliant, and I haven't been so kinetically into a game since the days of Atari 2600. Bravo!It's hard to explain the culmination of all of the above elements; you'll simply have to try it out for yourself. It's unlike any oher FPS and revolutionary at what it does. I guess I would call Receiver the 'thinking man's shooter'. It's terrific; buy it, then go yell at the devs to show it a little love and update it rather than spending all their time making rabbit-fighting games.			",519,227,13,122,80,7,131

												A very interesting take on a shooter. It was a flash game and doesn't present any real reason to play for more than a few minutes at a time.

												Receiver is probably one of the most creative games i think ive played an a long time. With lovely voice acting, two pistols and a handful of other items to work with this game has some jazz to it. I just wish that some of the tapes would not be so loud and that the turret and drone can be killed easier. Also, it would be nice if there was a  ""steady aim"" button because when i try to aim, i just end up shooting everywhere and dying. All in all Wolfire did a great job makin this game and i rate it a 7/10!			",168,20,1,14,20,1,14

												Got this game for free from Humble Bundle and my first thought was ""how lame does this look?""  Upon giving it a chance and playing it...wow.  Sure, it's very bare-bones and has a simple premise, but it's much more complicated then it looks.  Gone are the days of auto-reloads and clicking fire until your enemy is dead.  This game relies on knowing your ammo levels, actually pulling the magazine out of the gun, reloading it by hand, and then re-inserting the magazine before you can fire at your next target.You are set in a housing complex of sorts that is spotted with machine gun turrets and roving, flying taser-bots.  It's a lot harder than you'd think!  Would love to see this game flesh out some more (also to add some arms to relieve the creepy ""invisible man"" effect.Worth a shot to play!

												I really wish I could reccommend this game. I really do. The gun mechanics are amazing and satisfying, but just not enough happens. I understand it was made in 7 days, but allow me to sum up the gameplay.You spawn. You♥♥♥♥♥♥around with your gun until it makes bullets come out the end. The sounds are satisfying and the buttons intuitive. You are content. You walk down a hallway, pick up a tape recorder. The most unhyped guy ever starts droning the controls you have already learned at you. Fair enough, voice acting is hard. You walk through a door, a flying drone comes out of nowhere , acts like you are firing cusions at medium velocity at him, then zaps you to death.You spawn. Rinse and repeat.Thats it. I wish there was more, there is so much potential here, but for this, its not worth it. Instead, I would reccommend Papers Please for the money, or SUPERHOT for a free demo of a game with a much more interesting concept. Stay clear at least until more is added.			",88,10,0,3,9,0,8

												Alright kiddies, lets talk about Receiver.  This is a gun porn game. You get bullets, you get a gun.  That's it. One hit, and you die.  You've got two enemies, stationary turrets and flying tazers. You're dropped in this tower complex and have to find eleven cassettes to unleash your mind powers and finish the game.The plot doesn't matter.  This is a gun porn roguelite with gunporn and swat gameplay.  Its simple and low overhead, but high concept.  You're going to check corners, sprint erratically (none of that 360 no scope ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), and will start praying that the next set of rooms you encounter will have more bullets or clips. You can die from fall damage, you will risk falling to make a running leap for those bullets. You will crouch around corners to kill those turrets with three shots to their base. You will dip around corners to try and take out their sensors to save those precious rounds for later.  Those bullets are all that stand between you and oblivion at the hands of the enemy. Your psychic powers will make them glow like manna from heaven. You will take every spare second to load every spare bullet into a clip. After every engagement, you will check your gun and your ammo and make sure you don't spend the last free moments of your miserable existence frantically trying to load bullets in a clip while a hovedrone closes in for the kill on your enormous head.You are also going to fail, a lot.  But many of you like that, and it can be very satisfying to clear half a level only to fail in a hail of gun fire or miss that ledge for those precious shiny bullets.This game was developed for the 7 day FPS challenge and is the most streamlined experience for the FPS genre I have ever played. I have never beaten it, and I will never care. It is the thrill of dropping a hover drone from beyond its range, the joy in disabling a turret in a single shot, the chill of creeping into a new area and seeing the blue grid shine out from its sensors.This is a gameplay experienced refined to its purity.  I would enjoy an open world survival game based on these gunporn mechanics, if it played as smooth as this.			",267,68,1,54,19,2,57

												Best gun simulator out there.Seriously now, this game is all about knowing how to pistols realistically so expect to be really confused at first. Your first impression will most likely be that this is just a bad project made on Unity but if you keep playing it for at least 10 minutes you really get into the mood of the game. Although I will not spoil the game, be prepared to study how each pistol works and learning how to manage bullets is essential. This game really shows how wrong modern shooters are about how guns actually behave like in real life and gives you an idea of how really hard it is like to use one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More of a concept / tech demo than a game, but this is really cool.  This is less about what you are shooting and more about how to mechanically work a handgun.  There are 3 types of handguns you can randomly spawn with each time you start, and each operates differently.  There doesn't seem to be much to this game, but after 2 hours I am still interested.  If you want to actually 'beat' the game, I imagine it is very challenging.  Definitely worth picking up, especially if on sale.			",79,9,0,4,9,2,7

Since then, there have been over 50 school shootings in the United States alone.Coincidence?  I think not.This game was published by the Illuminati, to weed off the kids in schools so the only ones left are uneducated and unable to retaliate against their quest for Global Domination.  Well, kiddies, I've grown wise to their tricks.I'm putting my life at great risk by making this information public, but it's the truth, and you deserve to hear it.  Stay safe, young warriors.

												Decently interesting, though terribly optomised (I suspect there's memory leaks or video leaks all over the place, and it tends to generate the next area at a critical moment.)The atmosphere is the strongest I've felt in recent games - the oppressive ""hunted"" ""survival"" feel combined with the technical dexterity you have to employ to use the firearms make it feel quite intense at moments. The ending is slightly underwhelming though, even if pretty clever.It is also very difficult.			",216,30,2,29,13,0,37

												Receiver can be classified as a first-person roguelike-like, or as a better name, a procedural death labyrinth. In Receiver you play as... well a Receiver, who is someone who has survived what is known as the ""Mind Kill"" and must collect eleven tapes hidden in the world armed only with a pistol and some bullets.The game is procedurally generated, almost fully it seems, the world, what pistol and how much ammo you start with, what is placed where, is all generated on the fly, the layout of levels seem to be the same but not the placement, sort of like the game takes these block shaped rooms and places them in whatever order it feels like.The core concept of this game is simple, you start with a random gun picked out of a pool of three types, there are two kinds of robots, turrets and drones, you die in one shot, you must collect eleven tapes, as you gain more tapes, the rooms get harder as there will be more and more robots.Where the unique part of this game comes in is the weapon mechanics, this is not a normal first-person shooter, you can't just aim the gun and expect it to fire, the game simulates to some degree actual pistol mechanics using keyboard shortcuts, so to fire your gun you need to make sure you have bullets in the magazine, make sure the safety is off, pull back the hammer, and so on and so forth.Each action is done rather easily as the controls are very natural and intuitive as well as customizable, once you start playing more and remember the controls you can actually reload and fire faster, much like in real life where speed could be everything, all the guns have a real tactile feel to them, and there is nothing more satisfying then dropping a magazine onto the floor and slamming in a new one that you hand loaded before, pulling back the slide and taking down a robot as it flies toward you.Overall I love this game, despite how simple it is the gameplay is incredibly fun and replayable and is challenging but never seems to be frustrating, having very snappy gameplay and tight controls.

												A purely mechanics-driven shooter. Conceptually it's really cool but to actually play it... not so much. I enjoy going through the motions of loading the gun but it feels awful to actually shoot. I suppose that's why most games focus more on the whole shooting part. I just don't really have any incentive to play after reloading the gun a couple times. It's painfully slow to navigate around, the tapes you are tasked with collecting are boring as hell. Just watch a video of this for a couple minutes and you'll know whether it's for you or not.			",522,209,12,66,40,3,51

												Receiver is... very interesting.In a good way, of course. When you first jump into the game you'll find yourself armed with one of three different handguns, a variety of bullets and/or magazines, and, if you're lucky, a flashlight. This is one of the key features of Receiver - everything is random. Your loadout, the layout of the world, items in the world - just about everything is random in every playthrough (and trust me, you'll be playing through a lot). There's also perma-death - when you're shot (or tazed) by the automated turrets and shock-drones, you're down for the count and thrown into a new world with a new loadout head-first.But even with these different mechanics, what makes Receiver all that interesting if you just get three guns and a flashlight? That would be the five or so different buttons needed to reload. In Receiver, you don't just hit 'R' to slap another mag in, you manually pull the empty magazine out with 'E', holster your gun with '~', slot any spare bullets you have into the magazine with 'Z', draw your gun again, hit 'Z' again to slam the magazine in, and hold 'R' for a second to chamber a round. There are a couple other buttons to do a few extra things, too, and each gun has it's own reloading mechanics (these controls being for the Colt 1911. There's a simpler S&W Revolver and Glock 17 available).While these controls sound unnecessarily clunky, and I can't say they're realistic, it adds a new horror to your gun going 'click' while an enemy is charging you. You don't wait a couple seconds for the gun to auto-reload - you have to keep a clear head and go through each step of the process. Which is why you end up respawning a lot, unless you pause for a minute and drill yourself in the reloading process. This is the key feature of the game, and much more interesting (not to mention satisfying) than it sounds. And, come on, the game's only five bucks without a sale, and if you pre-order Overgrowth (which is a great game) you get this for absolutely free. You (hopefully) won't regret it :P			",222,24,2,27,6,0,30

												Receiver is an odd mix of brilliant idea and incomplete design. Essentially, it's more of a proof of concept than a finished game. Reloading, managing bullets, switching switches and all the various bits of micromanagement that we take for granted when playing most FPS games all add up to making for a fun experience that give an awesome feeling of knowing you've done the whole process yourself. It's thoroughly satisfying when you first figure out how to unload, drop mag, reload new mag and unlock the slider all in a second. That's the game's main selling point and it does it well. What you might not expect is that this is a very tense, almost horror game that gives off a creepy, lonely atmosphere. I've not felt like that since playing Amnesia.All this creates a great game but there are major problems that mean I simply cannot recommend it (but only just). Firstly, it's buggy, unoptimized, void of any real detail, has dull scenery, there's no choice which gun you start with, there are only two enemies and it often feels very unfair when you spend ages looking for cassettes without finding a single one or start with only 3 bullets and finding no more around. As I said, it's a great proof of concept but it's not a finished game. For that reason, I can't recommend it. If you happen to have it free then give it a go and feel like a champ in a cardboard world.			",165,23,3,15,17,2,37

												When your magazine clicks empty, there's two turrets between you and the next room, and an electro-drone is after you, your heart gets going. Learning to use the guns is very rewarding. Learning how to handle your enemies is rewarding. Limited resources lead to very exciting moments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome. It has an interesting story, but that's not what keeps me playing. The fact that you have no idea where or how you're going to start, and the suspense of roaming the area, never knowing what will be around the corner, is exactly what keeps me playing this game.  At one point the game started me off with two clips and a pistol and a flashlight. It's a pretty good way to start off. The first enemy I encounter I had a perfect shot, but then it spotted me. I aimed and fired... although all I heard was a *click*... I had a clip in my pistol, but there was nothing in it. The game started me off with a flashlight, two full clips,  but nothing in the clip that was in my gun. This game is worth way more than it's being sold. I highly recommend this game to FPS gamers or anyone that likes a challenging game. ",295,72,10,37,41,3,42

												A game of concepts, and it works.In this game, you are allegedly a 'Receiver', who has to find about and stop the 'Mindkill'. This is no easy task, as you spawn randomly, sometimes with mags and ammo, and other times now. Speaking of mags/ammoo, you must manually reload your mags with ammo found scattered throughout while finding the casette tapes. Makes for some tense action if you are being chased by flying robots. It's $5 so why not? It's good, the soundtrack is good, (albeit limited to one track, that i've heard at least, which is fine considering how it was made in a week.)The game can be very frustrating sometimes until you get a handle on the reloading mechanics.Overall an 8/10.

												Got it for free when I bought Overgrowth. Basically, it's handgun porn. It's repetitive, but once you learn the controls, you keep coming back despite the Dark Souls-like punishment for screwing up. Sometimes I've flicked the game on, promising to spend only a few minutes, and then I look at the clock later and discover that an entire hour has gone by. It's pretty good, with two exceptions.1: This guy is the weakest person alive. I mean, okay, getting shot once and you go down, that's fine, but I've jumped out of trees higher than the distance this guy will break his legs upon landing from.2: It runs very poorly. I'm not sure whether that's due to inefficient coding or whatnot, because we all know the circumstances by which this game came about, but I can hear my computer chugging away even on the lowest graphics settings, and the game stutters like a chipmunk on crack. Meanwhile, I can run The Witcher on its highest settings without so much as a drop in the framerate.Had this been pitched to me on paper, I would've said, ""Go back and finish it, then we'll talk."" However, now that I've spent some time with it, and gotten addicted enough to find all the tapes, I must say that had I known it was this much fun, I would have paid full price.

												I love the game, especially the gun mechanics. It makes me feel very in control and unrestricted. The controls are suprisingly easy to learn too. However, one, I think the game's too dark for my liking. I know it's intentional, probably for the flashlight, but I'd like something a bit lighter personally. Two, the drones are ♥♥♥♥ing hard to stop. Please, change this a bit. It's hard to kill one drone chasing you, let alone three. I love the game, and I feel like you could use the engine and guns for a lot of other stuff. Also, I think it would be cool if you could pick up attachments for guns and stuff, and also drop the extra flashlights.But, over all, I love the game!			",54,7,0,5,8,0,3

												If you thought there were no challenges left for FPSs, think again, because this game is a huge challenge itself. You will most likely assume that this guy is just like your typical shooters, but no. Sadly, it's not. Receiver is truly a gun simulator that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥so many times that you will get frustrated beyond belief. I sat hitting almost every single key on my keyboard only because I didn't know how to reload/switch magazine. It almost made me forget how to shoot. It requires a lot of memorizing, because you will need to know what each button does. When you have started to get a hold of the commands, there will be a lot of practicing. This game doesn't perform on easy mode, if anything, it is ""realism mode"". The Glock and M1911 are the most complex guns so far. If anything, you should start out with the revolver. The easiest gun to get used to (that is until I found out how to reload...).Was this easy? F*** no! Was it fun? Surprisingly, yes. Mainly because of the challenge.9/10			",89,29,1,14,11,1,5

												Terrifying in it's technicality.While this is not a horror game, it really plays like one. With the constant fear of turrets and flying drones ready to kill you in a single shot, and the multitude of keys required to handle and operate your firearm, this game will have your palms sweating after a few seconds.One hit, one kill, is what you'll learn all of the ""bad guys"" in this game deal. If you get hit by a bullet, or tazed by the drones, you're down for the count. Which is great, you have to be much more tactful in your efforts to solve the puzzle of this game. But ammo is often scarce, and danger looms around every corner. Match that with the creepily monotone voice of the man on the recordings guiding you through this Mind Kill event, and you have yourself a very intense journey through an every changing maze.This game is awesome, but be prepared to lose your mind when you forget how to reload, or unknowingly step into the sights of a turret. I suggest playing with the help menu open :).			",81,9,1,2,3,0,1

Receiver is an FPS (First Person Shooter) based around the idea of an apocalyptic setting where are reality is a realm of shadows, our media (as we call it) controls us, feeds off of us, studies us and kills us. The story and the soundboard for this game is eerie beyond belief. The Dev team that created Recevier is one of the more caring teams, while small, they provide good products in due time. For five dollars or for free with a copy of Overgrowth, this game has by far earned my respect and satisfaction.

												Keep in mind that this game was made on a game jam, in only two 2 days, don't expect the world here.It's a reandomly generated ""dungeon"" game, whereyou objective is to find all the 11 audio tapes trough the map. Your weapon and ammo is also random, sometimes you can have a 9mm pistoll with 3 full clips, other times you can have a revolver with 5 bullets.Each piece of the gun has its own button, so if you want to reload your revolveryou need to open it, then shake it down to take out the bullets, reload it bullet bullet by bullet and then closing it. Pistols in the other hand are faster to reload, but you need to reload the mags before using them, and to make it you have to put your gun out of your hands. This makes reloading be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ rewarding and very tense at the same time, depends on the person.Also, enemies which are only 2, can be damage in multiple ways, like the turrets which keeping scanning the map, you can shoot the camera and make it blind, you can shoot it's base and lock it facing one direction, or you can shoot the support of it and make it be facing the ground.It's a fun litle game, if you want an fps with doesn't hold your hand in any way and make your bullets really count, you can take a few hours of enjoying out of it ^_^.

												Edit: Just to clearify, I bought the game directly from the developers, and have not played it after it was released on steam, which is why I have 0 hours on Steam.It's a very hard game.You won't be able to get to ""the end"" within your first day of playing, unless you learn motorics extremely fast.Due to the difficulty it is also a very rewarding game. Not in a materialistic way, but in a mental way.When you manage to take down your first trio of flyers you'll feel like a boss.That feeling doesn't get old very fast - since you will probably die within the next few rooms since you inevitably wasted a lot of bullets by fighting three enemies at the same time :PIt's pretty rinse/repeat when it comes to gameplay mechanics, but luckily the rooms, enemies, tapes and weapons are randomized so that adds more replayability to it.If you are interested I suggest getting it in the Overgrowth preorder bundle directly from wolfire.com.You'll get access to both the Overgrowth alpha, Receiver full game AND Low Light Combat.

												Do you consider yourself a gun enthusiast? Do you think shooting a gun is easy? Do you like to shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥If you answered YES to one or more of the questions above, Reciever is definitely for you.Get a good look at how guns operate, collect audio tapes with weird messages, and shoot sentry guns and hoverbots before they end you. There are a lot of controls for something that seems as simple as ""point and shoot"", but this game shows that operating a gun properly is anything but.Gunporn/10			",242,39,2,18,16,2,6

												I love the game, especially the gun mechanics. It makes me feel very in control and unrestricted. The controls are suprisingly easy to learn too. However, one, I think the game's too dark for my liking. I know it's intentional, probably for the flashlight, but I'd like something a bit lighter personally. Two, the drones are ♥♥♥♥ing hard to stop. Please, change this a bit. It's hard to kill one drone chasing you, let alone three. I love the game, and I feel like you could use the engine and guns for a lot of other stuff. Also, I think it would be cool if you could pick up attachments for guns and stuff, and also drop the extra flashlights.But, over all, I love the game!			",54,7,0,5,8,0,3

												This game is really an unpolished proof of concept, and not an actual developed game, though it is somewhat playable. I love the gun handling mechanics and its absolutely worth playing just for that. Once you've begun to master the mechanics of handling and reloading the different guns, it really is enjoyable. It feels rewarding to get proficient with each weapon. I wish someone would take this concept (of micromanaging reloads and gun handling) into a more playable more polished concept. As for Receiver, yes you can put a few hours into it, but ultimately it's too frustrating. There are only 2 types of enemies, some are too easy and some are nearly impossible. The stationary drones just spin in place, telgraphing their movements and give you plenty of time to shoot them with well timed and aimed shots. The aerial drones, which I refer to as ""Flying F!@#s"" are impossible. There is just no way to see them (all) in time and they are just too fast, some rooms will spawn 4 or 5 of them. Your field of view is too small to see them and they are just way too fast and maneuverable. I think they were supposed to be an enemy who would force you to rapid reload under pressure, but in practice they either don't detect you and drop with one shot, or you empty your mag on one while the other one zaps you from behind. I really do like playing this, but its not developed to a stage where you'd really want to try and ""play through"" to the end (believe me I've tried). From the enthusiasm of the ""tapes"" I can't imagine the ending being very rewarding anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've only spent a small amount of time playing this. The mechanics are exciting, the Killdrones definitely live up to their names, and one singular mod has made this game better than base. I highly recommend that you mod this game with the mod that adds guns like the Mauser C96, the Tokarev TT33, and the Remington 870.Now, the game dips quite a bit on optimization; you can only run it smoothly on fastest/640x480 video settings, but it still is good enough. As the game generates nearby rooms, it also can lag up and make it troublesome to kill that one drone that saw you enter but you can't see hurtling towards you. It also dips in vanilla choices and the game seems very incomplete without textures to cover the blank walls and only 3 guns.The story behind the game is what you take from it, but I'll let you in on what I took from it.You have survived a great cataclysm called the Mindkill, which was an attempt at shutting down your brain with propaganda and media corruption. A receiver is a person who can turn around the negative effects of the Mindkill, with the help of a set of Cassettes called ""Clear Tapes"" to jog your mental capacity and remain on point. The killdrones and sentry drones are dreamed in to stop you from collecting all the tapes, to become awakened, and to stride carefree and conscious. While one can dream endlessly on, it takes one with true enlightenment to break free from the tyranny and claim their mind as their own.Heheh, I probably botched that up hardcore.This game gets a 8/10, with a WHOLE lotta room for improvement and even more potential. It's style is addicting and very enjoyable. Absolutely worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truly stunning, the feel of the weapons is amazing, the sense of achievement is the best of any game that I have played. Modern devs think that to make a good game, you need lots and lots of mechanics helping the player, whereas I think that its the other way around. The simplicity of the concept, yet the stress of reloading, ammo conservation and punishment for minor mistakes makes this game so very very satisfying, far more than a game with bosses that you get bored fighting and your only concern is how much all these shotgun shells are gonna cost. *cough* fallout 4 *cough*			",60,4,0,11,4,0,2

												This is more a tech demo than a real game.  Even so, the game aspect is so difficult, I haven't been able to beat a level once.  It uses randomly created levels, in which you have to find 11 objects.  Scattered in the levels are stationary enemy gun turrets, and flying ones as well.  You are provided with 1 of 3 weapons and some ammo, maybe a flashlight.  You can find more ammo in the level, and a few flashlights scattered around as well.Where this ""game"" shines is in it realistic weapon mechanics.  Guns are treated more as the tools they are than the violent weapons they can be used as.  Reloading my weapon while running from a flying enemy is the most satisfying reload I've had in a game!Several bugs in the game, but hey its a tech demo, what are you gonna do?Worth the money, try it out.

												in Receiver you'll 'receive' a gun (there are different guns) and your main goal is to find audio cassettes (a bit like Slender Man if u will). Automated Turrets and Flying robots are trying to stop you from finding all audio cassettes.Using the gun is pretty realistic, you will have to reload your ammo and check if you got a bullet in the chamber. Also ammo is very scarce and hitting targets is difficult. Failing to take out the turrets and/or robots quickly will result in a quick death, they will attack you with precision and you will die after one or two hits. Everytime you start a new game the map (and audio cassettes) are randomised so that adds to the replay value. For a game that has been made in just 7 days, Receiver is a really good game. Obviously you should not expect a game that will enjoy you for many hours, but the time you spend with this game is well worth it. ",1619,637,54,225,180,17,281

You are given 1 of 3 guns.The guns in the game are:-Glock 18-Colt 1911-S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" The tapes were NOT updated when the Glock and the S&W were added, so one of the tapes still considers your weapon to ALWAYS be the 1911.

												This game is a very entertaining puzzle-shooter that is challenging as hell and insanely intuitive in it's reloading. You actually manually cycle through the entire reloading process and start out with one of three different pistols including an M1911, a revolver and a Glock (I think). You must find ammunition and other equipment yourself, as well as a series of tapes that reveal the story of the game while avoiding security sentries and flying drones. No respawns, no retries for any given scenario. When you die, the scenario changes and everything is relocated. Sometimes you start with multiple full clips and a flash light, others you start with nothing but your gun. Ultimately, this is a fun game to play. Definitely comes highly recommended. Plus, Wolfire Games deserve all the props they can get for being so innovative.			",86,4,0,8,3,2,5

												The game is perfect for what it was designed to do. The only thing that is a complete shame is that it was made as an experiment and therefore is not being developed for anymore. If there was an additional few maps and an armory of weapons, then my 9.7 hours would most likely turn into 30-40 hrs easily. I became really good at the game and the only reason that I stopped playing was because there was nothing for me to move onto. A phenominal game considering what it is.			",159,6,0,10,4,0,4

My pain threshold is very low and I would probably uncontrollably faint if I were ever to take a single .22 bullet in the arm or leg.Receiver is a first-person shooter game that perfectly simulates how long I would last in a robot apocolypse.11/10 would forget to turn safety off again.

												As others have said before, this game is all about immersion.If you can get over the silly controls and get far enough to listen to the tapes, you will find an enjoyable story that reminds of many games and movies, though it can seem somewhat muddling, you will enjoy your time as a reciever.Always take into consideration that this game was made in 7 days for a game jam, and should be judged differently.

												I was expecting this game to be one of those 'press [r] to reload"" First-Person Shooters. I couldn't have been more wrong. This game goes where no other First-Person shooter has gone and actually requires you to manually complete every step in the reloading process of a handgun; whether it be revolver or pistol. You might think it's tedious, and it is. But once you get the hang of it, you are going to have a lot of fun.7/10.

												The game's rather... Well I can't say it sucks or isn't worth your time.Due to it's 5 dollar price, I personally think that it's mostly irrelevant if it's any good or not, unlike Gnomoria.The game is listed as an Experimental shooter with drones and turrets and it would be right about that, but just remember, even if the game acts a bit like Slender, The Eight Pages, there is no penalty for picking up the tape recorders.Also nothing will seek you out and kill you, well okay the drones will if they spot you.The game seems to rather accurately mimic how guns actually work, and you get to literally see every bit of most of the basics in how to work a gun, Atleast I would imagine so.There's about 3 guns and they all work differently actually, and each tape you pick up gives a bit of story into the game, and let me tell you, it's honestly rather sweet, almost Matrix-levels of awesome in my opinion. I won't give it away honestly.Coming from a guy who rage quits MOBAs because he sucks at most of them, and does so for weeks at a time, I haven't gotten past 1 tape (which you absorb apparently, atleast according to the game) and have died about 6 times, mostly due to turrets, and once due to a wierd drone that dryhumped my face and apparently shocked me.It is not hard to die in this game. Fall damage will usually always kill you, and I think if shot you will eventually die, even if you get away intact. The game's difficult and would benefit from Razer Hydra control support greatly in my opinion, maybe even some oculus Rift support too, though the difficulty at that point would only increase honestly.Play this game like you would play Dark Souls. Use your brain, observe the patterns of enemies and be stupidly cautious, and I'm sure you won't die as much.It's pretty fun. I've only played 12 minutes but it's still pretty fun.8/10 for a cool and originally executed concept, gun simulation... even if that REALLY needs to exist in alot of other places.Oh, did I mention it works like a Rogue-like game? Nope, I also didn't tell you about fake tapes in the level, or how the tapes don't play the first one, even if it is your first one until the game is reset completely.			",164,31,1,21,30,0,43

												Receiver, in my opinion, is quite an underrated game.I am, unfortunately, a gun nut, so maybe this game is a bit more enjoyable for me. But this game is underrated imo.When you get put into the game, you'll start off with one of three possible handguns. The Glock, 1911 or a revolver. Initially, you'll realise the controls are a bit hard to get used to. Several different controls for different functions, such as pulling the slide back or checking the chamber.In an hour or two's time, you'll find that you will barely need the help (which you can get by pressing '?', advanced help is holding '?') anymore. You'll also find yourself carefully treading through the map, taking out each bot that you come across quite easily, until one of those damned flying bots get you.There is also a backstory to this game; you pick up tapes and you listen to tips and stories behind the bots and what is real and what isn't. Then, there is also the thing about ammo. I have seen several reviews complaining about ammo; except I never found myself, not even once, in a situation where I have no ammo and am surrounded by enemies. There are many bullets lying about; you just have to look really carefully in corners and under, on top or inside objects. You'll also find yourself properly conserving ammo and knowing which part of the bots to shoot in order to deactivate them.Unfortunately, you die if you get hit even once by anything at all.The realism this game brings is quite astounding, and eventually I became a gunslinger against bots. On record it shows 1.9 hours, but I played more than that. My computer had a meltdown while I was playing it (because I have a not-so-good laptop) and the game accounted to me only 9 minutes of playtime, which, of course, is incorrect.This game is pretty good in general, however, the price is a little bit high. I got it for free on Humble Bundle (also the way I found out about the game). Might not be worth your time if you are into fast-paced action shooting games like Call of Duty.Every. Shot. Counts.

												Receiver manages to create a dark sci-fi setting with the use of a few short tape recordings. The game itself focuses on detailed gun manipulation that turn the automated actions of reloading, swapping mags or just checking how much ammo you got left, into detailed keystrokes that can end in disaster if used wrong in a combat situation. This is a great basis to give the game a lot of replayability even though it only features 3 weapons and two types of enemies as, like in a good action puzzler, your precise timing and situational awarness are tested over and over again even if you played through it before. The randomized layout and placement of enemies and pickups further adds to the replaybility of the title.If you are not turned down by perma-death and the inability to safe or load a gamestate and you have a soft spot for punishing first-person action combined with a fresh look at gun play, this might be the title for you.

												Highly visceral and deep gun handling and creepy distopian vibe are the two primary positive elements that this game has to offer. Nothing beats the feeling of learning the gun mechanics and successfully using them against the (sadly) 2 types of enemies you'll face during the game.The map is randomly generated for each playthrough and each time you die but things will definitely start to look familiar the more you play. Your mission is to locate 11 tapes that are scattered around the map and listen to their dialogue while staying alive. Be very careful while turning each corner in this game because a single enemy shot will kill you and send you back to the beginning. Oh and did I mention the guns are also randomized? There are 3 guns total but how many bullets they have and whether they're loaded, cocked or with the safety on can vary between each start.On the negative side, there are framerate hitches whenever you walk into new areas and the levels can get really dark. The flashlight proved more of a nuisance than help because it only lights up a few feet in front of you. This could mean life or death in this game. There are no gamma settings in the game. Also, as I mentioned previously, the levels can get a bit repetitive at times because they are seemingly different pre-made areas which are stitched together in different ways because of the level generator.All in all, a very entertaining game. Definitely get this on a sale. The adrenaline rush and realistic gun handling are definitely worth quite a few hours of random fun.			",500,214,5,52,27,2,32

												For such a simple game, this one's done a great job of keeping my heart pumping quickly. Pros: - The gun mechanics are much more complicated in this game than most, which makes it very unique. Instead of simply pressing ""R"" to reload a weapon, there is a specific key that is pressed for every step of the reloading process (Removing mag, adding bullets to mag, inserting mag, cocking weapon, etc.). - Your two enemies, Bots and Turrets, both have various hit boxes that, when shot, provide different effects. Turrets, For example, spin around in a circle scanning for the player, and if you fall inside of their sweeping scanner's view, they will fire on you. So shooting a turret in a certian spot may prevent it from spinning, but leave its gun fully operational, and able to shoot you if you walk in front of it; while shooting another location may leave the scanner untouched but render the gun itself useless.- 3 or 4 different guns to choose from that all have different mechanics, strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.- Maps are randomly generated.Cons:- The game is very repetitive. As your goal is always the same: gather the tapes. - Graphics are awkwardly ugly- Lack of enemies/weapons- Slight learning curve for gun mechanics.Overall, keeping the $5 price tag in mind, I give this a 8/10. Honestly I would say it's worth grabbing for the $5 tag if you can get it.			",151,20,4,10,19,1,4

												If you're looking for an alternative fps, get Receiver!Unfortunately I played this game while being offline, thus the overall hours haven't been properly registered, I have many hours of pure fun and anxiety spent here.Even reloading your gun is a challenge itself, you may need to look for tutorials and tips for that.It's hard to survive in this peculiar, yet addictive universe, you need to watch where you step because the enemy can be waiting for you around the corner, and there will be no health bar to save you.The enemies (AI machines) can easily track you and sense your presence if you're too close to them and they will hardly miss a shot!It's a great challenge and it's definitely, highly recommended!

GAME.SO SIMPLE I LOVE IT.Fun game that changes the way you play FPS games. The game has 3 different guns that you spawn with randomly. A Glock 17, Colt Handgun and a S&W Revolver. These do all have different mechanics to them.This game is so original, and you aren't believing me right now I get that, but just hear me out.Instead of just pushing ""R"" for reloading, you have to: Press one key to detach the mag..Another key to load the mag with bullets.. (AND YOU NEED TO FIND THOSE SEPARATELY) Another key to put the mag in the gun..And yet another one to drag the slide and load the first bullet into the chamber..And trust me when I say this.. This is some real butt clenching stuff when you realize you're out of bullets and a ♥♥♥♥ing flying taser gun are chasing you. (I'm not making this up..)Oh.. and the gun can also jam on you.

												First of all.If you are asking about the hours i did in this game, well i did that and i'm still playin this.So yeah! Hello guys! Welcome to my strange review about this game, i sincerely liked a lot playing this.I know... a lot of people said that this game is crap, just because you don't have things to do like doing missions and things like that.You are a ""shadow"" with a gun flying in the air and people would be like ""What a hell i'm playing"".So, in this game you don't have to do a lot of things.You have 3 guns that swaps randomly when you die.A 357. A 1911 And a Glock.You have to get this tapes, that says some things about the story about the receivers.But there's a lot of Turrets and Flying robots everywere around the map, so is not that easy to get all the tapes.Is pretty frustrating, but think about it.Is pretty simple!I mean, is not that hard to reload a gun, you have just to pull out the chamber and load it on your own.They did that just for making the game more hard than the normal ones.You know, i like games like this, because it reminds me old games, when you didin't have to think about what are you doing and what do you have to do.It helps you a little, tells you what things you have to do when you reload, but the game don't say anything about the story behind it and the why you are shooting robots.I think the dev wanted to take us back to the old times, the fun times when you stayed at home, playing games on your couch with the controller, but now with the Keyboard and the Mouse!Yeah, Yeah. I know.The game is all poligonal and things like that.But is been made in 7 Days.And it remembers a lot the old days in the 90s.About the price.I can say that is not pretty good, just because 5 bucks for this game i think is too much for the people that watched a lot of games at that price.If you don't like games like this, don't spend 5 bucks on it, just wait for the sales and spend 1 dollar for it.Is pretty worth it, and i hope you will understand that this game can be very good if you think about it.Is not good for the people that likes FPS games, shooting everything and everyone you see.You have to stay calm and relax for doing this and win, if you freak out, you die.At the end, i suggest you to buy it in the sales.Have a good one!P.S. = You will die in just one shot, good luck.

												There isn't much game here, but what's here is great. I'm a sucker for atmosphere, and the realistic gunplay only adds intensity to miscounted timings. Choose your fights as carefully as you can, and make every bullet count. Don't forget your Clear Tape.I have a short list of suggestions:1. Making the eject magazine button the same as the insert magazine button would be nice. A general ""drop"" button seems more complex.2. The safety doesn't really seem to affect gameplay. Why not make the gun randomly go off if you don't safety properly?3. give the player a more clear indication of where the bullet went. when you can walk up to it, it's very clear where you hit a turret, but wobblers have been a lot of hassle for me, because it's more difficult to figure out where i hit them.

												A really tough shooter with realistic gun mechanics. Awesome idea, and adds some real tension to the game. But it's far from finished. As a prototype it works, but I'm not sure if it would (properly) work in a fully realized game. It takes a while to get used to the controls. Great idea, decent execution (especially for a game that was created in just one week).[Rating: 74/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												This game is set in a very empty empty building where you are all alone, fighting robots with guns. What's so great about this game, that sets it apart from other FPSs, is the realistic gun reloading and the chilling yet very subtle story (think Abstergo). I very much enjoy the Portal-like atmosphere and the development of muscle memory so reloading feels satisfying.			",78,12,0,11,2,0,6

												This game has some pretty interesting mechanics, but honestly, it just wasnt fun for me. The little story that was there was really interesting and the ideas behind it are cool, but the gameplay is frustrating and ruins it for me.-The reloading, while cool, gets annoying fast-Hard to find ammo-The drones move way too fast and have too much momentum, they bounce all over the place-Everything kills you in one hit, Ive been killed by a turret when I was behind a wall-Everything is too inconsistent and randomI talk more about it in my review here

												Receiver is an outstandingly realistic FPS game when it comes to firearms. Pretty much the only thing lacking in it is jamming, but you're talking about the M1911A1, Glock, and a revolver. S&M Model 10 or something like that. .38 Spl.  Not a whole lot of jamming to be found there, however it does happen on the rare occasion. There are the scatter complaint I have about this game, but a lot of positive aspects to point out as well, let's start with them.First off; individual magazine, not an ammo pool. LOVE it! Ability to manually remove ammo from a magazine, or load ammo into a mag. That's a first for me in a videogame, and it's outstanding. Ability to activate safety on an M1911A1, love the realism, however it should NOT be able to be activated when the hammer is decocked. I own a Springfield Armory 2008 M1911A1 Mil Spec, and it cannot be put on safe unless it is cocked.Select fire on Glock 18. Now I don't like that they chose the Glock 18 because it's very rare for gun owners to ever handle one, however at the same time I'm glad they implimented it; it's almost useless in full auto, wastes ammo faster than you can say 'yeehaw', and will do more missing than hitting on anything beyond 10m. That's good, it shows people realism. Many people love the G18 because ""Full auto pistol! 1337!"" No, full auto is pretty much useless on a pistol unless it's got a stock on it. Even then, it will still eat up ammo insanely fast. Keep it on semi auto, or you won't last very long. Ultimately, I think it would have been better if they chose Glock 17 or Glock 22 (.40 S&W), but I love that they at least made it realistic!You can also go magazine +1 (M1911A1 has 7 round mags (Even though 8 round mags are more common nowadays but I digress) so you can have a full 7 round mag, +1 in the chamber making a total of 8. Or with Glock 18 with 17 round mag, have than +1 in the chamber and you have 18 rounds before having to reload!) It's also cool being able to spin the cylinder of that .38 revolver. Load just one round, spin it, and play Russian Roulette. Will you have a live round, or an empty chamber? :oI think now I'll touch on the bad aspects; as said, M1911A1 shouldn't be able to be on safe while hammer is cocked. Also, for some reason, when you have a full mag loaded, with the slide locked back, if you press the 'pull slide' button or whatever it's called, then a round will eject. If you choose the 'slide release' button or whatever it's called in the game, then you will simply chamber a round. Realistically, either should be able to be used without a live round leaping out of the chamber.I think that's about all I have to say about the game other than the obvious; obvious to just about anyone who played it anyways... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FLIERS! You'll see what I mean, they have to do something about them. SO annoying! Anyways, I hope they continue to develop this game, and come to include the ability to find more mags, use more firearms (More than one if you're lucky enough to find another firearm), ability to choose difficulty (I WANT TO PLAY WITHOUT THOSE DAMN FLIERS!), and if at all possible, please develop some rifles, as well as potential long distance shooting with adjustable sights!Don't stop now that you have a (Albeit kind of simple beyond the controls) revolutionary game made; keep going! Try making a more in depth story line! Character creater! Inventory! Weight management! Perhaps leveling up because I know from experience that it takes time and practice to become an accurate shot! How about long-term gaming? Hunger, thirst, oh and don't forget about different types of ammo! 9mm isn't much use when all you have is an M1911A1 and an SKS (Just throwing an idea out there for potential rifles/carbines that could be found!) :) To a bright future for this futuristically realistic game!

												Receiver is a really neat concept, but it's executed in a clunky manner. There's not enough content to warrant it as a full release, or pay 10 dollars. And the overall UI is very rudimentary. If it was given more polish, it could be a great adventure into realism games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's free on the Humble Store right now if you feel like grabbing it.Otherwise I can't recommend buying it. Basically, you walk around getting casette tapes where then a man narrates some gibberish, giving context to the scenario, a la Bioshock. But the difference here is that Receiver is trying to simulate using a gun via keyboard and mouse by forcing you to press something like four different keys just to eject the forking ammo. And while trying to listen to the tapes while walking around the single, randomly generated level, you'll probably get shot by a turret and die.Speaking of the randomly generated level, it's aesthetically awkward. It' one kind of big level where you randomly respawn after dying so many times and you don't retain your tapes. So when the motion and visual detecting turrets gun you down over and over again, don't blame yourself.6.0/10			",404,143,10,52,24,4,29

												Well holy sheeeet. That was a damn good game.The core concept of the game is, ""What if using a gun in an FPS was as complicated a process as it is in real life?"" and that boils down to each little part of the gun having it's own button associated with it. You don't just tap the R button and watch a cool little animation and then be on your way, you have to do all the little things required and in the right order as your situation dictates. At the start you will fumble around with the gun functions and may not even figure out how to shoot for quite a while. Then after a few minutes you may start to get the hang of it, albeit taking your time between shots. After a few hours of playing you will really get the hang of things and reloading will be like clockwork.Even the enemies, which are little robots, have a similar complexity to them. They don't just have an HP bar that empties out after a few shots. You have to hit them in very specific parts to disable certain functions of them until you can safely pass by. It's up to you to learn where your shots count the most for disabling them.The world is rather bland, however, and consists of a bunch of randomly generated rooms in sequence. You will get very used to these room as there is very little variety between them. You will figure out pretty quickly where the ammo drops can be and where the robots can be placed in certain rooms. It's the only real flaw in the game.The music is decent and gives a proper mood to the whole thing.One odd thing to note about the game is that you have to go to a separate website to patch the game. Specifically here[forums.wolfire.com]. Otherwise the game run's very poorly I've heard. I've only played the game patched and it is recommended.If you are someone who want's a score then I give the game 5 cassette tapes out 5. Nothing significantly hinders the enjoyment of the game and the core concept is pulled of splendidly.			",155,11,3,16,6,2,5

												Umm.... Everythings are simple. Just simple.Game style, Graphics, Sounds, Items. All of them...But only one thing is quite compilcated.That is Reloading the gun's bullets.And that is the point in this game. :PI want to tell you that this is all of this game XDSo... I'm not much recommend this game... But... at least you can experience how to reload the gun's bullets more detail than other FPS games.This game's idea is not bad... But game is not much fun.Just playing few minutes.That is enough. :PYou can play this game for spare time.음... 모든게 매우 심플... 합니다. 그냥 심플함.게임 스타일, 그래픽, 사운드, 아이템들 모든게 그냥 단순합니다.하지만 단 한가지만은 복잡합니다. ㅋㅋ바로 총알 장전하는 것이죠.그리고 그게 바로 이 게임의 핵심입니다.저는 그것이 이 게임의 전부라고 말하고 싶군요.그래서 저는 이 게임을 딱히 추천하고 싶지는 않습니다만, 적어도 다른 FPS 게임에 비해 총알을 어떻게 재장전하는지 좀 더 자세히 알수는 있습니다.이 게임의 아이디어는 나쁘지 않습니다. 하지만 게임이 딱히 재밌지도 않네요.단지 몇분 정도 플레이하면 된다고 봅니다.그거면 충분합니다.자투리 시간에 이 게임을 하면 될거라 생각합니다.

												Receiver is a quirky independent game, that's designed primarily how to teach you the parts, movements, and use of actual pistol firearms.It does this EXTREMELY well, but there's no tutorial it just throws you right in. hit or hold the [?] key on your keyboard for the keyboard shortcuts for pulling the hammer, ejecting the magazine, pulling back the hammer or slide, and various other tasks.I would love to see this further developed, perhaps with more varied enemies, the 2 turrets (flying or stationary) are clever, but I think a mobile ground enemie (zombies, perhaps?) would add to the fun.As it stands, receiver is a GREAT game, and I hope the devs continue working on it.

Mastering the controls and fluidly operating your weapon also gives you a sense of accomplishment.			",185,53,0,33,10,1,16

												This is literally the only FPS game I've played where it's much more difficult and time consuming to just get my pistol ready to shoot than in reality.  This game is intensely satisfying once you figure out all the controls, difficult even knowing how to fight the enemies (the drones are evil), and interesting from an FPS game perspective simply because I haven't played anything like it.  Get your magazines loaded, make sure your safety is off, and practice unloading empty magazines and replacing them with loaded ones.  Oh, and make sure you pick up every bullet and tape that you find.			",211,54,1,24,24,1,25

												Strange game. Your character is a floating gun and sometimes you have a floating sidekick named FlashLite. When you start the game, you have to guide your gun character through a poorly decorated future house and shoot your different robot pets. There are flying pets, stationary pets. There are no people pets : ( The interesting part of this game is that you can shoot your character and you have to put bullets into him by hand and there's all these controls to do it. Finally, you have to pick up tapes to beat the game but that's only after you kill all of your pets using the bullets in your body.7/10 +++++++---			",13,0,0,0,1,0,0

												if youre into gun porn and rogue-lite gameplay, Receiver is a very fun few hours.The main fun of this game is committing the controls to memory and becoming a speedy gun nut. I've had a few moments that were generally tense or made me jump as well, due to your characters inability to take a single bullet and survive.If you search for it, Receiver has a cool meta story that is revealed by listening to the tapes you collecting while dodging flying tazer drones and turrets.I would definitely recommend receiver at any price, especially since the proceeds go to a small indie team that made the game in 7 days. They are also currently developing Overgrowth.			",284,52,9,38,38,3,57

												It's a really good game for what it is.The controls and tutorials are lacking but after some reassining of buttons and practice they get managable.Music is nice and fitting.3 simple weapon models that need to be understood before they can be used effectively.Completely randomized maps, ememy placement, items and equipment. Up to the point were even the  chambers in your revolver are randomly filled.Gameplay itself reminds of a James Bond Simulator.Bugs Bugs Bugs ... getting stuck on stairs, falling through pipes and behind stairs.Would be one of the better simple games if they managed to get those bugs fixed but i'm sure this won't happen.

												This game is extremely fun and challenging little game that will put your memory and mouse handling skills to the test!Not only does this game have a very eerie atmosphere and creepy story but the realism around the guns are very well done. The shooting feels nice and feels very rewarding when you hear that *dink* and *crash* that means you succesfully took out an enemy. I learn quickly so the controls were not a problem. But without the little ""Help"" tap on the left I would have been hopeless. Which is also very well done!The one thing I really love is also that you can disable your enemies without destroying them. Like shooting the gun on the automatic turret and stading infront of it to check if it really is disabled is really nerveracking because a shot to the foot and you're dead. I also love the ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; feeling you get when the gyrocopter spots you and you're out of ammo.All in all 8/10 could do with some optimization and a nerf to the flying bots! By the way, check out the developers other game; Overgrowth which is also fantastic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sort of an FPS roguelike, you basically just wander and wander and wander looking for tapes and ammo, with no maps or any other clues to help you at all.I enjoyed the realistc gun operation, even though it got me killed many many times.There's basically 2 kinds of enemies, turrets and flybots, and both can 1-shot you, which can lead to some frustration. On top of that, there's barely enough ammo to get by, and if you wander into the wrong spot and get spotted by a flybot and waste your last few bullets on it, its almost a guaranteed GG.I eventually got bored of just randering around an RNG building, and fortunately there were some cheats available.Even with invincibility and unlimited ammo, the game was STILL a hassle to complete. I'd spin around and empty 3-4 magazines trying to shoot 1 little drone buzzing around my head.Eventually the game just started trolling and put 3 tapes and 5 turrets in a very small space. I have NO idea how I would have gotten past that without infinite ammo.I don't know if I would pay $5 for this, but it's definitely an interesting little time waster. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The thing that surprised me most about this game is that after playing a few hours worth it feels more like a FPS roguelike than anything else I've played - there's permadeath, a randomly generated maze & enemies, and a somewhat steep learning curve. Shooting feels extremely solid and the reload mechanics are very satisfying once you get the hang of them, and deaths rarely feel cheap but are usually the result of rushing in or not checking the area properly. Could use more content, but what's here keeps me coming back anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awsome game. The big boys could learn a lot from this gem. Every time I play Battlefied, Cod, whatever, and just mash R to reload I just sit and watch an amination for 2 seconds before continuing the midless spraying of bullets. Receiver doesn't just make you care about operating your weapon, It makes you care about every single bullet you fire and the target your shooting at. I would love to see main stream games taking this aproch, but sadly they are all now slaves to the consoles and their 10 to 15 button controlers. Anyway, rant over, buy this game its fun and real challange for any FPS player.A thinking man's FPS			",81,3,1,3,14,0,5

												Dear Receiver, I'm sorry... I was quick to judge you initially and I hope that you will forgive me; preferably by giving my a few clips of ammo and some tapes close by in my next spawn. I initially saw your complex gun mechanics as gimmicky and unnecessary whereas I now see then as adding tension and complexity. Your ruthless one-hit-kill policy caused me frustration which I took out on you by quitting... but I have now returned stronger than before and ready for the challenge you bring. I still can't play without the help screen up, but I will be able to in time. In return I hope that you will lower your price slightly as (although I was lucky enough to receive you bundled with another game) others have found you too expensive whih I can understand. I trust all who take you on are ready, Your Sincerely, DogstreetP.S. ... seriously, a few clips of ammo and tapes... oh and don't give me that revolver as I keep throwing away bullets I've not used yet...

												Retriever the Game reviewRetriever the Game ris a game where you shoot guns... are you guns lover? you'll like this game. it's a game where you hold the gun machine and then you shoot it. what is your favorite gun?  Its in this game I guaranteed it. I counted the guns in this game and Boy there is a lot, Theres Revulver machine gun with wheel turner, the square gun machine with a block door and two hammer locks and a slider tube, the gray gun that holds the block back you cannot shoot with it, the shooter gun with three switch and a pin on the front, the black gun with a gray brown handle that shoots a bigger bullet, the small gun machine with a wooden piece on it and a light switch pumper on the back of the gun, a gun that has two finger holes onto it and there's two blocks one top one bottom and a tube, the gun with a round pin ball switch onto it which stomps the gun from turning around, the gun machine with a circalar lock on the back of the big block and there's a tube onto the front of the gun machine, and the gun that shoots a bullet.I counted theres about 3 guns in this video game.The ravolutionary part of this game is the bullets system. You can take a bullet one out at a time and put it into your pocket for later storrage.The down side is you only find 1 bullet at a time instead of a whole box thats 16 bullets like in the other game.And the ravolutionary part of this video game is the abbility to be a peace ful citizen. if you dont want to use a gun you can put it into the corner of your face and dont shoot any thing.The objective of the video game is to collect 20 video tapes VHS from the ground. When you get the tapes you can hear a nerd talk about the world peace or something stupid. I only found 1 tape and I died and  I went back there the next time it was not there so you better win the game the first time. Sorry ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is a game about shooting....Oh, were you looking for something else? That pretty much sums up what this game is, from it's concept, of course. Now, let's start the real review:Graphics: Made in Unity 3D, the game has simple graphics and places that seems to be missing textures. But it's all part of the game's visual art style and concept. Enemies desing are also pretty simple and you can spot then on sight (Witch is essential in this game IMO). I guess the gun model is okay, since it gives player a good vision of what he's doing with it and where he's REALLY poiting at. Skybox is dead, but you really don't need it in this game.Gameplay: This is the jackpot in this game. The realism put into shooting, reloading, carrying and using your gun is something so nice to see in a FPS and that even most AAA studios keep forgetting that it exists. Playing this game using the device that simulates a pistol is even better. All the controls, from the keyboard/mouse/device responds pretty well and always keeps the game fluid and dinamic.Even tough gunplay is the biggest part of this game, it also haves an objective: Collecting all your self recordings so you can finish the game. But finding then is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Not only you don't have a radar, but you will die a ♥♥♥♥ING lot in this game. It IS hard. And i mean it. The enemies were created with the intetion of making the game hard in this way, and the AI woks pretty well to make sure that this is happening. Don't mess with the enemies. It's not because the game is realistic that the enemies will also be. 2-3 shoots and you are dead. Make sure of always keeping your ammo at count, or else, you are ♥♥♥♥ed.Soundtrack: Missing. Even tough the self recording are pretty neat to hear, i just can't like this monotunus atmosphere. They could've put some songs like The Stanley Parable did (Or SuperHot) to don't let the player attention go away of the game. Mostly because that if you are not paying attention, you are dead.Story: Most of it is explained through recordings. It's not a gigantic plot, but it does it job of keeping the player guessing. Going through uncovering the secrets of the protagonist organization and himself is quite awesome and it has a nice progression...When you find then in order, that's because the only bad thing is: If you die, your found recording count will reset, so, if you want to find a new one that you haven't heard yet/don't want to hear the same thing again from a past one, good luck with that.This game is more considered a ""project"" than a game itself. It had a nice proporsal and the idea of this game can be explored in other games (Indie or AAA). If you are looking to experience something new and a neat challenge, Receiver is a ""game"" for you.

												Receiver is an interesting rouge-like FPS (In that death is permanent and the game generates randomly). Most notable is the gun mechanics, where you must go through all the motions of reloading your gun manually, from inserting bullets individually into magazines to pulling back the slide. If this sounds complicated, it is. However, the game is nice enough to provide a help overlay that shows you the next button you need to press. Eventually, like handling a real gun, doing every action will become muscle memory, and you'll no longer need the help screen.The game has three different guns that you will get randomly when you spawn: a Colt 1911, a Smith & Western Victory Revolver, and a Glock. All three weapons handle differently. Probably the simplest to master is the Victory Revolver, as it is the least complicated to reload. The Cold and Glock are fairly similar in reloading and maintaining but are different enough to be noticeable. It would have been nice if there were more guns included, but it isn't a huge deal.The 'story' of the game is pretty simple and only exists to give you a reason because it needs to. You must find 11 cassette tapes randomly strewn around the generated environment, avoiding a couple different types of automated enemies. The game is really challenging, and how far you get in the game seems to be based on luck (There have been many times where I've failed to find any tapes despite surviving for quite a while and other times I've found most of the tapes without running into too much resistance). The many times you die won't frustrate you too much, but will only drive you to try ""one more time"". Unfortunately, the level generation isn't really that interesting, and you will quickly become bored of the same rooms over and over again.Ammo is fairly limited, only spawning in random places, so you will need to make every shot count. Enemies have certain weak spots that are more suitable to damage. You can also disable certain parts of enemy robots by shooting them, such as motors or cameras, that disable those functions. For instance, destroying a flying ""Killdrone""'s taser leaves it unable to damage you. The poor thing will continue to follow you around trying to zap you, like a lost puppy.The dynamic lighting won't work on some computers with some medium or low end graphics cards, like mine. This causes many rooms to be too dark to explore properly. There is a flashlight item in the game that also does not work if the lighting is broken, making the purposefully-dark rooms very hard to navigate, but not impossible. It really frustrated me when I realized it, but eventually I got used to it.Overall, Receiver is a fun, challenging, and addictive game that I like to enjoy in short bursts, but lacks a lot of content. It's very realistic gun simulation compared to pretty much any other FPS out there.			",123,26,0,9,5,2,3

This is by far its most fascinating--and fun!--feature.  It also sports a simple and unobtrusive soundtrack that, for me, draws me straight into this dark, simply rendered, rough-around-the-edges, strange, and wonderful place.The controls take some getting used to, mostly because of the complex actions they are used to perform.  FPS veterans: forget everything you think you know about first person shooters for this one.  The panic that sets in at the disheartening *click click* of an empty chamber, unloaded magazine, or an uncocked hammer, as an enemy bears down on you, is wonderful and frightening.Still, not terribly long into my first session, I found myself, mostly through muscle memory, ejecting a magazine to peek at how many rounds I have left, loading it back into the gun, peeking in the chamber to make sure I have a round loaded, taking a deep breath, and rounding a corner to fire directly into the camera of a robotic sentry gun just as it ""beeps"" in hostile recognition, seconds from destroying me.  Only after the encounter was over did I realize I was completely on autopilot.Receiver is definitely the most unexpected, fascinating, and mechanically interesting game I have played in a long time.  It is breathtaking in its visceral simplicity.  It requires a certain sense of open minded wonder to fully appreciate, and it is certainly filled with flaws, both in terms of polish (it was made in 7 days for a competition) and in terms of its unusual game mechanics.  However, at $5 full price, it's a deep breath of fresh air, and I find myself wondering whether--and hoping--other shooters  will look to Receiver for inspiration.  I won't hold my breath.

												This is a handgun simulator. The game is not much to look at and the levels are barren and dull, but if you've ever wanted to fire a handgun or learn about real gun mechanics this the most realistic and cheapest simulator. Learning to reload a Glock using only muscle memory was one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had playing a game. Worth $5. A must buy for less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is a FPS created during the 7 day FPS challenge, which focuses on gun handling mechanics. You play as a person known as a ""reciever"" who is equiped with only a handgun, and an audio cassete with with headphone, who must uncover the secrets about a corporation called Mindkill ( or Mindtech I can't remeber ) through a complex building full of kill drones. The game focuses gun handling mechanics which instead of pressing R to reaload, you need press multiple keys to take the clip out, putting it in your inventory, getting a loaded clip from your inventory, loading the gun up, and cocking it up. The controls aren't the only challenge though, once you get hit by bullets, or a taser from the killdrones, you die and have to start all over. To add up to the challenge the tapes, ammo, flashlights, and audio cassete tapes are scattered in new locations each time you spawn. The story unravels as you collect more tapes, each with a message revealing the secrets of Mindkill ( or Mindtech ). The sound and music makes walking around the building suspensfull, and makes you think that something around the corner is going to kill you. Overall this game is really fun, and is definetly worth getting if you want a great FPS, and a challenge.			",52,14,0,2,6,1,1

												Receiver is a quirky independent game, that's designed primarily how to teach you the parts, movements, and use of actual pistol firearms.It does this EXTREMELY well, but there's no tutorial it just throws you right in. hit or hold the [?] key on your keyboard for the keyboard shortcuts for pulling the hammer, ejecting the magazine, pulling back the hammer or slide, and various other tasks.I would love to see this further developed, perhaps with more varied enemies, the 2 turrets (flying or stationary) are clever, but I think a mobile ground enemie (zombies, perhaps?) would add to the fun.As it stands, receiver is a GREAT game, and I hope the devs continue working on it.

												Receiver is not a game that everyone will like. It takes the FPS genre to a much higher level of realism. It has no difficulty settings, checkpoints, game save or HUD for that matter.You start the game in a random room inside of a building. You don´t know who you are or why you´re there. Equipped with a 1 of 3 diferent firearms (a Glock 18, a Revolver or a 1911 45. cal Pistol), a flashlight(that you may not get on spawn but be able to find later), and nothing else than that you must find out what is going on.When walking around the building you will find  turrets or flying robots that will try to kill you. You can fight or run, but in some areas you will just have to go trough them to progress. You will eventually find orange sound tapes that will tell you why you´re there, how to get out, and how to effectively fight the robots and turrets. In order to finish the game you must find all 11 tapes scattered around the building.The game mechanics will be hard to understand at 1st, but in time you will get better at it. And if you don´t like some of the controls you can change them from the Launch Menu.You don´t have sights in the screen so you must aim to shoot properly, there are many commands for what you can do with your weapon, and the reload process must be done manually.Ammo is in pretty short supply, so you got to look around in the building and find bullets, equip it in your magazine (or barrel) and put in your inventory(in case you are using a pistol), then have it ready to reload in combat.Also this game is made with the Unity engine, so don´t expect anything fancy here.

												Omg where do i begin. i Love this game. I suck at this game. the gimick of mechanical deatail to how to operate your gun is extremely sastifying although confusing and difficult to get use to but the smart help system really eases that difficultly curve. Shotting enemies in different places all have different effects and learning these on your own can be excited although it is explained in one of the 11 tapes you need to find. Lacking areas would be the voice over for the tape dialog and the lack of really interesting text but looking for the tape is whats fun and you probably arent looking at this game for a gripping story. also the aim sensitivty just never seems perfect for me i can't get the pinpoint accuracy i want even with all the dpi settings on my mouse.overall i say that this game is worth the $5  and will last quite a few hours			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want the short n' quick of my review, here it is: It's an incredibly challenging game with an extremely well-made gun mechanic and great immersion, but it's poorly optimized and variety is limited.When I first picked up this game I had no idea what I was doing, and I think I quite enjoyed that at first, the first few deaths were absolutely laughable as I fumbled around with the controls manually looking up which button does what every time I needed to load another bullet or try to pick up a tape. The first thing you notice are that the graphics are mediocre at best, but in a game like this it really doesn't hurt the immersion factor one bit. The immersion is amazing, by the way. This game is an unintentional survival horror game. Enemies can and WILL scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta you.But then after a little while I got a hang of the controls, and that's where things really picked up. After you start to get proficient at controlling the gun and even the more advanced mechanics of switching out whole mags quickly instead of just reloading a few bullets, the game gets immensely more involved. You're no longer concerned with just getting one or two tapes, you want them all. You want them bad, you've already spent several hours on this thing... So you start to learn the very well-implemented mechanics of localized damaging, where you need to hit a specific part of an enemy to take it out, and with as few bullets as possible. No CoD-style shooting at someones hands or legs to damage them.The voice acting is not great, he fumbles around with words a bit and sometimes the sound clips a bit, but it doesn't matter because given the story it's totally reasonable for this. Story-wise: They might not have had enough time to record a super-fancy nice message. Development wise, they only had a week. Cut em' some slack.Eventually, you get to the point where you've heard every tape a dozen times and seen every enemy almost every time, and you still may not have beaten the game because there are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tapes. At this point, there's a very real possibility that you could get tired of the game due to the lack of variety and extreme difficulty. But, if you persevere, and there's a good chance that you'll beat it, and oh boy... When you beat it, it's so satisfying. INCREDIBLY satisfying.On top of all that there's actually a good bit of replay value thanks to the randomization of all the maps (Though it admittedly can ♥♥♥♥ you up someimtes and it's entirely possible to have an impossible-to-beat map) and even the modding community that has managed to add in a bunch of different stuff to make the game play better.So to recap!Pros:+ Great gun mechanics+ Accurate gun and bullet physics+ Randomization of structures item locations+ Reasonable learning curve+ Amazing immersion+ Very satisfying to finally beat+ Good replay value+ Great modding communityCons:- Very poor textures even on highest settings- Poor optimization due to engine limitations- Only 2 gun types by default- Only 2 types of enemies- Borderline extreme difficulty to get all 11 tapes (At least for me),  meaning it can take a long time to beat with a lot of potential frustration.- Randomization can ♥♥♥♥ you overOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It's an impressive and fun to play twist on the FPS genre made in only a week.			",89,10,2,7,10,0,3

												Most games assign you a single button to reload your gun. Most games provide you enough ammo to get the job done. Most games start you with the same equipment, in the same location on the map. Receiver is not most games.You start with one of three weapons at a random location on the single, large map. The amount of ammo you have appears to be random, as does whether or not you have a flashlight or spare magazines. In a normal FPS, you'd start with a full clip and pressing ""fire"" would do just that. With Receiver, that would make you extremely lucky. The first thing to do is examine your weapon. Is it a revolver, a semi-automatic, or a machine pistol? Is it loaded? How full is the magazine? Is the safety on? Is it set to full auto? All of this matters.While this can sound tedious, the surprising thing about Receiver is that it works. The graphics are terrible, the sound and story are nothing to write home about, but the gameplay more than makes up for everything else. As frustrating as the first few rounds can be, it's extremely rewarding when you finally start to pick things up. You'll quickly learn to count your shots because you don't have an ammo counter. You'll quickly learn to take cover and look around corners because the enemies are lethal. Pretty soon checking your gun, loading your magazines when you get ammo and checking every corner for turrets will be second nature.			",369,150,4,49,47,3,54

I'm not much recommend this game... But... at least you can experience how to reload the gun's bullets more detail than other FPS games.This game's idea is not bad... But game is not much fun.Just playing few minutes.That is enough. :PYou can play this game for spare time.음... 모든게 매우 심플... 합니다. 그냥 심플함.게임 스타일, 그래픽, 사운드, 아이템들 모든게 그냥 단순합니다.하지만 단 한가지만은 복잡합니다. ㅋㅋ바로 총알 장전하는 것이죠.그리고 그게 바로 이 게임의 핵심입니다.저는 그것이 이 게임의 전부라고 말하고 싶군요.그래서 저는 이 게임을 딱히 추천하고 싶지는 않습니다만, 적어도 다른 FPS 게임에 비해 총알을 어떻게 재장전하는지 좀 더 자세히 알수는 있습니다.이 게임의 아이디어는 나쁘지 않습니다. 하지만 게임이 딱히 재밌지도 않네요.단지 몇분 정도 플레이하면 된다고 봅니다.그거면 충분합니다.자투리 시간에 이 게임을 하면 될거라 생각합니다.

Get your magazines loaded, make sure your safety is off, and practice unloading empty magazines and replacing them with loaded ones.

												Warning: This is an addicting game. The gameplay is not unlike the '-Shock' series, where you're looking for audio tapes whilst trying to avoid and/or get-the-drop-on drones and turrets. The real difference in Reciever is in the shooting/gun mechanics. The gun you have in 'shooter' games is usually little more than a fancy finger that goes 'pew pew' wherever you're pointing it. In Reciever, your weapon is a very realistic *system* with which you must learn to interact, both successfully and quickly, in order to survive combat scenarios. This means knowing how many bullets you have in your clip, replacing a clip when you need to, not dropping bullets by accident as you're trying to refill a clip on the fly. All of this is in your direct control. No random dice-rolls... if you get caught with your pants down, it's on you. It's that direct relation of personal skill and performance that really draws you in. You will die quickly, and often. But each time you load up the game, or 'respawn', the environment is shuffled randomly. Even the equipment you start with is randomized. No two games are the same. And with almost zero load time. Just get killed by a drone that you didn't know was there until it was too late? It's okay, you immediately find yourself in a totally different place with a new weapon(1 of 3 , that I've seen) to familiarize yourself with and the lessons you learned from your previous life still fresh in your memory... now go see how long you live this time!This is a great game and I honestly think every person who's ever played a FPS before should play it. If for no other reason than to gain a little more respect for the weaponry that so many of us have grown to take for granted. It's cheap. It's great. I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game can be good if you enjoy playing with guns and seeing how they operate. However, despite the map interestingly changing with every game, it is impossible to play. I have found this so because the AI within the game are unrealistically impossible to kill as a result of a combination of insanely skilled AI and the guns being hard to aim and shoot.

												I had written a review with a minor nitpick, but then realized that they had already added the feature I was looking for and I just didn't notice when I wrote my review. I like this game, and my only real problem with it is the poor optimization. Despite the low detail graphics, the game does lag from time to time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning: This is an addicting game. The gameplay is not unlike the '-Shock' series, where you're looking for audio tapes whilst trying to avoid and/or get-the-drop-on drones and turrets. The real difference in Reciever is in the shooting/gun mechanics. The gun you have in 'shooter' games is usually little more than a fancy finger that goes 'pew pew' wherever you're pointing it. In Reciever, your weapon is a very realistic *system* with which you must learn to interact, both successfully and quickly, in order to survive combat scenarios. This means knowing how many bullets you have in your clip, replacing a clip when you need to, not dropping bullets by accident as you're trying to refill a clip on the fly. All of this is in your direct control. No random dice-rolls... if you get caught with your pants down, it's on you. It's that direct relation of personal skill and performance that really draws you in. You will die quickly, and often. But each time you load up the game, or 'respawn', the environment is shuffled randomly. Even the equipment you start with is randomized. No two games are the same. And with almost zero load time. Just get killed by a drone that you didn't know was there until it was too late? It's okay, you immediately find yourself in a totally different place with a new weapon(1 of 3 , that I've seen) to familiarize yourself with and the lessons you learned from your previous life still fresh in your memory... now go see how long you live this time!This is a great game and I honestly think every person who's ever played a FPS before should play it. If for no other reason than to gain a little more respect for the weaponry that so many of us have grown to take for granted. It's cheap. It's great. I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very crafty and all of the spawns, from rooms to what you spawn with, are randomized. The game very quickly teaches you to be cautious, ranging from punishing you for running into a room without looking into it first, to immediately being rammed in the side with a drone with no way to counter against it.How enemies spawn is randomized, and sometimes a bunch of turrets will be spawned in such a way that you'll need to tactfully take out each one before you can move on, and sometimes it'll cluster 5 turrets in one room.To keep you on your toes, how quickly you can react to turrets seeing you varies, ranging from being able to be seen by a turret for a full second and not die, to being shot the instant you enter their field of vision.Additionally, it seems how durable the robots are is also randomized. For example, sometime's you'll take out 4 enemies with one shot each, and sometimes you'll have to dump 10 bullets into a turret's weakpoint before it stops moving.What you spawn with is randomized, which means sometimes you can spawn with a revolver and 30 bullets, and sometimes you'll spawn with a M1911A1 and 4 bullets.Where you spawn is also randomized. Sometimes you'll spawn in a room full of ammo and maybe a tape and/or flashlight, and sometimes you'll spawn in direct view of a turret.Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, it's just that if you're purchasing this, prepare for RNGesus to kick you in the butt. A lot.			",90,4,0,1,6,0,0

												I would recommend this game to just about anybody who is a fan of the first-person shooter genre or has any kind of interest in guns. This well crafted gun simulator is, like they say, easy to learn but hard to master. Learning each weapon and how it is operated by muscle memory is fluid and satisfying; I never tired of loading and charging a weapon.The minimalistic presentation of the game environment allows the gun to be the focus of the game, as it should be, but each section in the procedurally generated world has its own challenges and secrets. After some practice you will grow well versed in traversing these environments and scanning them for threats and loot, which brings its own satisfaction.Perhaps the most satisfying of all the game's elements is its actual combat. Enemies come in two types: hovering taser drones and static turrets, both of which can deliver instant and fatal damage to the player. The gameplay here is challenging, but never unfair, and the quick restarts allow you to dive straight back into the game and apply what you've learned from past mistakes. The trial-and-error nature of Receiver's gameplay gives it a visceral and ephemeral feel comparable to that of Hotline Miami, although with a vastly different tone.Like the rest of the game, Receiver's story is delivered in a minimalistic and really quite interpretive style. You are tasked with exploring the world and collecting all eleven casette tapes, which contain a wealth of esoteric knowledge, accessible only to the specially mentally conditioned, known of course as 'receivers'. Despite their monotone delivery, I never really became bored with the tapes even after repeated listens. By the time you have heard all eleven, you will have memorised a great deal of background story information, which gives the feeling that you are a receiver. The casettes mention important story threads such as 'the Threat', 'the Mindkill' and multiple realities with such passing apathy that one is forced to imagine what exactly they entail, making the story that much more interesting. Without so much being left to the imagination, the game's story could not have had nearly the same effect.All told, Receiver is a simple but beautiful game. Its developers set out to create in seven days an engaging and accurate gun simulator with minimalist storytelling and they have succeeded by all measures. Receiver is a cheap buy and well worth a look from a fan of the shooting genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's pretty novel and fun but in the end if you've ever shot a real weapon it just makes you want to do that. It's kind of like a dating simulator in that you get a very rough approximation of the real thing but none of the real pleasure of it. Granted, it also comes to you very naturally if you have shot a real weapon. Also I've noticed people in the reviews complaining about the utter randomness in the game including enemies, bullets, gun you get and so forth but there's a very good reason for this and I see what the developer did here.One of the first things that you're taught when instructed in shooting is how to check your chamber. It's important to learn because it's one of the main things you do to check if your weapon is safe or not and stops you from accidentally wasting a round. You also need to check a magazine in any gun regardless of whether or not anything is chambered. Basically it's random so you get into the routine of checking your weapon like you would in real life and it's an awesome way of pounding procedure into people's heads.On another note you can also do a trick wherein you chamber a round, take the magazine out, then put another one in to get an extra one. In real life it's not very healthy for the magazine's spring and is one of the top 10 ways to literally shoot yourself in the foot but since this is a game go nuts.In conclusion if you're okay with not having the actual feeling of the shot and getting to feel that pleasurable click of loading rounds and magazine insertion it's probably worth playing if you can get it cheaply. Though I'll personally probably never play it again after I get 11 tapes for the first time.Edit: Actually cancel that, I wasn't going to mention it but it has some performance issues despite the very simple untextured geometry. It also drives my GPU temperature through the roof because of the apparent load so I'll probably not play much more of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[Pros]-Interesting sci-fi story. You are a ""Receiver"", one of the very few people who are able to hear a voice inside different mysterious cassettes you find. You must find enough cassettes to ""escape"" MindKill.This sound a lot like Matrix, and yes, it is something like that.-The unique gameplay mechanic of the game: It simulate a more realistic way to control a pistol. Specifically a Colt 1911 pistol, a S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and a Glock 17.At first it is VERY complicate to remember every single button to control succesfully a pistol, but with enough practice, you can master it.-The game offer you a very helpful guide which show you the action of each button. A huge plus in my opinion.-The whole game take place in one huge level. However all the rooms/places, bullets, cassettes, enemies and the pistol you using is random generated every single time. Something like a Rogue game in other words.-The feeling controlling successfully a gun by pushing the keys in the rights order, is unbelievable! Me neither believed it at first, but it is true!!!-The A.I of the enemies is very interesting, specifically the flying drone. One time a flying drone hit a wall while I was running to avoid it. The result was to get disfunctioning and the drone started flying around like a drunk! Hilarious!!!!One another time I shoot a drone and fall down just only to discover when I approached it was still functioning and killed me!!! MotherF*cker!!!!The same goes of course for the gun turrets you fight/avoid in the game.[Cons]-The whole game is only one level. That it. Nothing new to add or a New Game Plus mode.-Only two enemies types: The flying drones and the gun turrets. More enemies would made the game even better.-Very difficult start. Even if I said it is very enjoyable to master the pistols, you will ""suffer"" a little to play the game properly.-My main reason why I gave the game 9/10 stars:If you enter a new room/place, suddenly the game freeze a little for an unknown reason. For this many times I died because gun turrets shot me while I was lagged entering a room....[Final Thought]Being very Cheap on Steam right now, it is a must play just only for the unique experience is offer.It have some problems, but I forgive them very easily.I hope for a better and bigger sequel in the future.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very crafty and all of the spawns, from rooms to what you spawn with, are randomized. The game very quickly teaches you to be cautious, ranging from punishing you for running into a room without looking into it first, to immediately being rammed in the side with a drone with no way to counter against it.How enemies spawn is randomized, and sometimes a bunch of turrets will be spawned in such a way that you'll need to tactfully take out each one before you can move on, and sometimes it'll cluster 5 turrets in one room.To keep you on your toes, how quickly you can react to turrets seeing you varies, ranging from being able to be seen by a turret for a full second and not die, to being shot the instant you enter their field of vision.Additionally, it seems how durable the robots are is also randomized. For example, sometime's you'll take out 4 enemies with one shot each, and sometimes you'll have to dump 10 bullets into a turret's weakpoint before it stops moving.What you spawn with is randomized, which means sometimes you can spawn with a revolver and 30 bullets, and sometimes you'll spawn with a M1911A1 and 4 bullets.Where you spawn is also randomized. Sometimes you'll spawn in a room full of ammo and maybe a tape and/or flashlight, and sometimes you'll spawn in direct view of a turret.Don't get me wrong, this is a great game, it's just that if you're purchasing this, prepare for RNGesus to kick you in the butt. A lot.			",90,4,0,1,6,0,0

												This game is to your average FPS what a flight simulator is to, say, Gradius.Call me crazy, but this is a pretty damn good survival horror game. It gives you just enough of the tools you need to survive and not much more, a foreboding atmosphere, and a threat you can just barely deal with. You're not completely helpless, but you're not some badass dudebro space marine manly man who has everything under control. The pressure is on you--if you get hit even once, you're dead no matter what progress you've made. If you don't make your bullets count, you'll be hard-pressed to find more ammo. A feeling of tension is ever-present.Who needs jump scares when you can put real pressure on the player? This game really puts emphasis on the ""survival"" in survival horror.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do I suck at it; Yes. Does that make it bad; No.I found this game really interesting, as it was much harder than it looked and depite looking rather cartoony,is actually pretty immersive.Just to point out two things I like that are the immersive stuff.1. when it's ""randomly generated"" your gun is what's actually random,not only in make/model but in wether or not it's loaded and how much ammo you have.And sometimes you have a flashlight,sometimes you don't,have fun2. You need to physically check your gun,wether it's loaded to be specific, or you will be made into swiss cheese on stumps by the robots when your gun fails to fire (And it will,trust me).I'll give it a good play when my new mouse gets here (For the love of god,don't use a track pad.It's one hit death) but from what I've seen, it's very,very good for a game made in a week.8/10, go buy it,or get the free copy with Overgrowth.(You have no Idea how much I just wanted to put ""Like slender with guns (and robots)"")			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok. First off, I got this game for free. So when I saw what it was I figured it should be that way considering it's state and how it'll never be updated. But $5? Are you kidding me? This game is worth $1. I understand it was made for a FPS 7-day competiton thing, but if you're gonna bother to put it on Steam and sell it for 5 DOLLARS, at least put some extra effort and improve it. Maybe have 2 versions, the improved and the original. Also, I can barely run it. There is nothing going on and the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥yet I am running at 20 FPS with low settings. Optimzation didn't come to mind when putting this on Steam. Anyway, the concept is good and mechanics work but the difficulty is ridiculously hard. I can only get 1 tape and then you throw like 5 robot things at me at once and I get killed. Fun.			",357,44,2,22,20,0,12

												Receiver is a really interesting experiment in first-person shooter mechanics in the fact that the gun is incredibly realistic and complex. The game is all about surviving to collect 11 tapes that give background to the story, similar to collecting the Slender notes. The world is randomly generated from a series of rooms and a variety of randomly chosen preset enemy and loot locations.The biggest part of the gameplay however is learning how to use your gun, which is a very close and very fun aspect to learn. It's no longer about running and gunning, it's about preparation. How many bullets do I have? What enemies can I see ahead? How far away are they and how can I handle them best? Surviving in this game isn't required, but it's a true testament that you constantly want to strive for that.The only real complaints I have was that learning how best to disable the killbots is only really told through either trial and error or the tapes, which you can be lucky and spawn near three, you can be unlucky and spawn near none. I suppose it would've been nice for maybe the first spawn to give you access to the tutorial-like tapes, and have the rest of the levels be random, but given the turrets have odd shapes and sizes, you'll figure something out eventually.For five dollars, the mechanics are complex, the enemies are powerful, the world is ever-changing and luck has to be on your side to really get far. Overall, a graphically simple but gameplay complex game. Perhaps not worth five dollars, but a bargain at -any- sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I don't know if all the issues are Linux specific, but: besides the hard nature of this game, you are very frustrated right from the beginning killed dozens of times because you get killed by a drone and you have an empty gun. Besides this: the game is awful: it's very joppy, only in a window, almost now configuration possible and the graphics ... well it looks like a 20 year old 3D game. It crashes e.g. when you hold ""?"" for advanced help. When you get killed, you start randomly in a new area/level so you have to start all over again. If it was for free, you can just drop it in disappointment. But I don't see any entertainment that is worth to pay for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The randomly generated wourld tend to have good and bad days. the wourld have a tendensy of being randomized at wrong places, and you might find your selfe running around without annything to do because nothing spawns in. the wourld generator seams to be just about the only bad thing about the game, reciver have acomplished every thing els it wants to acomplish.

												The gun moving around the screen reminds me of the one armed mechanics in Trespasser- but without the absurd fun. And as far as the ""realism"" of being able to learn how to reload a gun modeled after a real gun to fire bullets modeled after real bullets from a real gun, at the end of the day, you're just learning a combination of keys to press. There's a reason no other shooter has realistic reloading, and it's not the fault of the games, it's the limitations of the keyboard/controller. It's the same reason flight sims can be tedious when played on a keyboard. For a game made in a short amount of time, sure, it's not bad. But that's about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 4, 2014
												I have to voice how impressed I am with this one. I thought this was going to be a quick pick-up-and-play novelty, but instead I found a game with an extremely complex and deep gun mechanic.Good:The main catch of Receiver is that it has some seriously detailed and realistic gun mechanics. You randomly start with one of three pistols, either a magnum pistol, a revolver, or an automatic handgun, in a random state with a random amount of bullets. The term 'check your weapon' seriously applies here. How many bullets are in the magazine? Is there a bullet in the chamber? Do I need to pull the slide back? Is the safety on? Is it in automatic? Each of these questions comes up each time you spawn and pick up your gun, and each function and action has a key you have to memorize.But what really keeps getting me about this game is how creepy it is. You are, in essence, the only living thing in a randomly generated complex filled with cold robots. it is dark and almost eerie. I kept thinking to myself that this game would make an incredible horror game. This is what F.E.A.R. should have been. But, as is, it is overall very tense and does a good job of leaving a lasting impression despite being so simple in story and graphics.I should also mention this game is very difficult in a lot of ways. You will likely die fumbling around with your pistol and trying to remember the controls. You'll curse yourself for accidentally dropping your magazine when you are trying to reload it, or while you scramble for that perfectly good bullet you ejected from your gun on accident. But the feeling of mastering your pistol is truly a reward on its own. And that doesn't even include shooting things.Enemies are tough on that note. Robots don't die from just being shot a lot. Enemy bots have four vitals you can hit to kill or disable them: weapon, motor, battery, and camera. Precision is everything. One aimed pistol shot can render a robot useless, but madly firing at the main body will do nothing. Turrets will unleash a flurry of machinegun fire if they catch glimpse of you, and those shock drones are a whole lot faster than they look. And finally, you die in one hit, and must start over every time you are killed.But its all good challenge, and while the complex appears to be nearly infinite, it is possible to learn the game, recognize certain consistent features, and fight off your attackers with deadly skill while you explore and search for tapes.So, overall for the good, it has a deep gun mechanic with lots of nuances and details (which is rare that I actually like something like this), its a lot more challenging than it looks, and somehow manages to master the art of simple elegance and proficent story telling while still being very simplistic.Bad:I really don't like some of the randomization. One time I started within easy view of a hover drone, and prompty got zapped before I could even check my gun out. Another time I started with only two bullets in my gun and nothing else. Often times I found myself going on forever; searching out the complex without finding any of the tapes for long periods of time. A little consistency and a safe zone to start with would have been nice.Also, I have to say while this game is fun, I feel like it is also a game I will never be able to beat. The complex is absolutely huge. I sometimes would spend several minutes gunning down robots and trying to survive; only to die with not even one tape. A radar for the little things would have been nice. Or something more than just a shiny spot. Its fun to be able to just explore blindly and figure things out on your own, but only to an extent. This goes well past that extent and into the frustrating ""I can't figure out how to beat this"" zone.Maybe that's part of the challenge for some, but that's not really my thing as a casual gamer.Also, you'll learn to hate the hover drones because of how derpy their movements are. It really looks like they are being held up by a string. They bob and wobble in the air like a balloon in the wind, and will bounce and flop all over the floors and walls whenever they try to charge you. Again, maybe that's part of the challenge, but those things really test the aim in a bad way.Finally, the game does tend to lag a bit in certain areas, which for a game where victory depends on quick reflexes and sharp aim, that is really just a killer. I hate to walk through a door, only to have a lag spike that leads me to getting shot by an enemy I couldn't see around the corner.So, while the game is fun, I do feel like there were a few flaws in execution. The randomness would be fine if your task wasn't so tedious and the level so massive. Aspects that I felt like should be there to legitimately challenge me just kept rubbing off on me the wrong way.Finally, I will say that a way to choose which gun you start with would have been a fun feature, and I can't figure any reason why this had to be excluded.But, overall, I don't think any of that dampened the experience I had enough for me to not recommend this.Its a good challenge and a bit of a mind teaser as far as the controls go. There's a lot of detail that is sure to please any gun enthusiast out there, or just anyone who wants a break from the usual FPS crazies out there. It may not be the most realistic gun simulator, but it does an excellent job at simulating the feel of real combat. It teaches you how precious a bullet really is, why aiming is so important, and how ridiculous all the other action games like Call of Duty really are when it comes to their gunplay. Its immersive, its intense, and its a whole lot of fun.Its a bit of an experiment that I'm sure won't please everyone, but the idea is solid and the feelings it established really caught me by surprise. At the very least, this game is sure to teach you why weapons training is so much more important than learning to pull the trigger. And for this price? I couldn't recommend it more.

The game is all about surviving to collect 11 tapes that give background to the story, similar to collecting the Slender notes. The world is randomly generated from a series of rooms and a variety of randomly chosen preset enemy and loot locations.The biggest part of the gameplay however is learning how to use your gun, which is a very close and very fun aspect to learn. It's no longer about running and gunning, it's about preparation. How many bullets do I have? What enemies can I see ahead? How far away are they and how can I handle them best? Surviving in this game isn't required, but it's a true testament that you constantly want to strive for that.The only real complaints I have was that learning how best to disable the killbots is only really told through either trial and error or the tapes, which you can be lucky and spawn near three, you can be unlucky and spawn near none. I suppose it would've been nice for maybe the first spawn to give you access to the tutorial-like tapes, and have the rest of the levels be random, but given the turrets have odd shapes and sizes, you'll figure something out eventually.For five dollars, the mechanics are complex, the enemies are powerful, the world is ever-changing and luck has to be on your side to really get far. Overall, a graphically simple but gameplay complex game. Perhaps not worth five dollars, but a bargain at -any- sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I don't know if all the issues are Linux specific, but: besides the hard nature of this game, you are very frustrated right from the beginning killed dozens of times because you get killed by a drone and you have an empty gun. Besides this: the game is awful: it's very joppy, only in a window, almost now configuration possible and the graphics ... well it looks like a 20 year old 3D game. It crashes e.g. when you hold ""?"" for advanced help. When you get killed, you start randomly in a new area/level so you have to start all over again. If it was for free, you can just drop it in disappointment. But I don't see any entertainment that is worth to pay for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is super fun (and challenging). If you want a game where you have to think about your next move, wether you have enough bullets, or if your firearm is ready to shoot, then this game is for you. This game is also amazingly hard, still haven't beaten it yet. This game is definatly worth five dollars! PS: You will probably spend the first hour or two trying to figure out wether your handgun is ready to fire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game with no real expectations, but ended up with mixed reactions. this game does a great job in making an intense and original fps, but it also have a few problems. The randomly generated wourld tend to have good and bad days. the wourld have a tendensy of being randomized at wrong places, and you might find your selfe running around without annything to do because nothing spawns in. the wourld generator seams to be just about the only bad thing about the game, reciver have acomplished every thing els it wants to acomplish. Reciver is a awsome game, because it is intense, original, it makes you think, have a ok story, brings you closer to the wapon you use and it have alright graphics			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game was originally created in the 7 day fps challenge and focussed on non-liner story telling and realistic gun mechanics. It is defiantly worth the 5 dollars if you can run it.

They let the community to do it for them.Side note: The only time I can accept poorly optimized game if the developer team has attempted to update in good faith but no longer exist. (i.e. Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines)-------------------------Ok, let's say you can run this game and play it.- What is that? No spare magazine for your 1911?Better restart.- What is that? No tape (The objective to pick up 11 tapes in game) in next room?Better restart.- Not your favorite gun?Better restart.- No bullet / only one or two bullets at the start?Better hope no enemy behind the corner.Oh wait, what am I saying.BETTER RESTART.- Five flying drones in a room?Better U-turn now.If not possible, BETTER RESTART.I understand this is rogue-like, but not having a spare empty magazine and some bullets at the start is asking players to restart endlessly.------------------------Now, gun handling mechanics.This is only interesting mechanic in this game.- Want to know how to load bullets into magazine like in real life?Sure.- Want to know reload your gun?Sure.- Want to know the steps to fire your gun?Sure.While gun handling mechanics are great,Cons > Pros------------------------TL;DRThis is one of those games that the developer team decided to publish their game and do nothing to improve it.Wait on sale if you want to try gun handling mechanics.For other reasons, No.			",111,24,1,11,18,0,9

												I like the idea of it. I like the idea of a game where you actually have to go through all the motions of maintaining your weapon, e.g. opening the chamber, extracting the empty casings, loading the new bullets, closing the chamber, pulling the hammer, etc. There is something tactile about it that is very satisfying.The thing that really kills it for me, though, is that the different styles of gun lead to completely different control schemes. Sometimes equipping the flashlight is the 2 key, but sometimes it is the 1 key. In one round, tapping Z causes you to load more bullets into the empty chambers you're examining, but in the next round, pressing Z will make you drop the clip you're examining onto the ground (even if it's full). There are too many buttons doing too many things as it is, but then when the game shifts them around on you every round, it only compounds the problem. Those who are patient enough to go through the pain of memorizing all this may not have a bad time, but it is a major hurdle to the enjoyment of the game.The point at which I quit the game though was when I loaded a new round and the randomization placed me inside a room with a flying turret directly behind me. Literally, the round started, I heard a gunshot, and the round was over. I know roguelikes are super into busting the player's balls with randomization, but that seemed a bit steep.In short, I love the idea, but I don't think I like the execution.

												Receiver is a fun little title that is held back by a system of pure luck.Upon first getting this game, it is a fairly confusing first romp, fiddling with your pistrol as you try to understand how it works before venturing out to find your first sentry and HOPEFULLY killing it, or at least hittng a vital part and breaking it in some way that allows you to either get away alive or make things unwinnable. The gun system is by the most interesting part of this game, and the main selling point of it: There is no ""Press R to reload"" in this game, ammo doesn't magicly appear in your clip.. Heck, you might not even have an extra mag, meaning reloading requires you to go through the effort of putting in each bullet into the mag, provided you even have some bullets stored away.Really, I wish more games had such a deep gun system, where you have to manually reload the realistic way instead of just pressing R and making a new magazine poof into the gun. however, it is a shame that such a system is wasted here...While it is fun to fiddle with a gun in this game, what holds it back is how the game is played.. The goal of the game is to collect a certain number of tapes while fighting off robotic sentries in a randomly generated series of buildings. However, what this quickly boils into is a game that is nothing but pure luck if you win or not. The world is so randomly generated that it is possible that it could spawn an impossible situation that makes the game unwinnable.. Other times, however, it might just give you all the tapes right near the start, although this is rare.. From what I heard, it isn't worth it, though.So what about the combat? Surely it must be fun. And it is, provided you only are fighting ground-based sentries. But the moment you come across a flyer, kiss your progress goodbye because the blimy little robotic dinks will kill you so fast it baffles the mind. You will tremble in fear the moment you hear their buzzing down the hallway, maybe even try and find another way around, because no matter how hard you try, you can't beat them.. Not without either getting insanely lucky or throwing half your ammo at it.This is because of how crazed their movement is, the flyers flying in such a wobbly way that it makes it hard to hit them, let alone once they start charging you.. They shake so hard that it is like staring at a very angry blur. This makes it very hard to hit weakpoints, and the fact that they are melee based makes it worse, since you have no way of protecting yourself against the speedy hunks of junk unless you run like a bat out of hell and get lucky enough to avoid them. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the one-hit death system.Combine random generation with such unfair enemies and you get a game that oftentime, no matter how hard you may try, you will never be able to beat. Not because it is hard, but because the game tends to play unfair, sometimes going the extra mile to make sure you suffer your fair share of cheap deaths. A shame, really.. Were it not for the bullish systems in place, this game woulda been great.. But alas it is held back by some real unfun flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't really recommend Receiver for the price of $5.00. The storyline is short and not compelling, the game doesn't run or look particularly well at all, and the gunplay is unique, but not enough to hold my interest. The story is told through audiotapes found randomly throughout the game. I found it rather uninteresting, which in part is to be expected as the primary objective of the developer was to experiment with gunplay mechanics. As a result we have a storyline that just gives you a reason to collect audiotapes and shoot guns at robots.The game did not run particularly well for me, and I doubt it’s a problem with my hardware. Clipping and pop-ins are fairly common. The environment is not textured so anything other than the guns you use look bland. The backdrop of a metropolis was a nice touch but overall the game was unimpressive graphically and technically.The gameplay is centered on the gunplay. You are given a random gun in a random condition with a random amount of ammo. You can manipulate nearly any aspect of the gun including pulling the hammer back or loading bullets individually into a magazine, and each action requires a different key. It takes time to learn, but once you start to figure it out it becomes increasingly satisfying to quickly empty the casings out of a revolver and reload it. You fight two types of enemies, a flying taser robot and a turret. Different parts of the enemies react in different ways when shot, so accuracy is rewarded over speed. For example the strategy I usually attempted to employ was to shoot the camera on the turrets as ideally it would take one bullet, and they would no longer be able to detect me. Admittedly the gunplay is interesting, but in the end I don't think it’s capable of holding up the whole package.Without a worthwhile story and weak graphics, the gameplay fails to make this game worth the $5.00 price tag. I'm glad someone experimented with gunplay to make this game, and if you can pick it up for a cheaper price or free, it is worth trying. Gun enthusiasts should also reconsider what I have said, because this game might be something you will find quite enjoyable. ",64,6,0,15,12,0,20

												As a gun nut from Indiana I really wanted to love this game. I can't remember how I ended up getting it on Steam--I had it before I had a Steam account and I didn't like it then either. But I decided after reinstalling it that I would try playing it to see if I could get good at it.It was made in like 24 hours so it's perfectly excusable that I can't recommend it. But things like rendering shouldn't be a problem for most players of a game. I don't have much trouble with other, more complex games with textures and stuff that my computer actually has to load as it goes. Unless I reduce the resolution to like 560x480 or something ludicrously tiny like that, this game is completely unplayable because of the lag (a common complaint, it seems).Aside from that, this game is not intuitive in the slightest. It looks like I'm definitely not the only person who has had incredible amounts of trouble just figuring out how to load my handgun. Again, this is excusable because it was made in so little time. If you're a diehard fan of guns and roguelikes, have uncanny powers of patience and fantastic eyesight, maybe watch a trailer or something and see if you think you would like it. Personally, I would not pay anything for a sequel unless it was a fully-developed and crafted game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I give this about a 3.4 raiting. It has potential and I was giving it a serious chance before falling to the side of some stairs and getting stuck. As well as falling 5 maybe 7 feet and dieing.  Everything! And there are only two things to fight... Is a one hit kill to you. Then at times you can one shot things and others a whole mag wont touch them. If you like things that are super hard then GO FOR IT! But otherwise the controls are over done. That is both neat and annoying. Maybe if there was the ability to lean around corners it be an ok game. Then as well maybe a difficulty setting would be nice. For an original idea I give mad props but in my own opinion this game has a long way to go before I put any serious time into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an interesting concept piece, but falls utterly flat on it's face. Everything about the game is in need of polish, from an awful UI (for such an extremely sparse UI as it is), to intentionally poor control layout, to the combination of these factors exacerbating its brutal difficulty. It's impressive how such a simple game can fail on so many levels.The game is brutal in it's difficulty. Not because the enemies can kill you with a single hit, or that they greatly outnumber you, or that you have very limited ammo, or that it's intentionally difficult to aim your weapon properly, or that some enemies appear to be able to absorb prodigious amounts of ammo for little to no good reason. No, the biggest difficulty creator is the fact that there is no rhyme or reason to the control layout beyond the normal movement and aiming and firing controls. Yes, the game is supposed to have a difficult mechanic of maintaining your weapon. But the button placements make no sense - they neither emulate the firearm that you are using, nor are they set up in a way that encourages a logical pattern. They're just generally clustered around the WASD keys like the developer just slapped them down whenever he thought of a new feature that guns have that he had yet to implement.The only hook into the plot (what little plot there appears be) is from audio tapes that have a poor voice over that you may or may not find near the beginning of your adventure. There is nothing that will make you feel like you have a need to complete the plot, other than any intrinsic desire you may still harbor for completing the game for the sake of completion alone.Also, a very special frustration that I managed to encounter is the fact that the game offers no way to reset one's controls to the defaults, but the UI that gives you control hints entirely works on having the default controls. So if you change your controls you'll either need to give up on using the tutorial UI, or find them online (at the time I write this I was incapable of finding them listed), or delete your registry keys from Windows so the game is forced into returning your defaults to you. The only people who should buy this game are the heedlessly masochistic and the curious game developers who want to explore the concept and how not to approach it. Even then, wait until it's on sale.			",172,34,0,9,6,1,13

-Quick Review-Receiver is a first person shooter that takes on the challenge of bringing in realistic gun mechanics, and an environment that looks like it was made by a student in his/her first few years using 3Ds Max. While not inherently ""bad""... Receiver isn't a game that will be enjoyed or appreciated by most people; that is why I'm giving it the down vote, to be honest I don't recommend or recommend-against playing this game, I simply didn't find it enjoyable.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You there! collect all the tapes! ""who me? Why do I want to do that?"" That's what I want to ask, but I'm not given that luxury. I collected only a couple tapes before getting tired of being murdered by the turrets 10+ times. Presumably you are collecting these tapes to uncover a mystery within the game and to understand what's going on inside the game.Game Play: First thing you do: Press ? on your keyboard so you can see what to doSecond thing you do: go through an acurete and realistic weapon arming proccessthird thing you do: run around and collect stuff on the floorfourth thing you do: run into your first enemy and get yourself killedGoal: To collect 11 tapesThe highlight for this game are the gun handling mechanics, you don't simply press ""R"" to reload, depending on the weapon you're using you need to press a button to change the cartage and then press a button to load a new one.For the revolver, you actually need to open the revolver, take out the old bullets, and put in new ones. While very interesting, and highly realistic, the game is not very easy to learn and will require learning new tricks if you want to actually survive the game play.I took down several of the auto turrets, there seem to be two kinds: Flying, and stationary. Both of them are really annoying if they spot you. If you get seen, you have a second to dodge around the corner. My instincts to shoot back usually ended up getting me killed. Achievements: No achievements (thankfully), unless you want to make them for yourself, I think collecting 11 tapes would be quite the accomplishment. Price:  This game just ended up in my steam game library, so free is free, but the price is $4.99 on the steam page. Probably not worth it for most people. Conclusion: I realize this game was made for the ""7-day FPS challenge"" which is why the graphics and the environment is very basic. But I just didn't really enjoy the game play, if there was more story, or just something to keep me interested I'd probably enjoy it more.This game would appeal to people who want to see what a game would be like with more realistic gun mechanics, however after playing it, I see why these types of mechanics aren't implemented in traditional shooters; because it breaks up the action within the game.

												I played this a lot considering how not-good it is. It's refreshingly low-stimulus. You engage at your own pace* taking short bursts of high risk. ""High risk"" can be as mundane as turning a corner. If you don't see the telltale spotlights, robots shoot you and you die instantly. Situational awareness is sacrosanct and there are no non-diegetic distractions. It manages to be tense, and then routine, which causes laziness and then death. The high lethality, immobile enemies, and detailed gun manipulation emphasize readiness. To get ready, there's lots to do. There's nothing like being ready to go with a robot around the corner, magazines topped off, safety off, ironsights up, and dying because you forgot to chamber a round. The game does suspense very well.You start completely over when you die. You collect random pickups for your random gun around randomly placed enemies in random structures**. There are ""plot"" tapes to collect but you won't realistically collect them all ever. Some are blank. It's neat how nakedly cultlike they are. Like a real-life cult, not videogame-standard delusional idiots. Mystical ideas have materialist labels. The speaker in the tapes is a gun-and-apocalypse obsessed cult leader. He says they're magical superpower-granting tapes. You have to listen to all of them a ridiculous number of times (it's meta, you will hear the same ones over and over.) Your gun holster and pouch and loose ammo is standard kit. It's almost what the Branch Davidians would sound like if they did their propaganda mail-order.Ultimately though, it's not very good. It's kind of ugly. It's badly optimized, and lags when generating a new area. There's hardly any content. The lighting is obviously wrong in places. Some of the procedural areas don't ""line up"" and connect right. One map area has stairs with an invisible ledge you have to jump over. If you jump on a bed your head clips through the ceiling. The environment can clip through your inventory. It's possible to get physically stuck where it's impossible to get out or die. There are a ton of tapes and sometimes the random number generator is just unfair. The game has a lot of problems. It's an extremely unrefined version of a neat idea***, so I wouldn't recommend it to most people. It's only five bucks and I'm not most people, so it worked out for me.*I died at spawn once because a robot spawned in an adjacent area in line of sight.**Technically procedurally random but who cares.***Because it literally is, it took a week to make.

												I got this one with overgrowth, and this is terrible, you have to keep a control screen u[ while you wander around looking for whatever you supposed to get, it just plops you in there telling you to get the tapes,like its slender or something, but if youet hit once you die, and around any corner could be a turret waiting to just once shot you, meanwhile you have to put clips into the things.

												Although it's an early access game, this company has had a past of keeping their games in Alpha forever. There are keys for each individual part of your weapons - and it take 10 button presses in order to reload a gun. The enemies are repetitive, the goal is another collectathon, and the presentation is just boring. Unless it drastically changes soon - Don't waste your money, please.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The biggest issue is that the way the story is presented distracts you with thoughts of how much the developers must start sentences with the phrase ""Yeah man, like, what if...""The second biggest issue is that the random generation completely fails to supply for the player.

												A game meant for guns nuts above all else. This is essentially a pistol simulator, i.e. there is a key for every step of reloading a pistol, like taking the magazine out or putting it back in. It was a cool concept at first, but it wore out fast. What is a gun sim without fun things to shoot at? The only things to shoot are turrets and flying drones.  It is actually more beneficial to avoid most of the enemies than to actually shoot at them with your gun. This ""game"" gives off a deeper tactical impression with its focus on gun realism, only for it to boil down to a silly minigame where you avoid turrets and drones whilst simultaneously collecting nonsensical tape recordings.

												Fun idea, poor execution. Something as simple as aiming or looking around is needlessly more complicated than in other games, making it doubtful you'll hit what you're aiming at. This is compounded by the fact that the game is not only criminally stingy with ammo drops, but your actually starting loadout as well- multiple times I was spawned with less than five bullets for my given weapon, and twice I literally spawned with nothing to shoot. Add to this the fact that some enemies don't actually die unless you hit a particular part of them (not that the distinction is even made apparent in any way), and you've got a recipe for frustration.4/10 If this were an early-access title then I'd say keep an eye on it to see if these issues are addressed, but as a fully finished game, it's not worth your time.

												Although the unique gameplay concept (surviving with a barely-loaded and mechanically simulated gun in a mysterious roguelike world) is laudable, little else about Receiver is; the optimization is shockingly poor even on high-end machines, the game has zero polish, and the gameplay ends up being more finicky trial-and-error than challenging fun.Excellent for having been created in a week, but not really a marketable game in its current state--think of this as an Early Access title with no updates in the near-future pipeline. Buy on sale if you're really curious (that's what I did) or skip.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is hardcore. You will DIE a lot.  I could see that if this were some sort of training VR where you were in an actual room, it would be legit.  The controls are difficult to get the hang of, and you will die a lot until you get the hang of it.  Ammo runs out quickly and good luck finding more, so get used to dying because of it.

												Personally, I found the game very interesting at first. The mechanics and story seemed unique, and some puzzle based gunplay didn't seem to bad.However, after purchasing the game, I find that it gets rather dull very quickly. The story is bland and repetative and doesn't entise the player. Other than that, the engine it is made on (Unity, I believe) causes a tremendous amount of lag, regardless of what system you run. All together, not worth the 5 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 13, 2014
												WOW... major dissapointment. I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but there is a major problem with it. This game is sooooooo poorly optimized it is nearly unplayable. According to the store page, my PC not only met the Minimum requirements, but the Recommended requrements (barely but still) yet the game had UNBEARABLE framerate and mouse lag. I  mean it takes almost 2 seconds for the gun to move after you move the mouse. Sure, what's 2 seconds? Well in a game where you have enemies that are flying quickly, turrets that can kill you almost immediately after spotting you and limited ammo to hit small targets on previously stated enemies... yeah the mouse lag can really be a problem. It wouldn't bother me if the requirements of my PC aren't powerful enough, but I have read the requirements and they match (so don't blame my crappy Computer that [supposedly] meets the requirements). Now onto the actual game... there isn't much. The game is very simple. Collect all the Cassette Tapes around the level, while killing off all enemies and trying to survive. The main feature is the realistic gun unloading/reloading mechanics. Everytime you need to reload or whatever, you need to manually pull back slide, take out magazine, store in inventory, take new magazine out of inventory, load new magazine, unlock slide, and pull back hammer before being able to fire your gun. Each step has its own corresponding key to hit and it overall is annoying. It loses its novelty very quickly and just makes reloading a chore. It also makes it impossible in a firefight. Also each of the three different weapons has different reloading sequences... great.Also levels are randomly generated after death. So once you die, cassete location, enemy location and type, bullet count, flashlight batterey life, and gun type all change. This gives the challenge and overall is annoying since enemies (who instakill I should add) can be right around any corner. Also bullets are in random spots so good luck finding them when you have ran out and are now running from your life against flying guys in a hallway that has a turret around the corner at the end of it. What should happen is instead of the levels randomize after death, have a randomize button so you can know the layout and actually finish a level.Overall, the game has a cool idea but the poor optimization and annoying instakill enemies with tiny weakpoints ruin a game that could have had some really tense atmosphere.

												While the gun handling is really good, everything else is iffy to bad. The story in the tapes you collect ingame is mildly interesting, but not great. There's very little music, and it's nothing special. The level is really basic, boring, and overly minimalistic. Visuals are generally kinda ugly, without much style too. There's only two types of enemies, and while the idea of hitting them in specific locations is a cool idea, it's really tough in practice. The turrets aren't too hard to hit (there's a bit of a challenge, but not too much) or in some cases just to avoid, but the flying drones are nearly impossible to hit in the critical spots, and can require more than one hit, despite them flying extremely erratically. Combat can be frustrating, and not in a way that made me feel skilled for dispatching an enemy, so much as glad I wasn't hit myself. After almost two hours of trying to enjoy this game, I realized my hope was futile. The idea and core gunplay of a game is there, but nothing else of substance. Oh! I almost forgot the worst offence! It's buggy and laggy to high hell! I thought it might have just been my so-so laptop I had played it on, but numerous other reviewers had the same issues. 3.5/10 could have been something cool (and lag free) if the devs spent more time on it.

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)It's not a good game, but that's not what you should buy it for. It's about the gun handling. Once you have gotten the hang of it and played a while, you'll want mechanics like these in other games, too, and I'm not aware if there are any so far. I do not feel like these mechanics must be the focus of a game (And they indeed aren't in this game, they'll only seem like that to a beginner for whom they'll be the main obstacle.), they could just be a nice element of realism, but the game would of course have to be balanced accordingly.At first, I had real trouble getting the hang of the gun mechanics, even though there's on-screen help in the game (that you can toggle). But then I did this, and it helped a lot:In the game's launcher, I edited the keyboard configuration to a set of keys that I could easily remember and that made logical sense to me. This plus the key function texts in the configuration window made it easy for me to start handling the guns in a routine way. Downside: The in-game help does not adapt to the changed keyboard config. :(So, the gun handling and mechanics are fun. What about the game itself? Well, it has very limited gameplay. You sneak through a (procedurally assembled, so somewhat different play-through each time) facility, trying to obtain bullets, magazines, guns, a flashlight, and a few audio tapes. You'll encounter flying turrets that you have to fend off, and there are floor-mounted turrets. It's interesting that both consist of various parts, and shooting those has varying effect depending on what you hit.Is it fun? Yes, for a few hours, and it's mostly interesting because of the gun mechanics. It's not a full game, rather a prototype. Worth the purchase? Definitely when discounted, but €5 isn't all that much, either.The FOV is not low but can not[pcgamingwiki.com] be changed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One Sentence Summary - If you like pressing 15 buttons to shoot a gun, buy this game... otherwise, buy something else...--REVIEW--I simply cannot say that I recommend this game. It seems that this game was more of a tech demo than anything. Other than the ""Tron"" sounding background music, this game really doesn't provide any emotional connection with the player. The game simply starts... there is no story provided, other than the players having some sort of idea that they are running along some rooftops looking for cassette tapes. I assume these tapes give some sort of minimalistic story. I get the point that this was made for some 7-day FPS challenge, but they could have at least given the player some sort of story or motivation to find these tapes. The graphics are incredibly minimalistic, yet it runs poorly on my laptop, even on the ""fastest"" setting. I get much better performance playing something like Dragon Age or FInal Fantasy 13 than I would on this game. When I turned the resolution down to the lowest setting (like 600x800 or so), I got decent performance. You might as well do this, because you won't lose any graphical details... because there are none to lose. I believe this to be either a hardware compatability problem or simply not programmed well to run efficiently.---PROS---+Minimalistic/Non-existent story (if you like that sort of thing)+Tron music+Very ""realistic"" process of having to load and reload a gun.---CONS----Minimalistic/Non-existent story-No Tron motorcycles or discs-You have to press way too many buttons to load a gun. There is no tutorial or simple explanation other than pressing the ""?"" button for help, and blindly pressing the buttons until your gun is ready to shoot.-Graphics are very minimalistic (AKA- Didn't have time to add detail)-The game runs extremely poor on a dual core laptop with 8GB ram.-For the average game player, I think the gun loading process is extremely cumbersome... At least make a tutorial or arrange the buttons in a streamlined order.---CONCLUSION---If you like randomly generated worlds in games with no story, as well as tron music and hard to load guns, this is the game for you. For the rest of us, we'll be better off playing something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this for free... Don't buy this. The framerate sucks, and you can't change it, because there are no video options. The gun mechanics work, but are a bit overcomplicated, which is definitely not necissary in this game. It's also just simply too difficult. The robots are overpowered. You always spawn somewhere different, which makes it desorienting and makes the objective lose credibility. It's just no good. Buy something else instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i usually dont write reviews but i have to comment on this. at first the game seems fine. lil funky at first. the controls take ALOT of time to get used to. and they are different with each gun.  the drop spots are random. you die with 1 hit. you fall off a step you die.  the randomness of things are okay. ammo is extremely limited.  quite a few times i spawned infront of turrets without any chance to even check my gun.  yes you have to check your gun because sometimes it doesnt even come loaded even if you have two clips in your inventory.  the aiming is iron site down the barrel. its frustrating to play.  im just glad it was free on the humble store. i wouldnt pay for this.  for a free game. its barely playable.

And there's a story in it, which is good for an endless game.The gun is realistic, u have to reload the gun like in real life, which is lots of works.Conclusion: It's a very great game if u like guns, and the realistic of the game provided very intense gameplay, it also provide endless gameplay.

												Receiver is a First Person Shooter about guns. Like, really about guns. The main attraction of this game is how it handles gunplay so realistically. Rather than have you automatically reload, you have to manually do each step to reload. If you miss up, there's just more time for flying sentries or turrets to get you. The point of the game is to traverse a randomly generated maze of bleak colors to find cassette tapes that provide background to the universe.The game's atmosphere is wonderfully dark and creepy. It does a great job of making you feel alone, and the dark colors combined with the low-quality models and textures create a sense of dread and otherness that makes you really feel like you're out of your element, running through a maze you have no map of that's filled with enemies that are more location-savvy than you.The gameplay is fun and rewarding. When you first start, you're probably gonna be really slow at handling your gun. You'll die a lot, and you'll forget certain steps, completely halting any progress in loading a new magazine into your weapon, typically under enemy fire. You won't have much ammo, and will have to conserve your bullets, though eventually you will run out right before entering a room full of enemies. As you get better at the game, you'll be able to load your gun faster and be more precise with your shots, wasting less ammo. This game does a good job of making you feel like you are progressing at the game because it is solely skill-based.I'd buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. For being made in a single week, and only having ONE content update, this game manages to create so much tension, and feeling, and amazing, it could put some big-name games to shame. And the mechanics are super fun to learn and use. Randomized level generation keeps things interesting, and the one hit death keeps a certain tension in the air that keeps you on your toes. The only two issues I have are as follows; no sprinting, and performance. No sprinting simply because if you happen to be crossing a large room or bridge with nothing around, navigation can be tedious. The performance thing is only an issue if you play full-screened. Just keep it in a window, with the appropriate level of detail, and you should be able to run it just fine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is a fun ""gun simulator"". The gun mechanics are very in depth. You can't reload just by tapping ""R"". You have to eject the magazine, load each bullet into the magazine individually, then put the magazine back in. Each of these actions has its own key. While somewhat confusing at first, you can eventually memorize the keystrokes for reloading and other gun mechanics.The objective of the game is simply to collect 11 cassette tapes, unlocking somewhat vague pieces of the game's story, and not getting killed by the two types of enemies. Enemies will kill you in one hit. If you die, you have to start completely over. It is far from an easy game.There are also 3 types of guns, but I downloaded a mod that adds even more.

												This game is, well, strange,I'm not sure what the story is, but all I know is that you are a in somekind of dream machine and you need to find tapes to unvail the truthGraphics/Art style- I like the art style in this game. It's very blocky, but this game shows that you don't need graphics to have a good game. This also reminds me of those retro days where the first 3D games were all blocky and sometimes pixely. Although I like the are style, there are some bugs that I found that make giant block spawn in my way and completely blocks of the only entrance to the last tape. 8/10 for retro score, 5/10 for score against games with good graphics. (the 5/10 score will not be put into the final score)Gameplay- For gameplay I would say that it's ok. It's actually quite spooky if you get randomly attacked by one of the flying turrets, but searching for the tapes is quite boring most of the time. Sure, you might say that you will run into a lot of turrets, but I spawned in once with no turrets.  7.8/10Price- 5.49 is the price in Canada, but is it worth it? YES! For the price, this game is great, and you will receive lots for the five bucks, besides IT IS 5 FREAKIN DOLLARS!!!!! 9.3/10Final verdict- If you like Indie games, then sure go ahead! This games will be a great buy, but if you don't like waiting and looking for things, than you might want to pass on this. Final Score: 83/100			",106,3,2,5,6,1,3

												Before you chew me out for only playing an hour and a half of this game first let me tell you about it. This game is great. The idea is fantastic and the sense of survival it goes for is achieved. Does it look like it could have been made in Google SketchUp? YES (at least on my computer it does). But it goes surprisingly deep for what it is. You spawn in a random part of what appears to be a huge house, or apartment bulidings, or neither I'm really not sure. You are then given one of three handguns, a Glock, a revolver, and a Colt 1911. This is where the game get's really interesting. The controls focus around the gun. There is a key set to open the reciever, a key set to take out the magazine, a key set to pull the hammer back. Everything you would actually do with a gun, and magazine for that matter, there's a key for it in this game. To me that is fantastic. It's new to me, and I tend to doubt there have been many if any games that follow that same idea. The second interesting point of this game are the audiotapes you pick up. They give a wonderful backstory to the game, telling you why you are there, and hinting at something sinister. In that way, it's like the Matrix, only voiced by Microsoft Sam. If you see this game for 50%, heck 33% off or more buy it. You will not regret it. This game get's my 7/10. The idea is great, but I wish the game was more replayable.			",216,11,3,11,8,0,17

												Pretty difficult to run with a reasonable framerate (I'm currently doing so by playing with a lower resolution), but it's definitely worth it. The gun mechanics are a massive breath of fresh air, the story is really compelling, and the atmosphere is just ridiculously tense. I have no problem with admitting that I'm afraid of the dark, but that normally doesn't affect me in games. However, Receiver somehow manages to hit the part of my brain that real darkness does.

												Some people will take this game very boring and uninteresting and some people will find this game very very fun. It's a quite unique game in my opinion.First thing: the way you handle the gun is very realistic, so the button layout is very different than normal games, especially when you reload. You have to press each button for certain actions; for example, with a revolver, you must 1) open the chamber 2) drop all the empty cartridges (some may get stuck sometimes, so you gotta shake em/hit the key repeatedly) 3) reload each bullets 4) close the chamber. <<so there are 4 different buttons to press to reload as for other games, reload is just 'r'. There are three different types of guns: Glock, Colt 1191, and S&W revolver. They all have different ways to reload, but the same action = same keys. You will feel SOOOOOOOOO achieved if you get used to reloading well that you can reload smoothly and fast without even thinking.There are only two types of enemies in this game: automatic sentry gun & flying taser robot, which is kinda scary when you actually face them because they **cking fly at you like a tsunami. They have limited sight (so sneak when you're out of their sight and ambush? I guess. That's not a very good word for this kind of situation but I suck at English so... Yeah..) but they if they detect you, good night man (unless you have an Asian reflexes on mice or consol that you can hit certain part of robot when it's flying the **ck at you). And damaging certain parts will either break (different parts) or kill the machine.Anyways, the goal of this game is to find 11 recorded tapes and I think it's game over then. HOWEVER! I bet not a person among 1000 players can finish this game as fast as they thought it would end. As you can see, I played 10.4 hours of this game and still wasn't able to finish the game and I consider myself not THAT bad of a FPS shooter... I'M ASIAN FOR GOD'S SAKE!Uhh.... I wanna explain more but I gotta go to sleep so.... maybe if someone asks to write more about this game I'll write it in Korean and English both detailed. Oh and also, are there any games out there like this? Because I'd love to see this kind of game actually developed well. I mean... This game was made in less than a week so great respect for that. Gnight it's late is Asia.-Devil-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:-Realistic firearms simulation. It feels like you actually control the gun-Interesting story-Quite a lot of stuff put into it, considering it was made in seven daysCons:-Takes more processing power than all of my other games. I have a decent computer and even on the fastest setting it was slow. I tried it on my other computers to the same effect. This caused my character to jerk around unpredictably and made it hard to aim my gun; I died frequently.-Graphics are from 1998-I kept encountering this glitch where the gun shakes back and forth rapidly and when I fire the gun I shoot myself instead.-Gun mechanics are frustrating at first, with a lot of buttons to memorize.-Randomized, sometimes requires lots of moving back and forth and can be frustrating.Go for it, but make sure you have a powerful PC first.

Warning:This is not a complete game, consider this a tech demo since this game was done in a week!Now that we got that out of the way, onto the game.Receiver is a first person shooter rogue-like. Everytime you spawn, you get a random weapon with a random inventory on a randomly generated world.The objective is simple, obtain 11 tapes around the map and you win. But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.The main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet. While the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.While there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.But lets review the features of this game.FeaturesDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto modWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.Taser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage modelsAs said above before the features. This is true.Ballistic modeling of ricochets and bullet dropAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill eventThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.Become literate in how guns actually operateI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.While the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.I belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once. Now for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?For 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability.

												Very well done realistic FPS. Made me panic a few times as a drone came whizzing past my skull, or I heard the beep of a turret behind me. I'm astounded at what this game accomplished despite only taking a week to create. the complexities behind your firearm become second nature after a few playthroughs, and you get immersed in the games subtle and somewhat errie cyber environment as you go to collect disks before you run out of ammo or are filled with the sensation of a sharp electric buzz to the head or dozens of pieces of metal rebounding throughout your ribcage.

												Love the game, resembles the complexity of firearms that you don't get in the real world. While in this game hitting a few buttons in the right order will reach your goal the real world lets you do this without thought unless you gun jams. All in all it is a good game but you will eventually curse the muscle memory games like COD, BF and even Arma created until you create your own.10/10  would use revolver again.

Either you spawn with enough ammo to actually fight the instakill enemies (!) or you don't, and die on the first encounter.And the instakill enemies! If your enemies can kill the player in one shot, then you need way, way more signposting around them! A single beep from a fast-moving aerial enemy that can attack from any direction is not enough.

												Been playing this game here and there for a while now. This game is pretty nice in a lot of concepts. For example, how you control your gun. There are 3 basic weapons; The M1911 Colt, the Glock 18, and a .357 Revolver (I think it is a .357) and all three have their own way of control. The Colt and Glock have the same controls except that hitting V forthe Colt will put on the Safety while the Glock makes it either go Semi or Automatic. I like the Revolver and how you can spin the chamber as much as you want with the mouse wheel. Or you can spin it before you place it back. There is a lot of stuff about the game that makes it a good game. On the other hand, I do go through a little bit of some issues here and there. For example, I get random FPS drops when going through different areas on the map, but it goes away half a second later. And I am currently having Lighting FX issues (Probably my side). Besides that, this game is definitely worth it. Especially with the recent gun additions to the game.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some times you start with a flashlight. Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have a lot of ammo, sometimes you don't. This game in its own way is one of the most immersive and impressive FPS ever to be made. Each of the 3 firearms has its own quirks such as having to manually eject the shells wit the revolver or the Colt M1911A1 that on ocassion is given to you uncocked or with the saftey on. Most of the time you realise that when a drone s flying at your head :P. Definatley worth the 4 quid you pay for. But be warned patience is required for learning the mechanics. Enjoy!

												Beyond the gun mechanics that I seriously enjoyed and would love to see used in other games (or better yet a sequel with a bigger budget) the rest of the gameplay reminded me most of the original Thief oddly enough. It's stealth that I ""get."" Pure, and and simple stealth requiring caution and planning but still giving me my action fix when the time comes. It's much more satisfying to successfully blast a turret or drone when you know that those bullets you are using really matter because you might not have enough for later if you use too many on just one turret. I'd call this a ""classy"" FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A different and interesting take on what video games have been doing for decades; not much in the way of content but a cool idea that it would be fantastic for some future games. Then entire time I played this I felt it would lend itself perfectly to a detective noir type game, something like LA Noire, using the shooting only once in a while to build tension and realism to the police procedural style; probably wont ever happen but hey, maybe this one random review will convince somebody to do this, and if that happened I would say Reciever is a great game for inspiring somebody!

												This game is, well, strange,I'm not sure what the story is, but all I know is that you are a in somekind of dream machine and you need to find tapes to unvail the truthGraphics/Art style- I like the art style in this game. It's very blocky, but this game shows that you don't need graphics to have a good game. This also reminds me of those retro days where the first 3D games were all blocky and sometimes pixely. Although I like the are style, there are some bugs that I found that make giant block spawn in my way and completely blocks of the only entrance to the last tape. 8/10 for retro score, 5/10 for score against games with good graphics. (the 5/10 score will not be put into the final score)Gameplay- For gameplay I would say that it's ok. It's actually quite spooky if you get randomly attacked by one of the flying turrets, but searching for the tapes is quite boring most of the time. Sure, you might say that you will run into a lot of turrets, but I spawned in once with no turrets.  7.8/10Price- 5.49 is the price in Canada, but is it worth it? YES! For the price, this game is great, and you will receive lots for the five bucks, besides IT IS 5 FREAKIN DOLLARS!!!!! 9.3/10Final verdict- If you like Indie games, then sure go ahead! This games will be a great buy, but if you don't like waiting and looking for things, than you might want to pass on this. Final Score: 83/100			",106,3,2,5,6,1,3

												Receiver is a game where you take control of a person who has a choice of 3 guns they are a Colt, Revolver and a Glock. The controls are simple in the game as you progress through the barren city not much is known about the story apart from you just need to collect 11 tapes and not die, as the game does focus more on the gun and the enemies it can give you a few jumps at times. For this review i give it a positive and i hope to see more people enjoying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game made in a week, it's pretty great. It's inherently satisfying to manually reload your weapon as quickly as you can, once you have a grasp on the mechanics. It's tense and fun when you hear a drone around a corner, look out for its camera light, and time it just right to shoot and disable it unscathed. There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.However, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.It's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is one of those rare games that feels entirely new and fresh.While it is your standard survival-adventure shooter in terms of action, it is so much more than that. Receiver is one of those rare games that actually makes you work to succeed. You have to memorize the steps to get your gun working or you will die quickly and repeatedly, you have to learn your enemy's weak spots, you have to learn how to safely enter a room or hallway. Receiver is near impossible difficulty, but I always find myself picking it back up.It's not a game about completion, but rather a game about mechanics. The guns feel good, the game has occasionaly jarring (but generally good) progression.You'd be daft to not get this game when it's on sale.			",482,81,14,61,44,7,89

Each of the 3 firearms has its own quirks such as having to manually eject the shells wit the revolver or the Colt M1911A1 that on ocassion is given to you uncocked or with the saftey on. Most of the time you realise that when a drone s flying at your head :P. Definatley worth the 4 quid you pay for. But be warned patience is required for learning the mechanics. Enjoy!

												Kinda like a Rogue like, the enemies are randomly scattered, so are the bullets and tapes and the lives usually only last 10 minutes max (or maybe that's just cause I suck)... so a Rogue like like.  The game is great considering it was made in 7 days.  I would love to see a multiplayer as the gun mechanics make it so much more interesting than 'press r to reload' games.  Only problem is that it's laggy as hell if played at my screen resolution, however being short sighted in real life, downgrading to 800*600 wasn't such a bad thing.  Nonetheless great game and very adictive, I frequently find myself thinking ""oh just one more life"" for the thousanth time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Warning:This is not a complete game, consider this a tech demo since this game was done in a week!Now that we got that out of the way, onto the game.Receiver is a first person shooter rogue-like. Everytime you spawn, you get a random weapon with a random inventory on a randomly generated world.The objective is simple, obtain 11 tapes around the map and you win. But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.The main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet. While the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.While there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.But lets review the features of this game.FeaturesDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 ""Victory"" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto modWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.Taser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage modelsAs said above before the features. This is true.Ballistic modeling of ricochets and bullet dropAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill eventThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.Become literate in how guns actually operateI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.While the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.I belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once. Now for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?For 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability.

While in this game hitting a few buttons in the right order will reach your goal the real world lets you do this without thought unless you gun jams. All in all it is a good game but you will eventually curse the muscle memory games like COD, BF and even Arma created until you create your own.10/10  would use revolver again.

												I lied in my last review, or at least looking back now i was, because i started playing more games and got a better idea of what a video game should be and this is not it. Now one could make the argument that ""it is better than cod"" while it might be better in the long run, it is just a sloppy game that had a very short time window. If it had more time then i could see this game being more playable but i seem to be going on nothing so i'll start the real review now. First off, guns are few to none and tiny little robots that want to turn your chest cavity into swiss cheese are every where, you may spawn with a gun or a flashlight or simply nothing. Finding a gun isn't very easy because you die pretty fast because you have as much bullet resistance as President Lincoln and when you finally get a gun, the magazine is shorter than a Japanese midget.  Objectives are not marked, there is no way to find your way around and there are no checkpoints. If you find these complaints stupid and like COD, then you have COD on your mind, because listing all the FPS's with those 3 things would take longer than i care for. This game does need navigations though, because every time you die the world gets randomized leaving you lost. Marked objectives are a must have because the only objective is to collect these little VHS tapes or what the hell ever, and they are small as a Chinese elf and some times blend into the enviroment.  Overall this game is just not worth playing, not only is it filled to the brim with bugs it is only fun for 20 minuets AND you die from 5 feet falls, i sh!t you not. Maybe if they made a Receiver 2 and put more behind it than ""OH LOOK WE HAVE RANDOM GENERATED WORLD N' ROBOTS N' GUNS"" then i would consider playing it. 3/10			",101,5,0,5,5,0,1

												Beyond the gun mechanics that I seriously enjoyed and would love to see used in other games (or better yet a sequel with a bigger budget) the rest of the gameplay reminded me most of the original Thief oddly enough. It's stealth that I ""get."" Pure, and and simple stealth requiring caution and planning but still giving me my action fix when the time comes. It's much more satisfying to successfully blast a turret or drone when you know that those bullets you are using really matter because you might not have enough for later if you use too many on just one turret. I'd call this a ""classy"" FPS.			",219,53,0,24,13,2,40

												Been playing this game here and there for a while now. This game is pretty nice in a lot of concepts. For example, how you control your gun. There are 3 basic weapons; The M1911 Colt, the Glock 18, and a .357 Revolver (I think it is a .357) and all three have their own way of control. The Colt and Glock have the same controls except that hitting V forthe Colt will put on the Safety while the Glock makes it either go Semi or Automatic. I like the Revolver and how you can spin the chamber as much as you want with the mouse wheel. Or you can spin it before you place it back. There is a lot of stuff about the game that makes it a good game. On the other hand, I do go through a little bit of some issues here and there. For example, I get random FPS drops when going through different areas on the map, but it goes away half a second later. And I am currently having Lighting FX issues (Probably my side). Besides that, this game is definitely worth it. Especially with the recent gun additions to the game.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is pretty fun... I think it's a little too challenging, and I have no idea what's going on. There are a lot of controls to remeber, which is tough. The map is quite big, and your looking for small cassette tapes that are scattered all over. Some areas of the map are really dark, or hard to find your way out of.  It either lags like heck, or runs smoothly, even on the lowest settings. Sometimes I spawn with a different weapon than previously, and in a different spot. You die in a couple shots from the rapid-fire turrets, and die in one hit from a flying electrical ball thing. So really, you die a lot, and veryu quickly. Your weapons do a little less damage than I'm used to, but overall a fun game. (I will try to play this game a bit more to see if I can fix any of the above problems, if I can I'l re-write the review)			",106,9,0,0,6,0,2

												Well, the graphics aren't that great, but that doesnt make the game bad. This game is AMAZING. This game is about the gunplay, and currently has 3 different weapons: Colt M1911, Glock and a revolver. Colt and Glock are kinda the same, except the Glock has a larger magazine, and it can auto-fire. The revolver is alot different than the Colt and the Glock, because it has a cylinder that holds the bullets.(6 bullets) The controls are a bit complicated, but you will get the hang of it. I would recommend this game to people that are tired of Call of Duty, Battlefield, all that kind of games, to people that want something fresh. This is the game for those people. 10/10 The Flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying			",57,5,5,2,13,0,0

												Receiver is a very interesting little experiment that bases its gameplay around the mechanic that you have to manually reload your weapon like a puzzle, essentially a on the fly FPS puzzel game.It doesn't take too long to figure out how to properly reload everything and very soon you will be reloading faster than ever, so in the end it becomes a interesting little survival game to keep you distracted.I honestly wish this game would continue to be updated because there is a huge realm of possibilities to add in terms of weapons that could be used. Like shotguns, crossbows, bolt action rifles, all of these things would bring fantastic variety to this game, adding onto the list of different weapons you need to remember how to reload in different ways.But alas, it remains as it is, with only 3 weapons to use and toy with. Although the product itself is good, it's a shame when you imagine all that it could of had.			",416,55,4,40,24,2,32

												For a game made in a week, it's pretty great. It's inherently satisfying to manually reload your weapon as quickly as you can, once you have a grasp on the mechanics. It's tense and fun when you hear a drone around a corner, look out for its camera light, and time it just right to shoot and disable it unscathed. There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.However, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.It's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is one of those rare games that feels entirely new and fresh.While it is your standard survival-adventure shooter in terms of action, it is so much more than that. Receiver is one of those rare games that actually makes you work to succeed. You have to memorize the steps to get your gun working or you will die quickly and repeatedly, you have to learn your enemy's weak spots, you have to learn how to safely enter a room or hallway. Receiver is near impossible difficulty, but I always find myself picking it back up.It's not a game about completion, but rather a game about mechanics. The guns feel good, the game has occasionaly jarring (but generally good) progression.You'd be daft to not get this game when it's on sale.			",482,81,14,61,44,7,89

												Once I got past that horrible voice from the Gemini Rue commentary trying his hardest to sound like Werner Herzog, Receiver revealed itself to be the most exciting and rewarding shooter I've ever played. The moment you realize you've been reloading and operating your M1911A from reflex memory, you feel giddy. And then you become just careless enough to get caught in a simple drone trap that you would've spotted if you weren't in your own head. Unlike most 5-30 minute games out there, this one has replay value because it's actually fun and you do more than just walk around. No, you don't learn about the magical power of love and ponder humanism. You shoot stuff.			",537,177,27,83,65,9,61

												The gun reloading mechanics are neat, but the iron sighting to aim is terrible making the game not fun to actually play. If you were to aim an actual gun, you would keep the gun lined up to the target with your vision. When you aim in this game, however, moving the mouse moves the gun around a certain amount before turning the character. This means aiming is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and very unrealistic to actual gun aiming. I also had to massively reduce my mouse speed in order to actually aim, though it was still hard to aim as the gun jumps around for every pixel you would have moved with your mouse.

												Reciever is worth looking at if only for the way it handles its pistols in a much more mechanical, realistic fashion than most other FPS's. Unfortunately, that's the only thing it has going for it. It's an interesting concept that is trapped in a half-baked, Slendermanish shell. Random weapon loadout, random level design, search for the mcguffin objectives (with embarassing voice work), and frustrating enemies that have locational damage models that mean that it's pretty much random if your shots do any good. Basically, the game is designed as youtube scarecam fodder, with all that entails. As a proof of concept, it does a magnifcent job in demonstrating more immersive gun mechanics. As a game, it gets old really fast.			",134,32,0,18,13,1,22

												For such a simplistic game, it should take only about 1.5-1.7 GHz to play this. But no. It lags like crazy even if you have a medium PC. Think about this. Skyrim, the massive open-world, plays fine on my 1.7 GHz laptop at 30fps to 60fps at medium settings. This game, plays about 10fps constantly. I can tell they didn't care about this game because the graphics are terrible and they didn't even take time to optimize it. There is some stuff good about it like the combat and use of atmosphere to give you an alone feeling and other stuff but I'd say that it isn't really worth the £4 that it sells for. Maybe £1. Overall, I believe its a like it or hate it game.			",46,3,1,6,1,0,0

												I guess if youre from Texas shooting deer with your AK every morning or something this ""game"" (experiment actually) might not be of much interest. For anybody else this could offer an interesting insight into what gun use entails besides point and click and pressing r.It would really be interesting to see those mechanics implemented in a ""proper"" FPS.

Theres 2 enemy types one of which is annoying to deal with due to sluggish movement, the style and graphics look nice (i was abit reminded of Mirrors Edge) but the performance is comically bad for what basically amounts to rendering gouraud shaded objects and some lights.If you ever played some realismo fps and wished the gun handling to be more complex, give this a spin and wonder what could be.

												Some quality gaming. The most high quality gaming I've had the pleasure to game in quite some time. To game on this game you have to press a lot of buttons, gaming that only a real gamer can game in a game. I went into this game expecting a quick gaming session, but in all my years of gaming I have never misjudged a game's gaming potential so badly. The game itself is simple to game, you are a simple gamer and the game is to find 11 game tapes for the game. You game with a gun and you find ammo, and if you game hard enough you might collect all 11 tapes. I have not gamed hard enough for such a game as this, and I have disgraced my gamer family. But I haven't heard of anybody gaming hard enough to give this game the business (game business, of course), so perhaps I will be allowed back into my game family. Quality game for any gamer to game when they feel like a casual game or a serious game this game can go either way. I'd rate this game pretty well but, being a simple gamer, I am compelled to meme.10/10 would game again			",106,26,2,3,31,1,1

												This game is terrible! It was thrown in for free when I bought Overgrowth, and even that was too high a price.It feels like Probably Archery, or similar simulator-type game, however there is zero instruction and sense of humour. I can usually get the point of games, however silly, but this one just makes me feel angry when trying to play it. I wonder if this game was even finished. How did it get onto Steam in such a poor state of gameplay? Perhaps the developers hated working on it and just published it to get rid of it?			",95,18,1,9,26,3,32

												a really good idea but a really rushed idea as well.  many people probably don't know that this game was made in 7 days.  the maps have holes in it, respawn logic makes no sense, and due to its rushed out style, theres a very severe lack of textures to everything.  what i ment by this is that everything is jsut a solid color with a shadowmap on it in its most simplist modeled forum.reciever will not be a gam that you would look at for entertainment but rather a demonstration of what not to do when making a videogame, don't rush it.

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the Randomness of the game makes it so terrible, you can turn a corner to find a sentry gun that makes no noise and will fire at you instantly. I spawn in dark areas that lead to straight to a drop that kills you, this is made even worse by the fact that your flash light has a very small distance it will show you. I kept spawning right infront of enemies or I would round the first corner only to see a sentry or a flying blade machine that would instantly kill me. The flying machines travel way to fast and sparaticaly to even aim at till they kill you. To be honest this game is very good for being made in 7 days, just it should not have been sold on steam for $5, because overall it's terrible from a gameplay standpoint.			",147,30,3,7,24,3,32

												i have seen many a review for this game and most of them are true such as the way that MMS'S are taking a dark turn towards these looking more like nerf toys than actualy firearms. The thing i love about this game is the fact they make it a challenge no beating around the bush just trial and error. The other thing is that they made this game IN ONE WEEK. 7 days to creat such a beautiful game and a great one at that. Wolfire games you have truly dazzled me not alone with Overgrowth but with Receiver and i myself am sad to only now get to know these developers. You have some real talent Wolfire i expect great things and hopefully so does the community.			",91,10,0,11,5,0,18

												A downright innovative game. every action, down to loading bullets into a half-empty clip(which is useful) and spinning the cylinder of a revolver(which is useless, but fun in a pretend-to-be-cowboy kind of way)also rather scary in a building-tension kind of way, but also kind of cumbersome for the same reason its innovative, mainly because of no rebindable keys, but this is an early build, so its forgivable.

												Let's get it straight from the get-go. This game won't win awards for graphics, plot or sound design even if I think the guns sound meaty enough. This game is basically a quicky roguelike involving a gun and I strongly suggest tapping the ? button followed by holding it down while handling different things so you can quickly learn how to take your gun apart and reload it. That right there is why you're playing this game. You're vulnerable, the gun is barely a comfort and you're constantly worried you're going to take one step too far and find yourself dead and starting over. The three guns all feel a bit different and funny enough, just like real life, I can't stand the Glock. Points for involving a revolver and the 1911 though. It's five bucks, if you're a fan of shooters or if you actually shoot, this game is at least worth a look at some point. I wouldn't mind seeing a proper game made of this concept. I like it.

												What quickly starts with ""I have no idea what the heck I'm doing and it's so fun"" turns into ""Oh, balls, I dropped the magazine"" Which quickly turns into ""nononononononononononono"" as you reload/run out of ammo firing at one those flying drones.5/5 10/10 got shrekLATER EDIT:Once you actually get to know the game, and build your skills, you play around. I was playing around decocking/cocking the revolver for kicks (whilst playing, cuz there were no enemies) when suddenly, I accidentally fired instead of decocking. Now normally, this is okay. But no, there's bullet ricochet. So I fire, then hear a little ""PLAT"" then fall to the ground, dead.I killed myself with ricochet whilst playing with a gun.This game.			",97,17,0,8,5,1,4

												This game is pretty damn awesome. It's a basic, relatively simple game that doesn't look amazing, but what's actually there is great. Each level is procedurally generated so the map is never the same, you always have randomized ammo/equipment, and one bullet from a turret or shock from a flying drone will kill you. It makes piecing together the 2spooky story that's told across 11 tapes randomly placed on the map very difficult, but wonderfully tense. And of course, there's the game's real star - three guns that operate the same way actual firearms do. There's no crosshair, no ammo counter, and your mags don't magically refill themselves - assuming you have more than one, anyway. Doing a brass check and topping off magazines with loose rounds are actually things you'll find yourself doing in this game, as are other gun-specific actions like releasing the slide, dropping empty brass from a revolver, and spinning a cylinder to a loaded chamber, all of which require multiple button presses to accomplish. Sometimes, you'll even find it necessary to holster your weapon to complete an action such as filling a magazine, or pull the weapon down from the ""aimed"" position into a low ready to sprint away from danger. It's not the prettiest or most action-packed game out there, but Receiver is the closest a game has ever come to recreating the sensation of using an actual firearm. Very, very much worth the $5 purchase price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a FPS with elements that allow the user to load and reload their gun manually; although this concept sounded intriguing at first, the gimmick soon wore off and becomes annoying and makes the game a lot more difficult. This game has fairly poor graphics quality but it is on the Unity engine. It has ok gameplay in generated worlds but it is very very difficult to complete. The game pins you against robot enemies in a creepy empty setting where you have to find 11 tapes to complete the one level game.There isn't much to say about this game due to it's lack of content but it isn't very good.6/15 ""Gimmick wears off""			",246,34,6,26,27,2,18

												Reciever I found to be quite a dull and repetitive game, you are placed into a weird futurestic city with the task of finding 11 cassete tapes, your simple mission. The games biggest draw is the fact that it has a very relaistic and unique gun system which although cklever I found quite annoying as the controls seemed to change for ech gun when they needn't for example to insert a magizene for one pistol is z while to insert a barrel into a magnum its r, which simply gets confusing. I often found the enmies, of which there are only two types of too be annoying as well as despite the fact I shoot them with obvious sparks coming off them it still often takes a lot of bullets to take them out, this is very annoying seeing as sometimes you are spawned with one bullet... meaning that you will often spend your time in Receiver walking around its dull landscape, getting shot and starting all over again...

												I came to steam to find a futuristic, exciting, next gen first person shooter. What I was met with was this steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Steaming- pardon the pun. I started up the game which promised to fit my criteria to find this poorly made pile of junk that was obviously designed by a dead parrot or some♥♥♥♥♥♥as that is the only explaination for a game of this high caliber of awfulness. The ""gameplay"" was disgustingly designed and felt as though I could do better coding with my left bollock. Half of the entire map is mother♥♥♥♥ing green and I am now blind in my right eye as a result of these graphics that looked as though they were designed with a blunt crayon. I have never come across a game that is this♥♥♥♥♥♥since 'Intergalactic Cage Match' on the ZS Spectrum. This game ruined my life and I feel as if this was the worst waste of £60 I have ever come across during all my years of black market trading and scams in cheap casinos. This is a dispicable excuse for a steam game and I would like it to be obliterated from the face of the Earth for I wish for it never to prey on another poor sod's once valued retinas. Also, It has the most ♥♥♥♥ed up controls sytem since Tony Hawk: Skate and its ♥♥♥♥ed up skateboard controller and we all know how utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥that was. If anyone in their right mind would ever play this game, I will find you and be administering you to the nearest mental institution. On the other hand, it has a half decent title screen.

												For a game that was created in a single week, it runs exceptionally well and is quite addictive.  This game, unlike other FPS's, take the approuch of being as real as possible: Every single thing you do with the gun is another step for you to take.  Unloading a clip?  Reloading?  Safty?  All of those need to be done one at a time.  Although this may seem risky, this game does it to a whole new level and makes it interesting.  Mechanics are a bit awkward to get a handle of at first, but after about a half hour of play-time, you begin to get the hang of it, gaining some progress in the game.  I can almost memorize all the buttons required for reloading.Enemies are nothing special, though: they basically boil down to stationary turrets and flying robot helicopers from SpyGear with tazers that go *zap*.  Nothing unique, but far from being easy.This game does a good job of making it a challange without making it either laughably easy or insanly hard.  At first, the game is difficult, but then you get a hang of things and it begins to get easier.  It's well paced.Randomly generated areas also help the game's overall success.This game is fantastic for what it is.  The best part is that I didn't even need to pay for it: They announced that if you pre-order their other game, ""Overgrowth"" (which is an excellent game as well; I highly recomend it) you get a free copy of ""Reciever"" as a thank you gift.Thanks, Wolfire games!  ~Ohyoupokedme			",49,4,0,5,1,0,7

One of hardest part is find weak spots with potato graphics also aiming on those flying zappers. I thought one of tapes was porn recordings, kinda. Is it worth it? Indeed.

												I thought about writing a positive review for this game, but then I realized I was going off half-cocked. Now, I'm not exactly gun-shy, but I think I really shot myself in the foot after shelling out 5 dollars for this.Now, let me put a bead on the issue--This game had me chewing the rag for a bit. It didn't exactly feel as if the developers had kept their powder dry.  I fell for the ""gun-lover niche"" lock, stock, and barrel. I actually enjoyed the game for a bit--but then I realized the experience was just a flash in the pan. The game wasn't exactly loaded for bear--its arsenal wasn't the most varied. I'm not just shooting blanks here--there are only 3 guns in this game that absolutely focuses on firearm-realism. I know the developers made this in 7 days, but it feels like they went off on a hair-trigger.TL;DR meme game get it on sale for 3.99 or less.			",139,17,0,7,5,0,0

												""Why don't you review a game?"" Said nobody ever. Reciever takes weapon handeling to a whole new level. The game has a fine art on making you learn how to use a gun from scratch. No PRESS X TO RELOAD title that gets shoved up your eyes, just learn by trial and error which is a nice change of pace. The idea seems cool and I wish they did that in more games. I only wish there was a bit more content in the game but it was made in only seven days so in my books thats an impressive feat. Give me a level editor in a game and in seven days and I can show you why you wasted your time on me. My level would be a mess of red barrels and AI that just stand in their place doing nothing.Overall Reciever gets a 6.5/10 A decent idea and fun to dabble around in for a small while. Just don't get your hopes up for Battlefield 5: No Glitch Edition.			",199,62,1,29,20,1,29

												>You need to have used this product for at least 5 minutes before posting a review for itThis is how bad this game is. The sentries hitbox doesn't seem to get hit after multiple shots taken to the body, the movement and view control doesn't feel fluid at all. While the gun control is pretty neat, the rest is garbage; no detail, poorly chosen textures and the map layout is very basic.No wonder they put it out for free at some point.			",118,20,0,7,3,1,4

Posted: June 9, 2014
												This is a brilliant game, I have to say. It only has three guns, and it only has two types of enemies, and it isn't full random generation (Like games such as Starbound), more on that later. However, the game is so much fine. If you think you can come into this and hit R to reload and see your ammo in the bottomright corner, then NO. This game is much more than that. You have to move every individual piece of the gun by either holding or tapping a button, and if you get ONE thing wrong, by the time you go around a corner and attempt to fire the gun and you realise a drone is flying towards you with its taser on the ready, you're basically dead unless you're me.The game features permanent death. If you die, that's it, all of it is erased, but if you get hit by something ONCE, and that includes your own rebounded bullets (Or bullets you accidentally shot yourself in the foot with), you die. The game generates the world via procedural generation. It basically takes a load of giant buildings, adds some custom things to that giant building (Bullets, enemies, etc.) and then connects it to another giant building. All of the giant buildings have three floors. The game then spawns you in with a random weapon, a random amount of magazines, a random amount of loose ammunition, a random amount of ammunition in magazines, and a random state of your weapon, also it decides whether or not you will spawn with a flashlight and decides whether or not there is an enemy looking at you just as you spawn in to challenge you. You then tuck into a corner and get your weapon all ready. If you find yourself ejecting live rounds out of the side of the gun and then pulling the magazine out of the gun and dropping it off a building or similar, you should press the ? key to bring up a context-sensitive help menu. What this means is that it will show all the things you can do, however things recommended to get your weapon into recommended operation (As in, full auto off, ready to fire, safety off etc.) will be coloured white, and things not recommended will be a dull grey.The enemies in the game consist of only two types. There are actually four types, however two of them were cut for time restriction reasons (Or I assume), as this game was made in a 7 day FPS challenge. The two enemies in the game are the immobile machinegun turrets, which will now be called turrets, which spin around slowly with a blue light on them, and when they see you, the blue light turns yellow, it makes a beeping sound, it tracks you, and very shortly after the light turns red (to indicate ""THREAT DETECTED"") and then it opens fire. You have to either sneak past it or kill it if you want to advance in that direction most of the time, and the way you kill it is not just ""fire until it has no more HP"", you actually have to aim and shoot at something and if you shoot, for example, the camera, it will not be able to track you, or shoot at the magazine and it will not be able to chamber any more rounds, but that still means it can still fire one bullet, and I've heard that it tends to trick you, as in hold fire for a few moments to indicate you probably shot out the firing control, and then fire that one bullet straight into you, though no confirmation. There is a small chance for you to be able to hit a nonvital area on an enemy and shut it down, however most of the time absolutely NOTHING will occur when you do this.There is also these shock drones, which most of the community tends to call them taser bots, or just drones (However don't get into that habit - there is another type of drone that isn't in the game but may be in the game sometime in the future), however I will just be calling them shock drones from now on. They fly around, they find you, they then have the same lights on them as the turret, but then they engage, they rush at you, they try to taser you. These are flying death if you don't deal with them shortly after they spot you, they will even hide above or to the side of doorways and wait for you to come out so it has a tactical advantage, they are VERY intelligent but they have no fear of you, keep that in mind.The two unreleased types of enemies are: The mobile turret, which is basically a turret on wheels, it looks like it'd go quite slowly and would obviously have the inability to go up stairs, but it'd be terrifying. The other type is a drone with (what I assume is) a gun on it, which would be one of the most deadly enemies to ever exist if I think I know how they'd work, however they probably wouldn't fire nearly as fast as an immobile turret (Nor would the mobile turret) or be as accurate, the turrets are deadly accurate and will one shot kill you if you aren't moving, and even if you are moving and not running they still have a high chance of shooting you in one shot.I've told you alot of the game mechanics, you should get a basic idea of it, however I haven't told you about the story or the objective.The objective of the game relates to the story, therefor I have to give you a basic understanding of the story for you to fully understand the objective. I will try not to go into detail at all, the story will probably be much more advanced than I describe. Here we go: The story is basically an unknown force called ""the threat"" wants to neutralise humanity because of their ability to gain an ""awake"" status. There are two realities. Reality B (which is basically actual life) and reality A (Which is basically dreaming). An ""awake"" status is where you can exist fully in both realities, if so much as a single human achieves an Awake status, they would see beyond the horizon. The threat weakens the resistance to The Mindkill through media. Once they were sufficiently weak, The Threat striked and initiated the Mindkill (I forgot what it actually does, listen to the tapes in the game to figure it all out (I'm not good enough to listen to them all yet!)). The Receivers are able to resist the Mindkill, and as such have to be neutralised specially, so they are placed in this universe (The universe where Receiver takes place). There are supplies aswell as casette tapes around the area (Placed by I don't know! I haven't listened to the tapes in a long time). To achieve an awake status, Receivers must listen to the tapes repeatedly. The maximum amount of tapes required to achieve an Awake status is around 100, however the minimum is 11. There are 11 tapes. One of them is a Cleartape, which, to most people has nothing on it, however if you are close to the Awake status, you will hear things on it.To stop the Receivers from reaching the Awake status, the Threat ""Dreams"" killdrones (the enemies) to the Receivers' location, which then activate. Alot of this is not implemented such as the cleartape things or the repeatedly listening to tapes, but it will give you an idea of the storyline. You have to collect the 11 tapes before being killed.The game has mod support, and it has a quite popular mod which adds a firing range aswell as a few new weapons. There is something you should do with this mod to get you started, it's an exercise I created: Basically, you go to the firing range, activate the weapon selection, and then choose the first weapon in the list, and then hold L to reset your game. You then need to put the weapon into full operation order without making a single wrong action, this does not include pressing a button that does nothing, however it includes things like dropping the magazine. You have to repeatedly do this correctly and discharge the weapon a few times without making a single true mistake and as fast as possible, you have to set the amount of times you want to do a weapon, I recommend 3 to start out with, however after a while move it up to 6. If you perform one error, you need to hold L, reset your score, and then try again.Once you get to the limit, you then select the next weapon in the list- I'm out of space.			",127,18,4,7,28,2,11

												Created by a team of 4 in a week for a FPS game design challenge, Receiver revolves around realistic gun mechanics in a (very) randomly generated world. Despite being an FPS game, the gameplay focuses more on actually controlling and preparing your firearm and stealth rather than on modern ""realistic"" cover shooting concepts. Reloading magazines manually,  emptying revolver chambers, and juggling your inventory are actually all very enjoyable, even more so when you manage to learn the controls. The randomization is very strong, starting you off with one of three random handguns, a random amount of ammo, and occasionally a mag light. Room objects, enemies, pickups, and lighting all are randomized, making you want to explore. However, the randomization also causes issues; one game I spawned right next to a taser drone with 3 bullets. Overall, I think this is worth picking up just to experience it, especially with the low asking price.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Fascinating concept for a game. You actually have to manually operate your weapon. The game is procedurally generated with regards to the placement of enemies, ammunition, and the objective collectibles. Your success can depend on what weapons, equipment and however much ammo you start with, all of which are random. You can start with anything from a .44 with a dozen rounds, or a 9mm with three measley bullets. The gunplay is satisfying and tactile, and the game is arranged such that you won't need to do the dozen things involved with operating a gun in a hurry. The pace is slow, and you have as much time as you like to get ready. It's possible to get up a list of keyboard commands on screen to help you know what to press and what does what. In all, a great concept, very well designed. Hopefully we see more like this in the future, with more scenarios perhaps, or some sort of multiplayer deathmatch. Very good price for a couple of hours fun. Definitely pick it up, especially if you catch it on sale.			",128,33,1,27,43,0,51

												Receiver challenges players to traverse a randomly generated landscape of buildings in search of 11 cassette tapes.  This is no simple task, with flying and stationary turrets primed and ready, permanent death in one bullet, and realistic weapons simulation, death awaits every corner.  You must learn how to manipulate every part of a weapon from pulling back the slide, ejecting the mag, and manually refilling cartridges.  What's usually simple, is suddenly a challenge in memory and nerves as you fumble to reload with death at your back.  Welcome to the real world of guns.			",695,197,31,84,68,8,87

												Very interesting game. Moderately difficult gun mechanics. Interesting grim and cyberpunkish ambiance despite it's low-budget nature. Rogue-like, enemies hitting you means instant-death, hence very challenging, I couldn't beat the game yet. Things often go smoothly for some while, where knowing the buttons halfway through is enough to know. More often than not you'll find yourself facing multiple enemies at once - hovering shock drones that hunt you down, and stationary sentry turrets - with only a few bullets left in your magazine, choosing to either fight or run. This can put you under some stress and make you panic. It's where the wheat is probably seperated from the chaff in this game. As it would work in real-life I assume when you not know your gun inside out.			",540,267,8,78,53,4,61

												Interesting? Yes.  Fun? No.  Great idea.  Ultimately poor execution.If it were free, I'd have recommended it. On sale for $1-2, meh-aybe.

The game has an unusual feature that you don't see in most FPS's. There's no push-button reloading. You literally have to do each step manually to load your weapon, be it a 1911, a Glock, or a good old fasioned revolver.

												Receiver is a really interesting simulation game that should be played by alot of people. In reciever you play as gun wielding spy who needs to find 11 tapes so he can find out how to fight wawes of mind tech robots. In the game theres three guns a revolver, and a glock. Theres also two types of enemies A mind tech turret and a mind tech drone. The game is really fun and the gun mechanics really spice up the gameplay. The first time you reaload your gun you feel the biggest satisfaction. Now about the gameplay. The gameplay is really tight and works fluid. But the difficulty  is insanely difficult. You will want to use cheats that were impilmated in the game. Overall a really fun gun game so go ahead and check it out. I give a 8/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

												Fascinating concept for a game. You actually have to manually operate your weapon. The game is procedurally generated with regards to the placement of enemies, ammunition, and the objective collectibles. Your success can depend on what weapons, equipment and however much ammo you start with, all of which are random. You can start with anything from a .44 with a dozen rounds, or a 9mm with three measley bullets. The gunplay is satisfying and tactile, and the game is arranged such that you won't need to do the dozen things involved with operating a gun in a hurry. The pace is slow, and you have as much time as you like to get ready. It's possible to get up a list of keyboard commands on screen to help you know what to press and what does what. In all, a great concept, very well designed. Hopefully we see more like this in the future, with more scenarios perhaps, or some sort of multiplayer deathmatch. Very good price for a couple of hours fun. Definitely pick it up, especially if you catch it on sale.			",128,33,1,27,43,0,51

												I don't remember how much I spent on this game, but if it was even 10 cents, I want my dime back.I'm all for a challenge, I'm all for dungeon diving through hoards of♥♥♥♥♥♥to find random lore that may or may not be important. I actually liked the system they implemented in having realistic magazines and weapon mechanics, but for all that, ♥♥♥♥ THIS game.Your character holds and shoots, whatever weapon you have, in a way that makes Call of Duty sniping, without steadying your scope, look like a good idea. This, being your only real method of survival against the flying enemies pretty much ensures that if there is more than one near you at any given time, you will die. Even if you're keen enough to deduce a way around enemies to get where you want to go, your character takes 6 foot falls like a toddler and you will probably end up dieing due to your apparent brittle bone disease.TLDR: Good ideas, poor execution.2/10			",115,29,0,27,7,1,11

												More of a tech demo than a game. But the basic gameplay elements, controls, are rarely if never before seen. I have not encountered a game that makes you actually manipulate a firearm in the ways this game makes you. You are forced to load a magazine manually, load the mag into the gun, turn the safety off, rack the slide, then you can commence the shooting. Which is unweildy and hard to remember during high stress situations just like with real guns. Its a shame the gameplay is crap and it runs so poorly on my machine. Framerate bogs down for no reason for me and the enemys that fly are often going to kill you out of nowhere. Its all randomly generated, but more often than not those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will be in a ridiculous spot that its either easy to shoot them or you are dead before you could even know you were being attacked.That said these elements need to be taken and put into a survival horror game. Chance the controls for firearm manipulation to the mouse maybe or not, this game needs to be made.But unless you really like to see diffrent games and this ""game"" is on sale than don't buy it. Its not worth the price they have asked for it because its very very basic to the point of being a demo of gameplay for a much larger game. A larger game that dousn't exist.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												I guess this game was made for people who like two things: FPS games and pushing random buttons on the keyboard. This game's main mechanic is having a pistol that you literally need to press a different key to do each action with. Unlike conventional FPSs, reloading is not simply pressing the ""R"" key, there's a full sequence. I will give the creator of the game the benefit of the doubt and say they were trying to go for interesting mechanics, but all they really succeeded in was creating a frustrating game that's pretty much just annoying to play.The game is essentially rogue-like, so even if you end up progressing in the strange plot at all, one small misstep, and you (which I assume is made of paper mache) die and need to restart immediately. Interesting concept, terrible execution. Honestly, I'm not sure if there is a way to execute said concept WELL, but as it stands, I cannot really say much in favor of this game. Maybe if the devs actually spend more than a week on this game and actually polished it, I could recommend it (Not even making this up, the game was made in a week). But it's buggy. It's basic. The core gimmick mechanic is annoying at best. I got it for free and would not say that anyone should buy this game.			",120,13,5,12,14,1,7

												Never played such a fun fps like this before.What makes it fun unlike other shooting games is that it shows realism in the gun, and you have to use the gun manualy, and properly.This game will force you to understand your gun, and how to use it properly and realisticly.One thing I love about fps's such as these is that the developers are open to new and experimental idea's, such as this game, I encourage more people to make games like this.This is my favourite type of fps games out of all the rest, it has potential and also has a more thrilling adventure to the weapons itself, unlike other fps games now days.I just love having the dismay of worring if my weapon was reloaded correctly, or what condition the weapon mode was under, or especially at the times when my gun was nearly out of bullets and I forgot to check and got myself KIA for it.This game will punish you for any miscalculation or incorrect use of your weapon, and I absolutely adore that!―NOW WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS?―Heck yes, I will most definitely, absolutely, positively recommend this game to all fans of guns, fps and simulation.You wanted a realistic shooter/ simulator, well this game is for you!

												I was exploring it for more than 10 hours, and I'm sure I've seen all that concept has to offer. I'm calling ""Receiver"" a concept, for I'm sure it is not a game. Really, it's not entertaining for one bit, if you don't look at it like on ""anti-Call-of-Duty"" project.In my line of values one should not ask money from other people to look at the thing like Receiver. So I suggest not to buy it even for 1$.If you are really want to know how different guns are operating, try a game which called World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. It gives much more clear view on the whole shooting thing. And you don't need to collect freaky useless and repetitive tapes.			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												Definite ""or nah"" for this game. You move around a boring empty building with a single gun and 1 clip. The controls suck and aren't intuitive and refilling the clip with bullets picked up aren't explained and there's no control in the help section for it, meaning you get 1 clip. Better controls, and more things to do besides walking around shining a flashlight and seeing 3 robot turrets would have helped. It is cool they are putting more focus on actually operating a gun, but more time could have been taken to optimize it and improve the controls and make it easier, more fun, and fluid. They just chose to make it more obtrusive to increase difficulty and learning curve, when not necessary. Theres just nothing to do besides inspect a chamber and load/unload a clip, with only 1 gun. 4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poorly optimized. Confusing controls. Buggy help. Even at the lowest possible graphical settings i was getting 10 fps. i can play tf2 1080p on max settings so why are there issues with this? Perhaps with a source engine port and fixed controls, i could enjoy this one. To be fair, the difficulty needs to be lowered. An infinite amount of loose bullets would be nice, and ""lean"" keys so that i could see a turret and not get shot in the face. Also there is no damage gradient, i.e., you are either dead or not, you are not ""injured"", you are killed.Also, there are no nice touches, like smoke at the end of your gun. Needs some artistic work. It seems it wants to be tf2-esque whenever you look at the enemies up close, but the gun models, tape models, bullet models, all seem to be trying to be too realistic, especially in a game where the main objective is to scavenge 80's Walkman tapes and take out cartoony turrets, all the while trying to scavenge and conserve ammo.The most offensive part is that there is no fov slider. I feel uncomfortable when i have literally 20 things around the map that can one-hit me that I need to seek out, wit the range of vision Helen Keller has when she is wearing a cone collar. And she's not only blind, deaf, and further restricted by the cone collar, but she's also dead.But the controls, oh! the controls. There needs to be a lot of double-binding. i.e.- bind opening and closing the cylinder or attaching/removing the magazine should be the same button. It's not helped by trying to decipher what key does what in the help menu when it is layered on top of itself.If you fixed these things, maybe i would try it out again.Verdict: decide on a artistic style, simplify the controls, optimize optimize optimize, add some features, lower the difficulty, and reconsider some of the existing features.Suggestions: Make a story either of A) an 80's cop fighting crime on the streets ( all of the guns in the game already existed in the time period,) where it stressed the difficulty of actually following procedure and how deadly the fighting was. or B) a brightly colored ultra-difficult stealth game where one must find and collect the walkman tapes or whatever. Might be sci-fi or 80's themed. I don’t know what's best for the game. But here are some pointers in the right direction.BTW, I realize that this was made in a 7 day thing or whatever. I just don’t think it's complete enough for it to be called a game. A hugely expansive, elaborative, and intracite demo/proof of concept, not a game. There just aren't enough mechanics for it to be called a game. Simulator? Loose use of the word, my friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is a very simple game once you realize how to work the guns. The game is basicly shoot two different enemys until you usally die. The gun controlls are actully really easy to understand and there are only three weapons that i found. The game would be better if they put more weapons and enemys in it. The game is defiently not worth anything because of how shallow the game is.			",101,11,2,9,10,1,11

												Receiver is a game that is completely based on one thing: the gun. The gun is both the main character and the antagonist. If you plan on making any kind of progress in the game, you have to learn the basics of handling the pistol that you spawned with.

												Makes a conscious process out of handling a gun in a FPS game rather than the automated process it usually is. This ads a lot of depth to the gameplay. Wish more games had this.The cyberpunk feel to the music and setting is nice.The only thing negative about this game is that it's basically a proof of concept/tech demo. The randomized enemy placement and equipment makes it worthwhile playing the game repeatedly, but it otherwise lacks most things a real game would have (including textures).Still, it's a lot of fun and something everyone interested in FPS genre should try.

												Works horribly. It doesn't work with my keyboard, because you can't reach the advanced help menu or holster your gun to refill your magazine. I'm guessing it's either because of the game or steam itself being designed for American keyboards or just my OS (which I read on a steam discussion is also why I can't even open my key bindings menu to change anything). This means that you're stuck with a capped 1-3 less than half-full magazines, depending on the gun. And to top it all off in general it's janky and slows down everything else I try to do when I tab outIn conclusion, Don't buy if you have Linux or a non-American keyboard			",85,9,0,6,14,0,14

												This can only be loosely described as a game. It does have very unique/complicated firearm simulation and decent graphics. It is certainly an effective demonstration of a game engine, but it is frustrating, repetetive, and riddled with game-breaking bugs and crashes. It is very poorly balanced, lacks any menus and resorts to briefly freezing to load bits of the map instead. Not that it should freeze at all to load the map because it is extremely basic and complete garbage. It is not at all worth the price and should only be bought for under $1.			",62,8,7,1,16,0,1

												you know, I bought this game, beacouse it has a great idea of accually full controll. But a good idea doesn't mean a good game. when I first launched it, all I said was: HOW DO I WHAT? of course you shoot with the left click, but to do as easy things as reloading your gun you MUST learn a 6-7 button combination, witch makes you dead if you have to reload with any enemy around. As for the enemyes there is a turret and a drone. Its easy to deal with the turrets, but if you see a drone... consider yourself dead. There are many guns, but some of them are hardly functional. There are NO skins whatsoever, except for a few dark colors on the enemies. The fact that its a rooftop at night doesn't mean you don't need other colors than grey. After an hour I ended up just turning my flashligt on and off constantly at a wall, just so I can see something else than that one shade of grey. That is IF you have a flashlight. What I  mean is that levels are random each time, and so is your inventory. That goes so far that you can spawn without ANY AMMO, with or without a flashlight, and a game can go on for hours or just five minutes depending on lootdrop, and if you find it or not. Collectables shine and are easy to find most of the times.In conclusion I't simular to the virtual boy, it can cause headache (if you're sanity is easily disturbed hallucination)due to a lack of colors. the game is really instable both with the random generation, and with crashes. Its another game that could have been great, but they just rushed it as a joke. Or if you want to mke a joke of it at least don't ask money for it!			",54,6,0,4,2,1,0

												>>Hey fanboys, can you stop putting thumbs down because I don't like your silly video game? I'm fairly certain most of you giving this a thumbs down have already bought the game /before/ I put this review here.Receiver is an interesting firearms simulator video game but it falls short of it's goals with poor execution. I suppose you get what you pay for. Don't always expect just $5 to get you a good video game.GAMEPLAY: You spawn in a random location with a random pistol with a random amount of ammo. The goal is to find six randomly-placed casette tapes in a randomly-generated map with randomly-placed robot enemies (taser-bots & stationary machine gun turrets). There's ammo randomly placed around the map. You must manipulate every part of your gun with your keyboard. There's no lean feature, so you must expose your entire body in order to get a few shots off at a robot. Considering that you die no matter where you are shot, this becomes extremely problematic. The randomly-generated maps don't fit the gameplay well; you can easily get stuck in odd places thanks to the bizzare level design. Stairs are nightmarish.PRESENTATION: The game is full of plain, blank textures which have no depth whatsoever. Low-detail textures can look good sometimes (see: Unturned) but this game is trying to create a realistic apartment complex. Without the textures, though, every surface looks like plastic. The skybox is low detail and ugly as sin. The sound effects and music are good, but unfortunately, do little to correct the visual sins.STORY: Hardly any story at all. The little story you can get is from the randomly-placed casette tapes. It's just a guy reading from a script in the most boring and monotonous voice thought possible. It sounds like he just got up at 6:30 AM and didn't have his coffee yet.THE VERDICT: You should really shell out some extra money in order to get you a better video game. This game doesn't teach you much about actually fighting since there's no human enemies. You can learn how to work a pistol, but if you're the kind of guy who finds this game interesting, you should already know how to use a gun.			",83,2,0,10,1,0,3

												What a turd. The premise intrigued me from the moment I first read about it on Kotaku, but this game abandons all playability in lieu of its premise. That is to say, I found it unplayable. I've heard some people being quite enamored with its focus on gun mechanics, but I feel this is just an experiment to prove how FPS' should not be done.

												While the game's complex controls are a beauty to learn, leading to a very intense and intricate game, this is really the only good part of the game. The graphics are incredibly flat, enemy weakpoints seem to be hit or miss, the amount of enemies to bullet ratio is ♥♥♥♥ing INSANE, and the story is so pretentious I think it could make a hipster♥♥♥♥♥by proxy. Oh, and EVERYTHING kills you in one hit.Apparently mods make this game better, but if you need mods to make a game good, that's a very bad sign. Would buy at $3 or less.  ",142,33,0,23,20,2,8

												This game is horrible. If you need more information ... this game is VERY horrible. Who knew such a confusing dumb game could get so many good reviews. This is optimized for... lets see                   NO COMPUTERS. This game lags so much that I dont even know how they got that good of a video for this game. NASA computers??? Anyway this game (if it could load anything) has too many controls. I like the idea of a game where you get to do every tiny little thing, but try and find a better way of letting the player control the character. Lag and bad controls, so whats stopping the good things about this game overpower the bad and letting this be a really good game? The thing is... THERE ARE NO GOOD THINGS!!! But wait THERES MORE! Low development speed, no variation of tapes,enemies,or guns, and repetitive maps are all things im not going to elaborate on because, along with lag and controls, these things are HORRIBLE! So please don't just pass this off as ""some stupid wrong review that some little kid wrote just so his stupid game could get the # 36,174,009,583rd spot on the top sellers list on Steam."" This is a horrible game made by the same developer of overgrowth (another horrid game, suprising right?) that cant be worth playing for money none-the-less paying money.PLEASE dont waste your money PLEASE dont make the biggest mistake of your life AND PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS GAME SUPPORT. MOST OF THE GOOD REVIEWS WERE MADE BY THE CREATOR  MAKING DIFFERENT NEW ACCOUNTS! Just leave this page now after clicking the ""Not Ineterested"" button and leaving a not recommended review.

												Great game, great weapon mechanics, great choice of enemies (it would be mindboggling to detail soft tissue damage and bullet hit dynamics in biological enemies). The narrative is creepy, makes me feel like the reason its' so easy to die in this game and the lack of saves is so that you repeatedly have to be brainwashed by the tapes (oohh.. a conspiracy by developers :P). *Shudder*. And Hong Kong background is a bonus, creeps me out even more. Otherwise, it's quite addictive. To be honest I thought we'd have the same weapon mechanics by 2002 in games, but thanks to MS and console crowd its in an indie game in 2013.Also, this is more Dues Ex than anything Eidos threw up in the past decade. And I see hints of Shadow Watch here as well. An exquisite game and if the developers will stay on this path despite the perverted game industry's demands, my entire respect to them. You are on the right path!Такое чувство что разработчики используют эту игру для зоибирования, постоянные записи на кассетах нету сейвов. Вобщем понятно...

												I really wanted to like this game. But in the end, the gun mechanics just dont work that well. Sure, it's cool when you do something right, like grab the magazine with bullets in it, push the hammer forward, put the cylinder back inside the revolver... I think you might see the problem. I ecentually got to the point where I could reload my gun without looking at the help menu but even with the satisfaction that comes with that, the gun mechanics are, in my mind, simply not very good. There are enemy turrets in the game. They are one of the obastacles that you have to deal with, and you deal with them by either shooting a camera attached to them, effectively blinding them or, shooting their battery pack, a brown box at its base, which will completely diable them. Shooting them in the camera is generaly a bad idea, since you must stand directly in front of them in order to do so. However, shooting them in the battery pack is incredibly inconsistent. I put an entire magazine into it to no effect. I eventually killed it, only to discover that almost all of my bullets, including the one that killed it, had landed in the exact same place. Also one bullet kills you and you respawn at the beginning of a completely new randomized map. I actually found turrets to be far easier than tazer drones. Tazer drones have weak spots but they incredibly difficult to hit due to their speed. They do have weaknesses, such as their slow turning or their inability to see you if you just duck behind a corner, and if you keep your distance, than they aren't normally that hard to kill. But when they are charging at you in a hallway, you pretty much just fire as much as you can and pray that you hit something vital.In addition to the random map, it seems that your ammo count is also random. I respawned several times to discover that I had no ammo at all. Once I respawned with a tazer drone facing me.Maybe this appeals to some people but It absolutely does not appeal to me. Even after I tried to learn how to play and was encouraged to try again by other Steam users, I still found no enjoyment in this title.This game is for: Gun nuts, those who enjoy extreme challenge with little payoffThis game is not for: Players looking for a story, fans of standard FPS', casual gamers			",109,6,1,18,2,0,12

												For the experiment in the simulation of real world gun-handling mechanics within a first-person shooter video game, it's interesting.  Can I recommend this as a ""game"" though?  No.  Games are fun, this really isn't.  It doesn't even really try; there's no score-keeping or anything.  While you fumble about  struggling with the aiming, you're shot once and die.  Or you fall 8-10 feet from one floor to the next and die.  Or you spawn without ammo and you die.  You forgot to unlock the safety and you die.  The enemies are more accurate shots, faster, and more agile than you, so you die.  Speaking of the safety - you can toggle the switch for it, but it doesn't clue you to what is on or off.  So, that's awesome, and yes I died because of it.  Then there's the pointlessness of the flashlight, the badly implemented randomization of levels, gun and ammo.  And you die so quickly that any progress you've made in collecting the tapes is gone.  Enemies take multiple shots to take down - you require one to be brought down.  And if they wanted to make it about realistic gun mechanics then why aren't your hands and arms visible during gun manipulation?  Instead you see the oddness of floating objects in your field of view.Ya know, I'm not in the least bothered by the lack of graphical polish, or the lack of variety in enemies, or it's lack of depth overall (outside of the gun-mechanics, I mean), but it could at least have been fun, which it's not.  I'm not convinced it was ever meant to be either, which is fine so long as you don't call it a game.  I know some have talked about how the muscle-memory building aspect of emptying the shells from your gun and reloading without thinking about it is one of the key points of 'Receiver' that people seem to miss.  I get it, I do.  Some people find simulation of tedious actions fun.  And these particular tedious actions would be fun were the game environment and the enemies encountered also depicted with the same level of realism that the gun mechanics are.  Dying from dropping 8 feet is unlikely in real life.  Even being hit by a single bullet isn't going to necessarily stop you or kill you in real life.  And the aiming mechanic is so unwieldy that finding your mark on those flying tazer-drones is a ♥♥♥♥♥.  And the ultimate goal from suffering through all of this is???  Collecting some cassette tapes.  It's 2014.  I don't even own a cassette player.  There is nothing of interest to keep one coming back except the muscle-memory building, for which there is no score-keeping.  I mean, make me Agent 47 with an objective to assassinate an evil dictator or something and I will gladly struggle with the mechanics to get it done.  Give me points for how quickly I manipulate parts of the weapon correctly...  something!Long explanation short:  It's just not fun.			",214,37,6,63,20,0,43

												Horrendous visuals. Disastrous controls. No, disastrous =/= a hard game, it equals a badly designed game. I'm cool with having to go through each step of reloading a weapon, but the controls have to be somewhat intuituve. In this game, buttons will have several different uses. This is not acceptable when you have so many keys in front of you. It feels like this game was meant to be played with a controller, with KB/M lazily tacked on afterwards. But it wasn't, it's just badly designed. They really needed a UX guy on this team. Avoid.			",290,53,9,22,12,2,41

OverviewI picked this game up quite a while ago but just got around to playing it. Overall, I am very very impressed with the game. The mechanics are novel and satisfying, the atmosphere is sufficiently creepy, and the enemies are a very enjoyable fight, and I find myself at the edge of my seat throughout every run. I eagerly recommend the game to anyone seeking an addictive challenge with near infinite replayability.In GeneralThe game starts, thrusting you right in to the thick of things, with nothing but a gun and sometimes a maglite. No tutorial, no nothing. Your goal is to find and listen to 11 cassette tapes without getting shot or tased by the hovering drones or sweeping turrets. Oh, did I mention you die in one shot? Yeah, that brings a whole other level of tension and urgency to every fight. There is no HUD, so you have to either count your shots or check your magazine constantly. Running out of ammo in the middle of trying to shoot down a drone that is divebombing you, tazer buzzing, will certainly spell your doom.ProsRefreshingly complex gun mechanicsAtmosphere fittingly eerie as♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Great little game to waste some time or have a lot of funSatisfying to disable your enemiesEasy to learn, hard to masterConsBare-bones graphicsOnly two enemy types and three gunsYou sometimes will spawn with little to no ammo or enemies right there to kill you before you can reactOften far too dark to navigate, even with the flashlightThoughtsI really like this game. The tapes fittingly play in any order and the guns are very satisfying. In my 4 hours of play, I have not yet beaten the game, and that speaks volumes to the challenge this game holds. The turrets are spooky and can startle you if you aren't ready for them, but easy to take out. The drones are probably the hardest enemy in the game. Very frequently, you'll hear one, step through the doorway and shoot it down, only to have another one that you didn't know about zap you from behind without warning. Luckily they aren't seen terribly often without large spaces to deal with them. The game feels very mazelike, lending to the general sense of unease and being lost and alone. For 7 days of work to create the base game, it is amazing. I only leave it wishing that you could actually see with regularity, as many rooms are so dark that even the flashlight does nothing to help you. Even if this game never sees another major update, I am quite happy to play it as it is now.			",61,11,0,8,7,1,4

												A very creative game. I actually do recommend getting and trying the game if you're interested in games with unique mechanics.What I don't recommend is trying to play this game to an ending in any real shape or form. Because this game is nearly impossible. You are a fragile little muffin, and your primary enemy is a floaty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who's impossible to hit. As well, because the map is randomly generated, you don't get to get a feel for how a map is laid out. Maybe I'm not good enough at shooters, but I personally don't feel that the game is very fair in its execution.Give it a solid half-hour, support devs that try new things. Don't push yourself to complete this game.			",164,41,0,31,9,2,15

												Incredibly enjoyable game, it feels really great once you start to master the gun mechanics. This might be one of the best games I've played in terms of gun realism. It's really cool to unload a gun and actually see each round that is and isn't fired accordingly.  Don't expect this game to be easy, this is hardcore to say the least, you have to shoot turrets in the right spots to disable them and you can only take one bullet of damage. I still haven't completed the game, but I really recommend it as it's very satisfying just to master the guns  My only wish is that the developers either made new updates or a sequel with more guns and more story!

												This game is awesome, I played the heck out of it when I first got it because I was fascinated with the controls and what the game was about. The controls are pretty awesome and intricate and there are a total of 3 guns in the base game (there are mods around that add a few more, although I've never done it) and each gun has its own personality that you learn throughout playing the game for a while. I think this game is really great on its own but there are a few problems. For one the game has poor optimization for pc, which makes sense considering it was made in a day and expanded upon. Second there is quite a lag spike when entering rooms, which could end up killing you a lot. Lastly, the controls are quite hard to get used to, but when they do, the gun becomes second nature. Overall I think this game is amazing and you should give it a shot! If you don't like it after a few hours you can easily refund and get the money back to buy like 2 keys in csgo or tf2. Have fun recieving!			",194,25,4,11,14,3,18

												Reciever is, in my opinion, the closest you will get to the accuracy and tension of operating a real firearm in a video game that I have ever experienced.At the moment Reciever is a little more than a tech demo and a proof of concept, but it's small size belies the fact it does an excellent job of roping you into this tiny world where your profeciency with your weapon is the means to your survival.Having experience with a real semi-automatic pistol is definitely going to be a plus for those playing Reciever for the first time, as the three weapons to spawn with are very accurately modeled in their functionality with only a couple minor gripes.Overall Reciever is a must play in my opinion, and I look forward to the possibility of seeing systems similar to this in future titles.

												Receiver is a game that anyone interested in gaming and the feeling of accomplishment should play.  Regrettably, I think I am now done with it.  This is a game with a steep learning curve and tremendous difficulty, the latter being something I am not particularly fond of in games.  But few games gave me such a strong feeling of accomplishment as when I learned to use the gun and take out enemies successfully.  There are some simple fixes that I think would benefit the game; slowing down the flying enemies which move at unforgiving speeds and having more warning about nearby enemies in general would allow me to have survived countless accidental deaths, which often seemed unfair rather than my own fault.  Protip, play with the options before you get into it, specifically turning on the option to lock the gun to the center of the screen.  All in all I highly recommend the game as a piece of interest, and I only wish that the game was still supported and seeing updates.			",352,158,6,31,24,3,38

												Get this game! I love it! It's only $4.99 and you can have COMPLETE control over the gun there is a button for taking the clip out, cocking the gun, inserting the bullets, and more! And also everytime you die, you don't start the same round over and over, it randomizes the map and obstacle placements upon each death! It's not labeled horror, but it gave me a lot of jumpscares. Not like horror jumpscares just these stupid flying tazer things kept flying up behind me and killed me -_-. I also jump whenever there is a sentry around the corner and it goes, BEEPBEEP right when I turn the corner. It's also very suspenseful. I tried it in a dark room, and I almost pooped my pants because of those stupid flying tazers XD. Oh, and when you shoot a sentry or a flying tazer, you will either shoot out the camera(the thing that it senses you with), or the battery(which,obviously,kills it). So if you shot a flying tazer but it's still flying around like crazy don't panic it can't see you ;) and notice how I've only played it for 40 minutes (as of now) and I'm ALREADY recommending it to you			",39,6,0,0,6,2,1

												Reciever is a beautifully crafted piece of technology. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in sheer replayability and challenge. I can't wait to see where Reciever's mechanics are employed next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This plays more like a design proof-of-concept or a prototype than a game. It's not really a simulation, but most of the gameplay revolves around mastering your firearm.			",721,178,11,58,65,8,79

												Really fun game that takes a different aproach to FPS. Its much more difficult with only a bullet needed to put you down. There is alot of buttons and a steep learning curve, but once you get into it you can understand why. Also with little ammo, finding goodies like tapes, flashlights, and ammo will make your day. No matter how fustrating it seems you just keep coming back. The only gripe i have is the little amount of weapons this game has, but can be easily fixed.			",223,21,0,16,10,3,13

												Whether your looking  for a realistic Indie FPS, a fun and exciting new twist on first-person shooters, or a realistic gun simulator with a classic arcade feel, there is something for everybody in a game that can be fun but rather burdensome oftentimes.The game features realistic gun errors, (i.e jamming, safe reloads, and bullets getting stuck in the cylinder) excellent gun mechanics, and awesome bullet physics. The game while fun, has some major performance issues. I will often be on an important part of the game when suddenly I start to get major lag. This should not be happening on a game like this, as the graphics are not even that good. This takes away from much of the game's fun. When the game is not lagging (something which is a rare commodity) it is extremely fun to play. When you encounter a flying mind tech you feel this true sense of fear for your life as you either fight or run. Shooting and reloading the gun is rather interesting because every single part of the gun is controllable. While this adds uniqueness to the game it slows the pace down considerably and has nothing to help speed it up.The verdict: An exciting and adrenaline pumping experiment that is hindered majorly by its massive performance issues. While the game is fun to play it badly needs to be optimized. If you have beast gaming computer or something ""good enough"" to run most games, then I would definitely recommend picking this up!Overall rating: 6/10Presentation: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 5/10Sound: 8/10Difficulty: 8/10Lasting Appeal: 6.5Overall rating: 6/10			",90,20,2,2,1,1,3

												WAIT! before all of you say im wrong for not recommending this game hear me out. I would recommend this game for people who love a challange and love to learn about the basics on a gun and does this in a very well done and outstanding fashion. But the reason i wouldn't recommend this is because it to hard and the game is just to hard to shoot down the flying drones.			",92,3,0,6,11,1,10

												It ain't pretty. It ain't easy. The story is sufficiently sci-fi and unnecessary. But you gotta give these guys credit for making one of the most engrossing weapon experiences you'll ever have, all as a product of a 7 day challenge. 5 bucks? Give it to the people who need it the most in the gaming industry.Tech demo/proof of concept, whatever you want to call it.

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: Definitely one of the more interesting FPSes I've played. It's easily described as Slender but with guns, and while that's not bad, it does miss what this game is truly about, which is to emulate gun mechanics as accurately as possible. No longer in this game are you able to press the easy reload button. Instead, you have to go through the motions for each and every gun. While that may sound tedious, it's actually pretty fun in execution. Much like Slender, this game does have a very randomized nature to it, which can be both a benefit and a downfall. It's always disappointing being met with three turrets in a row whenever you've only got three bullets in your magazine. This game can be completed relatively quickly (hence the short playtime, but there's another reason for that), but it's still a pretty fun game nonetheless. 7/10.Story: Hey guys, do you like The Matrix? If so, you'll be able to tell ALL of the ""inspirations""! But hey, they did it in a non-linear manner, so that's pretty neat. 6/10.Graphics: The sore spot of this game. The game looks alright for a game that was submitted to a game jam, but HOLY BUTTS IS IT UNDEROPTIMIZED. Apparently the reason for this is because they used an older version of Unity, but even after using the mods (the reason why my playtime is apparently only 50 minutes), the game still ran my GTX 760 through the ringer. This is also apparently because of how the lighting is handled. Plus, there's some pretty obvious and ugly gaps in the level geometry. There's also loading zones here and there that bring the game to a screeching halt so that things can load or something. Either way, the graphics side of this game, even though it was for a game jam, is potentially a deal breaker for some (since they may not be able to run it). 1/5.Music: Well, there is none. The voiceacting is pretty uninterested (presumably one of the devs), but the gun sounds are alright...? I dunno; nothing too remarkable here. 2/5.Overall score is 7/6/1/2; 5.0/10. Again, keep in mind that this game was made in seven days. However, this still doesn't excuse how bad it runs, as it just feels like I paid money for a throwaway project. A decent throwaway project, but a throwaway project nonetheless. It's still fairly fun, though; pick it up when it's like $1 or something.			",509,69,16,41,32,3,65

												This here is a good game. I'll give it that. But it could be...could be so much more. I know it was made in just 7 days, by one man and i give it a thumbs up for both originality and gameplay but if the develepor spent more time on it with updates, then he could sell it for so much more and get so much more money out of it. My laptop isnt exactly the best, I understand that but i run games like Just Cause 2 (with its 400km square map) no dramas but with Reciever i lag so badly its almost unplayable Its crazy XD. And with that bad taste already in my mouth, i start actually moving towards the objective, finding those tapes, but I then i hit the same problem i had with Slender. Aside from the occasional encounter with an enemy i found myself getting bored...but maybe its just me. Maybe im a fast pace FPS loving peasant XD, and i won't deny that this is a good game. Buy it. It really is good. Its just not for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Featuring three disparate and representative handguns, Receiver is a fantastically simple yet involved firearms simulator. Manual controls on the S&W Model 10, the M1911A1 and the G17 are all fully functional and absolutely necessary to operate if you wanna shoot anything. Learning the controls is intuitive and rewarding, and made easier with the key bindings displayed and a little background knowledge of firearms operation. A must-have for any self-respecting gun nut.			",283,58,0,16,17,2,11

Now the fact of the matter is, the game is EPIC in its complexity, the steps required to reload and shoot, simply awesome. The random spawns along with random weapons make the game so much more exciting, and even with minimal opponents, the game still astounds me. For such a short development time, it is great. I would reccommend this game to anyone who is avid about firearms. Even for those who are not avid about firearms, this game is great.			",60,5,0,6,11,0,24

												This game is a truly unique FPS-experience, and I recommend it to everyone who plays FPS, casual or professional. Your ingame-goal is simple, but considering the challenges featured it's actually hard to achieve.Your foes might lack sentience and versatility, but they are a strong opposition. You have an immobile and a highly manouverable type of enemy. Especially latter ones are powerful in numbers, but even immobile foes can kill you. Your reaction-time is short and you need to make the most of a second in many cases. Sure, immobile targets are easy to hit, but if you cannot see them and need to guess where they are by the noise of their machinery, you might end up getting shot.Unlike almost every fps, you have no health-bar and one hit or even a jump from too high obstacles are certain doom.Your arsenal is restricted to the one weapon you start with and a random amount of ammo and magazines (unless of course you start with the revolver). Your aiming and timing are the most important things. Here comes why:You truly need to manage your weapon. In order to load, you need to take out the magazine and reload it manually. In case you have multiple magazines (which is not guaranteed), you can prepare spare-magazines. Still, in a heaty situation like being chased by a flying drone it's still a challenge to just switch magazines. The realistic mechanic of handling a hand-gun is Receiver's crowning-achievement and the stuff that makes this game totally unique and more challenging than the hardest PVP-multiplayer-shooters.For 5 bucks, you get an always new layout of the map, different spawn-spots for drones and ammo, the tapes and flashlights.

Rather than one button for reloading     The has a seperate button for each independent part of the handgun. This drastically changes gamplay and otherwise dull conflicts can REALLY get your adrenaline pumping. One top of that the world is vast, trecherous. If your worried that this game will lose replay value the layout of the map is randomly generated so it's a new expieriance every time. This game goes on sale, go for it.			",108,26,0,11,15,1,8

												Great concept, horrible execution.Receiver is a sort of stealth-exploration game, the objective is to find 11 tapes with info. The game has a set of premade rooms and randomly generate levels by swapping these around as well as spawning enemies and items randomly in it.There's also the fact that it's basically a handgun simulator, being able to do things like manually loading bullets into a mag or pulling down the slide never stops being cool.Now for the bad part, enemies are hard to spot and can kill you in one hit which forces you to start all over again, making progress incredibly frustrating and making the game itself feel like it's based on pure luck.There's also the fact that if you decide to change the incredibly bad default controls the in-game menu will not reflect these changes, and of course there's no way to reset them to the default values, and reinstalling the game and deleting the root folder didn't reset them either, so good luck with that.Im left with a game whose controls I cannot figure out, and where Im often left unarmed fighting tiny fliying enemies that are super fast and can kill me instantly, fun!

This is not because my machine doesn't meet the requirements for running it - there are many other people with the same issues. There is no option, on Linux, to change the resolution or graphic settings. Instead, you are given a small window to play in, which combined with the frequent framerate problems resulted in a less than enjoyable experience for me.  These problems, or so I have read, may be because the game uses the Unity engine.At $4.95 it is relatively inexpensive, but still I regret not purchasing another game instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the only game that simulates detailed reloading at least three types of pistol / revolver guns. That alone makes it very unique.The game is primarily a mixture of pistol-reload simulator, stealth game, tactical room clearing, and a tiny bit of exploration. The goal is to complete the exploration mission while clearing rooms of bots. The bots are somewhat frustrating, especially those bots that fly and zap you with lethal tasers. Thankfully some of the bots aren't mobile...yet.It is mostly polished game that feels a tiny bit unfinished, but acceptable for $1 to $5. The coding could definitely use a little bit more optimization as it tends to lag, which makes the game excessively challenging to survive. The level design is slightly repetitive but has an interesting architechural design, although it appears to take place in an urban skycraper. The level design makes good use of atmospheric lighting to create a sense of direness. Also note: you may need to seek out the cheat codes to get full use out of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A cheap, and somewhat simple game( atleast the objective is simple.) Receiver follows the formula of games such as Slender, were as you walk around a map hunting for objects, in this case cassette tapes. But thats were the similarities end. You are not a lonely wanderer being preyed upon by a menacing monster. You are armed and on the hunt. This game pays close attention to detail with the 3 handguns currently available(1911, Glock 18, and S&W Model 10.) The player controls every lever on the gun and must manually eject the magazine, load it, replace it, and then place a round in the chamber. Or in the case of the revolver, eject the cylinder, eject the spent rounds, replace them, and close the cylinder. At first this is complicated because there is a plethra of buttons to use but after a while it turns into the simple combination of E,~,Z,~,and then T/R and in a short time you won't even have to use the guide. This along with a one hit death makes for difficult experience. My main issue with the game is the lack of options. As stated before there are only 3 handguns in 3 different calibres, One map, and 2 enemies(a flying drone with a taser and a sentry turret.) Mainly this is because it was the product of the 7-Day FPS challenge and was created in only 7 days. But i hope that with the source code open that eventually this game will gain a little bit of popularity and with that, mods. All in all, the game retails at $5.00 so you're not risking much.

												The mechanics are very cool, just the ability to manipulate every aspect of your firearm is cool enough in and of itself. Once you get the hang of it and can start filling mags, loading them and get shooting-ready without thinking about it you start feeling like a serious badass, and a lot of that is just figuring out how to get your weapon to work.That said this game is very, very, very difficult. If you really don't understand all the little aspects of your 'mission' you're in trouble from the start, you'll probably end up dying a lot even after you figure out how to go about things.The 'story' for this game feels more like a few base concepts. It is totally non-linear or 'structureless,' but how much actual impact it has on the game itself is questionable at best. Yes it's the 'goal' but beyond being an item to collect it seems fairly secondary. It has to be vague enough not to have a start or an end or to be collected in any order, so there isn't much really happening there. It's experimental, certainly, and a little eerie in certain ways, but that's about it, it's as open ended as the level composition and I'm not sure that it really succeeds at much of anything other than reinforcing a general atmosphere of uncertainty. That said it's not 'bad,' it just seems a little tacked on.Either way, if it's cheap I reccomend giving this a shot, rather literally. While I don't think this game by itself is a one hundred percent ten out of ten game of the year I do appreciate what it's trying to do and think that more games like this, innovating in even simple ways with mechanics that are generally pretty staid (lookin' at you FPS' in general), are more than welcome.

												Huh. Really very cool. So this is an FPS, but with a little twist. Basically the core mechaninc behind this game is reloading your gun. You don't just have ""reoald"" bound to ""R"". You have to remove the clip, fill it back up with rounds and re-insert it. Make sure you have the safety off, then pull the slide back to put a round in the chamber. Unless you've got a revolver, then the process is a bit different.Very interesting way of making the player feel more involved in the game.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												Surprisingly fun.  Once you learn the keys for what operates the pistol, it can be fun with the insta/perma death and random worlds.  They focused everything on the pistols, not world textures any of that jazz, but if you already know how to work pistols irl, it's easy to pick up.  Definately worth <$2, maybe worth the full $5.

												Fantastic game considering it was built in 7 days and goes on sale for $1-3 on occasion.  While some find this game boring or hard, I find it addictive because I have yet to find all the tape and the game actually presents a challenge.  It breaks mussle memory on how to use a gun by teaching you how a gun actually works and binding every little thing to a key.  Its definitely rewarding to quickly reload off of memory as a tazer robot comes zipping right at you and you shoot it down.  Then you turn around and another and zapps you  in the face..... Its very addictive because you know you are capable of beating the game as its simple and straight forward.... after you get the keys down, but the game progressively gets harder (a feature I was surprised got impolemented in a 7 day game). Personal best is roughly around 7 of 11 tapes.I look forward to when Wolfire Games finishes Overgrowth and starts work on this game.  It definitely has a great foundation and idea to start off of.  Worth the couple dollars even to learn how to use a gun without touching an actual one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never write reviews for games, but this one deserves it. One thing first:If you like standard FPS controls, hit ESC in-game, and check the box that says ""lock gun to center of screen""; this will get rid of the annoying 'swivel aim' when you bring up the iron sights. Once I did this, I had an easier time of dealing with enemies.Onto the game:It may have strange graphics, but this game is amazing. It's brutally difficult, and when you panic you screw up firing your gun. I'm very familiar with firearms, but I initially kept forgetting to rack the slide in the 1911 or Glock if I spawned with a magazine in. The 1911 can get you when you forget to♥♥♥♥♥♥the hammer, too. It's really amazing how in-depth the weapon controls are. Being able to load a magazine, chamber a round, unload that mag, and load a fresh one is awesome; not many games let you +1 a gun. Being able to freely spin the revolver's cylinder is also very fun. I had some good times just playing Russian Roulette with glass panes. I have only played an hour of this game so far, and I haven't gotten very far, or even really figured out what I'm supposed to be doing, but the gun mechanics are keeping me intently occupied.

												Seriously, this game is  awesome. Easily worth $5, just for the new experience.This NEEDS to be made into a full on game, big♥♥♥♥♥team, writers, the whole shebang. It feels like Bohemia Interactive could be a good fit, with their Arma series and being into the whole realism aspect. This mechanic in a milsim undoubtedly give the hardcore Arma community a big hard-on. I have one now.I love the no save point/respawning, definitely adds to the experience. The UAVs with the tasers on them are terrifying when they sneak up on you, and the game has a great atmosphere, despite being a little bit simple.Movement is a little clunky; I do like that they did something new with running by having you spam the W button instead of just passively holding shift. Makes it feel more involved and I've gotten more immersed in the game because of it, but sometimes you'll clip a bit into a wall or get stuck on the top stair of a staircase and it totally takes me out of it. Overall, great game, definitely give it a swing.			",76,6,0,11,5,0,4

												Receiver's fun. You run around shooting these sneaky little robots. The twist is that the gun that you weild is painfully realistic. Quite a few firearm mechanics come into play in this game. For someone like me who has shot guns quite a bit(FAR from an expert with guns though), I picked up on it pretty quick. For someone with less knowledge about firearms, these mechanics may take awhile to learn and might be frustrating. But that's the game really. It's less about the robots and more about you maneuvering this machine you're shooting them with. You have to remember all the steps of reloading in order and have to be able to do it fast. The game looks nice. It's going for a minimalistic style which it achieves nicely(at least to my eyes).However, it's HORRIBLY optimized. You've probably heard this from the bad reviews, and what they say is true. For how it looks and how much is going on, this game should not run my graphics card hotter than Battlefeild at a lower frame rate. As long as you have a decent system that can run this, you'll be fine, but it's still rediculous none the less. There's also problems with the map spawning to. I sometimes find myself getting stuck in certain areas and have to restart because there's no place to go. With all it's problems, it's still amazingly fun. Don't let all of this deter you. If you have $5, go for it. It's a few hours entertainment for less than the cost of a movie ticket.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The good -Realistic gun mechanics that show how simplified guns really are in most video games -Pseudo-random world generation makes for a different game every time -Extremely intense gameplay, due to permadeath -Enemy drones malfunction based on where you shoot them. (example, shoot the battery and the drone stops rotating, or shoot the tazer and a drone will follow you around but can't hurt you) This can make for some interesting situations. -Overall an extremely challengeing game, still haven't gotten more then 5 tapes. The bad -Very poorly optimized. My computer gets pretty hot. -Quite a few bugs, my flashlight never works anymore, some stairs you cant climb without jumping. -Visually unappealing, simple shapes and no texturing.  -Despite random level generation, the game doesn't have much replayability. You'll probably see all the rooms within half an hour.  -Only two different types of enemies.  -Sometimes you will respawn with little to no ammo, and have to die and restart.Some general opinions If you are looking for any of these types of games you shouldn't buy receiver. -You are looking for a game with replayability -You are looking for a game with decent graphics. -You are looking for a cakewalk of a game (easy).If you can get over these things then I say go for it. Me personally though, I kinda wish I had my $5 back (but now that I have it I'll try to beat it).			",89,17,4,17,12,2,14

												This game is a truly unique FPS-experience, and I recommend it to everyone who plays FPS, casual or professional. Your ingame-goal is simple, but considering the challenges featured it's actually hard to achieve.Your foes might lack sentience and versatility, but they are a strong opposition. You have an immobile and a highly manouverable type of enemy. Especially latter ones are powerful in numbers, but even immobile foes can kill you. Your reaction-time is short and you need to make the most of a second in many cases. Sure, immobile targets are easy to hit, but if you cannot see them and need to guess where they are by the noise of their machinery, you might end up getting shot.Unlike almost every fps, you have no health-bar and one hit or even a jump from too high obstacles are certain doom.Your arsenal is restricted to the one weapon you start with and a random amount of ammo and magazines (unless of course you start with the revolver). Your aiming and timing are the most important things. Here comes why:You truly need to manage your weapon. In order to load, you need to take out the magazine and reload it manually. In case you have multiple magazines (which is not guaranteed), you can prepare spare-magazines. Still, in a heaty situation like being chased by a flying drone it's still a challenge to just switch magazines. The realistic mechanic of handling a hand-gun is Receiver's crowning-achievement and the stuff that makes this game totally unique and more challenging than the hardest PVP-multiplayer-shooters.For 5 bucks, you get an always new layout of the map, different spawn-spots for drones and ammo, the tapes and flashlights.

												Receiver is a fun little game but can I recommend it? Hard to say since I got it for free. The game is very simplistic with the main attraction being the advanced gun mechanics, which is a neat little thing that I don't think has been done in a game before. However, that is pretty much all this game is sadly. The graphics are very simple, if not even extremely simple with untextured geometry and a simple 2D backdrop. I know this game was made in about a week or so, but that does not make it immune to criticism. There are two enemies that you fight, one is a stationary machinegun turret that is rotating and the other is a mini UAV sort of thing rthat flies at you with a tazer. Both of these have weakspots such as sensors and batteries that can be shot at to disable the robot instantly. The turret in not really much of a threat, but the UAV is a big threat because it is quick, small and actually moves. But that is all there is to this game, besides the games goal to survive and collect 11 tapes to win the game. So like I said before, the main part of Receiver is of course the guns. And they feel fun and authentic (no personal experience in real life) to operate. There are three weapons in the base game M1911, G18 and a revolver. The M1911 is the most detailed of the three with all components animated, the glock and revolver are fun to use as well but feel a slight bit unfinished sort of.So can I recommend it? Well, not really since it quickly gets boring, but for a while it is a fun game with the unique gun mechanics that can't carry the game alone. Some kind of duel multiplayer would be fun though.

												This Game is very strange. However I figured it out pretty quickly the only problem that I faced was the amount of ammunition you have. This means that there is a suprising amount of strategic depth within the game. You can't just find a drone and shoot the living crap out of it; you need to wait for the correct time and shoot the drones when you know that you are going to hit them. This game is interesting but takes a short while to get used to.... or you could just cheat.			",121,18,1,32,3,3,23

												Great concept, horrible execution.Receiver is a sort of stealth-exploration game, the objective is to find 11 tapes with info. The game has a set of premade rooms and randomly generate levels by swapping these around as well as spawning enemies and items randomly in it.There's also the fact that it's basically a handgun simulator, being able to do things like manually loading bullets into a mag or pulling down the slide never stops being cool.Now for the bad part, enemies are hard to spot and can kill you in one hit which forces you to start all over again, making progress incredibly frustrating and making the game itself feel like it's based on pure luck.There's also the fact that if you decide to change the incredibly bad default controls the in-game menu will not reflect these changes, and of course there's no way to reset them to the default values, and reinstalling the game and deleting the root folder didn't reset them either, so good luck with that.Im left with a game whose controls I cannot figure out, and where Im often left unarmed fighting tiny fliying enemies that are super fast and can kill me instantly, fun!

												I'm going to say it now, if you don't enjoy difficult games, don't buy it, if you get angry easily, don't buy it.For those of you who don't get mad easily and love playing difficult games, I recommend it very much, it's fun, challenging, a great way to teach you about the process of operating the 3 handguns it provides you with. The key to doing great in this game is being quick and knowing what button does what at the right moment, does it sound easy? No? Because it isn't supposed to be easy. Like I said, if you like challenging games, I recommend this game very much, if you don't like a challenge, then go do a 4 piece Jigsaw Puzzle.			",233,40,7,26,38,0,18

												A pretty awesome game that really cathes the deeper parts of a gun. The reloading prcedure is not an easy task for the new player but the detail of the gun (not graphically) is nothing i've ever seen before. Some more guns, new maps and maybe some new game mechanics/physics would carry the game even further but with the ""little"" it gives you it's really cool as it is for now.			",81,8,3,6,5,2,0

												$5 tech demo. Don't waste your money. I was running this at 720 resolution on ""fastest"" graphics settings and still had a horrible frame rate. It is impossible to aim. The mechanics behind the gun-play, and the randomized layout of the rooms is interesting. It's just too bad that this isn't a game. I didn't bother with the ""non-linear"" story telling aspect due to the voice of the recordings sounding like a mush-mouthed♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",107,18,0,21,15,0,49

												An interesting little game, randomized rooms and a simple goal make for a very replayable game, it also has a very unerving atmosphear, and the various ways one needs to manage their gun I find to be strangly imersive. Fairly easy to pick up but nearly imposible to master.			",471,85,10,43,25,3,50

												Reciever is a Sci-Fi Future Randomly Genorated Interactive* Indie Shooter Game made in 7 Days. For a Free(ish) game made in seven days, it is an incredible game! I wanted and expected only to download Overgrowth**, but I also got this unexpected game as well. This unexpected game gave me the best experience I would have ever thought. The game is just a fantastic game and I reccomend it to anyone who likes shooter games and indie games, because this is one of the best.Graphics: 6/10The graphics of this game remind me of the Unity3D Engine. The rating is because, well, the Graphics are based on how good the game looks and although this game does not look incredibly bad, it does look somewhat realistic. When you ""slide"" the gun's ejector, it actually slides back. Great animations as well; the flying shockers (Spinning and twisting) and the turrets (Spinning and finding a target).Controls: 5/10This game just has WAY too many controls. WAAYYY too many. It is really easy to get confused and this can get irritating. The sprinting (tapping W repeatedly) is really irritating as  well, as it aches afterwards and I feel that that could be changed.Mechanics: 10/10The mechanics are great. As I said before, it is an interactive shooter game. You can do pretty much anything. That is all I have to say. You can slide the gun's slide, eject the clip, holster the gun, put the clip back on, aim, fire without aiming, fall through some floors.... okay, maybe a couple bugs, but barely noticeable and non-gamebreaking so far as I can tell.This is all I really have to say about this game, because although it is not a big game with a lot of content, it surely is a game worth playing when you are bored. Overall Rating: 8.2/10			",176,14,0,8,11,0,2

												This game is perfect for playing with friends or even by yourself. The levels, guns, ammo, accessories all randomize so you have a new experience and predicament each time you play the game. One time I had a glock with 3 full magazines another time I started with an empty clip and had to scavenge bullets and use them sparingly to get through the level. This game is borderline masochistic but is rewarding enough to keep you playing. The gun mechanics really make you feel apart of the game and add to the overall suspense of the game.

												This game. Not only is the design extremely immersive, the quality of the game itself is insane. This rouge-like FPS is nothing like you've ever played before. Not only that, ITS ONLY FIVE DOLLARS. The controls are, truth be told, a little daunting at first. But when you finally get the hang of the controls, and you reload a clip seamlessly and quickly for the first time, you feel like such a badass. 10/10.			",202,21,5,15,12,0,6

												This is a really fun game. It's like a horror game, but it's different: The only jumpscares aren't monsters or anything, but just a drone or turret. They only result with you losing your edge and concentration, and keep you on your nerves. It's also a great example of how non aesthetically scary things can be scary.Also, it's a different type of horror completely: existential horror. You don't know if any others of you are alive or not, but you have to find tapes and listen to them just to get more and more aware of the scenario.It's weird and fun at the same time, and really makes you feel good after you're doing good, because you know how to check an area and keep cool in the face of surprise. Also hyper realistic gun mechanics gives you some real world experience.Could use some polishing, but that doesn't mean it's not a gem.			",33,0,1,2,4,2,0

												I'm going to say it now, if you don't enjoy difficult games, don't buy it, if you get angry easily, don't buy it.For those of you who don't get mad easily and love playing difficult games, I recommend it very much, it's fun, challenging, a great way to teach you about the process of operating the 3 handguns it provides you with. The key to doing great in this game is being quick and knowing what button does what at the right moment, does it sound easy? No? Because it isn't supposed to be easy. Like I said, if you like challenging games, I recommend this game very much, if you don't like a challenge, then go do a 4 piece Jigsaw Puzzle.			",233,40,7,26,38,0,18

												Great concept, horrible execution.Receiver is a sort of stealth-exploration game, the objective is to find 11 tapes with info. The game has a set of premade rooms and randomly generate levels by swapping these around as well as spawning enemies and items randomly in it.There's also the fact that it's basically a handgun simulator, being able to do things like manually loading bullets into a mag or pulling down the slide never stops being cool.Now for the bad part, enemies are hard to spot and can kill you in one hit which forces you to start all over again, making progress incredibly frustrating and making the game itself feel like it's based on pure luck.There's also the fact that if you decide to change the incredibly bad default controls the in-game menu will not reflect these changes, and of course there's no way to reset them to the default values, and reinstalling the game and deleting the root folder didn't reset them either, so good luck with that.Im left with a game whose controls I cannot figure out, and where Im often left unarmed fighting tiny fliying enemies that are super fast and can kill me instantly, fun!

												I gotta say, this game is pretty terrible. The concept is interesting but the physics are unrefined. It's virtually impossible to actually aim your gun and while I get what they were going for the randomized drop locations they don't really add much to the game. Overall, the game is extremely awkward to play. I only have it because I had bought Overkill (another unfinished game with a good concept but no follow-through), and I have to advise don't waste your 5 bucks on this. Wolfire has good ideas but they seem to jump from one to the other without ever putting out a completed game. Please finish one game at least to the point of playability before you start (and charge for) another.			",68,4,0,4,1,0,1

Very, very, very, nigh unnecessarily complex game mechanic and exceedingly lethal enemies combined with your rather disorienting disembodied firearm hovering in your field of vision as you move.  Lighting is very dim in most places.  Nothing is taken for granted.  You start with an unloaded gun, forcing you to load it in order to become familiar with the game.  Great concept.

												The idea of the game is good and so is the handling of the guns. I really liked that the gun can get stuck and you have to manually do all the stuff to reload your weapon. Also the each time randomized setting is pretty good.The music is ok if you play it for half an hour. After that it repeats itself too often and you probably get annoyed.Another point of critique has to be the glitches. As long as your dont use stairs, and dont crouch too often, the game runes prettymuch bugfree.. but dont mess with edges of staircases or fool around with the jump-button if you crouch under somthing ;)Sometimes you can free yourself, if just trapped, sometimes you die instantly, sometimes you have to reset.Overall i think its a pretty neat game. Wont catch you for a Weekend, but its nice to play around for a few hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Completely unplayable, the lack of proper optimization causes major lag and prevents me from playing the game as I should.  Which is quite a shame because the idea itself seemed promising. There are ways to mod the game and get it working and there's even a guide to get better FPS but it seems very risky to the point it isn't even worth it. But the fact is that the game should work the moment I start it up. I shouldn't have to go through this much aggravation just to get the game to run smoothly. Again, due to♥♥♥♥♥♥poor optimization.  So until the developers decide to clean it up, Receiver  gets an F- on my grading scale due to lack of playablity on the game's part.  Do NOT buy this game unless you really are a gambling person or have a lot of patience to toy around with user solutions that may or may not work. If the developers clean it up and it works better, I may change my verdict.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Skipping introductionWhats Zy's rating?5/10 Heres why.For starters, I am a linux user, ITS SO HORRIBLY BROKEN on linux. but thats not why its rated at where it is.For those whom like graphics..even maxed out (or at least on my 7640G) It was not very visually pleasing. It has the same graphics engine as that SLENDERMAN game, so expect that, only on low settings.-Also I dunno if its optimized at all for AMD graphics, seemed to have pretty poor performance on Catalyst 14.4 and 14.7Like Slenderman, this game tosses you into a random complex with different items each time you start. Not saying I particularly like that, but it does make you work for it.You will die instantly if you do not disarm traps.You will survive, but things get harder as you collect the tapes.I cannot call this game a horror game or anything of that nature, at least not yet.It is not really worth the time looking into as Slender was free and this seems to be a modded, non-horror port of the game or something of that nature.Its something to kill time but honestly It does not give me any value to be a time killer, even causal gamers might overlook it.Oh, and its also hard beginning off, You get random items, sometimes weapons with no ammo, and such, so yeah, its all about survival but then again Far Cry 3 seems to be better at that.-Lastly YES i did not spend much time on this game, i ended up youtubing half of it because I couldnt get it working for the most part.

												Glad I got this for free. Real glad.Graphics: A55 or XIII level of blocky. But since it doesnt affect gameplay except in the really DARK areas I use to call BLACK HOLES where the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ light gets swallowed and never ever reflects of anything even when you are coliding with the friggin wall.Performance: Unity engine, nuff said.Sound: Can be configured as you please. The first play I didn't hear any music. After I found a tape it suddenly started up. Turned that stuff down to 10% and all was dandy. The bleep sound of tracking turrets and drones is very important. So turn the rest way down and hide while listening to the tapes.Controls: nice concept around sprinting, handling different guns and equipment as well as the jumping. Double tap forward + jump = real jump. Had a few problems getting those flying a$$holes downed but then saw an option of centering the gun on screen. Felt gud.Overall gameplay is based around the randomness of each playtrough and the gun handling. Can't just spray the saucers with yo' gangsta Glock. Except when having 3 full mags ♥♥♥♥♥♥!Finished one playtrough and don't feel the need to come back. Seems a bit overboarding with all that Guru $h!t going on.8/10 for the refreshing concept and addictiveness for first timers.5/10 come back valueVerdict: Just played it trough again. Didn't get as old as excpected. I actually steamrolled all the obstacles and climbed atop the second tallest rooftop even with the puny jump. So yeah. The progressive level design and randomness of ammo spawns is actually cool. Had so much ammo endgame I could backtrack forever and blast away any drone, alarmed or not. Would play again with stronger PC. I like randomly generated games more than I thought.Hear me on this: Five nights at Freddy's merged with this one (who is frightened by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ turrets and flying donuts=/) I WOULD KICKSTART THIS ONE IN A HEARTBEAT!

												This game is an FPS. That deserves more praise for its work.What's so great about this ""Call of Duty ripoff""?For an FPS, the game doesn't focus on shooting. Not at all.It focuses on taking your time. And focuses on being as technical as possible with its reloading system.Lets make an example right here.To reload a revolver. Button 1 to show cylinderButton 2, 2-3 times to empty the cylinderButton 3 about 6 times to put in each individual bullet.Button 4 to close cylinder.With a pistol.Button 1 to take out clip.Button 2 to put away gun.Spam button 3 to put in each individual bullet into clip.Button 2 to take out gun again.Button 4 to put in clip.Button 5 to♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun, and put the bullet in place, ready to fire. (If needed.)Put that in a situation where you are in need of reloading, and conserving ammo. Then you have Reciever.This is a good thing, for it introduces a new type of strategy to your combat, and how you play the game. Unlike Run-And-Gun Simulator.The story is very..Interesting. I am not going to spoil it for you. But its not something to write home about, in my eyes. But its something that is newBut okay, every game has cons to it. What are some in this game?1.)  1-Hit-Kills. I can sort of forgive this aspect. Since the game does explain that you are horribly weak and ill. And you woke up on the top of a building, which layout you cannot recognise.2.) No more than 2 enemies. I don't care if you spam enemy 1 in one place. With some enemy 2 sprinkled on. We have 2 enemies. And that is lazy.3.) I wouldn't say this is a problem with the game. But I'm going to compare SC: Chaos Theory with this subject. Here we go.The lag. The horrible framerate. Its hard to control your guns and your escape with it. It ticks me off to be trying to run away from a flying tazer, and have a horrible FPS while doing so. Now, lets compare it with Chaos Theory. SC:CT looks very AAA Title for an Xbox to PC port. And with these quite stunning graphics, the game runs like butter on a hot pan. Reciever just feels clunky with this. And I've set everything on low. Even windowing the game didn't help.Thats pretty much all the complaints I have on this game, but those complaints still don't ruin the game that much. It is still enjoyable. And a good time-waster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever wondered why firearms aren't pictured in a realistic way in games? This game is here to illustrate that. Instead of pressing R to reload, you go through the entire process of extracting empty shells and inserting bullets, as well as cocking, locking and loading and whatever else guns do, and it's /tedious/, especially with multiple enemies chasing you down.It's not a bad game as such, but it does illustrate how realism isn't always good. If you should buy and/or play it depends on how high your tolerance for fiddly, slow, realistic gunplay is. I wish I could choose ""Maybe"" as a recommendation.			",258,79,6,30,22,2,32

More than worth $5. It is one of the most intense games too. One hit and you have to have a do over ammo is sometimes sparse. Start with the revolver it is the easiest then try the others.

												An intruiging little game. Receiver is a sort of FPS rouge-like game that focuses almost entirely on gun handling mechanics. You start of with one of three weapons (M1911, Six shooter Smith & Wesson model 10 or a glock 17) and are thown into a randomly generated map with nothing other than ammunition, flashlights, audio casets and two types of robots (static turret and flying drones) that are trying to kill you. The objective is to acquire all audio casets (of which there are eleven) without dying. A single shot will kill you and put you back at the begining of a new randomly generated map.The shooting itself is rather subpar but Receiver really shines when it comes to the actual gun handling. If you start with the S&W for example you need to unhinge the cylinder and look to see which bullets have been struck by the hammer. You can then release all the shells from the cylinder and begin inserting new bullets. If you have a cylinder with both un-fired and fired bullets, you can use the mouse wheel to turn the cylinder in order to allign a fresh bullet with the hammer. With the M1911 you can enable and disable the safety, eject and replace magazines, pull back the slider and lock it into place, eject single bullets out from the receiver by continously pulling back the slider and pull back the hammer. The glock 17 is simular to the M1911 but offers a burst fire mode in place of the safety and, true to its real world counterpart, lacks the ability to pull back the hammer as it has an internal firing pin.Overall Receiver feels more like a tech demo than a game, which is to be expected as it was created by Wolfire Games during the 7 Day FPS Challenge. Worth it if you can pick it up for a decent price or for free, which is how I got my copy over on the Humble Bundle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the most fun I've had in a shooter in a while.It take's the simplistic nature of every household FPS and throws it out the window. You don't like magically full magazines? neither does this game. It takes gun functionality and makes it one of the most intuitive challenges you'll face. While the enemy may be limited to mere turrets and drones, the main antagonist in this game is yourself; your muscle memory for gun-handling. Taking out a few turrets is easy, but how easy is it to remember if you fired five shots or six in the heat of the moment?Key aspects I commend are the damage states and hitboxes for enemies. Bullets may ricochet, merely glazing the target, unaffecting it. Others will damage a target, but not disable it. The feel of my blood running cold as I hear a turret lock onto me from behind, only to realize it was one I left disabled, but still haunting me. Will you spend an extra bullet for some peace, or tread on eggshells, jumping at every beep and bump in the night? You cannot risk dying. Unlike most other shooters where they toss every possible means to keep you alive (second winds, medkits, revival, unrealistic health), one mistake - one bullet - and you're done. A game emulating gun mechanics would be less of a thrill if your faulty actions did not lead to the distinct taste of failure. In a real-world situation, you have NO room for mistakes, and Receiver makes sure you understand that. I recommend this to anyone actually looking to own a gun outside of your lovely virtual collection of military surplus. Receiver teaches the minor nuances of gun handling innately through gameplay; a nice way to grasp some gun basics before dealing with a live firearm. Of course, I MUST say it is no substitute for lessons of any sort, merely a glimpse at the responsibility behind gun ownership. Though the game still persists on a ""if it moves, shoot it,"" basis, with so many factors to account for, you really think twice before pulling the trigger.The interface is straightforward and tells you everything you need to know in one place, mid-game. The help menu simply bold fonts actions necessary to ""proceed"" in-game, while keeping itself minimal to teach the willing. No flashing ""Out of Ammo"" mid-screen alerts. I found myself checking that the gun chamber wasn't obstructed during the less hectic parts more and more after an agonizing defeat brought about by my gun jamming.The game is well worth the price, and assuming the plethora of cookie-cut shooters out there have already satisfied your need for instant-action, colorful explosions, and lush visuals, Receiver is a great game for someone who has a little patience and wants to play a more serious game.

												I never write reviews for games, but this one deserves it. One thing first:If you like standard FPS controls, hit ESC in-game, and check the box that says ""lock gun to center of screen""; this will get rid of the annoying 'swivel aim' when you bring up the iron sights. Once I did this, I had an easier time of dealing with enemies.Onto the game:It may have strange graphics, but this game is amazing. It's brutally difficult, and when you panic you screw up firing your gun. I'm very familiar with firearms, but I initially kept forgetting to rack the slide in the 1911 or Glock if I spawned with a magazine in. The 1911 can get you when you forget to♥♥♥♥♥♥the hammer, too. It's really amazing how in-depth the weapon controls are. Being able to load a magazine, chamber a round, unload that mag, and load a fresh one is awesome; not many games let you +1 a gun. Being able to freely spin the revolver's cylinder is also very fun. I had some good times just playing Russian Roulette with glass panes. I have only played an hour of this game so far, and I haven't gotten very far, or even really figured out what I'm supposed to be doing, but the gun mechanics are keeping me intently occupied.

												Seriously, this game is  awesome. Easily worth $5, just for the new experience.This NEEDS to be made into a full on game, big♥♥♥♥♥team, writers, the whole shebang. It feels like Bohemia Interactive could be a good fit, with their Arma series and being into the whole realism aspect. This mechanic in a milsim undoubtedly give the hardcore Arma community a big hard-on. I have one now.I love the no save point/respawning, definitely adds to the experience. The UAVs with the tasers on them are terrifying when they sneak up on you, and the game has a great atmosphere, despite being a little bit simple.Movement is a little clunky; I do like that they did something new with running by having you spam the W button instead of just passively holding shift. Makes it feel more involved and I've gotten more immersed in the game because of it, but sometimes you'll clip a bit into a wall or get stuck on the top stair of a staircase and it totally takes me out of it. Overall, great game, definitely give it a swing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You may play for hours, trying to collect all of the tapes, an extremely hard task, while also very rewarding. It will be hard to get your footing in the beginning and become accustomed to the unique gun controls, and you WILL die, ALOT, but soon you'll get the hang of it, and become a natural.

												Most likely because of the game's experimental creation, Receiver is in practice like two games barely held together.The first, and most prominent, is the gun-simulation. Speaking as someone with little first-hand experience with firearms, it works fairly well in that regard. Just leave the help menu open for a while and you'll end up with a fairly satisfying feeling as you develop muscle memory to check your chamber for a round, check the round count in your magazine, then holster your gun to fill up the magazine with loose rounds you've just picked up. The inventory, however, can get in the way of this by being somewhat awkward in shuffling between multiple magazines--so much that it's easier to reload your current mag than to change to a new one.The second is paranoia-inducing roguelike shooter. The minimalist setting and procedurally-generated environments makes you waver between finding it to be simply cheap and menacingly alien--though some things (like distant objects being drawn incorrectly or poor lighting) push more toward the former. The recordings you are required to collect then listen to over and over to complete the game, straddle the line between boring and immensely creepy (though they're undermined once you get the obvious, mundane point behind all of them). The biggest factor of all, though is your frailty: one hit of automatic turret fire or flying drone dive-bomb kills you and makes you start everything over, no exception. These things work together to make your experience tense, but often ending in frustration due to enemies having very specific hitboxes that make your success at attacking them highly luck-based.The biggest problem of all is that there's almost no connection between the two in terms of gameplay. The biggest practical benefit of adjusting to the guns' respective mechanisms is being able to reload quickly, yet this is basically useless during combat: you die in one hit, ammo is scarce, and enemies react quickly while you're in their site but almost never when you're outside (turrets can't move at all, while drones rarely change room). Combat mostly boils down to popping around the corner to attack one robot, firing a few rounds before it reacts, ducking back around the corner, fumbling around with the weapon as much as you want to refill your magazine, and repeating.Regardless, and whichever game interests you more, it's worth the price to try, especially while it's still on sale.

												The Good.How can I say this.......This game is unlike anything I have ever played before. It's complex but not so much so that only hard core shooter fans will be able to figure it out. It's challenging but not frustrating. Fun but not so fun that it overstays it's welcome. This game could be a movie and I would love it all the more, if it were a book I would read it. There is mystery and intrigue as well as amazing visuals. The game is simple to get the hang of but so much harder to beat (I have yet to accomplish this). The one song off the soundtrack that you will be getting quite familiar with is actually really good.The Bad.The only downside is for some reason there is this stick every time I go through a major door, which leads to me getting tazed or gunned down and sometimes both. It's the only bad thing I can think of really...that's how much I love this game.The Verdict.Buy it, Play it, know it, love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You have you eject casings (be carefuil not to eject your live ammo), spin the chamber, hope you're lined up with a live bullet, fire, eject casings, find ammo, hold your gun up. Enemies are very unforgiving (they pretty much one shot you), so good luck!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a different one in the FPS genre. Instead of the 1 button reload, the reload system requires you to press numerous buttons in a sequence to actually reload it, just like in real-life. With a perma-death system and a eerie atmosphere, this is a great game for killing time and playing something different from the generic FPS genre. It may be hard to get the hang of the first time but with a couple of minutes getting to know your surroundings and your guns, you could even finish the game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. I have gotten so tired of the frivolous way in which most games treat Armed/Gun warfare. COD kids running around concerned with their 360 no scopes, and silly psychopathic lemmings style behavior. This game laughs in the face of that nonsense. It is brutal, it is unforgiving, minimalist yet complex. Few games have inspired me to write a review, fewer still have ever gotten me to post one, as it usually feels like too much hassle, but this game...I wrote a review after only playing it for a relatively short while. I don't know how much replayability most will find in it, but for the price and the intention of expansion, I say throw caution to the wind and learn something for once. If you don't know basic gun operation...in real life, after this you should have a pretty good idea. In my opinion, if for experience alone, this game is worth it. If you think you are some gun toting ace, give this a whirl and see what your made of. This review is written by a real gun owner. I personally appreciated the simulation quality of the gun mechanics. Rating: A+/(9.5/10)/(4.75/5)			",149,9,0,10,2,0,1

												Keep in mind this was a game that was made in 7 days initially before you buy it.That being said, it's not that well optimized. I walk in a room and I have to wait a few seconds for the room to load. I would be happy with this game just preloading and randomizing before starting a new life. So, basically, I would like it to do that thing Minecraft does.The controls are hard to learn at first, but once you get going you'll get the hang of it.The goal is simple: Don't die, get tapes. I have never gotten all the tapes, but they all offer a narrative to the game that keeps your curiosity.The difficulty is strong, yet fair. Every time you mess up it's your fault. Usually.Graphics-wise it's like Bubsy 3D with guns. I'll let that slide because it was made in seven days.Music's pretty nerve-racking.4/5 overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a truly unique FPS-experience, and I recommend it to everyone who plays FPS, casual or professional. Your ingame-goal is simple, but considering the challenges featured it's actually hard to achieve.Your foes might lack sentience and versatility, but they are a strong opposition. You have an immobile and a highly manouverable type of enemy. Especially latter ones are powerful in numbers, but even immobile foes can kill you. Your reaction-time is short and you need to make the most of a second in many cases. Sure, immobile targets are easy to hit, but if you cannot see them and need to guess where they are by the noise of their machinery, you might end up getting shot.Unlike almost every fps, you have no health-bar and one hit or even a jump from too high obstacles are certain doom.Your arsenal is restricted to the one weapon you start with and a random amount of ammo and magazines (unless of course you start with the revolver). Your aiming and timing are the most important things. Here comes why:You truly need to manage your weapon. In order to load, you need to take out the magazine and reload it manually. In case you have multiple magazines (which is not guaranteed), you can prepare spare-magazines. Still, in a heaty situation like being chased by a flying drone it's still a challenge to just switch magazines. The realistic mechanic of handling a hand-gun is Receiver's crowning-achievement and the stuff that makes this game totally unique and more challenging than the hardest PVP-multiplayer-shooters.For 5 bucks, you get an always new layout of the map, different spawn-spots for drones and ammo, the tapes and flashlights.

												The gun mechanics are pretty neat - it is indeed a satisfying feeling to be able to figure out the nuances of the weapon. I don't know anything about guns, but I'd assume they resemble reality decently.Unfortunately, the rest of the game is plagued with problems. The design of the game itself is so poor that the furthest I have ever gone in any of my games is finding 2 of the 11 objective items. Frequently, sentries and drones would be placed in locations where they cannot be disabled without being killed. The random initial gun/ammo state meant that I frequently ran out of ammo at inopportune times, with no reliable hope of finding more. The random chance of finding or starting with a flashlight meant that often, I'd find myself in a pitch-black area with no means of exploring. And in one worst-case scenario, a drone killed me right after I spawned, before I had any opportunity to react at all.Then there's the lag. This game has a horribly severe lag problem. On my laptop, which is capable of running Just Cause 2 on medium-high, this game struggles to run at 800x600 on lowest graphical settings. On my desktop, running it at full 1080p resolution with the lowest graphical settings causes my GPU fan to spin up and create a considerable din. For a game this graphically simple, optimization this bad is simply disappointing.Receiver is good as a novelty and exploration of game mechanics, but as a game itself, is a poorly produced product and not worth your time.

												Receiver is one of the most interesting games that I have ever played. Combining a fascinating and refreshing action dynamic that focuses almost entirely on the operation of a handgun with an impenetrably eerie, dystopian atmosphere and a roguelike 'perma-death' design that breeds addictive, tense gameplay, the creators of Receiver (the same crazy people behind the indie beta gem Overgrowth, or Bunny Karate Simulator to some) made something really unique. The recent addition of flashlights, more variables and areas to the game environment, and (my favorite) two new guns to play with dragged me back to the game yet again after a couple of months, and it's still a blast. This game should be played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FPSFPSというよりは銃のシュミレーションゲームと言った感じ。物理エンジンで自作で銃を作ったり、弄ったりしたりしたことがある人なら雰囲気は分かると思う。探索死にゲー。持ち物やマップ配置はゲームを始めるたびにランダムで決定。持ち越し要素は無い。カセットテープを集めるのがクリアの目的だけど、そのテープを取ると男性(開発者？)のぼそぼそとした天の声が聞こえてくるのが残念。リロードに手順が必要だけどボタンさえ覚えればやることは「マガジンを抜く」→「空のマガジンをイベントリに置く」→「新規のマガジンをイベントリから取り出す」→「マガジンを装填する」→「初弾を薬室へ」の5つだけ。もしくは「スイングアウト」→「イジェクト」→「弾丸を装填」→「スイングイン」の４つだけ。ただ問題なのは初期のボタン配置が非常に面倒な配置になっていること。ゲームエンジンの問題で起動時にしか変更できず、ゲーム中に変更ができないので面倒極まりない。個別にマガジンに弾丸をこめなくてはいけない分、自動式拳銃よりリボルバーの方が装填が早いという現象が起きる。常に弾切れに近い状態での戦闘になるため自動式拳銃の利点がほとんどないのが残念なところ。しかしマガジンに弾丸を手動で入れるのことが出来るゲームは珍しく、このゲームの美点だと思う。銃が好きな人、特に回転式拳銃が好きな人にはおすすめ			",252,22,2,25,5,1,20

												When I first started playing I thought it looked like it was made in a week. And it was! Although the visuals defenitely are not the focus of this game but rather the completely addictive gun mechanics! A game made in a week by geniuses! The intricate gun mechanics coupled with a survival situation that greatly reminds me of slenderman are a good mix and the sinister audiotapes that serve as the games objectives add to the atmosphere. I never extepcted to almost jump out of my seat to this game but I did, repeatedly. As it stands it is a great game that I would recommend. 10/10. But I would also love to see these intricate and realistic gun mechanics applied in maybe a tactical shooter or something along those lines. Add in multiplayer versus and you have a winning competition that might draw a great player base. I know Wolfire are busy with overgrowth right now but maybe in future...

												The gun handling controls are amazing. Pull out magazine, holster gun, load bullets into magazine, unholster gun, insert magazine, pull back slide to chamber first bullet, play game, realize the saftey is on, die. The only way the gun handling controls could be more hilarious is if you dropped all of your spare ammo on the ground if you forget to holster your weapon when loading the magazine. I can only imagine how great this game mechanic would be in counter-strike to those players that reload after each burst. Well worth the sale price to experience this tedium.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've found the near-perfect game to play when I need to punish myself. The premise of this game is pretty simple: survive and find 11 tapes. Pretty bare-bones, kinda like the original Slender game. However, this game spices things up by implementing guns in a very realistic fashion. Pull back the hammer and make sure the safety is off kind of realism. The extremely numerous controls feel rough in that way that Resident Evil's clunky controls actually enhanced some of the horror aspects. There were more than one time I was running in mortal terror desperately trying to figure out how my own gun works. The game is in desperate need of polish, as the level has a few glitches and texture issues, but for $3.99 it's a great time waster, puts some perspective on guns in games, and has that weird sci-fi dystopian backdrop I like. The game will probably be forgettable as soon as I find all 11 tapes in one go-through, but that's not going to happen anytime soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is excellent. The gameplay is one of the most unique and tense things I've played all year. The gun mechanics are obviously the big selling point for this game, and they work quite well. Figuring out how to work the weapons is quite satisfying and within an hour or so I was able to operate each of the weapons without relying on the on-screen help. There are 11 tapes to collect to 'win' but these are scattered around the randomized world and surviving the robots long enough to collect them is not easy. Each death starts you over in a new world with different starting conditions and each of the pistols play differently and require you to adjust your strategy from try to try. It all comes together as you push forward with little or no ammo, dodging behind whatever cover you can find to avoid robots while scrounging for supplies and making sure every shot counts.

												This is a great way to learn the mechanics of a modern firearm. Reloading is much more fun than the standard 'reload button'. Take the magine out, place bullets in the magazine, or get a full magazine, put the magazine in the weapon, chamber a round by releasing the slide. So, in stead of pressing R to reload, you perform the incredibly intuitive  [E], [~], [Z],[Z],[Z],[Z],[Z],[Z],[Z],[~], [Z], [R]. Optionally, Hold [T] and press [R] to check if the round is chambered. Also optionally, [Z], [~], [Z], [~] (now you have an extra bullet, 7 in the magazine, one in the chamber.I was joking about how awkward it might seem at first, but after playing this for a while, it becomes surprisingly easy and fun. And if you ever get stuck, just hold [?] (or actually just [/]), to see what you need to do to get the weapon ready to fire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's kinda neat to mess around with I suppose, but I'd say saying this has a story at all is a bit misleading. You handle a gun, press a bunch of different buttons to load it, and go through all the steps for 3 different weapons. Like for example, removing the empty shells from the revolver. If you press the button to load in a round while you still have the rod open, your bullets fall on the ground. It's a fun little dealie, but more of a beta thing. Hell if I know, it's neat.

												Firstly, you need to go into Receiver resigned that you WILL be losing a lot.  That said, the minimalistic style and insanely detailed gun mechanics make this an oddly compelling and addictive game.  It's very tough (and sometimes downright unfair thanks to the randomization elements) but still one of the most unique FPSes I've had the pleasure of playing.			",126,6,0,10,3,1,1

												This game is very unique, in that you must controle each action of the gun's reloading system. I love it, I want to see Mods for this game to add new wepons to keep it fresh. For now though, 3 guns are just fine.Wishlist for mods: Halo covenant carbine, gears of war lancer, a bolt action sniper rifle, Dreds lawgiver (from the film) and a multiplayer mode.

Micromanaging the gun does add ""interesting context to external challenges"" as the overview stated, and it was so satisfying to finally quickly reload my Colt M1911 in the heat of battle (taser-bot). The story was very interesting and had a unique way of telling itself. The game overall was very enjoyable, I just wish it was a bit easier because there's no saving and you die in one hit.

												I want moar realistic guns plz.I first heard about this game when I watched a Rooster Teeth: Rage Quit video about it. I did some more searching, briefly watch a video that Nerd³ made about it, and thought it looked interesting. So despite my rib-crushingly small budget this week, I bought this game. After all, it's only $5.I launched the game, having a slight idea as to what I was doing, meaning I knew there were guns, they were complicated, there were enemies I had to kill, and there were tapes (which tried to get me to question my existence) to be collected. And I found out very quickly that I wasn't far off.When you start, you're given one of three handguns: A Colt M1911A1, a Glock 17, or a Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver. In your average FPS, all of these would be no-brainers; you would simply point, shoot, and keep half an eye on an ammo counter on the bottom right of your screen. In Receiver, on the other hand, all of these weapons work differently. In addition, there is no ammo counter. ""Well,♥♥♥♥♥♥"" I said to myself. I brought up the help menu (which is paired with a helpful, behind-the-scenes AI that will help you get your gun in to working order!) and figured out the controls for my gun. I got my weapon ready to fire, and set out searching for tapes. Shortly thereafter, I died. ""Alrighty then,"" I mumbled to myself as the game reset. Luckily, I got the same gun next round, this time it was one step away from being ready. Same thing again. Set up gun, go find tapes, die. This will happen a lot. The game randomizes the state your weapon is in when you receive it.After playing for a few hours, I went to sleep, and the next day I came back to it. Having become familiar with the controls the previous night, the second playthrough was a breeze. The first time I reloaded my gun from muscle memory made me feel awesome. I still died a lot, though. But at least I can load my gun faster.Receiver is a good game. Well worth the $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's very clear that thought and energy was put into the function of the guns and drones. Other than that, things are very simple. But that's a good thing. This game is ABOUT the guns and drones: nothing else needs more detail.I've played it so many times that I know every room, every weak point, every ccontrol by heart.And I've never beaten it because, while fair enough, it's ♥♥♥♥ING IMPOSSIBLE.

												Edit: So finally after being very carefully and lucking out from getting shot and surprised attacked, I finally reached the end of the game by collecting 11+1 tapes. I have to got to say the ending is disappointing but that's ok because it's the journey to the end that makes it fun.It's a fun game of survival and methodical thinking, where you have control over your handguns mechanism such as reloading it, checking your remaining bullets, loading yor clips and all that fun stuff. The game is random as you try to survive while collecting tapes and you do die very easily which it is frustrating but not to the point where you won't try again as you might get lucky the next you playing whle collecting the tapes.I would really like to see a horror mod of this as that would be very interesting. There's only ever two enemies in the game which is fine strangely since you have turrets randomly placed in places where you would have a hard time and the drones who will sometimes surprise attack you.One thing I'll say turn the music off it actually gets in the way of the game because it will sopmetimes muffle the sounds of drones flying or turrets turning plus it's more atmospheric without it. I would like to see more weapons and enemies to give the game more variety but the base game is quite fun. The gun mechanics are interesting and much more involving than other gun games that you can probably name but on the other hand it's not THAT impressive. You can play with the intricacies of the gun but the main thing you're mostly just going to do is shoot, reload if you can, toggle a few switches in between. Cool but not play around much at least with me.so yes I do recommend the Reciever or at least give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first started playing I thought it looked like it was made in a week. And it was! Although the visuals defenitely are not the focus of this game but rather the completely addictive gun mechanics! A game made in a week by geniuses! The intricate gun mechanics coupled with a survival situation that greatly reminds me of slenderman are a good mix and the sinister audiotapes that serve as the games objectives add to the atmosphere. I never extepcted to almost jump out of my seat to this game but I did, repeatedly. As it stands it is a great game that I would recommend. 10/10. But I would also love to see these intricate and realistic gun mechanics applied in maybe a tactical shooter or something along those lines. Add in multiplayer versus and you have a winning competition that might draw a great player base. I know Wolfire are busy with overgrowth right now but maybe in future... Food for thought! 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver presents an interesting idea, but the presentation is not good. I am on a Linux system, and the low framerate makes the game basically unplayable. This is not because my machine doesn't meet the requirements for running it - there are many other people with the same issues. There is no option, on Linux, to change the resolution or graphic settings. Instead, you are given a small window to play in, which combined with the frequent framerate problems resulted in a less than enjoyable experience for me.  These problems, or so I have read, may be because the game uses the Unity engine.At $4.95 it is relatively inexpensive, but still I regret not purchasing another game instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the only game that simulates detailed reloading at least three types of pistol / revolver guns. That alone makes it very unique.The game is primarily a mixture of pistol-reload simulator, stealth game, tactical room clearing, and a tiny bit of exploration. The goal is to complete the exploration mission while clearing rooms of bots. The bots are somewhat frustrating, especially those bots that fly and zap you with lethal tasers. Thankfully some of the bots aren't mobile...yet.It is mostly polished game that feels a tiny bit unfinished, but acceptable for $1 to $5. The coding could definitely use a little bit more optimization as it tends to lag, which makes the game excessively challenging to survive. The level design is slightly repetitive but has an interesting architechural design, although it appears to take place in an urban skycraper. The level design makes good use of atmospheric lighting to create a sense of direness. Also note: you may need to seek out the cheat codes to get full use out of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver may interest you if you are looking for something a little different - there are no human enemies an no objective other than finding all eleven casettes, all the while hampered by turrets and flying drones. This is made harder by the fact that all of the guns must be reloaded realistically, although this is part of the interest for me. The levels and music are perhaps somewhat reminiscent of the first Deus Ex; the game is similarly, if not far more, difficult			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absoultely amazing 7 day Project turned into a game. I absoultely love this game, the mechanics behind the guns, the challenges, all absolutely wonderful. I started off this game completely lost and not noing any controls, I finally took notice to the ? and it poped up the controls. The animations are great, and you will always spawn in a random area with a random gun. Sometimes a glock, sometimes a revolver, sometimes a Colt, 1911. I would Rate this game 9/10.

												This game is ridiculously addictive. Simple gameplay (Takes a bit to learn the reload) But it is extremely satisfying, I found myself checking my magazines and the chamber of my Glock Or 1911 several times before entering into a new room. My absolute favorite part is sometimes you will spawn and immediately  have an flying Killbot after you. Madly Pulling the trigger on your revolver only to hear the devestating *click click* of two empty cylinders, but you keep pulling the trigger to find that the third chamber was loaded, you hit the bot its thrown off but its still coming after you, you squeeze again.*Click* Empty. The bot is charging you, you pull one last time to find the last chamber had a final round hidden. Bang you hear the impact and the bot goes down. Every time that happens my heart is racing and i need to step back from my keyboard to calm myself down! This is such a simple and cheap game. But it is designed well, and feels thought out.

												Theres something to be said about this game, it sets out to do one thing. give you a gun, and all of it's controls and boy howdy does it do that. whiles the content is sourly lacking, it being little more then a audio logged slender-type game, the three guns give it a suprsing deapth that made me want to spend time mastering how they function, developing stratagies based on what I stated with, Reley on the simplicity of the Revolver? The rapid fire of the Auto Pistol? or the sheer practicality of the M1911? The weapon makes all the difference, as well as your starting equipment; There is nothing more thrilling then being given limited bullets at the start and no flashlight. Tho i will say without a second of thought: ♥♥♥♥ the Sentries, those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s suck and I hate them.M1911 fo' life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gun handling/play is fun once you get a hang of it, pretty intense at times.  I can't recommend it though as most rounds are over too quick or drag on too long as you scour the area for ammo trying to avoid the randomly placed bots.  If ammo was more common or if the AI of the bots was actually interesting I would probably keep going.  The light story didn't do it for me either, only ever found 2 tapes in a single playthough.  Interesting gun mechanics and difficult, but kinda dull gameplay after you get a hang of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was looking for a game that throws out your ammo that remained in your clip when you pressed reload. Receiver took it much further and I was so lost with the controls in the beginning. it was great fun getting to learn how a gun works in the process, more than just pointing and shooting.Although there is a limited amount of enemy types the randomly generated maps and music makes this game intense at parts; so much as to where I was jumping out of my chair after a super loud shock from a drone.It's definitely not for everyone but I enjoyed it very much. Installing a mod that added a few extra weapons added to my play time.Before I go: The generation can hiccup even on my machine so there's definitely some issues performance wise. Unfortunately It does affect gameplay and I have died multiple times because of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it isn't just a ""simulation"" where you ""learn how to do the things, do them, and whooptee-doo you're done"" ; because the grueling process of operating your weapon is what keeps you alive. Which means the faster you reload is the only thing that determines your progress...And yeah also tension, intriguing ""story"", and the fact this was made in 7 days.Nothing compares, there's no way to understand how this game feels until you've played it!

												Wow. Receiver.I uh. Well. Let's start with the mechanics.The game feels a LOT like a survival horror shooter, although it also feels like one of the few ones done right. Ammo is somewhat scarce, and the panic you feel when you hear the 'click' while being stampeded by a flying tazer is very, very real. Dodge left, drop your magazine. And I mean freaking DROP your magazine, because why the hell are you trying to repocket it while you're under attack? Slap your keyboard wildly for a magazine with rounds still in it, then groan at your lack of muscle memory as you get zapped and killed. Next time you'll load faster, and survive. Next time.The next time loads, and your inventory is reset. A fresh gun, a random assortment of magazines and ammo - and if you're really lucky? A flashlight. Back out you go, let's see if you can survive this time.The story? It is...niche. It feels like the kind of story that'd really sing a song to anarchists, tin-foil fashionistas and psychonauts alike. Without giving too much away, it's kind of a meta story, and given what it's about, I can't help but l-o-v-e love it. Things are presented in a disjointed manner, and it's kind of involving to imagine this horribly confused individual desperately slapping the cassette into its niche, trying to figure out just what the hell is happening to him, and the world around him. All of it comes together nicely in a way that seems oh so appropriate to this scary, lonely world you're trapped in.If you're here for graphics, move right along. It feels like playing Q3A properly - no textures, and basic world modelling, leaving you with only the information you need.The sound does the job properly, leaving you thoroughly unsettled through the music design, as many of the beats are closely reminiscent of the flying tazers that may be right around the next corner. Guns clack, and shluck properly as you eject magazines, and pull back slides, and that god damn 'click' when you unexpectedly find your gun empty is exactly as foreboding as it should be.All in all, especially given the price tag, I TOTALLY have to recommend buying this game. It's a unique experience that you will love the hell out of, even if only for an hour a week, or so.more pls wolfire.			",219,48,0,25,22,2,37

												Reciever is a really good handgun managing simultor along with challenging gameplay.Not only do you have to get used to how your gun works, you have to worry about the enemies placed in places you least expect them. There are only two types of enemies but both require just as much effort to destroy as it take to remember how to reload. Turrets are slightly easier because they slowly spin in a circle in a single position. Tazers are another story though. These little guys fly around and once  you're found, they rush at you, tazer clickng as it closes the space between you. Conserve your ammo and learn how to handle your weapon, one slip up could cause you to fail.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never fired a handgun before? Not a red-blooded American? Then buy this game.It's a handgun firefight simulator. You have to load your magazines, check your safety, work the slide. You have to understand each weapon completely and be quick about it. It's the only game I've ever played with realistic firing mechanisms. I'm a gun owner, I love hunting and going in the woods to fire off some rounds. And until today, I've never touched a game that realistically portrayed how a firearm actually works. The only saddening part is the game doesn't have enough content and I'd love to see what they could have done with a real budget and a lot of time. Regardless, I recommend this title.

												You'll either play this for 45 minutes or be the 1% that plays it for 20 hours. It's a first person shooter where you control the parts of the gun individually with different keys. Your goal is to collect all the tapes around the map and survive turrents and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FLYING ELECTRIC ROBOTS (I hate them). It's hard to stay alive for a long time or find all the tapes, which give you parts of the plot, but because of this, you want to play more and unlock the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definitely NOT a bad game for ""Shooting Simulator"" game, if not a really good one. You really have to learn well how to shoot in this game. Even a ""simple"" reload is not actually as simple as shown in various shooter games (Battlefield, CoD, you name it) - if you're used to press ""R"" to reload, in this game you have to do more than that. This is definitely NOT a bad game either for a game made only in 7 days.However, as it is now it's nothing more than, well, ""Shooting Simulator"". With some flying drones out there trying to kill you.Basically this game plays as the following: you spawin in a randomly-generated map and you need to search for guns and bullets around the map, assembling and utilizing them, while trying to evade and shoot down the hostile flying drones. The latter part is extremely difficult, btw. So while this serves its purpose as Shooting Simulator, I don't think this game is quite enjoyable, thus the reason me not recommending this game.

												Silly AAA industry; you keep trying and trying to make the most realistic shooter ever, but an indie dev beat you to it. And he did it in one week.Receiver is, without a doubt, the most realistic shooter there is.-You die in a single hit. (To be fair, a single bullet will not always kill you in real life, but if it hits your body or head, it WILL disable you such that you are at the shooter's mercy)-You hold your gun and flashlight in the exact same way that US investigative and miliraty forces are trained to.-Your gun behaves exactly like a real one would. You can fill a magazine, load it, chamber a round, eject the magazine, and put another bullet in it. And you can fire the chambered round with or without a mag loaded. I could go on.

												Reciever is a really good handgun managing simultor along with challenging gameplay.Not only do you have to get used to how your gun works, you have to worry about the enemies placed in places you least expect them. There are only two types of enemies but both require just as much effort to destroy as it take to remember how to reload. Turrets are slightly easier because they slowly spin in a circle in a single position. Tazers are another story though. These little guys fly around and once  you're found, they rush at you, tazer clickng as it closes the space between you. Conserve your ammo and learn how to handle your weapon, one slip up could cause you to fail.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought and downloaded this game today, and promptly played it for three hours non-stop.it does an excellent job at rendering, and simulating the three guns currently available; recoil is spot on, weapon manipulation feels real, ammo count is right, and the guns feel like they should. that in and of itself is worth the price of admision.you'll find no CoD here, the graphics are simple, but workable, enemy variety is, lacking, to say the least, and the instant/perma-death are infuriating ocasionally.That said, as a firearms owner, and handgun shooter, I would rate it A1, everything I know to be true on real guns is true in the game, and it actually gives me some pretty good practice.press check, mag check, and know where your spare mags are!

												I stumbled onto your game back when it was released. I followed you guys closely for awhile with Overgrowth and happened to be watching right at the time Reciever was released. I also got the cheats for the game from Aubrey i believe, in a chatroom you guys had. I really like this game because it doesnt just have cool rogue like aspects but its such a cool gun sim. I was also really glad when I saw you guys updated it because i really thought you'd never touch it again as this game was a project build done in just a few days (thats why its more lack luster on the visual end) This is buy no means a game you will spend hour upon hours playing, or atleast i didnt, but i do love it, and im glad i bought it. And do still play it when i just have a bit of time. And I'd really like to see the mod community do something with this game, but that remains to be seen. Looking forward to overgrowth 1.0!

												You know what things suck horribly? Flying drones! They are worse than lag because they make the same noise as normal turrets and make you think they are normal turrets until it is too late.Now that that is out of the way, I have to say that my time playing this was fun, albeit quite difficult. The game is pretty simple in mechanics though: It's an FPS in which turrets and flying drones are your enemies and your goal is collect tapes. Think slenderman...with robots and guns...and tapes.The kicker is the controls: Everything gun related is set up with multiple commands. What do I mean? Let's use reloading (which really is where this shines) as an example. In pretty much all FPS games, you have to simply press R on your keyboard and this is way too simple for this game.For the revolver, you have to:-Press E to open the cylinder-Press V to empty casings-Press Z repeatedly to insert bullets one at a time-Press R to close the cylinderAnd this is just for this gun because there are two other guns that have some variation to how you reloadThis is really the highlight of the game. It really makes for some tense moments. Moments like learning you've used up your clip with 2 flying drones flying at you.When I think about it though, I'm split on the price. The games can spark some genuinly tense moments and is fun to play but there isn't much to it. There are only 2 enemy types, 3 guns, a flashlight, an enviroment you'll get really use to after a few plays, and slender-esque tape collection. On the other hand, 5 dollars isn't THAT much to spend on a game.If there was just a little more variety, I don't think I'd be having this issue but it might be best to get this one on sale at somepoint.

												A challenging FPS that doesn't lose any charm or fun once you get into the swing of things. Easily one of the more challenging games I've played, as it's quite unforgiving in both mechanics (learning the layout and order to load, reload, check ammunition, etc.) and gameplay (drones and turrets that track you via sensors and dish out instant kill shots). Your objective is to collect audio tapes to gain more information about what's going on while scavenging for ammunition and avoiding enemies. Though it's rather straightforward in terms of story, the randominzed gameplay alone was enough to get me hooked, and the complex gun mechanics only sweetened the deal.Be warned; you will die. A lot.			",52,6,0,3,1,0,1

Yes it may be a small game, challenging at first and difficult to get your head around, but in the end the reward of taking out a sentry is your happiness, you don't awarded bullets, health points or xp, just your pleasure at winning which is how all games should feel and once you win, it is a great feeling.It may or may not be the game for you, you really have to think to yourself about that one but in my opinion?

												This is a gun simulator, you don't just hit 'r' after every few bullets you shoot to reload your weapon. Memorizing how to handle and reload each of the three guns is one of the most strangely satisfying things I've done in a game in a long time. The graphics and narration aren't that great, but I urge everyone to check this game out (or at least watch videos of it).

It's kin of fun for the first 30 mins. Afterwards it is repetive gameplay that you are very likely to die in. Did you runout of bullets? To bad there isn't anymore. Having trouble finding your way around in those dark areas? If you didn't spawn with a flashlight good luck finding one. It is a good concept, but poorly done.

												Impossible realistic fun. Forces you to assemble and disassemble your gun to reload it the correct way with multiple button inputs. If you get shot, expect to die with little to no warning besides the hum propellers or the whir of a turret. Collecting the tapes can be a pain without a navigation HUD, but that's what makes the game fun.Definitely recommend for those looking for a new and interesting type of shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Theres something to be said about this game, it sets out to do one thing. give you a gun, and all of it's controls and boy howdy does it do that. whiles the content is sourly lacking, it being little more then a audio logged slender-type game, the three guns give it a suprsing deapth that made me want to spend time mastering how they function, developing stratagies based on what I stated with, Reley on the simplicity of the Revolver? The rapid fire of the Auto Pistol? or the sheer practicality of the M1911? The weapon makes all the difference, as well as your starting equipment; There is nothing more thrilling then being given limited bullets at the start and no flashlight. Tho i will say without a second of thought: ♥♥♥♥ the Sentries, those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s suck and I hate them.M1911 fo' life.			",308,42,9,63,13,2,49

												1)  This game was made in 7 days.  Yes, 7.2)  It isn't pretty, but it works, and it works well.3)  It features realistic gun handling skills interms of loading and reloading.4)  An entirely randomized layout makes for (argueably) infinite replayability.5) If you get shot, you die.  No HP, no medkits, no healing potions.  D. E. D. Dead.   Receiver is based almost entirely upon realistic gun handling.  There is a distinct lack of surface textures, but you can't expect the Mona Lisa in a game that was made in such a short time.  I picked this game up on sale for about $2.50, but I would recommend buying it even at its original price.  Receiver takes a bit of getting used to, and the story line certainly isn't unique, but it is quite fun either way.  A perfet playthrough can see the game completed in about 30-40 minutes or so.  But it took me almost three hours of overall gameplay to reach that point.  For under a dollar per hour of enjoyment, I'm happy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is ridiculously addictive. Simple gameplay (Takes a bit to learn the reload) But it is extremely satisfying, I found myself checking my magazines and the chamber of my Glock Or 1911 several times before entering into a new room. My absolute favorite part is sometimes you will spawn and immediately  have an flying Killbot after you. Madly Pulling the trigger on your revolver only to hear the devestating *click click* of two empty cylinders, but you keep pulling the trigger to find that the third chamber was loaded, you hit the bot its thrown off but its still coming after you, you squeeze again.*Click* Empty. The bot is charging you, you pull one last time to find the last chamber had a final round hidden. Bang you hear the impact and the bot goes down. Every time that happens my heart is racing and i need to step back from my keyboard to calm myself down! This is such a simple and cheap game. But it is designed well, and feels thought out.

												SO GOOD. I never would have thought this kind of game would exist, let alone I would like it. I want games like this. This should be the new indie thing, triple A devs try to copy, not crafting. Imagine Metal Gear with this added on top of the stealth. Fiddling with the guns on top of shooting giant robots.This is kind of like Videodrome the game. It has weird postmodern, paranoid worlds, and a strange look, where the quirks make it even creepier. I have a feeling, that and Hotline Miami were seen by the Wolffire before this.I really just want a full-on game of this. Even if Wolffire doesn't do it, some indie dev, or even Triple A devs should do it. Realistic guns is one of the coolest game play ideas since crafting.			",83,22,0,4,4,1,4

												I stumbled onto your game back when it was released. I followed you guys closely for awhile with Overgrowth and happened to be watching right at the time Reciever was released. I also got the cheats for the game from Aubrey i believe, in a chatroom you guys had. I really like this game because it doesnt just have cool rogue like aspects but its such a cool gun sim. I was also really glad when I saw you guys updated it because i really thought you'd never touch it again as this game was a project build done in just a few days (thats why its more lack luster on the visual end) This is buy no means a game you will spend hour upon hours playing, or atleast i didnt, but i do love it, and im glad i bought it. And do still play it when i just have a bit of time. And I'd really like to see the mod community do something with this game, but that remains to be seen. Looking forward to overgrowth 1.0!

												Receiver is one of those games where you suck when you first start, and there is no shame in this. Once you get into it, though, you'll find yourself hooked if you're a fan of FPS, want something different and wondered how it would be if you had more control over your firearm in your average shooter. Art direction is minimalistic which works for the dystopian feel, the audio is wonderful and the setting/story is fantastic. Controls are initially tricky but with practice they're easy to adapt to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gun manipulation is neat. Not practical at all, but neat. And the lack of any proper help means just learning how to reload will take you a good half hour of trial and error, which I guess is satisfying when you finally figure it out? But it's not a good game. What's the point of even having a gun if all the enemies are immune to bullets? Where's the option to run full-screen instead of in a tiny window? It's a neat experiment but nothing you'll put more than an hour into.			",341,66,27,30,22,1,28

												This is not a game for everyone so wether someone recommended this game or not is almost entirely based on their taste in games and as such introduce some bias. That being said I will now impart some of my bias upon you. Reciever is an interseting game to say the least: no fancy graphics, minimal to no story, and a difficulty on a level of reality unobtainable by another game in this genre. Where Reciever truely shines is its delivery of narative through gameplay. There are a few (11 to be exacy) tapes throughout the game that have recordings on them that help explain the basic premise (the  goal of the game being to collect all 11), but the entirety of the feel and the lessons this game imparts (as any game worth its salts has at least some knowledge to impart) are based in its mechanics. This game takes guns very seriously: they kill. You take one bullet in this game and you die. Not to mention, as many comments will tell you, they ain't easy to operate (E, ~, 2, 3, ~, Z, R, F to reload?). Which leads to the conveince of theme. This game is hard. It is almost pointless to expect to win with any sense of ease; which is exactly what the narritive delivers. Without spoiling too much, you can essentially die endlessly in this game. A never ending cycle of death, failure and pain. Sounds like a message to me (not to mention the recordings speaking of a dystopian society). This coupled with the game's core mechanics being gun manipulation means that the narritive is almost entirely non-verbal, which is fantastic. Again, I do not reccommend this game to everyone (it is rather artsy and only made in a week), but is excellent for what it is, and I hope we can all learn something about guns from something other than Battlefield, CoD, Halo, etc where they're just tools. I wish you a good day, and thanks for listening to my ramblings on :) Cheers!			",33,5,0,6,2,0,1

												I grabbed Receiver because I liked the level of detail required to operate the handguns and wanted something to play while downloading Wasteland 2. However, there are almost no textures, the word looks horrible, the enemies are unimaginative, and the tapes are SO ANNOYING. You don't even get any say as to what gun you get, and the revolver is is the worst. The gun mechanics are the only thing this game has going for it since it is awful all-around.All that being said, why can't I stop playing it???			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ya know, there is a reason why free to play games exist.In Receiver, we follow the story of a silent protagonist who's name is apparently ""Reciever"", or as i like to call him ""The Ghost of Guns Past"" (its just a floating gun no hand no nothing). This game was made for the 7-Day FPS challenge in which, as the name implies, is a callenge to game makers to create a First Person Shooter (FPS) in 7 days. And you know, its actually pretty good! So why am i giving this a low score? The game is just annoying to play to be honest. I know what you're thinking, ""Hey Vandal, if you say this game is pretty good then why did you just say its annoying? You just completely contradidcted to what you just said!"", well allow me to explain reader. What i meant by that was that its a good PROTOTYPE. This is what the game feels like, plays like, and looks like. This game honestly should be a Free to Play tech demo. Not a game worth $5! The game is also procedurly generated. Which means that, the level will be randomized with each playthrough. Now on other games that sounds good (i.e. Being Minecraft, Starbound, Binding of Isaac) but on this game it just fails to impress. Sometimes I spawn with a flashlight, the gun, about 4 fully stocked mags, and with the cassete tape in one room (You have to collect these things for god knows why). And sometimes i spawn with absolutly nothing! The other thing that makes this game bad is its TERRIBLE narrorator. In video games narrorators are supposed to retell past events, present events (Trine series), or just quirky narration (The Stanly Parable). The narrator in this game sounds like he was forced to do this. As in he sounds he hasnt gotten any sleep in months and is bored out of their mind on the brink of insanity. Pros:-Looping music is catchy-Guns are replicated good-Guns sounds are almost realCons:-Game suffers from confusing gameplay-Virtually no story if any-Horrible narrator-Not worth the $5-EXTREMELY CONFUSING controls-Bland textures-Crap hit detectionThe Final Verdict: 4/10I am being greatly generous with that rating. The game is not the worst game on pc (in my opinion at least) but it's definitely up there. I cant say anything else worth mentioning other than the fact that i can go on and on ranting about how the game shouldve been free instead of it costing money. I refuse to recommend this game to players unless you're a gun nut. If thats the case disregard this review and go buy - HANG ON NO DONT BUY IT! If you are a gun enthusiast, the look up ""World Of Guns: Gun Dissasembly"". At least there you can go crazy on numerous guns. The game would be better if it was still being in development by the dev team. In conclusion the game is not good. I know I dont have the right to say that since i only played it for about 6 mins. the uninstalled it. But in my opinion, unless the team makes a better version of the game, this game will forever be the worst game i have ever played.Even ""Dead Bits"" was a better game than this.-Evan			",102,15,0,3,3,1,2

												Wonderful experimentation with the FPS genre. Artsy, by intention (perhaps to its detriment). The game is fiddly, but by intention. Every action the PC in another game would take when you hit ""R"" you have to do in sequence. If you do it wrong, the guns jam and you have to go through a completely different sequence as you eject the mag, clear the chamber, and reinsert rounds into the magazine.Should be given to anyone that claims that FPSes train people to use guns :VReccommended as a romp.

												EDIT: I *tentatively* recommend this game to *some* people. No updates makes me bummed out.Reciever is, if nothing else, an awesome experiment in gun mechanics and gameplay. It's fun, and there's a level of challenge to it that no other game I've played has been able to recreate. It is empowering to come back to this game after a few weeks away and remembering keystroke-for-keystroke how to check the ammo in my gun and reload it.Note on optimization: Yes, this game will be laggy on almost anything you try to play it on. It's also worth noting that this game was made in 7 days. Updates are sure to come in the future, and the game's performace will be better for it. Wait for another sale to get this one if you're still skeptical, but rest assured that the money will be well spent.It's interesting, it's challenging (and occasionally frustrating), and it's definitely the most unique shooter I've ever played.

												I would recomend this game to someone who is likes FPS's or really any type of game and you would enjoy Receiver. It is one of those games where you do not have to be in a certain ""Mood"" to play. Play it any time of the day what ever day you can play it as long that you have a working computer you can play this game. Receiver is also a very convenient game that you can have a basic laptop and you can play it smoothly.			",44,0,1,5,7,0,1

												Verdict: 8/10 (50/10 when considering how quickly it was created from scratch)Pros: Novel concept, challenging gameplay, amazingly detailed firearms, great sound design, simple but slick graphics,  incredible game for being made at a 7-day game jamCons: Not much actual game, only 3 weapons, no updates/game abandoned, game would/could be so much better if the game got a minor update (more/different enemies, new map/level, new/more weapons).I found out about this game through Rockleesmile (the youtuber who has a show called Indie Impressions).  This game is absolutely amazing considering it was built in just 7 days. There are AAA games that cost millions of dollars and years of development that aren’t as fun, intriguing, detailed, and solid as Receiver.  Receiver’s not a perfect game and it’s definitely lacking in the content department (meaning it could really use more things to do, weapons to use, and greater enemy variety).  The “plot” if you can call it that is incomprehensible; as you make your way through the randomly generated levels you find (amongst more ammo usually) tape cassettes which contain the “story” of what’s going on.  There is an order to these tapes but I’ve never gotten more than 4 (there are 11 total) during a single run and although there is a proper order in which listening to them forms a coherent story (I think anyways) but in my experience they are always out of order therefore making the “story/plot” meaningless.  The real draw for this game is the HIGHLY detailed weapons.  The guns are the most accurate representations of guns I’ve ever experienced in a videogame (that was the point of the game; to create hyper realistic weapon/gun action).  Each bullet must be loaded into the gun (whether in a magazine or in the drum of a revolver) safeties disengaged, slides cocked, etc.  The in game representation of the M1911A1 Colt .45 pistol is exceptionally accurate because I actually own one IRL and it’s amazing how well represented it is in the game.  The sound design too is excellent.  The music swells and is intense when enemies are present, and sufficiently “sci-fi” and groovy while exploring.  The sounds of the weapons firing is quite satisfying, each shot feels “real” and each different type of ammo (9mm, .45 ACP, or .38 special) sounds/feels unique.  The level of detail in Receiver is exceptional and mind blowing, even more so when faced w/ the fact that it was made from scratch in 7 days.  These devs definitely have earned the price of the game, if you’re any kind of fan of firearms this game is worth checking out, you will very likely be impressed.			",424,71,9,30,35,0,44

												A short game that provides a gun experience unlike any I've had before in a game. If you have any interest in guns, play it now, because it's heaven. The actual gameplay is repetitive, but it's something I love to repeat each time. My only complaint is that it isn't being developed anymore, because this may be my favorite game and I've love to see it fleshed out some more.			",69,12,1,4,14,0,5

It's also very challenging and often frustrating (you will hate those flying f*ckers).

												Fascinating experiment, sort of a survival horror FPS that runs light on visceral horror but heavy on tension.  The detailed gun mechanics were frustrating at first but gave a sense of accomplishment once I got the patterns down.  (I often found myself compulsively checking the colt/glock to make sure a round was chambered and spinning the revolver cylinder ""for luck"" before snapping it shut.)The randomized tapes remind me a little of Dear Esther's non-linear storytelling (if someone did a Dear Esther/Receiver mashup, I would buy that in a heartbeat :)If you are frustrated by making mistakes and learning through trial-and-error, you will probably not enjoy this game.  To get anywhere, you will die and restart.  A lot.  Bullets are scarce, and you die in one hit, so it's not a game for people who want to rush around blowing things away.  Much of my enjoyment of the game came from efficient use of those scarce bullets and outwitting the drones.If you are interested in game design and how design decisions and minimalist storytelling affect the player experience, this is definitely worth a look.

												A simple game that eschews player models and texture gloss for gunplay. Manupulating all the controls on your weapons is a little fiddly at first and daunting under pressure but that's what makes the game so interesting, and very rewarding once you're reloading quickly from memory. Good replay value and playable for a game they churned out in a week for a competition.			",153,14,4,11,11,1,6

												A very different FPS with complex mechanics making receiver a challengeing and almost creepy game that will have you on the edge of your desktop waiting for a sentry or ""flying zappy thing"" to pop out at you. Overall a good game for the price, however I wouldn't pay a dollar more. The graphics could use some work. But what makes this more addictive is that each level is randomly generated, again, good overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DISCLAIMER: I know this game was created in seven days. That's amazing and all, and it's priced right, but I still hate it.This game was fun--at first. The only things going for Receiver are the 3 guns you can play around with, and the mechanics that require multiple key commands to execute a reload. After that, the game falls flat on its face.The story revolves around you spawning randomly in a dystopian apartment building with a gun in your hands. You have either a Colt 1911, a Glock 17, or a Smith and Wesson Model 10, as well as a random number of bullets. You have two enemy types, a stationary rotating machine gut turret and a flying drone electrocutor, neither of which are very difficult to kill or outwit. They're super-boring and get tiresome very quickly once you figure out the weak points on each one.Your objective is to search, collect, and listen to 11 tapes that are littered about the complex without dying, either from falling, getting shot or electrocuted, or, as I discovered minutes before writing this review, shooting yourself in the foot. That, for me, was the final straw in playing this game over and over and over just to try and beat it.The game is extremely challenging, and not in a good way. There is no map or GPS or way of finding out just where you are, leading to LOTS of backtracking. There is no health system; one shot or lethal fall, and you're dead. There are no checkpoints, so you start all over when the game freezes up or you get killed. That alone is reason enough not to buy Receiver; to have to start all the way back at zero after making so much progress.Receiver does one thing and does it really well--it gives the player more control over their weapons, more so than in most other FPSs out there. Is that enough of a reason to pay $4.99 for it? Yes; as long as you don't expect anything more than that from the game, you'll be A-Okay. ",71,19,3,5,3,0,2

												Whether your looking  for a realistic Indie FPS, a fun and exciting new twist on first-person shooters, or a realistic gun simulator with a classic arcade feel, there is something for everybody in a game that can be fun but rather burdensome oftentimes.The game features realistic gun errors, (i.e jamming, safe reloads, and bullets getting stuck in the cylinder) excellent gun mechanics, and awesome bullet physics. The game while fun, has some major performance issues. I will often be on an important part of the game when suddenly I start to get major lag. This should not be happening on a game like this, as the graphics are not even that good. This takes away from much of the game's fun. When the game is not lagging (something which is a rare commodity) it is extremely fun to play. When you encounter a flying mind tech you feel this true sense of fear for your life as you either fight or run. Shooting and reloading the gun is rather interesting because every single part of the gun is controllable. While this adds uniqueness to the game it slows the pace down considerably and has nothing to help speed it up.The verdict: An exciting and adrenaline pumping experiment that is hindered majorly by its massive performance issues. While the game is fun to play it badly needs to be optimized. If you have beast gaming computer or something ""good enough"" to run most games, then I would definitely recommend picking this up!Overall rating: 6/10Presentation: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 5/10Sound: 8/10Difficulty: 8/10Lasting Appeal: 6.5Overall rating: 6/10			",90,20,2,2,1,1,3

												Sorta simple game. The main goal is for you to collect 10 tapes, while trying not to get killed by the physco-robot rapists. Also, you have to reload the gun manually which also happens to be the main point of the game since it was after all, an experment.Just don't expect HD graphics though. The lights sometimes bug out. Also, if you're playing on a lower-end computer, it may start to lag once you gotten around 5-6 tapes as the game starts to spawn more bots.Overall, I say it is okay-ish.			",26,3,0,0,3,0,2

												7 DAYSthat's all this was alotted for when the project was made, as a competition piece of brand new un explored gaming, i find this to be very good, i got it for free, as i expect most people to ""want"" something for their money, you'll be paying for something you don't want, on the whole, this game is fantastic, i find it very engaging and simple, yet complex and boring, the idea behind the game is brilliant, if you want to play a game you have no familiarity with, brand new controls and cool level design, despite the lack of textures, i suggest you try this game, i can't stress the inginuity with the 7 days this was made in.some say the levels design is repetitive and boring, but that's the thing, how would YOU react to finding yourself here? having to operate a gun with it's proper details, defend yourself for unkown reasons, the tension, the audio the atmosphere in this game can get really intense, as a side note there is cheats available to help with completion if you find the game comes across unfair and your bullets don't hit where you fire. and the slow motion cheat can make things look really cool.the god mode makes it really easy but alllows for mistakes to be corrected, don't forget in this scenario, you are vulnerable, not a regenerating cybernetic undefeatable mass of intelligence like most games make you out to be, and death is death, it's a restart and a new starting point, new gu and new magazine set, so the start can be unfair with a few bullets and a mag or great with 3 mags and a ton of bullets. the controls are also available for on screen play, no pausing needed but you need to be quick if you are being chased.good luck.

												More a gun operation simulator than a shooter, Reciever replaces the standard “Press R to Reload” with a full tour of all the moving parts. First, the magazine must be ejected and the gun holstered. Only then can the magazine be fed with bullets and loaded back into the gun which then must be racked before a bullet ever reaches the chamber. It can be a difficult and confusing task, especially with the pressure of an active turret nearby, but it is satisfying and forces a level of interaction with the weapon beyond the normal point-and-click to remove obstacles. The scarcity of both supplies and fancy textures keeps the focus on that relationship between the player and the gun mechanics. The only distraction, other than the constantly looming threat of permanent death, is the tapes littered throughout the randomly generated terrain which either serve to set up a backdrop for the action or just spout the sort of nonsense you've come to expect from the street corner next to the liquor shop. The whole thing's over before a conclusion can be reached on that subject which just left me wishing someone would take this near blank slate and mod in a context for it all.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Receiver is a rather simple (on the surface) FPS game. Receiver's main objective is to find cassette tapes that tell a story of the society and troubles of the world, as well as how to operate a firearm. The gunplay is fantastic, for it focuses on semi-realism. Destroy the kill-bots with precise firing by hitting key parts such as the cameras, engine, battery, or (in the case of the flying taser-bots) the rotor. After the threat is neutralized, you should check your ammol without having a silly HUD, the game forces/allows you to pull the magazine from your gun (or open slide out the cylinder) to check how much ammo you have left. Maybe you emptied the clip and recently reloaded your gun, but you're not sure you got one in the chamber. Simply pull the slide back halfway, and take a peek! Overall, Receiver is easily worth the sale price of $5, and definitely more, although the price helps in the fun. 10/10			",123,14,5,16,17,0,15

												I just feel that Receiver is more of a novelty, more of the whole ""Games are Art"" argument than actual gameplay. ""It will rip your muscle memory apart!"" Some say, but I feel it's more ""It will rip the muscles in your hands to shreds!"", as 15 minuites later, my hands were barely useable, and I was in a great deal of pain.I can hear the cries of ""Hypocrite! Something, Something, Call of Duty, Something!"", but don't get me wrong, I think COD is an unrealistic pile of uselessness, while Receiver does show the whole gunplay thing, I cannot help but feel that it's made the same mistake as the MMS games it's trying to avoid being, namely, lacking a health meter! Yes, yes, yes, I know it's not realistic, but I thought we binned realism when we had strange insectoid trolls exploring the planet Zog!While I'm at it, your character seems to be killed easily by a sneeze more than anything else, and holding down buttons to do something? Really? I thought those died out back in the late 90's!Anyway, it just seems to be an art experiment someone wanted to try, but as a game..it's not really that fun.			",193,18,5,38,61,3,57

												Great fun for such a simple game (it was made in 7 days, which occasionally shows). Very difficult to complete (seems that quite few people have) since if you die, you have to start again, and 1 bullet will kill you. It's really tense since enemy/item/your spawning is random, so every time is like the first, having to check corners and move around tactically, with one wrong step meaning you have to start again.Realistic weapon handling too, which is fluid once you get the hang of the controls - you're in charge of each major moving part of the weapon (slide, safety, mag, hammer, etc,) so weapon knowledge is a big plus. Since a recent update you also may spawn with either an M1911, a revolver of some kind (a bit fiddly to reload, but quite simple otherwise), and a Glock 17 (with a full-auto mod, kind of pointless as ammo is so scarce).There's a couple playthroughs on YouTube, check 'em out!anyway GET IT IT'S SURPRISINGLY ACE			",188,25,16,8,14,1,3

Please consider a game with multiple weapons, human enemies, more health (for a more dinamic gameplay, not just 1-hit-kill). All in all, its worth the discounted price. I got only 9 tapes.

												Reciever is a short game with fun gun mechanics. It was initially made in about 42 hours or so for a competition, and it shows. The environemnts are repeated heavily, the textures are bare, and it feels kinda cobbled together. That being said, the gun mechanics are its main selling point, and you're probably not thinking of buying it for its minimalistic style. So, let's address that aspect of the game.The gun mechanics are very complex and realistic, and unique because of that. Now - to be clear - I've never owned nor fired a gun. However, I do have a pretty decent grasp on the basics of how modern ballistic weapons work, as should most people. The game portrays them accurately as far as i know, but someone that actually owns a firearm might say otherwise. Reloading the weapon is a complicated multi-step process, priming the weapon must be done for it to fire, and you even have to turn of the safety. There is also no ammo counter, you have to count shots or look at your clip for a vague idea of how many bullets you have left. You have to make sure a round is actually chambered, and cocking the gun while a bullet is in the chamber already ejects the perfectly good, unused round that you then have to pick up in embarrassment. If you're looking at buying this game for the mechanics of it, I'd say it's probably worth it.However, if you want a game that is more than just a bare-bones proof of concept slapped together over a short amount of time and sold on steam, then you might wish to look elsewhere. While it's not expensive by any stretch of the imagination, it is - however - still 5 bucks. While I've derived a lot of enjoyment from messing around with it - as it's a rogue like - there's a distinct lack of a real story, varied enemies, guns - even through there's 3 now - and other content you'd expect from a normal game. It's good, but if you don't think the shooting mechanics are interesting enough to warrent a purchase, then you should probably think hard about whether or not it's worth it. I won't tell you that you won't end up liking it - because you might - but know that when you get into this thing it's not to reach reality A.			",107,28,1,19,7,2,24

												SO GOOD. I never would have thought this kind of game would exist, let alone I would like it. I want games like this. This should be the new indie thing, triple A devs try to copy, not crafting. Imagine Metal Gear with this added on top of the stealth. Fiddling with the guns on top of shooting giant robots.This is kind of like Videodrome the game. It has weird postmodern, paranoid worlds, and a strange look, where the quirks make it even creepier. I have a feeling, that and Hotline Miami were seen by the Wolffire before this.I really just want a full-on game of this. Even if Wolffire doesn't do it, some indie dev, or even Triple A devs should do it. Realistic guns is one of the coolest game play ideas since crafting.			",83,22,0,4,4,1,4

They focused everything on the pistols, not world textures any of that jazz, but if you already know how to work pistols irl, it's easy to pick up.  Definately worth <$2, maybe worth the full $5.

												Fantastic game considering it was built in 7 days and goes on sale for $1-3 on occasion.  While some find this game boring or hard, I find it addictive because I have yet to find all the tape and the game actually presents a challenge.  It breaks mussle memory on how to use a gun by teaching you how a gun actually works and binding every little thing to a key.  Its definitely rewarding to quickly reload off of memory as a tazer robot comes zipping right at you and you shoot it down.  Then you turn around and another and zapps you  in the face..... Its very addictive because you know you are capable of beating the game as its simple and straight forward.... after you get the keys down, but the game progressively gets harder (a feature I was surprised got impolemented in a 7 day game). Personal best is roughly around 7 of 11 tapes.I look forward to when Wolfire Games finishes Overgrowth and starts work on this game.  It definitely has a great foundation and idea to start off of.  Worth the couple dollars even to learn how to use a gun without touching an actual one.			",59,9,1,4,17,0,15

												I never write reviews for games, but this one deserves it. One thing first:If you like standard FPS controls, hit ESC in-game, and check the box that says ""lock gun to center of screen""; this will get rid of the annoying 'swivel aim' when you bring up the iron sights. Once I did this, I had an easier time of dealing with enemies.Onto the game:It may have strange graphics, but this game is amazing. It's brutally difficult, and when you panic you screw up firing your gun. I'm very familiar with firearms, but I initially kept forgetting to rack the slide in the 1911 or Glock if I spawned with a magazine in. The 1911 can get you when you forget to♥♥♥♥♥♥the hammer, too. It's really amazing how in-depth the weapon controls are. Being able to load a magazine, chamber a round, unload that mag, and load a fresh one is awesome; not many games let you +1 a gun. Being able to freely spin the revolver's cylinder is also very fun. I had some good times just playing Russian Roulette with glass panes. I have only played an hour of this game so far, and I haven't gotten very far, or even really figured out what I'm supposed to be doing, but the gun mechanics are keeping me intently occupied.

												Seriously, this game is  awesome. Easily worth $5, just for the new experience.This NEEDS to be made into a full on game, big♥♥♥♥♥team, writers, the whole shebang. It feels like Bohemia Interactive could be a good fit, with their Arma series and being into the whole realism aspect. This mechanic in a milsim undoubtedly give the hardcore Arma community a big hard-on. I have one now.I love the no save point/respawning, definitely adds to the experience. The UAVs with the tasers on them are terrifying when they sneak up on you, and the game has a great atmosphere, despite being a little bit simple.Movement is a little clunky; I do like that they did something new with running by having you spam the W button instead of just passively holding shift. Makes it feel more involved and I've gotten more immersed in the game because of it, but sometimes you'll clip a bit into a wall or get stuck on the top stair of a staircase and it totally takes me out of it. Overall, great game, definitely give it a swing.			",76,6,0,11,5,0,4

												Ever wondered why firearms aren't pictured in a realistic way in games? This game is here to illustrate that. Instead of pressing R to reload, you go through the entire process of extracting empty shells and inserting bullets, as well as cocking, locking and loading and whatever else guns do, and it's /tedious/, especially with multiple enemies chasing you down.It's not a bad game as such, but it does illustrate how realism isn't always good. If you should buy and/or play it depends on how high your tolerance for fiddly, slow, realistic gunplay is. I wish I could choose ""Maybe"" as a recommendation.			",258,79,6,30,22,2,32

												I know I haven't played this game for very long, but I still think I am entitled to an opinion. When you first start up the game you aren't treated to a tutorial or a storyline, because who has time for that? you start off in a different, blocky room each time with no minimap, and no incentive to go anyplace in particular. thee guns are very realistic and nice to aim but the controls to use or reload each one are different, and to reload a gun requires several keys to be pressed. One shot from any robot enemy kills you, and you are not told where or what to shoot, and only after maybe twenty deaths might you figure out where to shoot to kill one.    Overall I might give this game a 4/10 for nice guns and good movement controls, but thats pretty much it.			",91,17,0,13,10,1,6

												 It's basically a first person shooter with very realistic gun mechanics. For example, to reload a revolver you first open the cylinder, then you separately take out the casings, you put the new ones in and you close it. You then have to pull back the hammer and stuff. It's quite complicated but it's a lot of fun once you get used to it. You also have to shoot ground sentries which shoot you and flying drones which electrocute you at a close range all whilst trying to find all 11 tapes.This game might not be for everyone but I personally really like this game. Also, I got this for free from Humble Bundle's End of Summer Sale so I'm not sure if it's worth its price. ",251,60,7,21,38,4,27

												A simplistic yet endearing game. The plot is barebones, relayed to you only through collectible tapes hidden throughout the world. The game takes place in a seemingly abandoned building inhabited by robots and machines out to kill you. This is where the gameplay shines. It's an FPS, yes, but you only carry a single pistol with VERY limited ammunition. In addition to this, you have to go through EVERY single step of using a gun. You'd have to manually insert the rounds into the magazine, insert the magazine, release the safety, chamber the round, and take aim all manually. Reloading has no automation whatsoever. Even then, you have to keep track of any ammo you have by checking the magazine as well as checking the chamber manually. On top of that, you die in one hit, while enemies take two to three hits on average.That's the main premise of the game, the interaction with the firearm. It's a bit shaky at first, but when you reload a gun just through muscle memory alone, it's the greatest feeling.Oh yeah. One more thing. You're gonna need that flashlight. If you don't spawn with it, you best find it.			",172,16,4,22,5,1,7

												This can't actually be called a game, for the state in which it was left after the 7 day challenge in which it was made. Yes, it's cool to ""learn"" how to use a gun, but no, it's nothing more than a pre-alpha concept of a game. And in 2013 it was released on steam with little to no polish/optimization whatsoever. That means it runs so bad a medium-end PC that you would wish to shoot yourself in the foot.Speaking of shooting, It has a really interesting ""reloading mechanics"", but the procedural generated levels, plus starting with no bullets more times than i wish to count for, the annoying A.I. and the pitiful to non existing aim just ruins it all. Releasing it in this state and putting a price tag on this incomplete experiment is nothing less but an insult.			",52,6,4,9,6,0,12

												Although this game is impressive for being put together in such a short span of time, it is not worth $5. The gameplay focuses on you having to become intimately aware of how to do everything but clean the random gun you recieve. The weapon type, along with the map, changes after every death to keep things fresh. However, I am glad I got it for free because it's not an experience worth paying $5 for.For a more in-depth review, visit http://fovgames.com/2014/09/22/receiver/ ",132,23,0,21,9,0,14

												Ok, Lets get one thing straight: The underlying IDEA of the game is genius. The execution of it however, is rather lacking. The flow of the game is a slow and enjoying pace. However, the procedural generation of the levels, loot, and enemies makes things rather frustrating. You can spawn completely set with enough ammo to take on the world, or none at all. I once spawned with a Glock with no mags. Awesome. Other times I have been spawned in the middle of some warehouse-like room next to 3 turrets. Great! The game is good, but it feels like they stopped right after the challenge ended and didnt round out the edges that make this such a flawed game. It just feels... empty. Balacing being the main issue here in the game that ruined the experiance.My experiance with the game was that of constant frustration with the mechanics. I immediately opened the in-game help menu, looked at the keys, and immediately was confused. For being a realistic-wanna-be for gun mechanics, how the hell am I supposed to check if there is a round in the chamber without pulling back the slide all the way and ejecting the round instead? Why cant I re-bind keys? Typically, any gun-lover such as myself would have LOVED to rebind the safey/Slide lock to a key on our mice - more specifically one of the thumb buttons as that is the finger you use for it. There are plenty of inconsistencies with the controls too. E to open the cyllinder on the revolver, but on the mag fed pistols, it just drops the mag in your hand, whereas Z takes out and inserts the mag. Why should I have 2 different keys for opening and closing the cyllinders? Why cant R just toggle the state instead of E to open and R to close? The entire button layout is just completely horrendous and poorly implemented - which is a shame because it could have been SO much better.I really wanted to enjoy the game, but the unfair swarm of enemies, constant control issues, and horrible balance for loot spawn just makes the level of frustration with this game a total waste of potential.This review is as of playing 0.8 Hours. I am trying to enjoy the game further, and cuz I simply enjoy playing with the guns - not neccesarily the game itself though.EDIT: So I finally beat the damn thing. And I only think the reason I did it was due to the fact that I got a lucky RNGeezus that decided to watch my back. Loads of bullets, spawned with 3 mags, and only turrets and no air drones. What you get when you win was very... disappointing.			",203,16,5,11,23,1,22

												Just bought the game today. By the fourth round, I had become a flashlight-hoarding, ammo-scrounging hobo with a .45. 10/10.UPDATE: The game is much more tense than you'd expect, the term ""reciever"" does not refer to a part on a gun, and there's a lot of cheesy and/or cliched backstory ingame. If you find a tape, listen very closely, because it won't be repeated.UPDATE 2: So apparently the tapes aren't an objective backstory, and knowing that, they make a lot more sense and seem a lot less cheesy. I'll let you figure the rest out yourself.			",183,34,7,13,14,3,7

												this is not quite a game, but a mechanic made into a game. this sounds bad, but its actually really good! the weapon handling is more realistic then any game ever before (talking from experience), and the plot is pretty well done for 7 day dev time, this is a game that at 5 bucks, it is a must buy, its difficult as hell, the mechanics are outstanding, and looks pretty good, buy this game			",112,14,0,8,9,1,17

												This is a pretty stripped down game. It is fun but it is challenging. Relaoding is not a single button press but a multistep process, there is no regenerating health, one hit you are dead. If you only play COD style shooters this isn't for you. If you want something different and definitely challenging give this a go.			",138,3,2,4,8,2,10

												The fact that a game made in seven days is more unique, interesting, and entertaining than  modern AAA FPS is really telling about the genre and the gaming industry as a whole... Completely risk-averse, just like Hollywood.Receiver is quite an experimental game, and the trailer pretty much shows the entire scope of it, so I'll spare talking too much about gameplay. The handling and bullet physics of the guns are the game's main selling points, and they perform quite well. You need to load every magazine yourself, eject spent casings, bullets will ricochet if fired at bad angles, etc. etc.The two enemies shown in the trailer are the only two enemies in the game, the flying drones which rush you really fast and try and stun you and the turrets. Both kill you in one hit. Not much of a variety at all, but it doesn't really need one. The drones clearly test your reflexes and the turrets your marksmanship. It could use one more to test handling in some way but that seems impossible to implement unless it somehow magically jammed your gun.All in all it works together quite nicely. The levels and your starting equipment are randomly generated and there's always some unique challenge to overcome. That said the level generation could use a few tweaks... as it tends to make impossibly hard levels with 0 ammo and about 8 turrets down a single one way path. The way you see the developers shooting multiple rounds at things in the trailer? Not a good idea. You generally want to take everything out in one shot if you can because ammo is very, very scarce, though you may get lucky! Aside from the obvious crappy graphics (the game seems to have problems with V-sync, by the way) that is my only negative.7/10 seems about right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun, yet abstract, game. Receiver will bring moments of frustration and joy, all dependent on your luck, and the randomly generated layout. The mechanics are pleasant, and the only problem I had with the controls was the ""tap W repeatedly to run,"" as I would, occasionally, run myself off a cliff. Tension-filled, easy to get into, but hard-to-adjust-to controls, Receiver is well worth the money.			",137,15,1,12,10,0,13

												Receiver is a fascinating experiment into realistic and deep gun handling models in-game.The story itself is interesting, if slightly cliched. The delivery is poor at best, and the game suffers from the performance hits caused by a backlevel Unity engine combined with unoptimized AI, lighting, and culling routines. However, this game needs to be played. It is engrossing, immersive, and ultimately, quite enjoyable. If they take this game beyond its ""7 Day Challenge"" state and add more polish and depth, they'll have quite an amazing title.			",381,110,19,5,9,2,12

												Interesting concept for a first person shooter, less about the person and more about the actions of the gun itself. Permadeath is a little frustrating but being able to fully manipulate your firearm seems to be something missing from common shooters. Though a little slow to pick up, it's nice to come back to this one when you only want to spend ten to fifteen minutes just walking around shooting things. All in all doesn't leave you too shattered when your killed and randomized starting gear makes for tons of replayability.			",141,9,1,16,8,0,18

												This still plays and runs like pretty much what it is: a one-week effort which is mostly an experiment in super-realistic gun mechanics, as opposed to an actual developed game. Still, said gun mechanics are pretty darn spot-on and interesting to mess with, and I guess there are also really detailed bullet ballistics which I haven't really noticed yet. Worth messing around with, but not something I'm about to start taking seriously, as the difficulty in getting all 11 tapes is pretty darn arbitrary, you probably won't find enough ammo to do it anyway, and, well, they're a guy with a weird accent tonelessly reading tables of contents at you, so, yeah. Guns! Neat.			",209,15,8,13,11,3,29

												Receiver is a game that anyone interested in gaming and the feeling of accomplishment should play.  Regrettably, I think I am now done with it.  This is a game with a steep learning curve and tremendous difficulty, the latter being something I am not particularly fond of in games.  But few games gave me such a strong feeling of accomplishment as when I learned to use the gun and take out enemies successfully.  There are some simple fixes that I think would benefit the game; slowing down the flying enemies which move at unforgiving speeds and having more warning about nearby enemies in general would allow me to have survived countless accidental deaths, which often seemed unfair rather than my own fault.  Protip, play with the options before you get into it, specifically turning on the option to lock the gun to the center of the screen.  All in all I highly recommend the game as a piece of interest, and I only wish that the game was still supported and seeing updates.			",352,158,6,31,24,3,38

												The word to describe this game most accurately is suspense. At first, this game is hard. After you figured out the nuances of handling a firearm, it's still ♥♥♥♥ing hard. However, you develope a cautiousness, you check every corner for turrets, check your magazine after every encounter with an enemy robot and you actually feel like your life is at stake. I have never experienced this in any other FPS since most of them give you the asuring feeling that you will spawn in 3 seconds after you died. If you are looking for a ""Run and gun"" sort of game, this may not be the best choice for you. If you enjoy an in-depth simulation of handling a gun, this is the game you NEED to play. It's as simple as that.			",48,1,0,5,0,0,1

												This game is more a less a rogue-like tech demo. The price and the videos about it should reflect that to players.The premise of the game is that players will start off with a pistol, it could be a revolver base or a magazine based pistol.  From there, you are going around looking for recordings to find out more about the area that you are trying to escape.  Casing point though, it takes a backseat to the mechanics.One of the core concepts of this ""demo"" is that it is fairly thrilling to reload a pistol all the way through by manipulating each of its mechanisms in a fluid manner under pressure. The hammer, the chamber, the loading or unloading of the magazine all have dedicated buttons which gives this demo a big learning curve because it's not as simple as press ""R"" to reload your magazines anymore.The revolvers are simpler and take less time to learn to reload and ready for firing.As for the other parts of the game, the elements of the environment and the mechanical enemies are simple polygons.  It gets the job done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really interesting game, which makes the gun mechanics of ""hard"" military sims such as the Arma series look absolutely primitive. Here you have to manually reload a limited supply of rounds into clips and chamber rounds before they can be fired. As someone who's actually fired real world weapons, it's nice to see the real world mechanics of actually handing rounds and guns replicated faithfully in a videogame. There's no one button, instant reload here; and the game's all the better for it. The premise of the game is also interesting, too, and the procedurally generated levels allied to one-hit vulnerabilty and permadeath add lots of replayability - but  if there's one major flaw, the AI is *way* too twitchy. As an experiment in replicating real world gun mechanics in a virtual world, Receiver is an unqualified success - by playing it you'll gain a much greater understanding and respect for how handguns actually work - but as a game, slightly less agressive AI would greatly enhance the experience for those of us who don't have the reflexes of house flies on amphetamines.

												A must have.An FPS that lets you take full control of your weapon. No more R to reload, no more resupplying by walking over ammo, etc. One button to pull the slide, one to eject the magazine, one to put a round into the magazine, one to chamber a round, one to engage safety, one to eject a round, one to pick stuff up, one to fire... it does have a bit of a learning curve, but I can tell you it's really worth it. Once you've mastered your weapon, using it will be thrilling. You have to shoot drones that'll try to kill you. Once you die, you start over on a new, randomly generated map (well, more like existing rooms put together in a random order). It also has an eerie backstory and ""quest"", of which I'm not going to reveal anything other than you collect cassette tapes and listen to them.If you have ever played FPS games, corridor shooters, shoot-em-ups, whatever, you need to play this game.If you like guns, you absolutely need to play this game. I'm not especially into firearms, but this game made me more interested in them :)Cons: The game was made in about ten days (for a game jam), so it's far from polished. The graphics won't astonish you (think minimalistic Unity3D), and there are some optimization problems, but overall it's still a very enjoyable and definitely unique experience.Oh, and it's made by the Wolfire guys who are like the best indie devs ever.

												Receiver is the perfect game for anyone who more often than not finds themselves calling BS on Couter-Strike and  Just Cause. It takes one shot to kill you, which makes you incredibly cautious and gives you a sense of how you would handle waking up somewhere surrounded by sentry guns. You can't just go run past them shooting blindly. I think that multiplayer would be some of the most balanced and unique multiplayer to date, making you create muscle memory to reload faster than the enemy. Alas, I'll have to wait for multiplayer Receiver. This intriguing little gem was definitely worth five dollars.			",171,30,0,8,8,0,9

												Intriguing principle. This game is mostly a fun little exploration into more complex gun mechanics than we normally see, and while the controls are awkward, they add some depth to the game. The rest of the game is a survival-horror type affair, creeping around trying to use meagre ammunition supplies to take out sentries and explore further without dying. It's very difficult, and somewhat oddly so.5/10 - Interesting ideas, lacks depth or real meaning. Mostly novelty value.			",254,32,9,28,20,3,30

												After 30 minutes of messing with the pistol slide, taking poorly aimed pot shots at turrets and listening to the most terrible right wing sci-fi fanfiction ever on audiotape, I was left wondering how they could justify charging money for this. It's barely a game, more like a tech demo you'd get for free in a PC magazine demo disc in the 90's. Good thing I didn't pay for it. Thanks Humble Bundle, you saved me $5 AND destroyed my faith in the indie gaming community again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are so many thing you can do/have to do.Also the music and atmosphere makes it kinda creepy at times and i just love that feeling cause it helps with immersion in 2 am early morning....But in all seriousness, I love this game would give it a 8/10 however they could be more creative with menus and story.

												Never fired a handgun before? Not a red-blooded American? Then buy this game.It's a handgun firefight simulator. You have to load your magazines, check your safety, work the slide. You have to understand each weapon completely and be quick about it. It's the only game I've ever played with realistic firing mechanisms. I'm a gun owner, I love hunting and going in the woods to fire off some rounds. And until today, I've never touched a game that realistically portrayed how a firearm actually works. The only saddening part is the game doesn't have enough content and I'd love to see what they could have done with a real budget and a lot of time. Regardless, I recommend this title.

												Cool proof of concept, but the complete lack of explanation for how to operate a gun (without IRL experience) makes it frustrating to learn, even with the help overlay. The mechanic has potential - but the gameplay has to improve so that you know how to actually operate the gun, and where to shoot the enemies. A simple option to limit yourself to one kind of gun, and a step-by-step instruction manual on how to use it shouldn't be very hard to implement. Might be worth buying on sale, if you like experimental games.			",186,47,11,15,19,3,32

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this gameALSO NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is recommended, means that I did not enjoy it but it passed a bit of my level of expectations! Think twice before buying/playing this game(This only applies to some games that have been recommended, not all, please read above before reading the review below) Receiver is... meh, it is not a terrible game nor is it a fantastic game!The game was developed by Wolfire Games (the same developer as Overgrowth) for the 7-day FPS challenge, and I must say for 7 days, they have created quite a stable game.The gun mechanics and the realism of the gun handling is amazing, the animations for the guns are fantastic, well done to Wolfire Games!BUT the game has some serious issues:-The level of difficulty: The game is really hard, from beginning to end, once you die, it resets everything (kind of like a rogue-like game), it is randomly generated, the enemies are really hard and annoying and the tapes that you have to  collect are very hard to find. Once you found a number of tapes and you get killed, you lose everything, which can be quite annoying, as the enemies are difficult and sometimes just appear out of nowhere!The controls for the guns: They are extremely awkward, I can understand why they did it, because in real life, to handle a gun, it takes time and practice, but for game it is pretty annoying, the game does help you with a list of controls, but if you run out of a magazine with one of the game's enemies running after you/shooting at you, I don't think the list of controls will help in dire need of refilling a magazine with ammo, whilst focusing on the game and the list of controls (not for me anyway)! Level design: Although the levels are quite good, they can get really confusing and it put me off after a whileAmmo: Ammo is really scarce, and you can hardly find any ammo anywhere, once you lost your ammo, and you meet one of the enemies of the game, your ♥♥♥♥edCompatibility: The game is awful with compatibility, the game is developed with the Unity3D engine, and its frame rate just drops drastically in some areas, whereas other Unity3D games I've played, run fantastically on my gaming PCLevel of detail: The level of detail (excluding the gun designs) is bland, and very incomplete, I can understand for a 7-day development time, but Wolfire Games could of after the game finished the 7-day FPS challenge make the game a bit more detailed, but it seems that Wolfire Games just abandoned the game after they finished the 7-day FPS challengeNow to the recommendation, for its full price, I would not recommend it, BUT if it is either in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game then I would recommend it. RECOMMENDED :)  Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...  NOT RECOMMENDED :(  For its full price  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is wonderful. It's really easy to understand and even if you don't, you can always just hit ? for info. This is a game where reloading is a little more complicated than just hitting R. You have to go through a process to make sure your gun is in working order and that you can shot the f**k out of the machines coming to kill you. They've only made 2 machines but both can kill you easily if you don't pay attention. I won't say any more but I strongly recommend this game to anyone checking this game out. It will be worth your 5 bucks.			",57,5,0,12,1,0,1

												Receiver is a Gun-Shooting Simulator (basically). If you hope for a game with story and alot of enemies, action, drama and other stuff, then this game is prooobaly not for you RIGHT NOW. The game is still in alpha, and right now, you start at a random spot in the somehow-big map, with a gun, or you maybe not even start with a gun, maybe a flashlight, maybe both? but the simulation part is SO amazing. You have to take your time to actually learn how to switch magazine/bullets. luickly there is help menu....but I won't rate this game since its still in very very early stagebut its a fun game if you just learn how to do so, but you want more than your imagination, then wait some months before buying this game, so the delevopers have a chance to make the content more 'advanced'			",360,57,9,31,38,3,15

												A brilliant love child between a Slenderman-esque collection, 'LifeForce Tenka' future dystopic, and 'The Matrix'-like-conspiracy, rolled into a handgun simulation game.You have been dropped into an unfamiliar and alien world where all you have is your gun, an appropriate magazine (if you're not wielding the Smith & Wesson), and a random assortment of supplies. Your goal is to collect the tapes scattered throughout the game and reach a state of awakening, piecing your story together as you avoid the games treacherous falls and gun-totting, tazer-wielding ""Kill-Bots"".No two games you play will be the same, with randomised drops of tapes and ammo, unrelenting and uncomprimising sentry bots, and vivid and vague worlds randomly generated, which will leave you fearing, focused, frustrated, or flying-high, as you attempt to scrounge whatever little ammunition and disordered 8-tracks strewn among the highrise fortresses of a cyberpunk dystopia.

												Receiver is probably the most satisfying, and purest (in the sense of gameplay) pick-up-and-play title.  Not only is it directly based on your own readyness/carefulness, but also based on how you know either of the three weapons that you randomly tote, in various states, reserve ammo and placement.  No two playthroughs are the same; each are generated in different ways.The enemies are one of two, a spinning sentry turrent or the more dangerous air drone.  Each having there own weakpoints to learn and behaviour to adapt to.You can only take one bullet, which also brings up another thing about Reviever.  You die from one shot, stun or a two story drop.The weapons, the Glock 18, M1911A1 and Colt Revolver behave realistically aswell.  On top of that, reloading becomes a very important routine, that they all differ.  You need to not only extract the magazine of the 1911, but also swap magazines, load in the cartridges, either hit the slide lock or rack it.  With such a minimalist HUD, you need to count your shots, to drop a mag for inspection.Also nice touches such as the revolver casings expanding within the cylinder after use, requiring several attempts at the extractor and so on.All this makes such a satisfying 'in-betweener' game.  Thoroughly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every action the PC in another game would take when you hit ""R"" you have to do in sequence. If you do it wrong, the guns jam and you have to go through a completely different sequence as you eject the mag, clear the chamber, and reinsert rounds into the magazine.Should be given to anyone that claims that FPSes train people to use guns :VReccommended as a romp.

												You shoot robots and find tapes, ammo, and flashlights. To most people that's the whole game. I see it as more of a ""Hey kids, you think just because you play Call of ♥♥♥♥ing duty all day and whenever your parrents tell you to get off for whatever reason you♥♥♥♥♥♥and murder them, that you know how to use a gun? Well, show us! Come play this game called reciever, and remember, anything besides bullets and yourself that moves, shoot it!""This game does not have a health bar, but it's still easy to know how much health you have. This is because no matter where you are shot, you die on the first bullet, like in real life! Imagine that in a video game. So basically if you are alive you have 100 health (or 99 if you're a hard core metroid fan).There is no ammo counter. You need to count how many bullets are in a mag, and keep track of the ammount of bullets you fire. Or, just regularly check in on your ammo. You can either put in a new mag, assuming you spawn with one with actual ammo, or just insert bullets into the mag itself. As for the revolver, i just eject all bullets, and pick the ones i droped back up and put them in the gun. Easy.There are three guns. The Revolver, the Glock, and the 1911. I am partial to the Revolver, the glock is ok, and the 1911 is abysmal.The Revolver is exactly what it sounds like. It has 6 round capacity, and occasionally needs a hammer to be pulled down. The Glock is a pistol with a huge clip of which yet I am still unaware the full capacity too. If i were to wager a guess, i'd have to say maybe 32 bullets? It has two fireing modes. Semi automatic, and fully automatic. TIP: If you plan on actually trying to live, keep ammo, and ultimatly win the game, do not use fully automatic mode. It eats ammo like a mother humper and kicks like a kangaroo, and I can garentuee you next to no bullets will ever hit your target. This is not a game where you should ""spray and pray"".The 1911 is a terrible gun. It has so many standards compared to the other guns, that it's almost like a punishment to have. The max capacity for a mag is 8, and the bullets are as affective as blank bullets shooting something five miles away... right next to a kill drone. For some reason, unlike all the other guns, it has a safety. It also has a hammer which is really annoying to use, and I don't know if this is only me, but I can load a full mag, chamber a bullet, have the safety off and have the hammer down, be fully prepared, but the gun WILL... NOT... FIRE....... but you know, this only happens when there is a tape right in front of me.There are two types of killdrones in the game. The Hover-drone, and the killdrone turret. The hoverdrone is really annoying because it makes a really stupid sound, bounces all over the place, making it just about impossible to hit sometimes, and it has a really annoying sounding tazer that kills you in one hit, because as we all know, tazers kill people in under a second people. The killdrone turret is a sationary revolving turret with unlimited ammo that fires bullets that kill you in one hit. That's kinda self explanitory.Overall i think this game is great, just damn hard, and occasionally annoying if you have the 1911. The mechanics are great, like how you have to repeatedly press your walk key to run. This can be bad because sometimes it can just activate at any random time, but you know, this only happens when your right next to a  CLIFF... and it doesn't matter if you're crouched. If you start double tappin' that walk key you get right the ♥♥♥♥ up and start running. Even sometimes if you DON'T, it's like the computer say's ""NOPE."" and it kills you in a way that makes it seem like it's your fault. But all the con's in this game can be overlooked in one short sentence.The game was made in only seven days. For a game like this, thats incredible. I wish though that I could see wolfire games finish this and make it a whole game with more mechanics, fix some bugs, add new enemies, etc.I rate this game 8/10 for being perfect when you aren't running off cliffs for no reason and you don't have a 1911.As for the tapes, I'll let you listen to them yourself.

												Not worth full price, but an entertaining game. No saves, and one hit downs you, ending the game. Levels are randomised. And you have to manually use the parts of your gun (mapped to keys on your keyboard). It's a bit short, there are just two kinds of bad guy, and the graphics are poor and occasionally glitchy, but there's plenty of mileage in getting skilled and trying to fully complete the game in one playthrough.

												This is a simple game with a really cool idea. Its an FPS where you control every action involving firing, loading and unloading your gun. It takes an action that is often one button press in games and turns it a lot of steps, like pressing E to remove the magazine, then ~ to hostler the weapon, then z to put any spare bullets you find back into the magazine, ~ again to equip the gun again, Z to slide the magazine back into the gun, and then T to load a round into the chamber. Some guns have you press V to change firing modes or to turn on or off the saftey. It might sound an annoying ammount of things to deal with but when you are doing it successfully its pretty rad. Its a really short game with only 2 enemies and maybe 3 guns but its a unique enough experience that its worth a buy.			",146,29,2,25,12,0,15

												The goal of the game is to collect eleven(if I remember correctly) tapes scattered across the very big complex filled with gun turrets and flying stun drones aiming to stop you. I've gotten maybe five tapes on my greates run. It's hard as a pedophile in a kindergarden, but good. This is not a game you pick up and play for hours at a time.

I don't want to put the complex controls in the minus column because they grow on you and if you're like me you'll wish more shooters adopted a similar system.			",149,36,2,38,21,0,21

												A simplistic yet endearing game. The plot is barebones, relayed to you only through collectible tapes hidden throughout the world. The game takes place in a seemingly abandoned building inhabited by robots and machines out to kill you. This is where the gameplay shines. It's an FPS, yes, but you only carry a single pistol with VERY limited ammunition. In addition to this, you have to go through EVERY single step of using a gun. You'd have to manually insert the rounds into the magazine, insert the magazine, release the safety, chamber the round, and take aim all manually. Reloading has no automation whatsoever. Even then, you have to keep track of any ammo you have by checking the magazine as well as checking the chamber manually. On top of that, you die in one hit, while enemies take two to three hits on average.That's the main premise of the game, the interaction with the firearm. It's a bit shaky at first, but when you reload a gun just through muscle memory alone, it's the greatest feeling.Oh yeah. One more thing. You're gonna need that flashlight. If you don't spawn with it, you best find it.			",172,16,4,22,5,1,7

												Despite the flaws included in being a 7 day FPS entry, I still seem to be drawn back to Reciever. It's frustrating, because at some point you'll forget to add bullets to your magazine or you'll stumble while trying to run from one of the many hellish floating zappy robots that inhabits Reciever's levels, but the simple element of having to treat your gun like a real firearm makes Reciever something else. It gains more imersiveness than could be added by having Tomb Raider (2013)'s visuals or Half Life 2's character animations. It makes the game more of a realization that you are not the killing machine Call of Duty has trained you to be. It shouts in your face, ""you can't even run from a fan with a taser strapped to it!""It might also be the quick loading time that makes Reciever an easy game to get into, usually I only end up playing 15 minutes before getting frustrated that I got the revolver again (I don't really like the revolver, it loses the complexity that the 1911 and the Glock have), only to come back half an hour later for more. Reciever may not really be a game, but it certainly shows that if you add complexity to any game mechanic, the game might be more interesting.			",60,6,1,4,13,0,3

												♥♥♥♥ this game is Hard. WIth a capital H!While it may not be the prettiest game, it is one of the most engaging I have ever played. It pits you off in a random place in the map, with a random gun and a random amount of supplies. This causes every match to be completly different. Its quality is its realisticness, no not the graphics, but the gameplay. Because of this the gunplay is AWESOME! While at first it may seem quite daunting, learning all the many keys needed to operate a firearm, it becomes second nature by the end of the game. At first this gunplay is annoying, but once you get used to it, you will find reloading a fun and smooth task. Speaking of realism, there is no health. BAM! One shot, you're dead. This makes the gunfights about accuracy and timing, making every shot extremely tense.While this game may not be worth its full price, the $0.99 I spent on an onsale copy was definetly well spent.

												This game is an FPS. That deserves more praise for its work.What's so great about this ""Call of Duty ripoff""?For an FPS, the game doesn't focus on shooting. Not at all.It focuses on taking your time. And focuses on being as technical as possible with its reloading system.Lets make an example right here.To reload a revolver. Button 1 to show cylinderButton 2, 2-3 times to empty the cylinderButton 3 about 6 times to put in each individual bullet.Button 4 to close cylinder.With a pistol.Button 1 to take out clip.Button 2 to put away gun.Spam button 3 to put in each individual bullet into clip.Button 2 to take out gun again.Button 4 to put in clip.Button 5 to♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun, and put the bullet in place, ready to fire. (If needed.)Put that in a situation where you are in need of reloading, and conserving ammo. Then you have Reciever.This is a good thing, for it introduces a new type of strategy to your combat, and how you play the game. Unlike Run-And-Gun Simulator.The story is very..Interesting. I am not going to spoil it for you. But its not something to write home about, in my eyes. But its something that is newBut okay, every game has cons to it. What are some in this game?1.)  1-Hit-Kills. I can sort of forgive this aspect. Since the game does explain that you are horribly weak and ill. And you woke up on the top of a building, which layout you cannot recognise.2.) No more than 2 enemies. I don't care if you spam enemy 1 in one place. With some enemy 2 sprinkled on. We have 2 enemies. And that is lazy.3.) I wouldn't say this is a problem with the game. But I'm going to compare SC: Chaos Theory with this subject. Here we go.The lag. The horrible framerate. Its hard to control your guns and your escape with it. It ticks me off to be trying to run away from a flying tazer, and have a horrible FPS while doing so. Now, lets compare it with Chaos Theory. SC:CT looks very AAA Title for an Xbox to PC port. And with these quite stunning graphics, the game runs like butter on a hot pan. Reciever just feels clunky with this. And I've set everything on low. Even windowing the game didn't help.Thats pretty much all the complaints I have on this game, but those complaints still don't ruin the game that much. It is still enjoyable. And a good time-waster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game (if you can call it that) is way too hard. The enemies appear aout of nowhere and kill you instantly on sight. Even if it was easier, the game has no point, or goal. This is only interesting as a demo of gun mechanics, not as a $5 game. Run out of ammo while being chased? forget about reloading, you have to look through the help message and do a bunch of bs then youre dead too late, try again. so frustrating.

Receiver is a simple game in design, but that simplicity goes a long way in the amount of effort it takes to move forward.Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Rainbow Six, along with the undertones of the world controlling you. This might be the best idea for Receiver. The game is very barebones in gameplay, but it's exactly that element that changes how you play the game compared to other first-person shooters. This is hardcore FPS at its finest, and you'll be shocked to know just how much work you need to put in to get through it all.It has a roguelight element to it, which to this game, means you have a small variety of guns that you will spawn with, along with a specific quantity of ammunition, as well as magazines, based on the weapon. The equipment also has randomized properties. You may need to prime the weapon, you may need to turn the safety off, you may need to ensure that your six-shooter is full in all barrels. It goes a long way, and over time, you'll be adapted to this, which shows another element that the game has: it disciplines you. You WILL die if you neglect one detail, so don't overlook anything.Speaking of dying, you will die. You will probably die a lot. That's because it's a one-hit kill game. You get hit at all, it's over, and you start anew. Doesn't seem new, huh? Well, admittedly not, but there's several details the game focuses on for you to succeed. Specific hit zones on your enemies. Blind spots. Corners, timing, even your gun has an arc after a certain distance that warrants you be a bit more methodical... Until you're spotted. Now you need to find and hit their weak spot. Miss the spot? Pray your next shot doesn't. It does? Say goodbye. And that is yet another element: Be calm. If you don't, you risk missing the shot.There's actually a few weak spots on all your enemies, and it sets a slight dynamic for how your enemy is defeated, and what happens next. You can shoot out the tazer on the cyclone bots, and that may leave you annoyed to hell and back as they fly around, distracting you and wasting your ammo as they fly around you, and through you, which is disorienting as all hell.You must be tactical, conservative, watchful, and completely aware. Your ammo can fade quickly, your magazines will be emptied rapidly, and if you don't run when you need to, you'll screw up, and fail to reload as you attempt to. The controls go a long way to emphasize that as well. It definitely doesn't feel traditional, which makes sense, because it isn't. It isn't even comparable to games like Takedown: Red Sabre or Insurgency. You go at one speed, and crouching does little except expand your mobility among the level. The focus is completely on your location relative to the enemies, and your defense/offense.Remember my explaining the game in layman's terms? That sets the story's tone too. The story is as such: You are a receiver, left in a sort of dream state or second reality. It's in the second reality that you've learned of the first reality, and that you are among a select few who survive a mind kill, destroying all who have been poisoned by corporations and media... all except the receivers. Your goal is to find 11 tapes scattered across the large building complex you're in, and be awakened, released from the body provided by the second reality, and brought forth to the first reality. Meanwhile, the corporation that executed the mind kill know of the receivers as well, and have designed more suitable forms of killing equipment to stop you in this second reality. If you die in the second reality, you are defined to be sealed, and cannot transcend to the first reality.Sounds crazy right? Well, it is. And again, you must find 11 tapes to transcend. Die, and you start over. Admittedly, it's a short game, but it's the difficulty and effort required that makes it worth it all. This game will not mess around. It's kill or be killed, and the game will make sure you are killed most.Final note, the game runs in the Unity3D engine, and surprisingly, is very bad in performance. I am shocked to know I get frame drops at 720p considering my specs. I've played Unity3D games that seemed far more demanding, and subsequently, perform much better than this game. Optimization faults, maybe? Either way, it isn't absolutely jarring, though framedrops can be bad if you find yourself in a risky situation.Overall, Receiver is probably the best hardcore FPS I've played this year, and probably of all time. It is simple, it focuses on the gunplay and strategy over all things, and bar controls, I can jump into this game and lose myself trying to make progress. It is an excellent grab, and if you didn't score it from Humble Bundle's free summer games, I think it is work every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not a game for everyone so wether someone recommended this game or not is almost entirely based on their taste in games and as such introduce some bias. That being said I will now impart some of my bias upon you. Reciever is an interseting game to say the least: no fancy graphics, minimal to no story, and a difficulty on a level of reality unobtainable by another game in this genre. Where Reciever truely shines is its delivery of narative through gameplay. There are a few (11 to be exacy) tapes throughout the game that have recordings on them that help explain the basic premise (the  goal of the game being to collect all 11), but the entirety of the feel and the lessons this game imparts (as any game worth its salts has at least some knowledge to impart) are based in its mechanics. This game takes guns very seriously: they kill. You take one bullet in this game and you die. Not to mention, as many comments will tell you, they ain't easy to operate (E, ~, 2, 3, ~, Z, R, F to reload?). Which leads to the conveince of theme. This game is hard. It is almost pointless to expect to win with any sense of ease; which is exactly what the narritive delivers. Without spoiling too much, you can essentially die endlessly in this game. A never ending cycle of death, failure and pain. Sounds like a message to me (not to mention the recordings speaking of a dystopian society). This coupled with the game's core mechanics being gun manipulation means that the narritive is almost entirely non-verbal, which is fantastic. Again, I do not reccommend this game to everyone (it is rather artsy and only made in a week), but is excellent for what it is, and I hope we can all learn something about guns from something other than Battlefield, CoD, Halo, etc where they're just tools. I wish you a good day, and thanks for listening to my ramblings on :) Cheers!			",33,5,0,6,2,0,1

												Ah, Receiver. Don't let the complexity of the controls deter you from experiencing this marvelous game. Receiver is a game... well simulator... sort of... that focuses on knowing how to operate your weapons. Most FPS games you push a button to reload and it's done. BORING! In Receiver, the key is not to have good aim and press a button, it's to know the mechanism of the gun itself. You can't just push a button to change your clip, you must eject the mag, swap it for another, and place the new mag in the gun and chamber a bullet. Much more than just ""Pressing a button."" Receiver is an excellent game to play if you have knowledge of actual gun mechanics... and a PC with a good GPU. I'm sorry, but my laptop's Intel (R) HD GPU just doesn't cut it.			",40,3,0,3,8,0,1

												I grabbed Receiver because I liked the level of detail required to operate the handguns and wanted something to play while downloading Wasteland 2. However, there are almost no textures, the word looks horrible, the enemies are unimaginative, and the tapes are SO ANNOYING. You don't even get any say as to what gun you get, and the revolver is is the worst. The gun mechanics are the only thing this game has going for it since it is awful all-around.All that being said, why can't I stop playing it???			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It ain't pretty. It ain't easy. The story is sufficiently sci-fi and unnecessary. But you gotta give these guys credit for making one of the most engrossing weapon experiences you'll ever have, all as a product of a 7 day challenge. 5 bucks? Give it to the people who need it the most in the gaming industry.Tech demo/proof of concept, whatever you want to call it.

												I've always had a soft-spot for FPS that had realistic guns. Going to COD (first one) from MOH was a great feeling as the sights were actually used. Receiver took this to the next level with a detailed tactical reload, ammunition management, and a somewhat annoying ""one-shot yer dead"" life system. There's no doubt that this was rushed out but the gameplay is straight-forward and the ""plot"" is acceptable if not gripping. I would love to see this refined into a better game, keeping the gun mechanics and improving everything else.			",145,42,4,15,44,1,19

												7 DAYSthat's all this was alotted for when the project was made, as a competition piece of brand new un explored gaming, i find this to be very good, i got it for free, as i expect most people to ""want"" something for their money, you'll be paying for something you don't want, on the whole, this game is fantastic, i find it very engaging and simple, yet complex and boring, the idea behind the game is brilliant, if you want to play a game you have no familiarity with, brand new controls and cool level design, despite the lack of textures, i suggest you try this game, i can't stress the inginuity with the 7 days this was made in.some say the levels design is repetitive and boring, but that's the thing, how would YOU react to finding yourself here? having to operate a gun with it's proper details, defend yourself for unkown reasons, the tension, the audio the atmosphere in this game can get really intense, as a side note there is cheats available to help with completion if you find the game comes across unfair and your bullets don't hit where you fire. and the slow motion cheat can make things look really cool.the god mode makes it really easy but alllows for mistakes to be corrected, don't forget in this scenario, you are vulnerable, not a regenerating cybernetic undefeatable mass of intelligence like most games make you out to be, and death is death, it's a restart and a new starting point, new gu and new magazine set, so the start can be unfair with a few bullets and a mag or great with 3 mags and a ton of bullets. the controls are also available for on screen play, no pausing needed but you need to be quick if you are being chased.good luck.

												If there was a neutral button, I'd pick it. Reciever is an unfinished game that needs much polish, and very needed updates. This was made for 7FPS, but the overall expansions have only added little content. If this had been in development a few months longer it could have been pretty amazing (or if not made for a contest). The game is pretty low budget in the graphics department, the art style has a certain uniqueness to it that should attract only those who love minimalistic low-res 3D polygons.  The gameplay is what compansates for many other areas, and should keep you waiting around for more. The gun mechanics are with the most extensive realism I've seen protrayed that may other games haven't. The animations are well done surprisingly for the guns. Take all the ficton crap from other games and action movies you've seen and throw it out the window, Reciever will teach you proper. The story isn't that impressive but is interesting to listen to the tapes, it feels like a different storyline each time you collect the tapes in variating order. TLDR;SummaryGameplay- Provides some moments of action and is intense whenever nearing an enemy. Gun mechanics are over-the-top realistic. Graphics- Somewhat crappy, not without charm though. Audio- One cool song and some minor sound effects. Not much here. Animations- Very detailed and each gun has it's own flare. Story- Interesting but not engaging. Overall? I can't recommend Reciever as a whole, as it is flowing with flaws and horrible optimization. Very incomplete, but gameplay provides a few hours. Not the best deal for $5. Has some replayibility but is a decent game. Mostly just neat to see a showcase of gun realism, the main attraction to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More a gun operation simulator than a shooter, Reciever replaces the standard “Press R to Reload” with a full tour of all the moving parts. First, the magazine must be ejected and the gun holstered. Only then can the magazine be fed with bullets and loaded back into the gun which then must be racked before a bullet ever reaches the chamber. It can be a difficult and confusing task, especially with the pressure of an active turret nearby, but it is satisfying and forces a level of interaction with the weapon beyond the normal point-and-click to remove obstacles. The scarcity of both supplies and fancy textures keeps the focus on that relationship between the player and the gun mechanics. The only distraction, other than the constantly looming threat of permanent death, is the tapes littered throughout the randomly generated terrain which either serve to set up a backdrop for the action or just spout the sort of nonsense you've come to expect from the street corner next to the liquor shop. The whole thing's over before a conclusion can be reached on that subject which just left me wishing someone would take this near blank slate and mod in a context for it all.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Think you'd survive an action movie if you had a gun?Spoiler: No, no you wouldn't.This is the FPS equivalent of Super Meat Boy, and it has what are indisputably the most immersive gun mechanics of any game ever.The gameplay itself, outside of the gun mechanics is as simple as its minimalist aesthetic, but severely punishing for any misstep or corner left unchecked. It only takes one bullet to bring you down, and there's no going back. The game has a permadeath system, and any failure brings you back to square one with randomized equipment at a randomized spot of the randomized world.Tasks which would be simple motions for action heroes are challenging feats here. It may take you several playthroughs to swiftly reload a colt 1911a, but to finally accomplish a swift reload is incredibly satisfying.Receiver is Wolfire Games' submission for 7DFPS, and though it lacks polish, it's an extremely successful experiment in game design.

												 It's basically a first person shooter with very realistic gun mechanics. For example, to reload a revolver you first open the cylinder, then you separately take out the casings, you put the new ones in and you close it. You then have to pull back the hammer and stuff. It's quite complicated but it's a lot of fun once you get used to it. You also have to shoot ground sentries which shoot you and flying drones which electrocute you at a close range all whilst trying to find all 11 tapes.This game might not be for everyone but I personally really like this game. Also, I got this for free from Humble Bundle's End of Summer Sale so I'm not sure if it's worth its price. ",251,60,7,21,38,4,27

												Ah, Receiver. Don't let the complexity of the controls deter you from experiencing this marvelous game. Receiver is a game... well simulator... sort of... that focuses on knowing how to operate your weapons. Most FPS games you push a button to reload and it's done. BORING! In Receiver, the key is not to have good aim and press a button, it's to know the mechanism of the gun itself. You can't just push a button to change your clip, you must eject the mag, swap it for another, and place the new mag in the gun and chamber a bullet. Much more than just ""Pressing a button."" Receiver is an excellent game to play if you have knowledge of actual gun mechanics... and a PC with a good GPU. I'm sorry, but my laptop's Intel (R) HD GPU just doesn't cut it.			",40,3,0,3,8,0,1

And you have to manually use the parts of your gun (mapped to keys on your keyboard). It's a bit short, there are just two kinds of bad guy, and the graphics are poor and occasionally glitchy, but there's plenty of mileage in getting skilled and trying to fully complete the game in one playthrough.

												A simplistic yet endearing game. The plot is barebones, relayed to you only through collectible tapes hidden throughout the world. The game takes place in a seemingly abandoned building inhabited by robots and machines out to kill you. This is where the gameplay shines. It's an FPS, yes, but you only carry a single pistol with VERY limited ammunition. In addition to this, you have to go through EVERY single step of using a gun. You'd have to manually insert the rounds into the magazine, insert the magazine, release the safety, chamber the round, and take aim all manually. Reloading has no automation whatsoever. Even then, you have to keep track of any ammo you have by checking the magazine as well as checking the chamber manually. On top of that, you die in one hit, while enemies take two to three hits on average.That's the main premise of the game, the interaction with the firearm. It's a bit shaky at first, but when you reload a gun just through muscle memory alone, it's the greatest feeling.Oh yeah. One more thing. You're gonna need that flashlight. If you don't spawn with it, you best find it.			",172,16,4,22,5,1,7

												I've sunk quite a bit into this game. It's not flawless, and bitterly unforgiving, but it's a challenge. There's a lot of games where you get ""better"", but more in the way that you warm up rather than actually getting better at the game itself. Reciever, however, is a game you get better at. You start off carefully studying the keybindings, fumbling with your weapon, but the more you play the more it becomes second nature.   Reciever is the QWOP or Surgeon Simulator of First Person Shooters. The fun isn't just in the game itself - The story and voice acting are well below part - The fun is in learning the controls and doing that little bit better every time.			",82,10,0,4,6,1,6

												Receiver presents an interesting idea, but the presentation is not good. I am on a Linux system, and the low framerate makes the game basically unplayable. This is not because my machine doesn't meet the requirements for running it - there are many other people with the same issues. There is no option, on Linux, to change the resolution or graphic settings. Instead, you are given a small window to play in, which combined with the frequent framerate problems resulted in a less than enjoyable experience for me.  These problems, or so I have read, may be because the game uses the Unity engine.At $4.95 it is relatively inexpensive, but still I regret not purchasing another game instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know the number is correct, but I can hardly believe I've put 11 hours into this game. It was a 7-day FPS that spawned Receiver, and it shows. There is almost nothing to actually *do* in the game. The ""kill-drones,"" being the only things in the game world other than you, are either stationary and simple, or simple, flying, and bloody agrivating. And yet.. I still continue to play. The gun mechanics; you can play with your gun, brandishing it, flipping the safety, loading your gun bullet by bullet, clip by clip. Dropping your extra clips accidently with the wrong button. I just keep coming back. And the price is right.			",214,85,3,18,21,3,27

												Ever wondered why firearms aren't pictured in a realistic way in games? This game is here to illustrate that. Instead of pressing R to reload, you go through the entire process of extracting empty shells and inserting bullets, as well as cocking, locking and loading and whatever else guns do, and it's /tedious/, especially with multiple enemies chasing you down.It's not a bad game as such, but it does illustrate how realism isn't always good. If you should buy and/or play it depends on how high your tolerance for fiddly, slow, realistic gunplay is. I wish I could choose ""Maybe"" as a recommendation.			",258,79,6,30,22,2,32

												This is probably the most realistic shooter I've ever seen. It's not just some ""point-and-shoot"" game, you actually have to control each part of the gun. It's not as easy as ""press R to reload"", once you run out of bullets, you have to take out the magazine, put a new one in (or fill up the old one), put a bullet in the chamber, and♥♥♥♥♥♥the gun, and THEN fire. Every part of the gun mechanics in this game is pretty much exactly how you'd have to do it in real life (minus the whole finding random unused bullets lying everywhere). It's so hard to get used to at first (especially with all the lag), but this is still a really cool game for such a low price.			",143,32,1,16,14,0,6

												Great fun for such a simple game (it was made in 7 days, which occasionally shows). Very difficult to complete (seems that quite few people have) since if you die, you have to start again, and 1 bullet will kill you. It's really tense since enemy/item/your spawning is random, so every time is like the first, having to check corners and move around tactically, with one wrong step meaning you have to start again.Realistic weapon handling too, which is fluid once you get the hang of the controls - you're in charge of each major moving part of the weapon (slide, safety, mag, hammer, etc,) so weapon knowledge is a big plus. Since a recent update you also may spawn with either an M1911, a revolver of some kind (a bit fiddly to reload, but quite simple otherwise), and a Glock 17 (with a full-auto mod, kind of pointless as ammo is so scarce).There's a couple playthroughs on YouTube, check 'em out!anyway GET IT IT'S SURPRISINGLY ACE			",188,25,16,8,14,1,3

												An incredible gun simulator. Every action you would perform in a reload is controled by indivdual keystrokes.Instead of simply pressing the reload button you need to eject the magazine, either drop it or put it back in your inventory or refill it, put a new magazine in and rack the slide or release it.There is a decent modding community. There are mods that add new guns and also new features that make the game even better.In essence, it's totally worth the money if you like guns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wonderful indie FPS with a super real look at handguns in a neo-corporate future. You spawn randomly in a building for purposes of absorbing 11 cassette tapes. These tapes are scattered through out a business high-rise filled with sentry guns and flying shock drones. You are super fragile and reloading your pistol or revolver takes around 10 seconds. If you die, you respawn somewhere else in the building with different equipment.  Pretty fun if you can remember how to reload a pistol and just run from everything. I'm not even sure if you can take out a sentry gun with your pistol. Wonderful ambient noises and music that totally fits the setting. It feels like you're starring in a late 80's action movie.

If you don't like shooting boring robots and turrents then you'll be like me. In between this game. I love having only so many clips and even fewer bullets. Shooting and keeping track of how many bullets i have left. Scavaging the apartment rooms, sinks, toilets, and sometimes couch cushions for ammo. I love the feel of the game that i still am not completely sure what is going on and the story is literally given in a random order each time with few details leaving me with piecing it together gaining constant Ah Hah moments when i've achieved a fact! This game definately hits home with things i want in my game. Innovation on FPS, replayability, and i can play quick session, or long rides. I do only wish that i was not fighting robots and turrents. The literal most boring of enemies! Its a dark, lifeless, seperated world, cloaked in mystery! Why can't i face demons, or Mr. Smiths or something. Oh well, that is my one complaint and that should not turn you away! Hope you escape this dreamlike world with the knowledge of the reciever!

												This is not a game for everyone so wether someone recommended this game or not is almost entirely based on their taste in games and as such introduce some bias. That being said I will now impart some of my bias upon you. Reciever is an interseting game to say the least: no fancy graphics, minimal to no story, and a difficulty on a level of reality unobtainable by another game in this genre. Where Reciever truely shines is its delivery of narative through gameplay. There are a few (11 to be exacy) tapes throughout the game that have recordings on them that help explain the basic premise (the  goal of the game being to collect all 11), but the entirety of the feel and the lessons this game imparts (as any game worth its salts has at least some knowledge to impart) are based in its mechanics. This game takes guns very seriously: they kill. You take one bullet in this game and you die. Not to mention, as many comments will tell you, they ain't easy to operate (E, ~, 2, 3, ~, Z, R, F to reload?). Which leads to the conveince of theme. This game is hard. It is almost pointless to expect to win with any sense of ease; which is exactly what the narritive delivers. Without spoiling too much, you can essentially die endlessly in this game. A never ending cycle of death, failure and pain. Sounds like a message to me (not to mention the recordings speaking of a dystopian society). This coupled with the game's core mechanics being gun manipulation means that the narritive is almost entirely non-verbal, which is fantastic. Again, I do not reccommend this game to everyone (it is rather artsy and only made in a week), but is excellent for what it is, and I hope we can all learn something about guns from something other than Battlefield, CoD, Halo, etc where they're just tools. I wish you a good day, and thanks for listening to my ramblings on :) Cheers!			",33,5,0,6,2,0,1

However, there are almost no textures, the word looks horrible, the enemies are unimaginative, and the tapes are SO ANNOYING. You don't even get any say as to what gun you get, and the revolver is is the worst. The gun mechanics are the only thing this game has going for it since it is awful all-around.All that being said, why can't I stop playing it???			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorta interesting, got it for free from the Humble Bundle site. After playing it for ~30 min or so I quickly lost my patience. The difficulty of the game lies soley within trying to manage your gun. FSM help you if you start with the revolver! You have you eject casings (be carefuil not to eject your live ammo), spin the chamber, hope you're lined up with a live bullet, fire, eject casings, find ammo, hold your gun up. Enemies are very unforgiving (they pretty much one shot you), so good luck!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a different one in the FPS genre. Instead of the 1 button reload, the reload system requires you to press numerous buttons in a sequence to actually reload it, just like in real-life. With a perma-death system and a eerie atmosphere, this is a great game for killing time and playing something different from the generic FPS genre. It may be hard to get the hang of the first time but with a couple of minutes getting to know your surroundings and your guns, you could even finish the game!			",36,2,0,2,6,0,7

												Not a game so much as an experiment with gameplay. You end up battling the controls as much as the turrets and drones- which is considerably more enjoyable than it sounds.Grab it on the cheap if you can- the price of a candy bar or cup of coffee, for something that'll last a few hours longer.

												I would definately recommend this game to those that want a non-cliche fps with very interesting physics. They controls are a little difficult to handel at first, but once you pick them up the game plays fantastically. It is also very very realistic, which is always a nice bonusOverall, well worth the £3:99 (some amount of dollars). Not very fast paced, but a refreshing change from most shooters.

												Impossible realistic fun. Forces you to assemble and disassemble your gun to reload it the correct way with multiple button inputs. If you get shot, expect to die with little to no warning besides the hum propellers or the whir of a turret. Collecting the tapes can be a pain without a navigation HUD, but that's what makes the game fun.Definitely recommend for those looking for a new and interesting type of shooter.

												Sorta simple game. The main goal is for you to collect 10 tapes, while trying not to get killed by the physco-robot rapists. Also, you have to reload the gun manually which also happens to be the main point of the game since it was after all, an experment.Just don't expect HD graphics though. The lights sometimes bug out. Also, if you're playing on a lower-end computer, it may start to lag once you gotten around 5-6 tapes as the game starts to spawn more bots.Overall, I say it is okay-ish.			",26,3,0,0,3,0,2

												If there was a neutral button, I'd pick it. Reciever is an unfinished game that needs much polish, and very needed updates. This was made for 7FPS, but the overall expansions have only added little content. If this had been in development a few months longer it could have been pretty amazing (or if not made for a contest). The game is pretty low budget in the graphics department, the art style has a certain uniqueness to it that should attract only those who love minimalistic low-res 3D polygons.  The gameplay is what compansates for many other areas, and should keep you waiting around for more. The gun mechanics are with the most extensive realism I've seen protrayed that may other games haven't. The animations are well done surprisingly for the guns. Take all the ficton crap from other games and action movies you've seen and throw it out the window, Reciever will teach you proper. The story isn't that impressive but is interesting to listen to the tapes, it feels like a different storyline each time you collect the tapes in variating order. TLDR;SummaryGameplay- Provides some moments of action and is intense whenever nearing an enemy. Gun mechanics are over-the-top realistic. Graphics- Somewhat crappy, not without charm though. Audio- One cool song and some minor sound effects. Not much here. Animations- Very detailed and each gun has it's own flare. Story- Interesting but not engaging. Overall? I can't recommend Reciever as a whole, as it is flowing with flaws and horrible optimization. Very incomplete, but gameplay provides a few hours. Not the best deal for $5. Has some replayibility but is a decent game. Mostly just neat to see a showcase of gun realism, the main attraction to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1)  This game was made in 7 days.  Yes, 7.2)  It isn't pretty, but it works, and it works well.3)  It features realistic gun handling skills interms of loading and reloading.4)  An entirely randomized layout makes for (argueably) infinite replayability.5) If you get shot, you die.  No HP, no medkits, no healing potions.  D. E. D. Dead.   Receiver is based almost entirely upon realistic gun handling.  There is a distinct lack of surface textures, but you can't expect the Mona Lisa in a game that was made in such a short time.  I picked this game up on sale for about $2.50, but I would recommend buying it even at its original price.  Receiver takes a bit of getting used to, and the story line certainly isn't unique, but it is quite fun either way.  A perfet playthrough can see the game completed in about 30-40 minutes or so.  But it took me almost three hours of overall gameplay to reach that point.  For under a dollar per hour of enjoyment, I'm happy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gun mechanics are brilliant, and as a technical demonstrator this is almost flawless; chiefest among flaws being the controlset, and the inability to change it. Fumbling for an obscure  key while reloading is extremely frustrating.Being a tech demo, the gameplay is terrible. It shows great promise, and I would like to see the investment made to make this a fully fledged title. Kickstarter, anyone?Pay the five bucks. Take a look. Well worth it, even if you only play for ten minutes.			",217,67,5,24,32,3,47

If you want a challenge and dont care how a game looks, but rather plays, then this game could be for you.The realistic simulation of the firearms is a refreshing change from other games, just wish this existed as a multiplayer vs free for all.The random level builds ever time you play/die is great its never fully the same, but the loading of the next part of the level has gotten me killed a few times.If you try this game just remember, you will die a lot.

												Receiver is a fun little FPS game which focuses on some pretty advanced and realistic gun control mechanics.You control every aspect of using whichever firearm you randomly spawn with from manually loading bullets into the magazine to removing the magazine and pulling the slide.You roam around the randomly generated map collecting bullets, flashlights and tapes which give you the insight into Receiver's background story. You win once you have collected all 11 tapes.In my opinion, the price of £4 is well worth the experience of originally trying to work out the weapon mechanics to roaming around taking out the hostile drones like a professional.There are also mods for Receiver which expand upon the original three firearms and include bug fixes and optimisations which I highly recommend.

												This is one of those games that had tons of potential but was never worked on again. There's maybe an hour's worth of content, annoying enemies, playstation 1 graphics and revolutionary, interesting and complex gun mechanics. The idea is there (limited ammo and realistic shooting/reloading), and that part is excecuted fantastically, but the rest makes it feel more like a tech demo/browser game than a $5 game on steam. With a lot more polish, this could turn into something amazing. I'd recommend passing on this unless it's on sale for a dollar.			",214,28,3,13,17,4,15

												Reciever proves that it doesn't take great graphics or slick special effects to create an engaging and immersive gaming experience. The biggest feature of this game is its elaborate gun handling mechanics, what that means is we are the ones in total control of our weapons.  From pulling back the slide to manually loading rounds into an empty clip, it gives us a deep level of control, and the kind of adrenaline you'd believe you feel like you were in a real fire fight.   Now couple that with the games' randomized levels and unordered storytelling, Reciever puts this game high up on my recommendation list.			",189,44,0,26,24,2,20

												Whether your looking  for a realistic Indie FPS, a fun and exciting new twist on first-person shooters, or a realistic gun simulator with a classic arcade feel, there is something for everybody in a game that can be fun but rather burdensome oftentimes.The game features realistic gun errors, (i.e jamming, safe reloads, and bullets getting stuck in the cylinder) excellent gun mechanics, and awesome bullet physics. The game while fun, has some major performance issues. I will often be on an important part of the game when suddenly I start to get major lag. This should not be happening on a game like this, as the graphics are not even that good. This takes away from much of the game's fun. When the game is not lagging (something which is a rare commodity) it is extremely fun to play. When you encounter a flying mind tech you feel this true sense of fear for your life as you either fight or run. Shooting and reloading the gun is rather interesting because every single part of the gun is controllable. While this adds uniqueness to the game it slows the pace down considerably and has nothing to help speed it up.The verdict: An exciting and adrenaline pumping experiment that is hindered majorly by its massive performance issues. While the game is fun to play it badly needs to be optimized. If you have beast gaming computer or something ""good enough"" to run most games, then I would definitely recommend picking this up!Overall rating: 6/10Presentation: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 5/10Sound: 8/10Difficulty: 8/10Lasting Appeal: 6.5Overall rating: 6/10			",90,20,2,2,1,1,3

												Fascinating experiment, sort of a survival horror FPS that runs light on visceral horror but heavy on tension.  The detailed gun mechanics were frustrating at first but gave a sense of accomplishment once I got the patterns down.  (I often found myself compulsively checking the colt/glock to make sure a round was chambered and spinning the revolver cylinder ""for luck"" before snapping it shut.)The randomized tapes remind me a little of Dear Esther's non-linear storytelling (if someone did a Dear Esther/Receiver mashup, I would buy that in a heartbeat :)If you are frustrated by making mistakes and learning through trial-and-error, you will probably not enjoy this game.  To get anywhere, you will die and restart.  A lot.  Bullets are scarce, and you die in one hit, so it's not a game for people who want to rush around blowing things away.  Much of my enjoyment of the game came from efficient use of those scarce bullets and outwitting the drones.If you are interested in game design and how design decisions and minimalist storytelling affect the player experience, this is definitely worth a look.

												this game is stunning. the scenario or the overall graphics are not what you would find in a triple A game, BUT THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE WHILE IS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. the soundtrack blends itself with the overall sound, making you feel imersed... the guns and guns animations are really smooth and satisfying, seeing we can do anything we want with the gun, in a really accurate way. And last but not least, the story. oh.... the story is so amazing! when you find the first tape and you listen to it with the song as a background noise, it feels so deep and REAL.... i just want to find all of them to unveil all of the story....The only downside i see is the dificulty with the robots. with the different (but really nice) aiming system, it is a little bit hard to get past all of the turrets or robots, and they are too overpowered, for example, they have 1 hit kills, while you must shoot the weak (moving) spot of them... oh well it just adds to the challenge!All in all, 9/10 amazing game!

												This is a great game if you like messing with hand guns, but don't have any in real life.  If you do have one in real life, this game is the equivalent of learning how to translate what you know about operating a firearm to key strokes, running around some building-like place generated by a computer in 1992, and dying to robots.Some other reviews mentioned muscle memory, experiencing the fear of death, FUN, etc. I experienced none of that. Because the rooms all look essentially the same, and enemies are rather sparce, you start feeling as though you're running around in circles VERY quickly.  And you're essentially doing so looking for an excuse to operate your firearm.I do love the mechanics of handling the weapons.  Take this concept, add a few dozen different models (including long guns obviously), toss it into an online competitive environment, and it would be absolutely wonderful.  Skill curve for strategy, aiming, AND operating your equipment? Bliss. ",53,7,0,10,7,0,3

												This game, while simplistic in graphics, is well worth the five bucks  - and then some. Unlike most FPS shooters where even the most gun-inept moron can be a hero, this game's mechanics puts a very tense spin on things by mimicing reality moreso than conventional shooters - such as no HUD, lack of ""automatic"" reloading, and the ability to take a bullet or two without collapsing. If caught unawares, the game is unforgiving. Get hit even once, and you are dead. This game also includes a system for reloading your magazines, which means unlike most FPS's where you just run around and magically pick up ammo in fully loaded, ready to use magazines, you will have to stop and load rounds into magazines by hand. Or remove them, depending on your preference - unless you're using the revolver. It's simple. It's tense. And I recommend it.			",291,40,2,47,54,1,35

												Knowing your gun in this game is unlike any other. In games like CS:GO you master the recoil of a gun. In this, you master the gun itself. Anywhere from checking if a round is chambered, to manualy loading bullets into a gun. Very cool, very awesome, and very frustrating at times. Beware, get this game and it will eat your time.

												This is a great game, and I highly recommend it.It's really immersive and challenging, with a perma-death system that makes it very addictive. The scarcity of resources and the difficult combat both give the game this kind of survival-horror feel, but without jump-scares and through atmosphere instead. Unless you count the *beep* sound of a kill-drone locking onto you as a jump-scare, which you might by the end of a session. The controls are difficult to get used to, but it feels more realistic than traditional shooters. You're in complete control of every part of the gun, and fumbling under pressure while a tazerbot is flying toward you, getting ready to murder your face off, has this very authentic terror to it. In many ways, it feels more like an actual simulation of how well I personally would do under a similar situation rather than a video game, and it is very rewarding when your able to reload, shoot down 2 tazerbots and a turret, and reload again, all through muscle-memory without the help guide.The atmosphere in this game is thick enough to cut with a knife, and I really enjoyed getting immersed in the story and setting while listening tapes from another Receiver. I was facinated by all the amazing things the tapes talked about, and found the more meta tapes especially entertaining. They are also very effective at invoking various emotions, especially after you've collected a few tapes and the transmission is becomming less and less corrupted. The desperate struggle of you as one of the few survivors of the Mind-Kill is palpable, and the tapes gave a small feeling of hope as I searched desperately for more ammo and flashlights. The game is very good at drawing you in, and I'm so glad to see video game developers actually exploring the possibilities of their media, and not make the same games over and over again with less depth but prettier lighting.I highly recommend Receiver, and I feel as many people as possible should experience it. 10/10, would Receive again!

												Wow. I have gotten so tired of the frivolous way in which most games treat Armed/Gun warfare. COD kids running around concerned with their 360 no scopes, and silly psychopathic lemmings style behavior. This game laughs in the face of that nonsense. It is brutal, it is unforgiving, minimalist yet complex. Few games have inspired me to write a review, fewer still have ever gotten me to post one, as it usually feels like too much hassle, but this game...I wrote a review after only playing it for a relatively short while. I don't know how much replayability most will find in it, but for the price and the intention of expansion, I say throw caution to the wind and learn something for once. If you don't know basic gun operation...in real life, after this you should have a pretty good idea. In my opinion, if for experience alone, this game is worth it. If you think you are some gun toting ace, give this a whirl and see what your made of. This review is written by a real gun owner. I personally appreciated the simulation quality of the gun mechanics. Rating: A+/(9.5/10)/(4.75/5)			",149,9,0,10,2,0,1

												Keep in mind this was a game that was made in 7 days initially before you buy it.That being said, it's not that well optimized. I walk in a room and I have to wait a few seconds for the room to load. I would be happy with this game just preloading and randomizing before starting a new life. So, basically, I would like it to do that thing Minecraft does.The controls are hard to learn at first, but once you get going you'll get the hang of it.The goal is simple: Don't die, get tapes. I have never gotten all the tapes, but they all offer a narrative to the game that keeps your curiosity.The difficulty is strong, yet fair. Every time you mess up it's your fault. Usually.Graphics-wise it's like Bubsy 3D with guns. I'll let that slide because it was made in seven days.Music's pretty nerve-racking.4/5 overall.			",196,6,5,8,6,2,1

												Not really a game, more of an experiment in techniques on how to handle firearm mechanics in video games. Your goal is to collect all eleven casette tapes in each playthrough. The world is randomly generated each time, with enemies, ammunition, and casette tapes never in the same place as last time.Although slow paced it can get pretty intense at times. For example I was running from one the flying enemies whilst inserting bullets into an empty magazine, inserting the magazine in the gun, pulling back the slide, and cocking the hammer. All done manually.Lastly it has some optimization issues, despite the fact that it's a pretty hideous game to look at on a technical level.Firearm aficionados will get a kick out of it, but if you're not an avid fan of guns I'd stay away.There are mods available that add new weapons such as the Thompson M1A1 and the beautiful C96!

												An intresting concept, this game is completely foucsed on guns. It's goal is to do what many other games havent and show how the guns work and how they are used. Its not perfect though. The controls are VERY clunky. Im not sure if this is what they wanted, but they definitely should have simplified the controls some more. Also it is very easy for your die. I wouldnt have a problem with this normally, but when you combine it with the controls, the awqward inventory system, and enemies that will come careening at you at Mach ♥♥♥♥ing five, it can get really frustrating. But Receiver does do what it wanted to do, and did it well. The gun animations and mechanics are solid, and it wasnt how it usually is in games where it just feels like a weapon. It feels like a real thing, like this is whats between me and death. Reciever is good for those who adore realism, but falls short of the top rating. 4 out of 5.			",140,25,0,18,16,0,40

												Receiver is a rather simple (on the surface) FPS game. Receiver's main objective is to find cassette tapes that tell a story of the society and troubles of the world, as well as how to operate a firearm. The gunplay is fantastic, for it focuses on semi-realism. Destroy the kill-bots with precise firing by hitting key parts such as the cameras, engine, battery, or (in the case of the flying taser-bots) the rotor. After the threat is neutralized, you should check your ammol without having a silly HUD, the game forces/allows you to pull the magazine from your gun (or open slide out the cylinder) to check how much ammo you have left. Maybe you emptied the clip and recently reloaded your gun, but you're not sure you got one in the chamber. Simply pull the slide back halfway, and take a peek! Overall, Receiver is easily worth the sale price of $5, and definitely more, although the price helps in the fun. 10/10			",123,14,5,16,17,0,15

												　このゲームを要約すると、「ガンオタが銃の構造をリアルに作ったけど、他にまで手が回らなかった」　マガジンに弾をひとつひとつ込め、銃に装填しスライドロックを解除する……リロード一つするのにも大変なゲーム。リアルを追求しまくったお陰で、使うのか使わないのかよく解らないセーフティロックまであったりしちゃいます。　Ｒキーを押すと、スライドを動かして弾が飛び出るのでＲ＝リロードの人は注意ですｗだけど、銃をリアルに使うとこういう感じだよね、と、いう雰囲気は味わえるかもしれません。　２時間程プレイしてみましたが、コルト1911っぽい銃、リボルバー、グロックのピストルマシンガン、フラッシュライトがランダム初期装備で、弾薬数、マガジン数などランダム。途中途中に弾薬が落ちていることもあれば全然見付からないこともあったり……。しかも、暗い所から始まり、フラッシュライトが無い状態からだと、画面が真っ暗というより真っ黒でどこへいけばいいのか全くわかりません。と、いうか目的がよく解らないです。敵は、タレットが至る所に設置されていたり、空中浮遊しているスタンガンのような機械がいて、見つかると戦闘になりますが、倒すのが非常に大変。マップも同じようなところなので迷います。果たしてサブマシンガンやライフルはこの先出るのだろうか……いや、出ないだろうね。　そんな感じのゲームです。			",154,16,0,16,26,0,6

												Receiver's fun. You run around shooting these sneaky little robots. The twist is that the gun that you weild is painfully realistic. Quite a few firearm mechanics come into play in this game. For someone like me who has shot guns quite a bit(FAR from an expert with guns though), I picked up on it pretty quick. For someone with less knowledge about firearms, these mechanics may take awhile to learn and might be frustrating. But that's the game really. It's less about the robots and more about you maneuvering this machine you're shooting them with. You have to remember all the steps of reloading in order and have to be able to do it fast. The game looks nice. It's going for a minimalistic style which it achieves nicely(at least to my eyes).However, it's HORRIBLY optimized. You've probably heard this from the bad reviews, and what they say is true. For how it looks and how much is going on, this game should not run my graphics card hotter than Battlefeild at a lower frame rate. As long as you have a decent system that can run this, you'll be fine, but it's still rediculous none the less. There's also problems with the map spawning to. I sometimes find myself getting stuck in certain areas and have to restart because there's no place to go. With all it's problems, it's still amazingly fun. Don't let all of this deter you. If you have $5, go for it. It's a few hours entertainment for less than the cost of a movie ticket.			",108,11,1,7,6,1,3

												The good -Realistic gun mechanics that show how simplified guns really are in most video games -Pseudo-random world generation makes for a different game every time -Extremely intense gameplay, due to permadeath -Enemy drones malfunction based on where you shoot them. (example, shoot the battery and the drone stops rotating, or shoot the tazer and a drone will follow you around but can't hurt you) This can make for some interesting situations. -Overall an extremely challengeing game, still haven't gotten more then 5 tapes. The bad -Very poorly optimized. My computer gets pretty hot. -Quite a few bugs, my flashlight never works anymore, some stairs you cant climb without jumping. -Visually unappealing, simple shapes and no texturing.  -Despite random level generation, the game doesn't have much replayability. You'll probably see all the rooms within half an hour.  -Only two different types of enemies.  -Sometimes you will respawn with little to no ammo, and have to die and restart.Some general opinions If you are looking for any of these types of games you shouldn't buy receiver. -You are looking for a game with replayability -You are looking for a game with decent graphics. -You are looking for a cakewalk of a game (easy).If you can get over these things then I say go for it. Me personally though, I kinda wish I had my $5 back (but now that I have it I'll try to beat it).			",89,17,4,17,12,2,14

												I gotta say, this game is pretty terrible. The concept is interesting but the physics are unrefined. It's virtually impossible to actually aim your gun and while I get what they were going for the randomized drop locations they don't really add much to the game. Overall, the game is extremely awkward to play. I only have it because I had bought Overkill (another unfinished game with a good concept but no follow-through), and I have to advise don't waste your 5 bucks on this. Wolfire has good ideas but they seem to jump from one to the other without ever putting out a completed game. Please finish one game at least to the point of playability before you start (and charge for) another.			",68,4,0,4,1,0,1

												This game made simple gun play incredibly fun and once you master the controls it feels amazing to be able to pull off a reload under pressure. The game is also very repetitive and insanely hard as after 10+ hours I have yet to beat it. Due the RNG nature of the game the win condition item, cassettes, can drop with wildly varying frequencies but oddly enough with little variation within one run. If you spawn in a room with a cassette or two already there chances are high that you’ll have a third or fourth within a few minutes while spawning in an empty room can leave you wandering with 10 or more minutes between cassettes. That being said the story is horrifying and even though collecting the cassettes is the game objective it doesn't even come close to justifying a purchase. I highly recommend this game if you think the gunplay mechanics are as cool as I thought they were and are prepared to entertain yourself just by trying to survive as long as you can rather than completing the game.

												Mechanically accurate, delightfully unforgiving, and an overall unique experience for the price.  It's rough around the edges and the keybinds are akward, but you get used to them.  A refreshing attempt to inject realistic firearms handling into a virtual environment.  Anyone who fancies themselves a marksman in any game should give this a shot to see how they handle the minutia of firearm handling under stress.  It's also a good tutorial for people learning about firearms in general, as you must learn the components of revolvers and common semi-automatic pistols.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just wow. Pros:- Worlds are randomly generated, so places are familiar, but the world is always different. - Beginning ""loadout"" is random too, so always a fresh start. - Realistic gun models and functionality. - Game takes next to no processing power, so lag/startup time never present. - In-game help menu tells you binds, and is readily available. Even highlights actions that are extra applicable to a given situation. Cons:- There are only three guns so far, so if that isn't enough for you, bummer.  ",100,7,2,8,9,0,10

												Not even for a dollar.Look this game is an awesome concept and the realistic gun mechanics are an amazing perspective compared to the usual spray then reload games.  It also has some pretty neat sounding music.  However, it was made unbelievably quickly within just a few days for a game competition so it lacks a lot of finer details.I find it really awesome that you operate the gun in a very realistic way and must be aware of the mechanisms at all times to know how many bullets you have left, if safety is off or on, and basically if it's gonna fire or not. That's about all the good though, as this game is very limited elsewhere.  The story line is poorly thought out and not carried out very well.  All you do is collect tapes much like paper pages in a Slender game.  The only enemy you have are robots, that's it.  They are very challenging, but quickly get boring after 10 or so of them.  Other than the realistic gun mechanics, the game has nothing else in it.  The textures are plain, the graphics only semi-decent for the low resolution of the models, and there is little more entertainment than just firing off rounds all over randomly.  The thing that makes me most upset is how the developer has dropped this game like a bad habit.  There have been no updates or known plans for better development.  Given some time, better textures could be added, more enemies could be put in, there could be more mechanics (such as physics), and definitely way more guns than just a semi-automatic pistol and a revolver.  If they added to the game and actually developed it further...maybe I'd change my mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Receiver is an amazing proof-of-concept. The guns are more realistic, and take more knowledge to handle than just ""press R to reload"". Having to manually insert each bullet into the magazine (and remember to manually chamber the first round) makes each gun feel like a tool, like something more solid and tangible. That builds a strong connection between you and your gun, making the shooting more exciting. I would love to see the ideas of Receiver used in a mainstream game. Would love to.That said, Receiver itself is a fun distraction, but not much of a ""game"". After a half hour you'll likely feel you've seen everything worth seeing, and not be wrong. It's worth buying to experience what FPS games could do, as that proof-of-concept, and support the developers.			",58,20,3,6,3,0,13

												Wonderful experimentation with the FPS genre. Artsy, by intention (perhaps to its detriment). The game is fiddly, but by intention. Every action the PC in another game would take when you hit ""R"" you have to do in sequence. If you do it wrong, the guns jam and you have to go through a completely different sequence as you eject the mag, clear the chamber, and reinsert rounds into the magazine.Should be given to anyone that claims that FPSes train people to use guns :VReccommended as a romp.

If you get shot, expect to die with little to no warning besides the hum propellers or the whir of a turret. Collecting the tapes can be a pain without a navigation HUD, but that's what makes the game fun.Definitely recommend for those looking for a new and interesting type of shooter.

												First impressions (that will probably get drowned out in the sea of review and the fact that they are at the bottom of the steam store page.)Reciever is delightfully complex and a welcome challenge and change for any venterned fps player.The game however is very much a ""very early alpha""/prototype, but with a lot of future potential.By focusing on realistic detail of gun usage, the challenge no longer becomes about snap reaction times with pointing and clicking, but rather the challenge comes from profecient weapon use against the simplest of enemies.My first few rounds I heavily relied on using the help menu to guide me through the complex key presses needed to opertate my random firearm. I quickly took up the challenge to learn the keys and the appropritae sequences without relying on the guide, I dare say this only took me 20 minutes of play time to get down pat.Despite the simplistic nature of the enemies (a drone that has to ram you and has terrible flight pathing, and a stationary turret that scans in a radial loop) Their loud 'target accquired' beeps caused overwhelmingly tense situations unrivalled by any other modern FPS. These situations were only exacerbated by knowing it was one hit one kill from these drones, forcing you to be swift and always ready.As I summarised, the game is very earlier in development. Hopefully development continues and more content is added at a frequent pace.$5 dollars is I think a bit much for this game in its current state, but liek most early access games, its a entry bar none that gets you in on the ground floor before its worth more.I'd say check it out if your interested in a truley new spin on fps!

												Realistic physics + randomly genreated levels = fresh gameplay every time. Even though ""Receiver"" is a small experimental indie game, I feel like I could get a lot more gameplay out of this than a lot of other games. Permanent death, and a variety of guns makes sure you can't just run and gun. You need to think about the actions you take.Two things I disliked was the repetitive tapes you collect, as well as mashing the ""w"" key to run. In theory it sounds awesome, but it doesn't work half the time (could be my keyboard), and is inconvenient.			",132,19,4,11,15,1,13

												Receiver is a fun little FPS game which focuses on some pretty advanced and realistic gun control mechanics.You control every aspect of using whichever firearm you randomly spawn with from manually loading bullets into the magazine to removing the magazine and pulling the slide.You roam around the randomly generated map collecting bullets, flashlights and tapes which give you the insight into Receiver's background story. You win once you have collected all 11 tapes.In my opinion, the price of £4 is well worth the experience of originally trying to work out the weapon mechanics to roaming around taking out the hostile drones like a professional.There are also mods for Receiver which expand upon the original three firearms and include bug fixes and optimisations which I highly recommend.

												Receiver features the most fully simulated gun mechanics in any game I've played yet. The concept is very solid, challenging, and satisfying: operating each part of a gun individually. There is a mod that adds a Remington 870, a Thompson submachine gun, and another handgun. Each weapon type behaves and is operated differently. There is even more that can be done in simulating the weapons, however, and the nuances of the weapons couldn't be captured in just a week's time for development. I hope to see these complex gun mechanics in other games and I hope to see the concept developed further, perhaps in VR, where key memorization is not as needed.			",124,18,1,21,10,0,23

												While being very simple, this game feels integral and smooth. When you get used to the routine operations, the gun feels like it's your avatar - kinda like a PC in some RPG. 4 of 10 times you die because you didn't pay attention to the gun.Two types of enemies - stationary turrets and flying melee drones - may seem scarce at first, but they feel very, very solid: sounds, damage zones (turrets can be disabled in several ways, like destroying the camera or the battery compartment, etc), camera lights and the overall feel. The complete spawn randomness makes you constantly feel on edge: 5 out of 10 times you die because you haven't encountered enemies for a while, got lulled into carelessness and strolled around the corner without a care in the world.This and the need to constantly be aware of your gun's condition and the number of remaining bullets provokes you to actually think and plan your encounters (however lame that may sound in this case).The one unpleasant thing I can't come to terms with is the inability to drop flashlights. Once I got lucky and found 6! of them, so that my inventory actually continued off-screen. And you can't really avoid picking them as they usually spawn in the middle of a pile of bullets.Now I wish the modern shooters had an option to turn on gun handling, the immersion could be tremendous; but undoubtedly big title developers won't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ So sad :(.

												This game is more a less a rogue-like tech demo. The price and the videos about it should reflect that to players.The premise of the game is that players will start off with a pistol, it could be a revolver base or a magazine based pistol.  From there, you are going around looking for recordings to find out more about the area that you are trying to escape.  Casing point though, it takes a backseat to the mechanics.One of the core concepts of this ""demo"" is that it is fairly thrilling to reload a pistol all the way through by manipulating each of its mechanisms in a fluid manner under pressure. The hammer, the chamber, the loading or unloading of the magazine all have dedicated buttons which gives this demo a big learning curve because it's not as simple as press ""R"" to reload your magazines anymore.The revolvers are simpler and take less time to learn to reload and ready for firing.As for the other parts of the game, the elements of the environment and the mechanical enemies are simple polygons.  It gets the job done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a gun simulator, you don't just hit 'r' after every few bullets you shoot to reload your weapon. Memorizing how to handle and reload each of the three guns is one of the most strangely satisfying things I've done in a game in a long time. The graphics and narration aren't that great, but I urge everyone to check this game out (or at least watch videos of it). They need to make a full on first person shooter with gun handling mechanics this realistic.			",272,37,14,15,21,3,23

Yes it may be a small game, challenging at first and difficult to get your head around, but in the end the reward of taking out a sentry is your happiness, you don't awarded bullets, health points or xp, just your pleasure at winning which is how all games should feel and once you win, it is a great feeling.It may or may not be the game for you, you really have to think to yourself about that one but in my opinion? It is a great way to kill and enjoy time at the same timeor just rise up to the challenge!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is by far the most interesting games I've come to know, and heres a few reasons why:1. Mechanics. The weapon mechanics in Receiver are some of the most complex, frustrating and hair-pull-inducing I've ever seen, and thats why they're so good. This game forces you to adapt to how it must be played and gives no way around that. 2. Unfairness. One shot and you're dead. Thats it. You have 2 options: FIght or Flight. I've found myself accidently shooting at the ground and end up killing myself from MY OWN SHOT.3. Story. While not fully explained from the get-go, it is more or less pieced together through the 11 tapes you find. The games lore must be discovered, not given away in the tutorial.4. Lack Of Tutorial. This is what makes Receiver very interesting. The player is not given hints, directions, instructions, or anything of the like. The game gives the player a gun, a flashlight (sometimes), a clip or two and some bullets, then essentially pats the player on the back, smiles and says ""Good luck.""5. Damage. When you land a shot on an enemy, there's a chance that bullet has affected them and, hopefully, crippled them in a way. A shot to the turrets gun or the drones tazer disarms them. A shot to the camera and they are blind. A shot to the battery pack and they go down. Every shot counts, so aim wisely.If you have 5$ and some spare sanity you've been itching to lose, pick up Receiver and give it a run.			",166,13,7,5,12,0,6

												So I pre-ordered Overgrowth (which looks like it's going to be awesome) to get the alpha, and Wolfire games surprised me by giving me a free steam code for this with the pre-order. I knew the Overgrowth download would take a while, so I put in the code, downloaded the game, and played it to pass the time. I probably spent about an hour playing this in that one sitting. As simple as the game is, it keeps the game alive by making sure you never play the same way twice. You always spawn with a random gun, in random conditons, with random magazines with random amounts of ammo, in a random place, on a randomly generated map. And nothing is as satisfying as releasing the slide on a freshly reloaded mag and knowing you just did that from memory.  Definitely worth pre-ordering Overgrowth or $5, plus at least an hour of your life addicted to it.			",258,34,4,21,18,1,20

												This game is really, really good if you're looking for a edge-of-your-seat shooter, although I hesitate to call it a shooter, because it brings so much more to the table. It's a mix of stealth, exploration, and plain FPS with a very important twist. No action is automatic with your gun; if you want to reload, you have to drop the magazine, put it in your inventory, pull out another magazine, put it in your gun, and♥♥♥♥♥♥it. This mechanic really helps with the immersion in an already deeply atmospheric game. Pros: -Realistic gun control-Amazing depth of play with three guns and two enemies-Interesting plot, if you can collect the tapes to reveal it -All-around funCons:-Somewhat buggy at times-Doesn't run on lower-mid range computers (speaking from when I was playing on a Macbook Pro, not sure if it's been optimised since)Even if you're not a fan of FPS's, I recommend this game just for the plot and atmosphere, and for 5 bucks (2 right now!), it's really a steal.9/10 overall			",102,38,0,5,5,0,15

												This... Isn't really a game.TL;DR at the bottomReceiver is a one mode 'game' in which you spawn randomly in a generated 3D world with no textures, with one of three guns, a random amount of ammo, and sometimes a flashlight. Your goal is like slender or other random generated indie games, which is to collect all the messages throughout the level which include voice overs that vaguely describe some plot to give the game some kind of flavor or depth, and in my opinion fails to do so. Collecting all of them means you win, or, at least that's what I'm told, the game didn't keep my attention enough to complete a run through.Part of the reason for that is this game is rediculously unforgiving. There are only two annoying enemies in this game. Flying buzzsaw robots from Half Life 2 and shooting turrets from Portal. They both kill you in one hit, but the same isn't true for you. Many times you aim and shoot at them and for some reason their 'weak point' hitbox doesn't register. It is overall very frustrating, especially if you can't find a flashlight and you happen to be surrounded by very dark rooms. I ended up just cranking up my gamma.One last deal breakingly bad thing in this game. When you enter a new generated area (which there are like 6 or so for the game to load to my knowledge), the game freezes for a split second. My computer more than exceeds the requirments this game suggests, but it happens every other time, and can mean a turret might shoot me when it otherwise would not, which, again, means a complete game over and starting the ENTIRE game from scratch.The redeeming factor of this game is the neat gun concept. You are given no tutorial, but instead a key map shows up on the right of the screen with the next step to getting the gun ready to fire highlighted. A different button is required to perform all of the functions of the pistol you spawn with, from safety, to releasing the slide, to loading an empty mag with fresh rounds. Speeding up this process by remembering the right combination of presses is pretty rewarding, and is also very accurate to real life and educational to those that don't really know how guns work. Slow claps.If this pistol simulator wants to keep marketing itself as a game it needs a MAJOR content update. New enemies, objectives, a difficulty other than butt clenchingly hard, and a story that isn't one guy breathing into a mic.TL;DR- Only 3 guns, 2 enemies, 1 game mode- Stutters at loading intervals, which can end up killing you- Has very dark areas but may or may not give you a flashlight nearby- Bland blank textures and one (maybe two?) drab songs constantly playing- Frustrating level of difficulty with no way to change it- Boring generated map- Sprinting requires spamming the W key. Seriously, when was this ever a good idea?+ Fantastic gun mechanics+ Shows promise if content keeps getting addedVerdict: Buy it on sale if you reeeeaaally want to try. But otherwise in it's current state it should be free and in beta.			",50,4,0,11,3,1,6
