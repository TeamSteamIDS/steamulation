												Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to any gamer unless they are deadly serious about their farming simulators.This game offers absolutely no help, tutorials or explanations on how to play at all. You're simply thrown into the game and will spend your time clueless on what to do before you ragequit or borequit.I've played a whole lot of FS13 and assumed it would be a similar experience (even if from different companies). But I was very wrong. However, the game is actually a pretty good looking game for something that came out a few years ago. But it's not for everyone, the effects can really bother some people, luckily there are options to turn them off if you don't quite like some of the shaders being used.It would be nice if this game had co-op but unfortunately that is not the case for this game or Agricultural Simulator 2013 either.So if you had to play a farming simulator game, I'd recommend FS13 demo instead due to that being a free trial to see if you like it and if you do, get that instead. It also has co-op so you can play with friends.			",1095,265,59,122,171,5,161

												It's a great farming game.  When it works, it's great.  However it's buggy and will crash frequently if not working perfectly.  Unable to play it on my laptop (repeated crashes) but it runs fine for hours on my desktop.Farming with hired workers is great and easy, and it's very enjoyable.  Fairly realistic on how the tractors work which is a great plus.If you're interested in farming, pick this one up in a bundle or something for cheap.  It's great and not very costly.

												This is a good game if you have a lot of time on your hands. It is very slow moving, however it is fairly realistic regarding damge to equipment and fuel usage etc. The graphics are good with tractors leaving tire marks in the ground. If you are looking for a realistic simulator this is for you. If you are looking for a farming simulator that you can have fun with friends and a joke around but still keep the farming trend i'd go for a game more like Farming Simulator 2013 (2011 or similar) .

												I am going to recommend this game, only bevcause tractors are fun to drive in real life, and this somewhat simulates it.I didn't mean to lead wtih that, so it will be buried, and your attempt to dig it out. To begin, I'd like to say that ploughing a field was pretty neat. I had another major event happen, but can't recall as it's been a while since I've played.I could probably, and I say probably, meaning I'd have to have other entertainment playing on screen nearby, thrashing over the stereo or a few beer. Maybe a combo.. Anyway..Maybe I'll load it up in future. For now, all I can say is I did enjoy try to drive these beasts. Got it in a bundle too, I do believe, so it will be pennies on the hour.This is for a select niche. Think you can do it, motherfarmer!? Good luck!			",412,81,33,37,40,8,42

												""3/10"". According to My Own Rating.A farming simulator that has better (although laggy) graphics and livestock breeding but is harder to get started, doesn't allow modding and is filled with bugs (couldn't expect any better from the creators of skyscraper simulator).Got 2 points for the graphics and 1 for the livestock breeding. Even though it's not really fun, the livestock it's much more diverse than the Farming simulator's one so... at least they tried something. Everything else is way worse than Farming simulator.Interface lag.No modding.Bugs. Lots of them. Some will make the game crash.VERY Stupid AI.Hard to get started (took me a while to figure out the game had already started). No tutorial. Not so intuitive controls. No real brands for machinery (not like I really care though). Everything is too damn slow. It may take SEVERAL HOURS to complete a farming cycle (assuming you use the time skip feature to speed up crops' growth. Otherwise it would take days). Prices are not balanced and can't be fixed since there's no modding.You can go for livestock breeding and make a billion dollars faster than a single crop  cycle (which is worth about 20k).  Although you'll probably get bored and quit before that. Not worth buying unless it is included in a bundle you're already buying. Don't expect any better from the 2013 version. If you get the demo you'll see the interface lagging got even worse.Buy Farming Simulator instead.			",47,20,0,20,65,0,18

But don't fret prematurely, for there is much mischief to be made in multiplayer with your friends! ""Want to have a tractor race?"", you're on! ""Smash pedestrian cars with enormous farming equipment?!"", even better! The sand-box esque still will leave you with many hours of play, and with its low price, you really can't go wrong with Agricultural Simulator 2011.

Well, here it is just in case someone could actually read it (http://www.igrorama.com/2013/01/agricultural-simulator-2011-extended.html)I do recommend this game and others in the franchise because they are simulations. They make you care about your farm. Focus is on farming and survival as farmer. It's not game of shiny toys and driving heavy machinery, it's for hardcore virtual farmers. Period.

												So I love farming. I mean LOVE. So when I heard about Farming Simulator I was happy. When I watched footage of this game I was blown away. I really love it, probably a huge competitor against Farming Simulator. If it wasn't so buggy. All Ag sim games are glitchy, none of them as bug free as this one though. If you want a good not buggy game get Farming Simulator 2013 and the More Realistic engine (Don't worry it only makes the physics better). If you want a realistic farming game get this. Depends on what ya want, Ag Sim 2011 2013 or maybe even the Professional Farmer series. Either way get FS or Ag Sim. i gurantee you won't be disappointed with either.			",31,0,0,0,9,0,1

												Wow. What an awesome game. It is like third person Farmville with none of that In-game purchase nonsense. And it is cheap. Totally worth it! I can't wait to play it again!I also reccommend the publisher's other bestselling GOTY game Skyscraper Simulator, I hear it is awesome!(Don't be too harsh on that review, its my first try at sarcasm. Now for the real review.)This is one bad game. You get thrust into things without any proper tutorial, then you have no idea what in the world you are doing. In fact, I wasn't surprised when i found out that this game and Skyscraper Simulator were from the same dev, because I heard that Skyscraper Sim was rubbish.A waste of money. Thank goodness I got this in an indie bundle.To sum it up, you will be as confused as I was if this is your first try. Unfortunately, I can never get into, so I don't recommend it.

												In a charming mountain area, you take the role of a classic farmer with all the necessary tasks like cattle breeding, growing grain and other resources, and dealing with products from your farm. Your fields can be cultivated with machines from CLAAS and even your animals have to be taken care of. The complete Agricultural Simulator allows you to ride many genuine CLAAS tractors. Choose between many different models of tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products and invest in better equipment. More powerful machines will help you farm bigger areas. As striving farmer, you have to invest carefully to maximize the crop. Don’t kick over the traces or you won’t be able to upgrade your farm and buy more land. Choose the right seed from different types of grains like barley, rye, or wheat or decide to grow canola or corn. The harvest can be used as animal food, new seed as well as product to be sold on the market. Always have an eye on the market prices so you don’t come out with losses after all the work. Get another main pillar and breed cattle: cows, horses, sheep, hen, and geese. You may even have game animals on your farm and sell them profitably as food. If everything works well, the animals will prosper and you can sell their offspring on the market. Take care of proper feeding, daily care of the stables, and your animals well-being. Hire workers to balance your workload and invest in their further education. The career mode in Agricultural Simulator guarantees a lot of fun. Playing cooperative mode allows you to manage your farm either online or offline with your friends.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251
