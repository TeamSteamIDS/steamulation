												MUST READ BEFORE YOU PLAY:There are a few things i think people should know about before playing this game.I bought kingdom wars before it was a f2p game and have had two maxed out citys with high lvl hero's and have spent money on the game beyond just buying it pre f2p.This is my honest review about what i know of the game.BUGS! Be prepared to lose resorces for winning pvp matches.That's right you lose for winning! If a person trys to fight you and you accept and then he pays you to flee battle you get a win and maybe a little gold from the payout BUT you will lose 5k food 5k wood and 5k stone from your towns resorce stash which varries depending on what your stash has in it but that was my last loss to this bug. Not only do you lose for winning a pvp match in this manner you don't recieve the crowns for the win that you are supposed to get for winning.The only way to avoid this bug is to fight until the game tells you you won or lost.BUGS! That's right more bugs.This one however is in your favor.When creating troops to build an army some times you will dupe extra units.BUGS! Your city is full of small bugs that are annoying at times but minor and not worth more then a mention that thay are there.THE MOTHER OF ALL BUGS! This is a big one in my opinion! Be prepared to lose it all! That's right and not because you can be captured or destroyed by another player but because everytime the dev's change the game some people not all but at random get a full wipe including your account like you never exisited in the first place. The money you spent ""poof gone"" the time you spent ""poof gone"". I know this first hand as both my maxed out city's got wiped and in return i didn't even get a response from the support team. After the first time i said ""ok i haven't played in a wile no big deal i lost my stuff"" and i moved on rebuilt spent money on the starter packs and was back on top in a few weeks and that's when the dev's changed the game again and i lost it all again.Sense the game came out pre f2p i have put about 60$ into the game and 288 hours which i wish at this point i had not but if you don't mind losing it all and spending money and time on a game so that a bug can rob you in the end then this game is for you!There are some cool things about kingdom wars but the amount of bugs makes the amount of cool things not worth the mention as the bugs destroy the enjoyment all together.The dev's don't really care about the game the bugs have been there forever and have never been fixed the team took what was supposed to be an update to kingdom wars and made it a stand alone game ""kingdom wars 2: battles"" which is the same game with a cuple added fetures.The team only did this to pump more money out of people instead of fixing and updating the game they had already created ""Kingdom wars"" leaving KW broken and a waste of time and money.In the end i can't say i recommend any games from this team as they don't put any real care into the games they create beyond publishing bug filled crap they have no intention to fix.

												Some games are born great, others have greatness thrust upon them... This one is neither, through the efforts of the developers and a great part of the community it has worked toward something truly unique. I have played my share of games that had Pay to Win (or elements of it) schemes going on in the background, yet never had I seen one where the developers actually completely changed the game because of critisism from the players themselves... I know of no better community of players then the ones who stalk the digital halls of Kingdom Wars, (it's the only game that I leave the chat window open on) when there was a shortage of Moderators the players themselves would offer advice to the new arrivals. Simply put, my hours should speak for themselves, and I intend to continue for a long time. Many people have claimed that Kingdom Wars is rough around the edges, that it is, but those same people usually don't stick around enough to see the simple truth that we veterans know by heart... (or atleast we should by now) ""If you don't like it, spend some time and wait for the next update."" So in closing, it's fun, it's free, and no other game in the genre can come close to it's majesty!			",560,144,1,241,55,3,203

												7/10** Developers removed the buying of premium currency in the last patch. now it is only availble through quests.****AKA NO BUY TO WIN ANYMORE**Game plays similar to total war. Are a few bugs that tend to occur with each patch that take time to get fixed.The multiplayer and persitant aspect of DoF adds a new and more refreshing element into the genre.  Managing your kingdom is just as fun as battling players and NPCs.Take time to compare the negative and positive reviews.  Take game time played into consideration.It took me a good 4 hours before I finally got hooked. That time was spent learning the ins and outs of the game due to me not having played strategy games in eons.Is it the perfect game? no.Is it a fun game? Yes.Should you buy it?  Yes, especially since it is always on sale it seems.			",114,11,0,20,19,0,14

												Kingdom Wars is a very interesting game. At first I had a very low opinion of it, but if you can overcome the first hour of the game and look past its shortcomings you'll find a very addictive experience with so much potential.Negative impressions:  Visually it looks as if it made in the early 2000s, and the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Once battle is joined unit formations devolve into disorganized mosh-pit like globs with very poor unit collision detection (if any at all.) The animations are primitive and very basic, not just in combat but for walking, idle, and cutscenes dialog. There are also a host of bugs, many of which are highly destructive and infuriating. The worst I encountered was when I lost an entire army, 28 units, because a quest sent them into a void and left me with an empty army on the map- without even starting the quest. I was left without my hero unit, and an entire day worth of invested resources that I used to build said army.Positive Impressions: The economic system and a load of fun, and by far the best part of the game aside from the general idea. You can make profits by trading, harvesting resources, looting battlefields, and questing. Each option presents its own benefits and challenges. If you decide to harvest resources at home then you will looking at the safest and most reliable way, but it also means you need peasants working the land which drags on your unit cap. Trade is the quickest way, but it also means you’re at risk of losing caravans and thus your cargo. It also requires more management and the natural risk of losing money on a trade if you’re too hasty.The game has a pretty mild pace, which is certainly a positive in my opinion. You won’t become powerful overnight, and all buildings and soldiers take quite a bit of resources and time to make. There is also a healthy variety of units and plenty of defining traits to pick from. Units gain experience from battles which lets you upgrade them, in addition to researching new technologies and equipment. From what I can tell there is no pay-to-win advantage either. The cashhop is purely aesthetics and speeding up the process of questing rewards.If the combat would be overhauled then I think this would be an easy game to recommend, and if animations and visuals where modernized then it would be a jewel. However as it stands it’s a give and take. If you can overlook its issues there is a lot of fun to be had, but not everyone can do that. ",41,11,0,25,5,0,27

												It's a great concept and the idea of the game is interesting, but don't expect to engange in many PvP battles, more so it's rare when someone tries to attack your castle, which hasn't happened yet. Your Troops fight in a squad and can actually level up and you get to chose from several different strenghs, such as how hard they hit and how much damange they can take. If you loose a sqaud of high level soilders it's not the end of the world but you feel bad.The game is almost too slow to start, but after 5-6 hours you start to see the gold coming in. You might have read it's ""pay to win"". You can spend cash for crowns which buy's you the special units or upgrades, yet after you get established it's easy to build a bank of crowns. Your gold even starts to overflow to the point where a good portion of the time your lugging your troops around from town to town selling goods.Whatever race you chose to play isn't a total lock, you can still buy units from the other races. One of the key factors is collecting your loot off of dead bodies, I strongly recomand  getting Female Wardens from the elf race because you can simply select their duty to collect loot and they do it fast compared to human peasents. The AI isn't great.  They are going to attack is how they are going to attack. Generally they don't engage you till you engage them. If they try to flank it's a pre-determined before the game even starts. The AI doesn't adjust to the battlefield and what is going on. The AI will flank when basically you already broke the line.Archers and Crossbow men are generally a strong staple of castle RTS'. They aren't effective. When you see 60-80 Archers on a castle ridge after a few times it doesn't make you turn your soilders around.The big draw back besides the lack of PvP fights, which when they do happen are very laggy is the overall Missions of the game. Basically it's fighting a small group of soilders, or laying into a castle.  Most of the missions are putting down rebel armies of peasents. The developer has been putting out patches, but the game isn't new, so I'm not sure what the future holds in stock. If they make a second one, I think they will get the game right.I enjoyed my time with the game, but with no real challange and a weak storyline that actually may not have a ending , it's hard to say ""Yes"" or ""No"" to the game.  However, if your looking to play a RTS game and can't find one I would give it a shot, it did provide me several hours of gaming.			",79,5,2,21,15,0,29

												What the page doesn't actually tell you, something that I was stung by, is the presence of a real life cash shop in the game (where you can buy one of the strongest units in the game, dragons for instance, as well as various ""pay-to-win"" instances)As such I would recommend some further research into this game before purchasing.Edit: This may no longer be true as per my post on the comments section of this original post.

												This is definetly the best Free to play game.Also as an RTS is very balanced and the AI is pretty intelligent.Also,the graphichs are amazing.It's the first MMORTS I've ever played,but I bet if there is any other MMORTS it cannot be as good as this.Those 3 races you can play(elf,orc,human)and the existence of dwarfes(which you can also use in combat) + dragons and other creatures makes you feel like you are playing Lord of the Rings,and the combat makes you feel like you are playing Total War.Even it is Free to play,it is not a Pay to Win game,so you can simly be as good as others that pay.The PVP sistem is very nice too,You can battle army versus army or siege a player's castle.You can also PVP army vs army at other castles(controlled by AI).And the variety of quests(which can be played co-op) makes the game even more interesting.But definetly by far the best thing in Kingdom Wars is siegeing.Take your mate and siege a castle,and I guarantee you won't regret seeing thousands of men fighting.IF you have a wizard,dragon or a hydra with you,the battle will be even more interesting.Of course there are plenty o bugs,but the developers are trying their best to fix them.And there are always moderators online to help you get through those bugs and refund your lost resoruces/units. Also,the comunity is very nice and will surely help you questing,battleling,and maybe even giving you some resources :)If you are an RTS/Medieval/RPG or just a browser games fan,you definetly have to try this game!

												A Fantasy free to play non pay to win fairly slow-paced RTS game with PvE and PvP elements, with an ever growing communityIf that sounds interesting to you then this is the game for youMy first time playing this game I had mixed feelings. Low res graphics, buyable units, premium accounts and Purchasable city plots. All of it was too Pay-to-Winesque for me. But after having spent quite some hours into the Game by talking and bonding with the Community I very rapidly discovered how wrong my assumptions were. Buyable units are easily stomped on by non-buyable units. Premium is merely a small bonus. While it may not be Pay To Win on the gameplay part it does have a few knacks of its own, for example: ''Starting another city'' with another race and settings requires a payment of 4.99$ or by deleting your current City. This feature is very stupid as it limits you to only 1 race which limits the player from sinking more time into the game without sinking money into the game. A very positive change would be if they gave you 2 slots instead of 1, maybe when they release the Undead race they will give everyone a 2nd slot. HINT HINTUpdates are pumped in weekly so expect bugs/glitches that you might encounter to be fixed soonNext to bug and glitches fixes new content is added to. Such as skins, units, buildings maybe even a whole new race.On a side note, this game is still pretty unstable, on a daily basis people come in and complain about how they crashed during big battles or that certain things aren't working. One of the Major malfunctions in this game is the fact that Online gameplay isn't fully server hosted causing bugs with Resource gathering from time to time, but that is simply because they don't have the financial support to make everything more server dependent. Which is where you come in.Gameplay itself is very solid. While the Army management is pretty flonky because of bugs with manual Army mapping and you can only select 18 Units at once, it is still fun and massive, there are some performance issues with big armies moving around and large fights (FPS drops and sometimes Crashes) it is still very fun, competitive and enjoyable. A few issues here and there make the competitive part of this game ALOT less... competitive, such as Battle protection pausing when going offline. But it is still carried forward by the massive rewards PvPing and PvEing give, especially late game.The best part of it, when you start PvP you can't be put up against opponents with a larger or smaller army then yours, making it completely skill reliant.Pros-Solid game-Solid experience-Lots of dialogue-Wide open-world with lots of provided Lore-Updates are sinked in on a weekly basis-Lots of playability-Fun and growing community-Lots of content-Beautiful designCons:-Bad AI-Inconsistent unit collission-Workers not always doing what they are told to until you manually send them-Extremely buggy-Not enough is server hosted-An extreme amount of dialogue (This could be a Pro depends on how you look at it)-Extremely low res (Ruins the design part by quite alot)-Some Pay to Win elements that do need to be removed-Pretty hard learning curve for newcomers-Unit management is not that good (HD patch would help xP)This may look very negative but as a whole the Pros outmatch the Cons by far, since the Developers of this game are working very hard to take charge and improve this game as a whole. While some issues may not be fixed in a few weeks, months or even Years it still is a solid experience and a must play for Hardcore RTS players that want to enjoy both sides of an MMORTS, the Town management and PvP without PvP taking the cake like in most MMORTS games.The best part of this, it's free.

												I would recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS fantasy games. PROS-Beautiful scenery, interesting units, races, strategies and play styles. The story line is a bit interesting too. This is definitely worth the FREE download and try. The game runs on my outdated subpar computer. Game is NOT pay to win. You can chat, have friends, create an empire and a guild. You can control multiple cities and races, and armies. You can have vassals, do co op with friends, and show off your high leveled up units. All the races are viable to play.CONS-Large battles tend to lag and make clicking important things hard to do and the combat systems leave much to be desired as the units are sometimes oblivious to quite obvious enemies and sometimes stand there and do nothing or chase after an enemy while forgetting the actual enemy you clicked on for it to target. You cannot melee a moving unit, even if you are faster and chasing that unit. Town population cap of only 90. Hero unit level cap of only 60. Towns are only semi customizable as you cannot place whatever you want, wherever you want you have to build on plots, and you cannot really design your defenses or choose where you put the walls, towers and gates. Cannot actually view friends towns and you cannot add a new friend if that friend is currently offline. Can only click/use one referral code. Limited town storage and upgrading your storage buildings does not increase it. Upgrading buildings in general should improve things relating to that building, but in most cases it does nothing other than increase the HP of the building.I know my list of cons is big, but I put it there because I wish the game were a bit better in these areas, however, regardless of the cons this game is still amazing and I cant put it down.

												Hello! Let me start by saying this game is unique and have great potential but its far from perfect!I'll start with the good side of Kingdom Wars:If you are fan of Stronghold, Total War, Warcraft, Age of Empires series you will love this game, has the all elements including some unique features like live economy and constant online world!You'll start with a small village, few peasants, soldiers and a hero (24 hours battle protection) .... build and upgrade your town and armies, siege and ally with other players and NPC , train Hyrdras, Minotaurs, Dragons to become emperor and conquer the world!Enjoy sieging your enemies (player or NPC) but be careful about where you deploy your armies couse anytime you can be attacked by other players (in game system have battle protection but you will need to spend cowns to get it and wont be able to pvp or coop will its active), hunt other players on battlefield if you dont have anyone to siege, trade with other towns, escort your caravans will moving resorces, explore the world with your armies and much more!If you are willing you can spend real money to customize your hero armor,town architecture,army banners,symbols.Buy additional town space (only 1 town is free), build new Empires with different race and share new expiriance with your friends!Ok here is the bad side of Kingdom Wars:Servers ... uff i am feeling sick already .... they are just not good, game have huge number of buggs and will lagg even on amazing configurations will coop - duo to server issus .... if you are in Europe and you coop with someone from Australia! Buying naming rights for your heroes and monsters is throwing money couse names will mix or reset everytime you enter new region, also prices for some staff are not worth the money, they should balance this.You will be frustrated with same buggs and controles because they are still working on improving game engine. Recently all servers crushed and they lost most in game data, however I have to commend the moderator they really made the effort to cut our losses but at the end everyone started over with promise it wont happen again!Generally viewed this is great game and you will enjoy playing it even with all its faults .... i know i did :) 7.5/10 Would give it 9-9.5 if they fix servers and all of the above mentioned!Sorry for my bad English i know its not perfect but hope this review will help ppl!All the best guys and good luck! ;)			",29,3,1,4,7,1,12

												Yes, this is worth getting.I've noticed a lot of negativity about this game since it's release and frankly I don't understand where it is all coming from. What you have here is a solid, fun, online RTS game, with some innovative original flourishes.Pros:= Three distinct factions with very different play styles both in terms of city building, unit disposition and battle tactics. They are further differentiated by their own distinct unit, building and UI art, quest lines and voice acting. Each faction can also recruit a variety of mercenary units to further enhance army customization.= The battle pacing is just right. Look I'm an old fart, so I prefer a game where I can actually see the action unfold rather than everything be over in the blink of an eye. The pace of combat is somewhat slower in DoF than in other contemporary RTS games. I think this is a good thing becasue it allows for more tactical options and also negates any ping advantages in multiplayer.= Heaps of single player content. Each faction has a very generous quest line which I estimate to be around 30+ hours worth per side, not counting replayable missions. There are also countless NPC skirmishes to explore in a variety of landscapes against varied NPC elements.= The quests are involved and interesting. They have put a great deal of thought into felshing out details of the fantasy world. It's not a testiment to originality, but it's a top notch effort for a video game setting. I love how half of what the elves say is made up gibberish with no explanation offered, but after an hour or so in the game you find yourself understanding it all.Cons:= There are a few technical issues especially with pathfinding, but nothing that some patience and practice can not overcome.= Multiplayer is a mixed bag. You can grind out a very formidable army against NPCs and newbies can get crushed if they dive in unprepared. That being said, when the balance is just right, they battles are a lot of fun.= Speaking of grind, there is a bit of it. It's an online game so the pace of progression is sedate. You won't max your units out over a weekend. Your rank and file units can also be permanently lost, so you need to be paying attention. I personally like the perma death touch for some units (hero units take an xp penalty instead when they get ""KOed""), but I can understand why some people would consider it a negative.All in all I had a great time with DoF. If you're an RTS fan and looking for something a little different and long term, you should definately pick this up during the sale. It's a steal for seven bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game servers are not recording progress. It recognises a new kingdom created but forces you to start over every time you want to play that kingdom, making it pointless to play in the first place.If you want in-game support, there is none as the ingame community is dead and the only way to contact GM's /devs is via email.If you exit the game via main menu, it tries logging you back in, in an endless loop, forcing you to crash the game in order to exit.This game is plagued with bugs as a result of the developers abandoning it last year, (read the forums) Hence why it is now on Steam. It's a pitty because it had a lot of potential even with a in-game shop, but now it's just an empty shell of what it could have been.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hello,Just figured I would write this quick review of my recent experience. Please take it with a grain of salt and your experience may be different.I played Kingdom Wars earlier this way. Around July or so for several weeks at least. Spent actual money for some of the perks. Premium being one of them. As well as a small expansion I believe. I won't go into how the game was then or that experience though.Just wanted to share that it is now December. I hadn't logged into the game since late July so I just wanted to see if my city was still there. To my amazement when I logged in it treated me as a completely new player. My city was totally gone and even the premium days that I had payed for that were left on my account also were gone as well.This review is not meant to be positive or negative or bashing anyone. Only a simple statement of experience. The reader can feel free to take from it what they will.			",4,0,0,1,1,0,2

												Yup this game is awsome! For those who like RTS and is must have piece. Luckily its not pay-to-win i have paid nothing yet and i dont feel anyway behind other players. It must be added, that you can feel the 'under contruction' sign, but all in all its a game in a world with rich lore, and the feeling of classic fantasy is only the top of the cake.Thanks to the well planed PvP protection you wont get raided and farmed in that very moment you join the game, also you dont have to sit 24/7 in front of this game, since you are protected while offline.You should definetly give it a try if you liked any total ward games mixed with a bit of Mount&Blade and a bit of Warcraft III :)			",76,2,4,7,9,0,20

												Kingdom Wars (Race: Human) 0. Resource gathering  Resources are gathered by peasants (stone, wood, gold, food - though food is a bit different as you can slaughter pigs that are ""fattened"" for a large food income). Each peasant unit takes 1 population space and costs some food. 1. Story about my wizard and about ""wealth"" (crowns)  For quite a while I had battle protection as a starter player. This battle protection gave me enough time to form an army, walls and a wizard. Wizard is an extremely strong unit. Maximum population number of town is 90 I think - you can increase the initial low population limit by building houses - also, you can have initially up to 5 armies outside of your town on map - each army has 60 population cap (Normal units take 1/90), wizard takes 10 and costs 120 crowns. Crowns are gained either by paying 5000 gold (daily limit of bought crowns is 30) or winning a pvp/pve battle (siege or army fight) [You can get 20-40 crowns for winning when attacked by enemy player in your town). A wizard needs further spell upgrades to be able to cast spells (10,20,40,80 and 150 crowns - example for lightning (of the Deep) wizard: shield,drain stamina, buff allies, large aoe attack, teleport) so it's very expensive unit. Once I got the wizard and trained him to get to higher level and bought 2 spells (shield gives him extreme resistance to everything and aoe attack kills everything sooner or later) I was able to siege enemy castle with one man - the wizard. 2. First defence of my town This happened when I finished building my inner stone wall and outer wooden wall (There are 2 types of wall - One made out of wood and the other one is made out of stone, stone is very expensive and there is inner (cheaper) and outer part - outer is much more expensive than the inner one, it's like a second layer of walls) and placed trebuchets on them (you can build trebuchets, rock throwers (close range) or hot oil thingy that pours hot oil on top of the enemy) on top of stone walls. I recalled all of my peasants into my middle part of the town. I chose to fight the enemy. I placed my archers on the wall - on the side from where the enemy was coming. He started attacking my town with trebuchets, he focused on my outer wooden wall and used fiery stones that set the area around my walls on fire. I had plenty of stone in my town and you can buy stone during battle for gold if you have market built so I started aiming all of my trebuchets (the ones on the walls) at those trebuchets. In 4 minutes the enemy trebuchets were destroyed. Then I opened the outer wooden door. As I expected, enemy archers started pouring in, hoping to shoot my people, cattle and soldiers. As soon as they passed my gate I closed it behind them. They were trapped in my outer wall part of town. I started ordering all of my elven rangers (best archers in game, I got them from befriending one elven town and buying them in it) to increase their rate of fire and fire at the enemy archers. Then I opened my inner gate and sent all of my unicorns (also elven unit, they use them for gaining gold and as a cavalry. My wizard kept placing defencive shield on my rangers and they kept firing while unicorns were slaughtering the archers and crossbowmen. They died in 2 minutes. Only thing that remained were enemy melee units behind my wall. I sent my archers to shoot them from safety of my walls and aimed my trebuchets with another 3000 stone remaining (Enough for a long time of constant firing from few trebuchets). The enemy surrendered before I managed to obliterate the rest of his army. I got 28 crowns. The whole siege was like 20 minutes long.I find this game very nice - also, any units you loose during the pvp or pve fights is dead permanently (except wizards, main hero and other heroes like them) UPDATE: I've returned to playing this game, got affected by a roll-back and lost most of my proggress - I was given codes for crowns (ingame currency, something like ""cash"" type of money  in most games, dragon and a free code for Kingdom Wars 2: Battles <- It took them only 43 minutes to reply with these ""refunds"". Best support ever ",202,82,1,67,30,2,54

												I was thinking of giving up on this game during the first 30minutes of gameplay, but im glad I didn't. Very fun and addictive once you get into it (past the inital quests and learning curve). IMO best MMORTS out there!Additional comment: this game is NOT pay to win AT ALL. I have not spent a single cent (excluding buying the game) in this game and I have an 80% pvp win/lose ratio. I also have the most expensive units ( that requires premium currency to buy) on my account. The premium currency (that you can buy) can very easily be attained through in game questing. So please do not let the fact that others say that it's a Pay to Win game to discourage you from getting this awesome game!			",14,0,0,9,3,0,12

												Very well done game. I seen youtube videos and these guys have been around for years updating this game and it's only been getting better and better as I have seen. It's very worth the money and building a kingdom in this one is very fun seeing there's lots of quest that keep ya busy and crowns you have to gain or buy with money you make from cattle or chopping trees and gold and stone mines. I like the experience and upgrading units. I've been on many hours since I started and there's so much more for me to go. Just now got a powerfull dragon and have been burning up lots of enemies.

												Changing my oppinion on the game after having played a good 30 hours.This game has been out for 3 years yet should never have been released in its current format. The devs seem keen on taking suggestions and fixing bugs, but the base of the game is broken. Terrible UI, delayed commands, units not doing what they are supposed to, no interactive pve, broken pvp.You get shown all these amazing battles you can fight with massive armies and awesome castles you can siege. You will not see this ingame.In pvp: You will build a massive army and level them a bit only to see them destroyed in pvp by a single enemy dragon or wizard. A high level 60 dragon or wizard has the same army strenght as a fully deployed army but has many times the defense, attack and hp regeneration stats so your units will be hitting and shooting it in vain. The only way to counter is to recruit your own super monsters and you'll end up using just those.In pve: Sure you can use a massive army to siege a city and lose half of them in the progress. Or... get a dragon and/or wizard as said above and decimate the enemy castle as they cannot kill your dragon. Its easy to see which is the better option.This review will be voted as not helpful just as all the other negative reviews as the core players have been playing this game for years and are good friends with the mods/devs (who btw can and will abuse their power to restore units and ingame currency by just being nice to them) and are raging fan boys thats are just happy with 1v1 units fighting and thus destroying the idea behind this game.

												I would like to recommend this game. I really would. I cant. Like a lot of games it has a lot of potential. That is why I have followed it from the beta on and off. I would love a decent mmorts. The enthusiasm shown for it by the developers kept me checking in and believing everything would eventually turn out ok. Over three years after release and nearly a year on Steam. How is it now?One year anniversary email Oct 2012 ""After a disastrous beta and early release and severing ties with ex publisher 505 Games, our studio have finally gotten a chance to make Dawn of Fantasy the game we always wanted.""(edited for relevance/space) Apr 2013 email ""We have an ambitious plan to get rid of the last remaining issues by May 1st and so that we can switch to adding awesome new features.Here's a brief overview of the top problems we solved in the past couple of weeks    Server stability resolved - no more server downtime    Fixed lost progress, lost unit and army rollback issues    PvP, Siege and Coop does not Out of Sync or Disconnect    Fixed the quest, Co-Op and PvP victory problems    Started the UI redesign and replaced some fontsIf you left the game because you had any of the problems above, now is the time to come back and give Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars another go.""Looking at what is there right now it feels extremely buggy, poorly designed, implemented and unfinished. Losing units (mods will reimburse, with logs), crashing during battles (lose incurred on profile), lag during coop battles (rubberbanding), Syncing issues during pvp. Unit stances and behaviours not sticking, Unit commands not being followed. Very annoying voice spam messages and popups (deleting a voice file solved one, the mods responded they would look into the other) Resource system not working. I could go on and on.Its a real shame as the Homeland building aspects I really enjoy, enticing me to log back in and check on the little fellas regularly. The rest is, quite frankly, and I hate to say it, crap.The ui is poorly designed. It feels like it is trying to fight me on what I am trying to do at times. Not showing all my units when I select all peasants (I believe there is a cap of 18 units selected which does not help you find that one unit you want to garrison) Hiding units in single man stacks behind a wall with no way to find them in a timely manner as the onscreen indicators are poor, Elements of the ui requesting you to look at them (quest book and invite friend button thing) flashing repeatedly until I click recognition and then flashing again a few minutes later repeatedly. I read my goddam quests the first time! Gaahhhhhh! Its like a facebook game!You have a world map where the ""mmo"" takes place. This consists of a static map which is nice enough. You will never see another player on this map. This map is for you, To meet (fight) other players you move around declaring your looking for pvp and hoping that the area you are in has someone there. The system will tell you when a match is found. So its more like a lobby in the multiplayer sense. With an unnecessary visual element. The map for single player contains npc towns which you can visit(very rudimentary diplomacy), siege(coop or single) and visit for quests/selling/buying/trainging. It all just feels tacked on and has done since the beginning.I feel like I have been harsh in writing this but I feel it has had more than enough time to be in a decent playable state. Right now I feel nervous carrying out actions. I feel increasingly nervous the longer sieges go on in case of crash/loss. I fear sieges, not because of players but because of desyncing. I feel nervous upon logging in to find any units missing.The positives of the game are grossly overshadowed by the problems. Of note is the nice way of earning the currency (crowns) ingame. The initial period, base building in your home instance. The fact they kept my account and it was available to me from steam after a long absence. Friendly dev interaction,Despite all that I will probably still log in to check on my little homeland every now and then. Quickly mind you, before the immunity timer wears out.I will continually update the review as changes occur. I will happily change the recommendation if its deserving. In march apparently big changes are happening. We shall see. Unfortunately I have heard that many times before. ",190,31,1,59,36,2,77

												Been waiting for this game for a while, so glad to see it hit steam. Dawn of Fantasy combines classic Stronghold style RTS with Facebooks dull version of ""Kingdoms of Camelot"".If you like the Stronghold series or the Total War games you can slide in to this game with ease. Starting your kingdom takes a bit of time but compared to most other MMO's the learning curve is minor and you can get rolling pretty quickly, anything you need to know about the game will be answered in game by the VERY helpful community via the help chat tab. and the quikly responding support!bear in mind this game is new out and with surprisingly few bugs, patches and improvements are being made frequently and is rapidly flourishing in to an amazing game. It's totally free, I would 100% recommend this game,			",104,9,2,14,21,0,22

												Now that I have almost 30 hours into the game, I feel like I can give a bottom-line up front review with the most important points of interest.PRO:Fun castle siege / medieval warfare game; has a nice old school feel to itCastle building mini sim? ...shoot... I felt like I had to have a #2CON:- Plagued by a crown system which stunts your rapid growth/gameplay unless you play real $ at an outrageous price- Once you have finished your ""introductory"" crown based protection system, you have to pay more real money or use all the crowns you saved for upgrades, if you don't want to PVP. If you want to Co-Op all of the time, don't buy this game at all. It just isn't for you.- No custom castle/wall/tower building--everything is pre-designated- Requires real $ to customize your city or hero (even if it is a small amount, they quarter and dollar you) and the customization is minimal at best- Peasants are morons- Enemy AI has as much intelligence as my Mr. Coffee- Units have a tendency to just up and disappear- More bugs than a Zerg SwarmBottomline:  The game is getting older and older and not getting any better. Kingdom Wars 2: Battle has come out and I doubt they will put any effort into this game at all. If you buy it, you're feeding the green money monster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would definitely recommend you try Kingdom Wars  if you love a great medieval rts game. Build massive alliances and armies to conquer and control the world map by siege and vassal as well as coop and pvp options. You are able to choose from several different races and traits with the option to build cities in many different regions on the world map. The game community is very helpful with questions and resources until you are able to build a strong economy in your home city,  (the best game community I have had the pleasure of playing with). Although Kingdom Wars has a few minor bugs nothing major, the dedicated team of developers are always fast to respond to keep the game running smoothly. Thank you for the great game Reverie World Studios.			",31,7,3,3,5,0,14

												It is a great game and a mix of Total War, Age of Empires and one game I liked alot Tzar in the late 90s. Now that it is free to play there are hundreds of players different skills and all eager to advance trough their levels of play. Am not much of quests person but they do provide some fun and PVP in game altough it was before bugy now plays fluently. There is a mix of races and every opponent shouldnt be over estimated as everyone has their own tactic. I recomend this game as you will have hundreds of hours of fun.			",33,1,0,10,1,0,12

Posted: May 3, 2016
												Highly recommended for Human Race only, but i think it can work in any race if u use it carefully.How to make fast resources.Quick Tip for being a Human Race, in this game sometimes new players have hard time geting resources... a veteran friend teached me how to make gold fast and easy, Humans got the best defence in all the race that makes them good for fighting in balance and some formation to make them useful for certain enemies, a friend teach me that swordsman is the best melee units for human when you are a newbie or a starter, you can use this to your advantage, my friend teached me how swordsman can really be useful, 1st buy the technology in the blacksmith, in the armors and you can find the Mail Armor for swordsman to improve crush armor it will highly improve your swordmen's resistance to impact and crush armor it is important to unlock this upgrade,and you will need to train 16 units, just 16 ok you can only highlight 16 units at once to highlight them click the swordsman units in the top left corner then press Ctrl+1 to put them on Num. 1 , after you trained 16 swordsman, make an army in the world map, you will need at least lvl them to a nearby castle for example dagbor if in southmont, thorndale if in wold, and denwall if in rollingplain, lvl them at least 3-4 i will cost at least 2-3k gold after that you will need at least 600 gold, you need to go in the elven territory and make camp in any of the elven territory make a least a basic camp, then manage camp, and recruit units, then find the male warden, 1 warden is really useful you will just need 1 male warden.After you bought 1 male warden, you need to go to Bal Rattha and press find (the magnifying glass in the right side of your army HUD) in your army. Do not make a camp, thieves will slowly steal your money if u make a camp.WHen u lvl your swordsman you get at least 6-8 time to improve the skills of your swordsmen Improve the heal rate to 2 and improve all your resistance to impact to max.After that Highlight your army and your warden to num. 1 and num. 2, Go kill all the ogres and make your wardens loot the dead bodies of the ogres, (You have a chance to tame an Ogre) Male wardens got special abilities, they can instantly lot dead bodies, AND! Turn the resources to gold.A dead ogre has at least 100-700 meat that means, at least 1 dead ogre can make you get 100-700 gold (beware of the Ogre scouts, when u looted 1 ogre camp make sure, always guard your wardens because ogres camps have dead bodies and ogres can literally smash your wardens and watch out for Ogres scouts, 1 try can get you at least 15-25 k of gold at at least 16-20 ogres, if u try at least 9 times you can get 300k of gold and if u want to turn them to resources you will need market in your base and transfer the money you collected form ogres to your own base and turn them into some resources from the market.I think this will help you alot, but sometimes its boring but it can lvl your swordsmen fast, (At least 16 lvl for your troops in one try ), (Warning. Do not bring archers with your swordmen because almost all the time ogres targets archers and other ranged units). I hope I helped anyone thank you for reading all of that XD :D~peace			",79,3,0,9,6,0,4

												Kingdom Wars is the first true MMORTS(that's massively multiplayer online real-time strategy) with a town/base that you build and doesn't disappear or reset after every match. Once you build your base, you build armies that are also PERSISTENT. So everytime you login, your base and armies are there from the last time you played and they're ready to battle.Each faction(humans, elves, orcs, +more to come...) are unique in every way. They gather resources(gold/food/wood/stone) differently. They have different units with different abilities and formations. They even have subfactions(3 subfactions per race) that make them even MORE unique by increasing/decreasing unit stats, economy, build times, etc.  Then you choose two traits from 5 or 6 options that further customize your experience with more stat boosts and whatnot.Once you've built a base, done a few quests, and trained a decent army you can either conquer the AI controlled cities(either solo or Coop with someone) or search for another player's army to fight or siege their town. The Player vs Player fights are matched up according to the strength of your army, which prevents powerful veterans from picking on new players(or vice versa depending on how good you are :D ).The best part is that anything can be earned by playing the game, except for a few items that are purely cosmetic and don't affect actual gameplay or mechanics.PROS:-Game Moderators are easily accessible and available for questions-Wizards, dragons, minotaurs, treants, hydras....that's right, HYDRAS!!-units level up and can be customized to your playstyle by spending skill points to increase health, stamina, attack, resistances, range, reload time, etc.-better than average graphics considering the size and scope of the game-massive battles with unlimited tactical possibilities where terrain, weather, and NPC patrols/camps are all factorsCONS:-some minor bugs/issues, but the developers have released more patches to address bugs in the past two weeks than in the past year, so they're committed to keeping the game running smoothly now that it's free to play.-high system requirements to run the game even on low settings-some parts are difficult to learn to play early on because tooltips and tutorials aren't very helpful, but the community of players and the moderators are great about helping outBasically, you have nothing to lose except maybe a little time and hard drive space. And if ya don't like it, delete it. But if you're like me(as you can see I've logged almost 400 hours in this game), you'll be playing it every chance you get! Also, if and when you see me online, add me as a friend and I'll send you a bunch of resources to help ya get started. My username in the game is ""Quintessential"". I'll even invite you to my alliance if you like.See ya on the battlefield!!			",9,0,0,4,5,0,8

												This game may not look like a whole lot. but it offers more then what meets the eye. The overall ""LOOK"" of the game is a bland land scape with somewhat vibrant colors and dull textures. The part that gets me hooked is the gameplay and micro managing of the establishment you are trying to build and expand upon. This game has both a single player and multiplayer to it. It is suggested to start off with the muliplayer first so that way you can learn the game faster. If you like an RTS that is advanced but has a nice learning curve to it. Something that you can pick up and not get scared off. Then I highly suggest you give this one a try and don't let the looks fool you, theres a very thick under side that you should try to get through to.			",386,19,4,43,29,3,61

												Classy.First make people PAY for your game, using a pay to play model.Then, when the cashflow dries out, make the game 'free to play', oh, that's right, adding PAY TO WIN elements.'Starter Packs'?! What's this? Paying for in game cash, city slots, and attack protection?Basically you guys are screwing over gamers who thought they bought a 'buy once, then play fair' game.Best of luck with the cash cow.

												So i got this game, not exactly sure what it was. An MMO, RPG? Its an RTS, and a pretty well done one. The whole free-to-play is actually that, but they added a twist that i actually thought as something a whole lot better than the other ones out there that ""need energy to complete actions, come back tomorrow"". This has that ideal, but they did it in a way that keeps people entertained. You set some units to gather resources, and they gather small amounts over time, more units, more resources brought in. The best part though, is that you can constantly play, without having to check back up on your kingdom every few hours. You can create an army relatively quickly, and go out and fight (have not reached parts like that, just doing a quest to attack goblins at this point). This is when the RTS main fighting starts, though i should mention the home city is set up the same way, RTS style. This game is pretty fun, and i cant wait to either siege a castle, or get sieged. Im realy looking forward to the co-op battles.Just 5 hours in this game and i already love it, it has an excellent RTS-RPG mix, and i cant wait until i experience multiplayer. Plus this game is free, no need to buy things. Download it and try it, you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Being a WoW fan and playing as the orcs is extremely delightful too!

												Good game, for a little while. Replayability doesnt seem as good as many other games out there, and i wasnt able to find the quest lines enjoyable at all.The world isnt very interactiveable either, you cant take over other cities and make them part of your kingdom, when you battle a NPC city, and win, they just become your ally, giving you benefits such as recruiting a small number of units, trading and the likes..Game had potential, i wouldnt recommend to buy it for the full 18.99, but if its on sale (which it is often) its worth buying if you like RTS. It has some cool siege play, and basically on the siege front, it is everything that Stronghold 3 wasnt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looking back on the game (I like calling myself experianced on this as I have played about 116 hours) I think that its good. The units are cool the battles can change in the blink of a second and for a free to play game it is very fair with its crown system. Its a free to play game so all you people that have nothing to do and like strategy its made for you. A quick warning the recources take some time to get so imagine kind of like a world that keeps running with or without you gathering recources. Still a solid 8.5/10 if your reading this download it now. I mean right now get up download the game and come back when you have. In fact dont come back here untill you play 6 hours, yeah that seems good... Ok your back? Cool well theres nothing else to this so go play some more.			",91,11,0,18,23,0,27

												Review of Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsDawn Of fantasy, what a game it is, it was originally launched in October 1st, 2011, with so much excitement and a lot going for it, but was plagued by poor programming and bugs and rushed by the publisher, features promised but never delivered. Still we all had high hopes and knew there was something special there. So the Devs still apart of development that cared about the game and wanted to see it grow, ended up ended up taking care of it out of their own pocket over the past year and a half just worked mostly for free, using the what ever means, any current sales to invest into better servers or pay for outsourcing some fixes here and there and now they released a new version on steam with many new features and updates that fixed a ton of the game making it a lot better than its first official launch. In the end, The game is very addicting, I have 4 cities, and massive armies, sure theirs many issues and bugs and sometimes horrible path finding, and pvp doesn’t always work, yes there has been major crashes but only because the game has grown so fast, there was none of these issues before, but the community and gameplay is just so rewarding I can't stop.So glad I’m done with this review, Already 70hrs in and all I want is more! The Review easily could have been pages and pages with everything the game has to offer.Final Verdict A solid 8.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/1/14I originally really got into this game, and really played it hard, wanted to advance, got really strategic about all of it, and now I threw my hands in the air and am tell it to go blow itself.First off the game is a patient one, some builds take hours to build, there is a lot of slow freaking traveling and sieging an area actually takes time and a lot of effort. You feel accomplished when you get it right and it is awesome. Absolutely awesome. But the game mechanics are atrocious.Pros: Rewarding, new-ish style, feels like you can explore a lot.Cons: -♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics: Units randomly stop firing and run into battle without attacking. This happens with super expensive units and it sets you back literally hours. Spike traps are an instant (and invulnerable) kill for your units so while sieging the enemy you may lose 20% of it regardless of what you do.-Not intuitive building (for the elves)-Everything is slow, inaccurate, frustrating, expensive, unresponsive, and repetitiveAlthough I was expecting an Age of Empires-esk game, it delivered but in a C rated experience. This game has a lot of potential to be good, but it needs more polishing			",151,5,0,13,7,0,13

												This game is really good, is a realy nice blend of RTS, RPG, and MMO, a really nice comunity still growing. And the premium currency can be obtained trought ingame missions(quest), battles, sieges. clearing map areas etc. You can solo, coop and pvp. Rise the levels of your units, etc, if you are a fan of RTS this game is a must play. And doesnt matter if you have a lot of time or just a few hours a week. See the details below.If you like doing only PVE you can dedicate your self to it wheter sieging NPC towns, clearing diferent map aereas from NPC, doing missions, you can get resources from PVE as well as from PVP.You are more of a PVP oriented player you can get resources as well from PVP, you can atack other Players Armys, Siege their towns.If you get atacked you can pay a little bribe to your oponent, and you will get under protection, and if you feel brave enougth, you can accept the challenge and fight your oponents army, wheter you win or lose you will get under protection so that no other player atack you again for a goo period of time.Protection system from PVP sieges and army on army battles, if you are under protection and you log off your protection resumes when you get back, the time counts for when you are online, and if you are offline no one can atack you.You can only play a few hours a day, a week?, Doesnt matter no one can atack you when you are offline, and you continue gattering resources while offline.

												Let me first state this for the record. This game, has great potential. It really does. The developers of this game really do care about this game.However with that being said, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess that is holding hands along side a microtransaction system, That offers cosmetcs, and also ""preminum"" accounts, booster, etc. You name this game has it on the microtransaction side. This is not how you do microtransaction, btw. It's either one or the other, not both. Doing both may or may not work. In this case it doesn't work, in terms of concept and execution.They shove it right in your face the whole nine yards, ""Hey tell your friends about us!"". Yup, i mean all of our friends play videogames, i mean yeah ALL of our friends...... >.> not only that but this game randomly encourages you to do so, and also suggest to sign up, and god knows what else. Anything to get their game more attention and care, and also $$$$Since gathering resources might take awhile, and you might need the few extra crowns (which by the way can be obtained through quests, or *ding, ding* you guess it. BOOSTER PACKS! :D) expect to not be stocked up for a long while. But even then the proccess is really, really, slow. Unless you have upgrades and you communicate with the community.It just isn't the microtransaction system that is also plauging this game, but like what i previously stated before, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess. The army's AI is chidlish, making illogical decisions that baffles you, plus the ""co-op"" system in this game is a complete joke, no lobby, but through a random selection of players or friends that, and oh by the way they must meet certain requirements in order for you to play with them. So if you are X, 1, 2 & 3 and your friends are, Y, 4,5,6 guess what? can't do it! Must be on the same page. But even then the game's cp-op system is still broken. the PVP has the same system, and runs just like the co-op system. You can tag team against players and what not.Now. How is the rest of the game? Well it's like Stronghold. You rule your own little ""territory"" in various landscapes, races, etc. All of which have their own set of skills, abilites, quest, etc. You can't customize your character, and if you want your character to have a name, must buy, buy, buy a renamer thingy in order to do it. In your terriotry, you see your land grow, however bewarn, upgrades require certain techs, large amount of resources may vary, and guess what? CROWNS! GLORIOUS CROWNS! :DAlso these ""VIP"" status buildings, and upgrades? They require an insane amount of supplies and CROWNS! so don't think getting to the top is going to fast and swift.You can create alliances, but it costs......CROWNS! :D as Buzz Lightyear would say: ""Crowns. Crowns, everywhere!"". You must be invited by the clan leader in order to become part of the alliance, yup kiddes you have to make a ton of friends in this game if you want to be apart of it on a larger scale. The tutorial does it's best, but honestly, if you played Stronghold, and a Total war game, then it shouldn't be a bother.Now, unlike a Bethesda Game Studio game (Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.) there are no radient quests, the quests are given to you, so don't expect it to be quite fun. And unlike a Total War game, there is no real panic with the peasntry and such. Which would've been nice to have in this game, as it gives players an incentive to think about their territory first.The lore is alright, i guess. For a medival game it does the job right.One more thing, if you don't have a good rig. expect big performance issues, and even if you lower down the settings, the game still has weird performance issues, etc.So in the end. Despite the patches, the issues are growing, and with this absurd and constant in your face ""give us promotion"" and also, buy, buy, buy! I recommend, NOT playing this game.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												Kingdom Wars is a fun packed game, Very Interresting, And easy to learn. First i would like to say how Kingdoms Wars is free, That just makes it such a better deal, For Everyone. I do like how there are multiple teams, Humans, Elves And Orcs. But that is not all, if you need you can even spend your money to get more and better stuff. Finally i would like to say i personal love this game. I have had this game since you had to pay for it, And now my friends can play and get it for free! That is all i have to say, Thanks For reading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's mouse based gameplay; which I like. Feels like it's more 'strategic thinking' rather than 'who can remember which hotkeys to press the fastest.' It's like Age of Empires and Total War had a baby that was breastfed bongs and became the most chilled out, yet totally badass, medieval strategy RPG			",163,29,0,23,7,0,14

												Love this game. But after playing it a while, the community even says the devs have left it. An update was announced over a year ago and never came? Supposedly. Idk,,, Anyway This game is beautiful. If you like RTS's and the ability to play with or against others, this is the game for you! Actually the second one is, but i havent been able to try it out yet  :( Feel free to gift it, ill love you long time jk lol. This has a different approach to an RTS that most mmorts games miss. Its not a chess board with people everywhere trying to kill you, take your town, start over, etc. This game has a little bit of an offensive Ai and defensive Ai camps, towns, castles, and armies. All the while you are able to pvp with other players. Repair your towns when your attacked. etc. This game allows you to build. Allows you to have fun at your own pace. BUT make sure you go through the tutorials for orc and elves. They have their own style of play.  Which is also very intreging. (sp?) Though in order to have a town in each faction you will need to unlock slots with real money (as far as i know only way) otherwise its start, erase, and start again to test them all out. Which isnt too bad seeing you dont have to wait 12hours for something to build...This game really makes me want to try the second one and i will once i can! :PFans of:Age of EmpiresEmpire Earth Starcraft You will love this. :)			",43,1,0,5,2,0,1

												Kingdom Wars has the same concept and battle physics as Age of Empires which is one of my favorite games. But in this game you get to make a kingdom, though if you want to make another city you have to pay $2, thus it's trully an origional MMO. But there really isn't anything good to buy in the story other than buying city slots, skirmish mode which you don't need, the campaign, and a few custumizations. Other than that it's all up to you which is really nice. LOVE IT!!! 10/10			",151,9,1,16,10,1,8

												Set in the fictional-mideival lands of Mythador, Kingdom Wars gives you a chance to play in a 3-D land with your kingdom.  Highly detailed maps offer an excellent gameplay experience, as well as a fantastic look into RTS style strategic gaming that took me in for hours of fun. I give this game a 9/10.  I've had a blast and will continue to in the future. Some things to be improved on are the graphics and animations because they were made a while ago, as well as the variety of bugs and glitches.

												Nowadays, it's quite hard to find a game that is a Massively Multiplayer Online Real-Time Strategy Genre and certainly as good as this game, Kingdom Wars is a saviour to a dying breed of MMORTS.Kingdom Wars certainly has a great Community that many games lack, in my eyes it also has a high chance of reviving this great Genre. I’d like to list all the negative things first:As this is a game still in Development, there would be much work to be done, as i am a Games Developer myself, i understand that creating a game and meeting everyone's expectations is not easy.Bugs are on the loose which can dishearten a fan of the game, however the Developers and Moderators are both working well together to clear them. (I believe the Development team should look more closely to fixing these before adding any new content.)Making sure that all NPCs that you can talk to etc… have a nice smooth crisp looking graphic design, as some do look pixelated rather than looking smooth with the rest of the NPCs. Now for the Positive:Hours of fun to be had when the bugs can be overlooked. Various races to be played (Orcs, Elves and Humans) You do also get the awesome Dwarven Armies you can build. Unique units, Kingdom Wars offers a variety of Unique Units that you can build to boost your armies’ strength and even rename them which gives you a more personal favourite feeling to your units.Quests are quite important within this game, it gets players activated as well as the PvP (Player Vs Player) and PvE (Player versus Environment) these would vary from easy to hard.Theres just so much that i could list that makes this an awesome game.

												This game is great so far. Been playing for awhile and imagine Age of Empires with a dash of the Total War series and plenty of High Fantasy Setting with a large open world map complete with questing, offline major keep skirmishes, coop, pvp, and tons of utilities and realism like weather, seasons, faction traits, perks and even random events. If you're looking for an RTS that scratches both a persistent world MMO and an RTS to enjoy with friends, this is definitely it. I would say buy it now, its $4.99 and it's already paid for itself with entertainment value. Looking forward to cool new features and updates with this!			",128,8,0,13,9,0,15

												This game is fun. Temporarily.First and foremost: It's NOT pay to win per sé. You can achieve all the things you want by just playing the game. Even the crowns (which are used for upgrades) can be bought via ingame gold.My reason for not playing the game anymore is: Walls are bugged. I really wanted to dig in and build a nice stronghold. But when my archers bug through the wall and stand IN it or below it ... that annoys me to some decent degree.Also the combat is kinda wonky and if you upgrade your archers to increase their range the AI wont even bother defending itself.Nonetheless the game is more like a browser-game and CAN kill some time. Serious fun is not a thing for me with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Devs, this game really made me have goose bumps when I first heared of a browser like rts/fantasy/medieval game. Start working! Get the game shaped!I would enjoy it the same way as I did the first (monthly progress) time, although the goofy combat, and delayed movement of units fustrates me, I will still play it. If that major annoyance would be fixed/improved/ or get better solutions, I would pay again (but don't get cheesy). But PLEASE. F****** don't leave the game die as many good ones did! It's a waste of art. Obviously I won't even talk about many features it can have, such as more races,more tech, management, more opportunities, etc....Just do this one splat of lazy movement and sluggish and unresponsive combat. Improve it.( You might say: ""you can get used to it, it's not that bad""...but then why does it have to be bad? when it can be improved. <<Lazy mentallity I say!>>)This is where you want to stop? or end your limits?. As many other obstacles may be (which of course I'm not aware of, financially or whatever) just don't give up. Is it just me this game is still feeling unfinished? (And yes, I am aware it's out already, don't tease me)Otherwise, enjoy the game. It's fun. As it is. Untill another one pops out even cooler and better then this. It always has been like this.

												Ok....when i first saw the game...it came with a subscription...granted with its graphics...and cash shop, as well as...slow gameplay it didnt really work out. Strangely though, the game does offer a few unique things. Units Lvl Up, indefintely, making the difference between keeping a large army or small elite force obvious.Unit mantainence is harder.Multiplayer Sieges especially on big cities are extremely fun, on a huge scale.On a side note, the subscription is gone.Cons: Pathfinding(not sure since i havent played it since its new update)          Cash shop advantages(there are daily rewards though, you wont get the dragons. A player who can get their city to become an economic superpower can however convert gold to in game CASH at a steady rate i believe)New: Arcana Update : New Units(mages in general) , removal of buying cash(no more pay to win, but im not sure, i havent been on for a long time), Better pathfindingUpdate: Arcana(not tested) : Includes better pathfinding as well as new units with spells as a focusUpdate: Arcana seems to have added guilds, also there is an EMPIRE expansion coming up for free, which enables more COOP or single player empire building, you can now get up to 30 towns			",124,14,1,49,26,0,68

												If you like RTS fantasy games then this is a great one to start with! You can play offline single player modes but the online version is so easy for new players. To begin with this game is NOT ""pay to win"" it never really was but in the past about 2% of players shelled out the extra cash for some better units. Now there is NO cash shop. Instead you earn an extra type of currency called crowns by doing PVP. You can literally spend the first 24 hours of in game time just building up your city and levelling up units WITHOUT worryinging about being attacked. Your 12 hour immunity to attack BEGINS when you decide to build walls and you can hold off on the walls for 12 hours so you have a nice army and city ready to give any attackers a run for their money. The game matches you based on army strength so even when you do finally decide to PVP you will not be getting owned by players with much stronger armies, this is not the D-Bag gank festival that other PVP oriented games tend to be. Even when you do lose you still get a few crowns and your heroes do not die permanently nor are your buildings destroyed beyond repair! I am Namaste in game if you have any questions! there is tons of helpful posts in the steam forums to help get you started. It is the sort of game you can take your time with and play at your own pace! Hope you love it as much as I do, it is a steal on sale as of the 22nd for a limited time at 5$			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is an RTS with some ""unique"" features, it wraps up some RPG and MMO elements in an RTS shell, I have got to say Dawn of Fantasy is not a bad game really. it takes patience, lots of it and can be pretty time consuming (from my admittedly little experience). Dawn of Fantasy looks and feels pretty ""rough"" but dont let that completely put you off from the game if you find it interesting. You choose from one of three races, then from one of three starting zones, you choose your heroes gender, and then name your city. Afterwards it should drop you into your tutorial.

												I Wouldn't buy this game, Reason is when i did i had to buy 3 slots for building other towns. Now i have to say i didn't log in to much cause well with everyone i had a job and worked, going out with friend living the so call good life! One day i saw they made an update to the game which i was fine with evething updates or new stuff get added in. I also spent some money on a few other things which was not to much maybe 20- 30 dollors canadian. Anyways i get in and everything is whiped , my account is wiped, i had no citys or anything that i worked for or spent time on. Ok so i was confused i made my account again went in and ask one of there so called devs who was trying to refer me to send in proof i did  any of that and everything would be i guess restored but not my citys i beleive i would have to rebuild them and that but anything i payed for would be given back to me. Long story short i can't find any of these so that makes me other a lier or it ws a money grab and for those that don't log on everday! Right now i would say the game was good but way to low population and other mechenics of the game were annoying but vary still playable!my e-mail is Patrick_Robinson_11@hotmail.com for any devs of this game that want to contact me on this issue cause im confused on how you wiped someone who payed for stuff but you still wiped a player who payed for more slots and a few others stuff! is this a game a money Grab or was it an honest mistake time may never tell!

												The basic concept of the game is great, but the gameplay is very glichy. Units wont move sometimes and also maybe one of the biggest problems is DOF.exe has stopped working. One of the ways to play is in RTS mode but this mode crashes more times than not. Also pvp is very laggy at times. I like playing the game and have logged well over 100 hours trying to play this game. have spent money on it and overall am disappointed as I really like the idea behind the game. Hopefully sometime they will get it straightened out, but for now i can't give it a positive review.			",12,1,1,7,1,0,3

												This game is pretty bad. The game has some neat idea's and concepts, but just fails to deliver even basic RTS mechanics that have been the standard for quite a while now. The controls are very poor and the response from units is very sluggish and half the time I tell them to do something they just plain don't do it or it takes the 5 seconds to actually start moving. None of the games mechanics are explained anywhere in the game and in a pvp game like this where you can be raided by other players this is a major fail by the developers.The quest system is also very poor at explaining what you need to do. A lot of the quest I did I had to fumble my way through as the directions aren't very clear and there's again no explanation on how it's done. The quest will say go trade with this settlement for X resource and that's it, but in order to do that you have to go to your world map fumble around for a way to create an army that can move to other cites then deal with poor user interfaces to select things and finally do a trade.The graphics are pretty lackluster as well, but I don't really hold that against a game as I focus more on gameplay.Combat is also a mess as you get large groups of units that are really one unit, but it has multiple small units that encompass it. These individual units can become spread out over a large distance sometimes which cause a lot of problems with organizing an army. Controlling units is some of the worst I've ever seen as there are no hotkeys for abilities or unit stances/formations and there is no quick way to know which units you have selected as again the UI is very poor and doesn't do a good job of clearly showing you what it needs to. You would think with all the units it would be cool in large battles to see them all fighting and stuff, but you would be wrong as they have no collision and will all stack up in small area's and at the same time they have collision with your units which makes them pathfind to where ever they want getting your units killed.Overall the game looks like and plays like it was designed for an iphone and it shows. The game is below average and I would say it's a 3/10 at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yeah, sure, it looks a bit derpy. Sure, the graphics aren't optimal. But this game has lots of things going for it. For one, it has excellent customer service, and it's not pay to win. The game overall is fun to play, if you like real-time tactics, albiet without unit collision it looks a bit like a derpy moshpit. The animation isn't optimal, but it's enough to enjoy the gameplay. The only real downside is that the game has such a dwindling community.			",22,2,0,6,1,0,2

												Although the game could use a little polish, it's definetly worth trying out. Building massive armies, freedom to build and share you'r own maps and features. Helpful people always offering to give tips. decisive live strategy battles. laying waste to everything from small bandit camps to entire empires through massive seiges. The game is a bit finnicky and i have found a few bugs myself, but if  you are able of basic thought the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Including a lot of micromanaging and sort of planning economic success and quick decision making skills aren't required, but they are recommended. But all things can be learned in time. So on behalf of my word, try the game out, and i mean really try it. you can tell that alot of work was put into this game, and it deserves quite a bit of gratitude for it.			",22,0,0,1,2,0,2

												This. Game. Is Amazing.  I always was intrigued by the mmorts, though i have never felt any of them got it right.  DoF on the other hand, feels like what i always wanted an mmorts to feel like:  An RTS where my city persists in a world with oither peoples cities. I bought the game solely because of the dev's participation in the community, and discovered that the game is really good.The content is really well thought out, especially the little things, like the types of units and their skills.  For example: archers have an 'enfillade' skill, which allows them to place spears  at their position.  Awesome.You can have multiple cities, so one could play as Man, Elf, and Orc, without being locked into a decision.Again, the little things, like the dialogue of the Orcs that really seem, well, orcish, and the Dialogue of the humans that have a real feudal feeling. The Devs also have listened to the player based, which is refreshing.  The players didnt want the cash shop: they removed it.  The players didnt like griefing:  they made pvp protection easier to obtain.  Another cool thing:  Your town can't get attacked if your offline.  Very cool.The community is really helpful too; Ive never seen a question in global chat go unanswered.I've always like real time strategies, and mmos, and DoF does a really good job of joining them.

												After playing this game and messing around on it for around an hour, I thought to myself that I wouldn't be playing it fo too much longer. However, I put a bit more time in to it and I intend to invest a lot more time into it now. Once your city develops and you learn more aspects of gameplay the game shines. The graphics aren't top notch, some issues here and there but overall, the gameplay is awesome and the customization of armies is brilliant. For £3.74, this is a steal. Also, the devs are good people! :D			",111,1,0,14,9,0,22

												Despite what most are saying, the negative reviews are actually obsolete now, the development team and staff are only 5 people and they have managed to wrestle the graphics issues and such.they've also released their first free expansion with wizards and hydras.Also the P2W thing is kinda  off the beat, I got free units from the daily gift button which would be considered P2W, though the crowns are able to be earned in game by doing quests or even asking your alliance members.right now these guys need a huge help, I love the game...but it needs a more active community.Again most of the negative comments have been already adressed and if anything, this game is worth the price.I would highly recomend it for almost everyone who likes RTS's and MMO's. the graphics are a little bland and they are working on beutifying the game in a future update, but the seasons cycle, and the detail so far is quite good.P.S. I would also like to note that I got all three dragons through the quests, and the daily sales which is clientside, you can get them 50-75% off, so your quests can deal with it, though I will admit they aren't super powerful.

												Its free, And for being free it has a alot of army style options, fairly interkit, similar to age of mythology or empires, its new, needs patches . but its really promising and again the army tactics and possibilities are amazing with Fun co op, really hoping this game keeps working for more co op abilities,As well as the pay to play element isn't really there, you can “buy crowns” or do a never ending quest loop to get crowns , and that isn't very hard to do. And isn't too grindy as you can try new things every attack and the quests rotates missions.If you going into this game accept their will be bugs but its fairly forgiving game but still really fun, with a feeling of long term progress. as well as this game i belive has a chance to be big on steam.

												There is the basis of a good game here, but the interface is just too difficult to fight through and the gameplay not quite deep enough to make it totally immersive.I think the designers have made some bad choices here and there, in that instead of improving on the UI and deepening the game they have gone for breadth and made more races, which, athough it adds replayability, doesn't improve playability.They have some great concepts, the PvP ""shield"" being one of them, but they haven't been able to get over the steep expectations a game player has these days in terms of interface and display.It is a shame, because I get the feeling that with a bit more investment this could have been a really strong game.It is free up to a point, so I recommend you give it a try, your opinion may differ to mine.  It may just be that my tolerance level is too low for this kind of thing.			",9,0,0,8,8,2,19

												Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom WarsHello! Let me start by saying this. I wanted a game that I could command large masses of troops to attack strongholds. After searching EVERYWHERE I found this. This game exactly fit my needs! Now I am going to let aside my desire for games like this for the rest of the review to keep it biased.Ive been playing this game for about 80 hours now and I fell in love! I only have one friend that plays this so we usually attack together. The game is way more fun with friends! Now on to the things I need to explain.First if you don't care for the tutorials provided at the main menu you WILL be lost completely! I rushed straight to the game and couldnt figure out anything. Please Please do them. Next the Global chat and Disscusion page are needed! The in-game help is very minimal and you will have a lot of questions. Next this game has a lot of bugs!Now a lot of people say this game sucks because it crashes all the time and has slow battles. Do not believe them all. I can run this game at lowest graphics 50fps on my 3gb ram 1.2ghz laptop! When fighting large masses of people it is true that the frame rate drops. For me prop to about 3 or 4fps, I dont really care though because it picks back up after a few seconds.  Now on to the pros and cons.Pros:1. Awesome Gameplay and Idea2. Great Potential3. Friendly Community 4. Great graphics as a whole5. Good money system6. Very complex and soooo much to do7. Long Coop and Solo campaign8. Good rewards for fighting especially PvP rewards9. You can do everything in the game for free!10. Devs that are on the forums helping people out all the time!Cons:1. Individual Model graphics (Mostly my fault for turning down quality from High to Very Low)2. Bugs3. Lack of tutorials and guides4. Not very easy for new players to begin (goes with con 3)5. On my bad laptop takes around 10 to get the game loaded to my city (Again my laptop is bad) Finally my over viewThis game has grown a top from ""Dawn of Fantasy"" with new updates and bug fixes. I really enjoy this game and wish it does good in the future. I can spend hours a day on this game seiging new cities and taking territory. You can also do online coop quests with random people is you feel like it. It is Massively multiplayer and PvP! I hope whoever is reading this decides to download it and give it a try! I mean its Free! Cant get much better than that! And that concludes this reiew! ",31,0,0,2,3,0,2

												Hey addicting game, especially if you are looking for a medival/fantasy twist on the classic strategy / RTS type game play. I love this game because it combined the resource gathering and dependent villagers/peasant workers from Age of Empires with a beautifully done epic medival warfare gameplay that is reminscent of those epic scenes from Lord of the Rings. Despite being a smaller title this game has a lot of potential in being a great play for anyone wanting to play a Co-op / Single player game laying siege and marching troops across the map.

												The bugs alone ruin this game, that's without the dated UI and poor AI.The most game breaking bug I found (and posted about) where you can buy a building and sell it for more over and over again. What does this mean? You don't need to accumulate resources, you simply puchase all your solders via trade and upgrade them to max level with gold. It is a simple number fix yet it has not been changed despite there being a few bug related patches. Either the devs don't listen or they just don't care (or both). ",68,14,0,26,18,0,37

												Unstable servers & numerous game breaking bugs. The pathfinding is TERRIBLE, one can completely avoid melee attacks by spaming movement orders, theres a trick to it. If you give an order to a unit to enter a castle when the gates are open it will pass through the gate even if the gate closes before it arrives. For some unknown reason, even on a quad core 4.2 ghz machine, when units need to find a path it will generate a terrible lagspike and eat your machine alive. Also sometimes they wipe all your characters and you have to start over.Sometimes you will simply not be able to log on for prolonged periods with no explanation.Often the game crashes to desktop.If it worked it would be more fun.

												Great game, considering its free to play, that's worth a try. There are some bugs and it does seem like it would be much better suited to an up front fee as the game feels a bit constricting even if you spend a fair bit on it, but as you can tell by my play time it was worth the download and i have tried both orcs and humans and seen elf gameplay and they are all very unique in style.A quick run down of what the races are like as the game doesn't give the best description of them:Orcs give a lot of freedom in building and rely on mostly melee troops and have poor defensive capabilties.Humans are very linear in building but have a good mix of all troop types and have good defensive capabilities.Elves (from what i have seen) are a good mid ground but are really to unique from the other two especially in economy as their buildings produce resources instead of gathering with workers like the others. They rely heavily on magic and ranged in combat.			",22,2,0,4,9,0,7

												Great game, Its eal hard to find a game that hits all the aspects of what I want in a game. I understand their are still bugs that need to be worked out, but the progress made thus far are impressive and I can't wait to see what the game holds for the future. Recommendations: 1. Incorperate something to the alliance portion to make your own empire seem that more impressive. IE, more costumization pertaining to your clan. visual asspects that other players can see and say ""Yep, that alliance is awesome"", or ""How can we get that?2. Incorperate add on's to own castles. This will make each castle feel more of thier own deisgn and help players create more tatics for deffense. But make small add on's with a variety of dessions to work with. some you can earn and speacial ones only given by ether successfully defending your castle a certian number of times or completing certain missions. The sky is the limit3. I have a few more ideas but I would liketo if anyone responds to this. So I an't just wasting my time writing a bunch of ideas that no one looks at.Again, Awesome game and can't wait to see what u have instore next.			",1,0,0,1,3,0,5

												It's had a rough start, but its fun and has a lot of potential  It is also one of the better free to play games I've played.EDIT:Now that the dev team is back working on the game in full force, the game will only get better, so many of the current issues won't last for long.  It is NOT dead and hasn't been abandoned by its creators, something that can't be said for most of the F2P games that've been around for a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is something with great potential.You get to build a town , build walls,collect resources, and other stuff in real time. You get a hero and some random people and use it to create an impregnable fortress, or an unstoppable army, or whatever. You get to choose between the usual fantasy lineup of humans, humans with long flowing hair and pointed ears (elves), and shrek fanboys (orcs). They each have unique structures and play styles and you go on adventure.That's all I got for the good now the badthey sort of lie about this being pay to win. Of course you don't have as much super BS in game currency. One thing you have is crowns but you  can get them from questing and stuff to build structures and research, and the build times are relatively short. But you have to pay SEVEN US dollars in order to have more than 1 town, you also have to pay to customize your hero in anyway. I get that these guys need money, but it would be nice to atleast have 1 more city free in order to test out other races without throwing all your work down the ugly thing they call a drain.Also they have a premium that tells you how many days you can use. I can't really advocate with bugs or glitches because the closest thing I got was this

Also I can't advocate graphics since I have a device created before the potatoe was evolvedoverall it has potential, but the creators shouldn't try to pull a cheap one if they're saying there's no  P2W feeling			",40,6,0,4,14,0,22

												Wonderful game. Without having to stress over minor things that make other strategy games tedious and easy to lose interest in, Kingdom Wars Dawn of Fantasy is a game I will certainly enjoy playing for countless hours on end. With release of the new DLC (which I will be aqcuiring very soon) thousands of hours of fun gameplay and adventures were added, including a storyline campaign. Can't wait to see what else Siegeworks thinks up for this game, in the mean time I have some castles to siege. Ciao!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Online Empire Simulator, thats what i call the Genre, maybe you call it something else, but its been around for a long long time. Maybe you started in Tribal Wars/Travian, or noticed those Evony ads everywhere. I think my first was Astro Wars in 2002, (its still up) and countless more since then. For many people, the combat might of ruined the game for them, for almost all of these games use automated combat, you send an army and you win or lose.Some games of this genre tried to improve on that, offering tactical deph in way of army formations, eventually some games gave combat a manual mode, in turn based style; Heroes of Gaia and Forge of Empires for example. But we've all probably been waiting for a real RTS combat experience, and Kingdom Wars is the closest thing to getting it, and without walking for hours on an overworld.Naturally, merging these genres brings setbacks. Remember planetside 1? The first MMOFPS? Yeah, the actual gunplay sucked, but you played it because of the scale, you couldnt get that anywhere else, you put up with it. Kingdom Wars is in the same boat, stepping into new ground, the controls suffer for this and take getting used too. I dont view it as a MMORTS though, its an online empire simulator with RTS/RPG mechanics as its broken up into instances with icons to represent your army on the world map, a map shared by all players but in their own instance.Here's what you need to know you're getting into.You pick a race, then customize it by choosing a specific region, then two of five perks.Your town is persistant, you train workers to gather instead of upgrading mines. It CAN be attacked, but not while you're offline.When you make troops, they shouldnt stay in your town, thats when you enter the world map and create an army.The world map is full of NPC cities, these can be traded with, allied with, or dealt with. You cannot see other player cities or armies.There is a long story and quest chain, almost like its a single player campaign in an online game, you'll be doing quests but they can be done in co-op too.Your city is relatively safe compared to other games of this genre, chances of being attacked are low and you cannot be attacked while offline or otherwise unavailable.While your city persistently generates resources all the time, actively playing the game is very rewarding since there is no stamina system holding you back from playing it all day, it does great at blending the Idle and Active aspects of both genres.You cannot build extra cities like other Empire Simulators, you have a main city to grow, and other cities you conquer trickle rewards. You can unlock extra city slots in case you want to try other races or regions but these cities cannot interact.The F2P element is very generous too, starting with Protection peroids that only count down while you're online, having multiple and efficient means of farming premium currency, and restricting PvP to armies of similar Strength, so you wont be fighting an army of powerful premium units without an army of equal strength on your side, and even if you lose, you still get Crowns, so dont shy away from a fight!If you're just a RTS fan, this might not be for you, although there are unlockable Skirmish/Campaigns for solo play. But if you've ever enjoyed growing a persistant online empire then you have to check this out, I cant kill all the elves myself.			",144,21,1,70,7,1,41

												""WE BEEEEEAAATT!!!""-Orc SlayerOn a more serious note, this game is very fun to play in a relaxed way. Combat is very micro managy (or it can be) which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Although, I've found myself spending most of my time so far watching my hunters hunt while I wait for buildings to build. Still a very fun and in depth game. Pro's:+In depth and micro managable combat if you want to, click and swarm units if you don't want to micro.*+Fleshed out races with personalities. +Great soundtrack.+Fun animations and ai things to keep you entertained while things build.+Customizable city lay outs (for the orcs anyway, not sure about other races).+Good variety of units and upgrades.+Good PvP.+Very in depth lore that gives you a good feel for the world.Con's:-Buildings can take a very long time to build (as in a few hours real time).-Skirmish mode has to be bought. -Can be very dull at times.-Most of the quest dialog is text only, but there are still fun unit battlecries.-Graphics are about on par with Warcraft 3 (but then again, it's just as enjoyable). Overall, I recommend this game as a fun strategy game to play as a relaxing ""watch your city grow"" type of game. Especially now that it's only $4.99 USD. 8/10*EDIT: This has recently come to my attention (I didn't really get into much combat earlier and I'm just now really finding out about this): Unit AI. The unit AI is really buggy and they will randomly stop attacking, run the other way, attack things you didn't want them to, and are hard to control. I still recommend this game, but just be aware of this if you buy it (or downloard it I suppose since it's now free to play).			",50,8,0,10,3,0,3

												Grand strategy game which heavily suffered from pathfinding issues, amongst other things. All these issues have now been solved, however. With the free Arcana Expansion released, now is the perfect time to grab the game.A persistent online RTS, or MMORTS even. There's been only few attempts at these over the past decade, and each has had it's own values. But Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars stands out from the few in the genre. In a good way, that is. This is a game of pure quality, you can experience the love the developers put into the game first hand. Apart from the issues which have haunted this game, the core gameplay is sheer fun. Building up your small settlement into a mighty fortress while managing your armies, sieging massive pre-made strongholds, or just going out on a looting trip, no challenge is ever the same.While I have not played the game in quite awhile, I do remember there to be an in-game shop using premium currency. Nothing essential, but plenty of things which cannot be obtained otherwise, including the mighty Dragons. I am, however, quite sure you were able to gain premium currency ingame, which becomes considerably easier the stronger your economy gets.Edit: The cash shop has been revamped. The currency can no longer be bought but only earned in-game. As such there are no longer microtransactions possible, removing any P2W brand the game could possibly have had. These devs are really responsive to the community and actually willing to change their model to such an extend. Kudos for that.			",77,7,3,9,3,0,11

												I would recomend playing this game. The storyline quests are fun and never ending so far. I find that helps greatly in not being bored with a game. I would consider this game similar to a few other games i have played such as Stronghold series, Lords of the realm 2, Lords of Magic. Yes i did refrence some oldschool games there but just giving an idea if you've never checked this game out before. I have found the CSR's in this game to be more helpful then any other game i've played thus far. Willing to go above and beyond in this game for others to help out. You should know in advance if you chose to play this game there is a no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t policy in effect. Meaning don't be a tool to others or you will lose your ability to connect to this game. CSR's and game GM's appear as regular players so keep it cool and enjoy your game. Lastly i will point out that if you use the forums and you do have game avdice the gaming staff does take all suggestions under consideration so if you are looking to have an impct on a game you enjoy... you found the right game.

												A compelling store, decent graphics, and even a fairly priced micro transaction store. Playing Elves in a RTS game is something I have always wanted and now we have it. You can also play humans, and orcs but why would you?In addition to the race you also can pick the realm/lands they live in which adds an additional level on to the complexity and variable traits to your race and settlement. I can't recommend this game enough after 15 hours in and many more to come. The only suggestion I would have for the game developer and publisher would be to automatically give the user more ""city slots"" so I can try additional races without needing to delete my original city or purchase the slot that I may not use if the other races aren’t fun to me.Please try this game, for the cost of nothing you really can't go wrong. Also check out the sequel which is wonderful and cleans up some small issues I have in the original. ",71,21,1,20,17,0,17

												Kingdom wars is actually a pretty nice RTS, and while the MMO aspect doesnt have all that much yet (its mainly just PvP against other players or working with them to take NPC cities, alliances also dont do much yet) from an RTS standpoint i would say its pretty fun. The game takes a while for you to start up, and its certainly not the kind of game you'll ""finish"" in a week or so. Units actually matter as resources take time to collect and when most units die they are permanently gone (exceptions to that include the starting ""Hero"" unit and special units like wizards and dragons that simply lose levels upon death) Speaking of levels, as your units kill enemies they will gain levels, these can be used from simply increasing max HP to extending an archer units sight/amount of arrows. The units that you level over time actually matter as they will be the most powerful units in your army and form the backbone of your fighting force. Tt feels like battles actually mean somthing in this game, win or lose you will be affected. Currently there are only three races in the game, Humans, orcs, and elves, but talk of adding an undead or dwarvern faction is being discussed. I would say if you are into strategy games you should at the very least give this game a try.			",90,17,0,27,16,0,36

												previously wrote a bad review early december.Because - I was one of those who lost everything, account wiped clean.. after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars in 2013.Sent an email to support@reverieworld.com 7th december 2015. Turns out that my email ended up in their spam-filter.. x) ... ok, fair enough I guess, small indie company - in a busy time as well.But once the support did find out, namely the moderator Zane, in a matter of a few hours of personal support with the tools he had available I was up to close to where I was after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars.. since I did get a little bit of some of the stuff that wasn't even out back in 2013. (In exchange for some of all of the now kinda obsolete dragons I bought.. I guess you could say, since you can only have one of each now in an army.)So that's honestly some of the best support I've gotten from the game industry.. (if not the best, looking past the fact that the spam filter caught my email :P )  With that said, I think I can honestly say they do care about this game even after so many years and it going free to play... speaking about free to play, it does actually look like you can get everything for free it just takes a bit more time to build your stuff and level up - but only in the beginning when you build your city :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well I have been keeping my eye on this game and been waiting for the developers to make some changes before I bought it. there is no more in game shop where its a pay to when with cash. I am happy about that. This is the only MMORTS game I could find that is actually 3d with micro managing. I did end up buying it due to the sale of 4.99$. my first thoughts where I wish the graphics were better but when I got a feel how the mechanics of the game works i lost interest ing the graphics and found it has allot of in depth stragety with city managment to build a strong economy. I suggest players to pay attention to the in game quests and everything will come together. I dont have much more to say being I only have been playing for a few hours but so far I am happy. if you go to the community page you will see the developers are very active and doing there best to get this game to last by listening to the players.

												It’s a great RTS game with some good Ideas…..but that is all it got, good ideas.The game suffers from bugs which really ruin the game experience, it's badly optimized, the UI is horribly designed – everything is really small and it's hard to find what you need when using it and the siege…..to say badly implemented is an understatement.The devs released a 2ed game so I guess this one was abandoned so I don’t even expect the game to be fixed at all….I would really like to recommend it but only if it would ever be fixed…..

Posted: November 2, 2014
												So here I am 128 hours of gameplay in my first week of Kingdom Wars... The time I have spent on this game alone should speak for my overwhelming reccomendation of this game. What I still can't believe is that this game truely is Free To Play, and NOT Pay To Win. Anybody can pick up this game without spending a cent and find themselves ruling the battlefield. All it takes is a little knowledge of the economics of the game, and some good old fashion battle Skillz. This review will hopefully outline some of the awesome features included in this game, all so you, the reader, can finally jump into Kingdom Wars and finally expierence the MMORTS that is Kingdom Wars for yourself!First off, a look at the battles! What can I say except that they are truely an epic experience. The game includes battle matchmaking service that ensures you aren't being attacked, or can attack, other players outside of your own Army size and expierence. This ensures that veteran players can't simply prey on the weak newbies to the game. This is awesome as it ensures players don't often shy away from battles, and continually work on their own strategies and skills through first hand expierence. When you finally dawn that Army backed up with a royal dragon, and march to the front gates of an enemy, I guarentee your heart will skip a beat as they fly in wreaking burning havoc on the field.In addition to the gratification you will get from some PvP battle, there are countless PvE battles awaiting you in this game. The map is filled with other PvE castles and towns that are available to attack. In addition, after winning any of these battles you will have the option to loot them for Crowns, OR make them your own vassal, increasing your resource collection rate, and allowing you to recruit troops outside your own race.For those looking for a solid economic simulation, rest assured, you can find that in Kingdom Wars. A lot of the micromanaging has been eliminated from the simulation mode by adding the ability to select your workers and assign them tasks from their menu bar. This works GREAT in battle especially, as when fires break out during a seige you can simply click on the peasant and assign them to fire fighting, and off they go douse the flame preventing further damage. For those that enjoy the micro managing part of this, you can still individually click on your workers and send them to specific duties still. Workers duties don't just stop at your city. You can also establish work camps throughout your region, filling them with workers assigned to tasks on the map, such as wood cutting, gold mining, ore mining, and farming. Managing these camps is even simpler, all it requires is some simple clicking through an economics screen that lets you add workers or subtract them to tasks. This tool is also used at cities that have become your vassal, but in addition, have the ability to setup trade routes to other cities, further expanding your resource gathering.My favorite part so far with the game has actually been the fact I started playing prior to Halloween and was pleasantly surprised to see that the game gets so much developer attention they released a Halloween package that included an ""Eternal Night"" for the holiday. I could truely go on and on about the many features this game includes, but every minute I spend typing this review I feel my anxiety increasing from being away from my own game. That all being said it should be mentioned that there are some minor issues with the game still. On a couple occassions it has froze while loading a PvP battle, and I have found some resources missing a time or two. However, their is nearly always an Moderator or Developer on whom is ready to issist and remedy these issues. I am stunned by how much the developer team cares to ensure a solid game play expierence. In addition, it doesn't matter if you have purchased premium content or not, the DEV team still give you amazing service in navigating a small hiccup here or there. Plus, with nearly daily updates to the game, these small problems are quickly dissapearing. After playing a dozen or so ""Free To Play"" games and always being dissapointed in how much an advantage players who purchased premium content would have over others, I am simply in bliss finally finding a game where the broke the college student could come on and have an enjoyable escape without forking over their tuition money in order to do so...

												Kingdom wars is one of the best free games out. It is a amazing strategy game. its battles are epic and the graphics are amazing. I have had this game for a few days and i think its safe to say i love it. I have managed to get 2 of my friends to get it and they also love it it may be a little confusing at first but you need to just play it for a few minutes to really get it. the game has a lot of potential and i hope i will be here when they imploment it. #Amazing			",27,1,0,5,7,0,15

												Hi, I am a new player to this game and I love it and would recommend it to anyone. It is a fun online game with a great story. If you like Lord of the Rings you will love this game, it has taken great aspects of the triology and has put a good story to it. I myself am a big fan of Age of Empires so I really like the game as the combat is even better that it.Another great aspect of the game is it PvP ( in a similar to clash of clans) but instead of being raided all the time. You can only be attacked while your online. And it's not just attacking their defenses like Clash of Clans but you have to fight their army like in Age of Empires.Thank you for not making it a pay to win game, those are just annoying.It is an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone. (Even weirdos like me)XD			",9,0,0,1,0,0,1

												Definitely recommend this game. It has provided me with hours of entertainment from the quest to PvP. Everything in this game can be obtained without have to buy anything, Even then special units can still be taken out with regular foot soldiers. The balance of this game is great between the 3 races so no one is at any great disadvantage making this a true game of stratagy. The customer support is very helpful and profesional as well and has helped me out a great deal. Even the online MODs are a great help with a good comunity to boot.			",53,1,0,8,8,0,10

Product received for free
												So I started this game with no real expectations. It looked lke your standard Battle for Middle Earth/Civillization knockoff game, with none of the interesting storytelling, and all of the grind. It plays well enough, with no truly devastating glitches that I know of yet, but there was one thing that made me stop playing. Before I get to that thing, let me explain some of the pros and cons of the game: As I've said before, it's like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth and Civilization, with both Real Time Strategy elements and that good old fashioned resource management component to give it a realistic hue. You kind of get tossed into the game with no proper training, and the beginning of the game, as a result, can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Thankfully, you get an awesome amount of Battle Protection, which keep the PVP hawks off of you until you can set up a decent and defensible foundation. There are four main resources: wood, food, stone, and gold, and a fifth pseudo-resource called Influence, or Crowns. Crowns are not important when you're getting your basics down for your town, but later on, they will become a very valuable resource that will become frustrating for you to acquire, since they mostly are acquired via quests of PVP. Luckily, however, you can convert gold to crowns, and if you're good at resource management, then it shouldn't be too much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to handle. Getting the controls down isn't exactly a synch, but it isn't impossible to nag down, if you're experienced with RTS games. The game's story are lore are unimaginative and yawn inducing, with the generic, Tolkien esque knockoff vibes stemming from the three main factions: The Humans, the Elves, and the Orcs/Goblins. The dialogue is badly written, with some of the texts even bleeding off the boxes they are cramped into. The way the dialogue is written, it feels like the writers are trying to copy off ye olde engrish ways of writing, where every word and sentence is a headache to put together and understand in your head. Even if you do manage to finish translating the drek, it's all this very generic lore, with the elves and their nature and magic, the orcs with their war and tribal mentality, and the humans with their... Human♥♥♥♥♥♥ I guess... There's obvious betrayals, with obvious setups for war and bloodshed, and the whole campaign is just there for filler, so the antisocial ♥♥♥♥s can feel like they're playing the game while the PVP nuts hash it out with each other. Now I'll admit it: the gameplay is riddled with dozens of little gems that made me keep wanting to play the game. You had a versatile unit structure (at least with the humans), that allowed for different approaches to siege and warfare. You can fight to defend your stronghold, you can fight to siee someone else's stronghold, and you can just get your army out on a field and hash another army's brains out for all you care. It's a nice, versatile game structure that allows for a lot of possibility. The problems crop up when it comes to controls and the AI itself, and this is where the story of why I stopped playing begins:I was set up as the Human faction, with a nice little stronghold on a hill in the mountains. I had set up everything I needed and didn't need, including a few mercenary workers from both the orc and dwarven lands to work in my mines when I needed them to. I had my peasants fully upgraded and able to handle and gather any resource I needed within minutes. I had an army with knights, mounted knights, cavaliers, and archers, all battle hardened and toughened up wth the scars and calluses from the many grind battles I did on account of Sir Lentoth. I had several dozen catapults primed and ready for a siege, with enough stone to last me several hours, if need be, and both my archers and catapults had the flame upgrade to give me a boost when I had to inevitably shoot the enemies down within their own walls. I was ready for my first major siege, and I was admittedly kind of pumped.I scouted the elven regions, looking for the smallest city to start on. I knew I wasn't ready for the big times yet, and that I needed to start small, so I didn't bite off more than I could chew. I picked out some ♥♥♥♥ery named city att eh top hand corncer of the closest elven region with the ""Very Easy"" tag written into the description. I said, ""♥♥♥♥ it, why not?"" and sent my army there. I started the siege, and found myself doing pretty well, going back and forth with my archers to and from the stronghold, taking out as many as they could before they died, bringing them back, and using my knights and hero to heal them up, and prime them for the next wave. The enemy reserve timer hits zero, their reinforcements come, and at the cost of all of my melee units, I take out the calvary they sent after me. I had 20 archers, my hero, and 9 catapults after that wave. I managed to take out the city's archers, and were using my archers to take out as many within the wall before my catapults took down the gateway. I had my hero healing them up as best as he knew how, and the process still worked, until I finally cracked through the walls. I expected to lose quite a few men once the walls came down, my archers could only reach so far, within the city, after all, and there were plenty of melee units left that were capable of taking me down if I wasn't careful. Problem is, I was careful. I knew my strengths and knew my weaknesses, and I used that to my advantage. I brought my archers in and used them to slaughter all but a few of the units in the city. At that point I decided to make a retreat to reheal and regather my strength. But there was a glitch in the game, a minor flaw concerning the AI. I had 20 archer units, mind you, and I had taken out all of the units, save for a few stragglers that were on their own. Nevertheless, I needed to heal, because something was off with the archers' targeting. My hero wasn't doing any killing, and ended up getting himself killed right at the gate. My archers were killing most of the enemy units, save for a lone mounted unit that they just couldn't hit. Let me reiterate, the archers were firing at the horseman, and were hitting him, but he wasn't taking any damage. He was the enemy that followed my units back to camp as they retreated, I tried firing, repositioning, and refiring once again, but this guy simply would not ♥♥♥♥ing die. His comerades died, the rest of his unit apparently died too, but he wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing die, and wouldn't even get a scratch on him, regardless of the fact that I had 20 archers with flame arrows attacking him. He eneded up following my guys back to camps, killing them one by one, It was then thhat I realized that because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I couldn't get into the city for long enough to win the battle, so I withdrew and sent my army home. Maybe there was a technicality here, maybe the unit was a special one, he did have the ""Mounted Grandmaster"" title on him, after all. But that technicality cost me a battle,cost me my resources, and cost me my energy and time. I'm officially done with this ♥♥♥♥ing game, and I can't stand to see it on my desktop anymore. The minor glitches I could handle. the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storytelling and grindy nature I could tolerate. The painstakingly slow travel speeds of the armies across the continent I could tolerate while reading a book or setting up my town some more. But this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this glitchy, unpredictable ♥♥♥♥over was the straw that broke the camel's back. It's a free game, it's a 3D game, and it's playable until you start to do something important. So waste your time here if you want, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with this♥♥♥♥♥♥  ",10,0,0,6,1,0,2

												This game as a Free Play was great up until my Battle Protection ran out. Then no later than one hour out of player protection I was attacked by a very ""STACKED"" player, very POOR POOR Player vs Player balancing. Although I had played 20 hours, had a very decent sized army and defensive town (with stone walls) I was easily defeated by the attacker. My units were Level 10 to Lv 7 on average. All of the attacker units were Lv 20 that I could see. I had just built a Wizards tower and it would take another 120 crowns to build a Wizard, he already had one and it was fully leveled. I was not playing passsively, I played for a longtime building my base, fortifyinh it and building very decent army. Even so; as soon as Battle Protecttion ended I was crushed.I would not suggest anyone play this game unless you look for disapointment. I would relate this game to any other Facebook or CRAP Online game that requires a Pay to WIN requirement to pull ahead. If you wish to be attacked by Sadists who have money to burn on this game help yourself.20 hours in I was hugely dissapointed,had I been able to progress without Player vs Player it would have been just as enjoyable....however I got the EFFIN CRAP beat out of me by a guy ""vastly"" out leveling me and 10 times my strength. It's really not a matter of ""he did it better"" it's a matter of allowing players vastly stronger to attack and crush any other player starting out no matter how strong he is. It took me sometime to get some of my units to level 11 but as I said he had units all at Lv20. I was smart enough to go out the backside of castle with two Level 10 Mounted Knight units and flanked his Wizard and supply trains. I took out all of his supply trains and pounded on the Wizard for 5 minutes of game time and NO DAMAGE to the wizard. Not point of dmage done to the wizard. In the meantime his wizard cast lightning bolts at my castle defenders and basically took out 50% of my troops al by himself.If there is any game balance there you tell me.The game was somewhat fun up until that attack. I stopped playing not because I'm a sore loser but because if any player 10 times your strength can come in and hammer you then there is just no getting ahead.			",48,6,1,18,9,0,25

												Well, I must say, when I started to play I thought it was not that good because I believe it lacks a tutorial and so when you start you start to get confused on how to play but just go to the top right and there should be a help menu, that helped me do some things but this game does not allow you to place buildings, which kinda sucks you cant custimize your city layout.     But it does get pretty fun when you start to understand it and get troops to attack. Thats pretty fun. I think it is very stragetic. Its not a bad game,But don't plan on customizing your hero and he wears some pretty basic armor, your town, well good luck it looks like a village for a while and i believe you can buy crowns to speed up building progress.     If you ever played clash of clans on tablet, its like that but with more cons then clash but its pros are pretty strong where you can control what your troops do but lack building placement, (does this mean that all our towns look the same)      Well this is a positive review cause i still find it somewhat fun, but give it a try if you think your into games like these.p.s. never send 3 squadron of troops into a army triple the size. they never come out alive.

												This is by far in my opinion one of my favorite real time strategy games, i love everything about it......the beginning of starting out is kinda slow but it gets better, and better! 10/10 i wish there were more RTS games like this one (maybe from a different time-zone also :P)			",135,9,4,8,13,0,11

												although the game has bugs that they are clearly trying to fix and are definitely doing a great job of it especially in the last month this games concept is so overwhelmingly amazing that i have to give it a great scoreunlike most games you actually have to put time into this game and i completely get lost in this world for hours a day i absolutely love everything about this game and with a little more time im sure this game will be perfectthe only thing i would like to see improvement is everything on a much larger scale as in cities and army's ",30,1,0,16,4,0,15

												Real-time strategy is a genre enjoyed by most gamers. there are two distinct ways to play an RTS: online in a single game against opponents or offline against computer generated enemies. Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is the first and ,as of writing this review, only 3D massively-multipleyer-online real-time-strategy game. At first glance, it seems as though these two characterizations could in no way combine together to form a fluent game that's fun to play. Dawn of Fantasy does this almost perfectly. The game takes place in a mideival era with elements inspired by fantasy. The game takes a healthy dose of inspiration from titles such as Age of Empires and Strongholds Legends while still remaining origional and unique. DoF is easy to pick up and play if you are experienced in the RTS genre, but can be challenging if this is your first strategy game. What makes the game unique is that it is in a persistent world that keeps on going even after you log off. while this may sound like a bad thing to you, it truly isn't. While you are away, you can't be attacked by other players and production of any units or construction of any building will not be halted. DoF manages itself well so you don't have to worry while you are away. The game's player-versus-player isn't overpowered either: you won't have to worry about being attacked by players with armies that could overthrow a galactic empire. Instead, you will only be faced against armies that match your own army with a slight 10% deviation. You also won't be attacked by anyone until you construct walls around your city, which isn't mandatory to continue playing the game but not having walls means that you can't play co-operatively with your friends.As soon as you do construct walls though, the game really gets into the most fun parts. As well as being attacked by enemies, you can team up with your friends and wage war against players and NPC's alike. With a game this amazing, you'd think that it would use microtransactions so players could pay-to-win. That is not the case in Kingdom Wars. As of January 10th, 2014 buying your way to victory with in-game currency has been disabled: meaning that the only way you can make money in the game is (Plot Twist!) to play it! I picked up this game for five dollars, but i'd gladly pay the full price for this game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are currently three races to choose from, the empire/town emulation is fazed out quite quickly as you discover a drawn out grind fest to level a single army and any heroes you earn or buy. You can earn heroes and elite units buy generating gold and buying premium crowns or simply buying them with money, you will end up with a single army with a hero or two and several camps generating gold. The PvP will only include a hero setting fires to kill your non elite units and a hero that can solo any regular elite units, you will only have the option to counter a certain hero or just ending up co oping PvE sieges to gain crowns faster. I recommend simply clearing your home town map of quests and enemies then upgrading your resource gathering tools and start trading off extra resources you do not end up using on 2nd/3rd tier units. You want any upgrades that increase your gold income and you want to travel to neighboring towns and find which resource they pay for the most and setting up a camp nearby with that said resource. After you have three maxed camps set up generating resources set up another of all storage traveling units to trade and a single army of 25 2nd/3rd tier tanks, 25 2nd/3rd tier ranged DPS and either 9 town workers to gather resources off dead bodies or 5 of them and 4 storage traveling units. The last slot will be for either your starting hero or a crown bought one, leave your army out of your hometown so no one will attack it but if they do make sure to either have a single hero there or walls with long ranged dps mounts. Gold is key. Support is weak as they run with a small team so wiki and check forums for any issues or wait for the newest Empire Expansion to come out.			",86,2,0,14,9,0,14

												Good game. They put a lot of effort into the music, lore and landscape.The game needs a more social map with static locations of other players and battlegrounds to fight over. Overall it is easy to play. There is solid strategy and good play mechanics. The graphics are ok not spectacular. The market is well done and the special units are not out of reach of the casual player with a reasonable investment of effort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I give this game 8/10Pors-Free to play and not pay to win. There nothing in the game you can buy with real $$$$ that will help you in battle in pvp or pve. Every thing done with in game reasouces.-Customzation. If you download it in the free to play version. You can buy Custom hero looks and city buidling. So you can make the city and your hero fit more to how you like. Sadly the Custom look not free cost like 3 bucks but that is understandible snice the devs still need to make money. For the poeple who go the game before when is cost 20 bucks. Devs were cool, and fair to give us the Customs for free. Snice we already threw in 20.- RPG/RTS Mix. Game got a good mix for a rpg and rts. You have a hero that will lead your army and interact with quest. All units gain lvl with xp were you can increase there attack, hp, range ect. Unless your unit a hero they can die. So game make you think on to lvl your units and keep them alive to reach higher lvls for more powerful units.- Factions. Game have 3 factions with there own play style. They play a role for pve but for pvp their no down side. You can play humans and your freinds can be orcs or elfs.- Fair PVP. pvp set up goes threw army and city power. So you never have some one who has a army for example. 1000 power attack your army of 340 power. You can challange poeple with higher power army but you never have to worry about going up aginst some one who op as hell. Puting that down it goes to skills and army set up wins the battle.-Active dev team. Got to say I always see these guy on the fourms answering and fix issue and bugs in the game.Cons. -Grapichs. Got to hit the basic.. Frist the citys and country side look great. But the Combat and units are not overly amazing.  (This can change in the Future.)- Sounds. The sounds over lay in the game not the best you hear some units fighting with sounds and some with out sounds.(Can change if devs work on it.)-Bugs. game still bugy. ya ya I know the devs are working on it still but Until it fix I leting poeple know game still got a few bugs.More Imerrsions, more units more citys. I see stuff in the loading screen with ships and some town info talking about ships. There like 4 areas in the world map that are empty. You can go in them and fight pve still but there not much gain. Possible that it just intel for things to come later.OVERALL . I still recomend the game. It free to play now and you don't have to spend a dime in the market to get it full value of online game play.			",93,1,0,21,12,0,44

												Dawn of Fantasy is alright. the start is slow, but once you start to generate income; things get going.one thing should be noted; it is P2WF(Pay to Win Faster). there is a currency called ""Influence"" in game that can be bought with either money or in-game gold. it's used for research and elite units.the PvP aspect can be almost completely bypassed by not building walls, which seems a little off for me.other than these few things; Dawn of Fantasy is a pretty good game to kill a few hours a day.

												I have been playing this for 6 months or so, and for a F2P game it is great. I think that the tactics systems are a little less than that memorable series, total war, but come astonishingly close for an F2P game. The graphics are OK, but then again it is a strategy game that is, well, not graphics focused. The buildings and crown system are very good, as the crowns are easily possessed unlike other games such as CoC or Star Trek Online, which are somewhat P2P and P2Win, though advertised otherwise. I think the game really emphasises equality among P2P and F2P players. This game is really geared towards those who like total war and want it in an MMO or cannot afford it. For those tactical masterminds who want to test their cavalry strategies against foolish mortal players, this is for you.			",10,0,0,3,5,0,7

												I'm a huge fan of strategy games, I've played aoe, empire earth, total war, bfme, stronghold, anno 2070, imperium, civilization, might and magic, spellforce,kohan,tzar etc. But Kingdom wars has its own unique concept. You have a castle in a campaing map, you can develop it just as you would do in a strategy browser game, all the changes you do remain. But with you armies you can assault npc castles with other players, you can fight against other players armies or you can assault other players castles, and all in rts battles! So you have a mix of a Stronghold castle building(permanent) combined with castle sieges and pvp battles.  The game has its flaws and some bugs but the community is really close to the players and they are still launching updates to improve the game vastly. It is not p2w, you have crowns which you can buy with money but they are really easy to farm with ingame actions.			",31,2,0,8,8,0,7

												Kingdom wars is a decent game if you want to spend a lot of time building up a small village and slowly building it up more and more as time go on, to be honest I like it I havent found any game similar to it and of course there is also ingame store which I guess kinda breaks the pvp but if you want to just play by yourself build an army and take over cities even if you rip out your own hair doing it I would recommend buying it.PVP side I wouldn't recommanded it since it has ingame store which breaks it people can buy a chest and become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥more or less right away it boost people up since you need a resource called crowns which you get from quest and other means but also you can get a lot by doing ingame purchases.

												Not bad for a free game. I feel like the items they do charge for (all of which are cosmetic) are over priced for many of them however it is early on. The game itself has the problem most MMO RTS have of slow resource gathering but unlike a lot of mmos the buildings themselves build fairly quickly. A BIG thing I have to give this game credit for is they did something I've never seen. MMO 'strategy' games frequently give a grace period (usually 24 hours) that you can't be attacked during. However the counter continues to count down even when you're not logged in. In Kingdom Wars the counter only goes down when you're LOGGED IN! Meaning if you need to take a break and let things farm in the background you can sign off and come back later without loosing that starting protection.			",132,19,0,52,24,1,51

												when i first started this game i tought great more wasted money, but as i played it i become more and more amazed,  this is a revolutionary strategy game if you love strategy/war you must play this, im in love with this game and feel sad that the developers are underfunded i would donate money to help them for they created a amazing game you will fall in love with it if you give it a chance, theres so much to do, unlike all modern RTS games this gives you many options,  stronghold kingdoms is crap compared to this and yet it makes millions,  i pray the developers get rewarded so that they can continue to amaze us, guys i strongly suggest to support this game this is the revolution,  WoW WoW AND WoW.... NOW KEEP IN MIND THE GAME IS STILL BEING FIXED AND WORKED ON SO DON'T BE A LITTLE ♥♥♥♥♥ AND GIVE IT THUMBS DOWN DUE TO A SMALL GLITCH			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked playing ""Game of War"" or any of the Kabam style facebook and tablet games you will get a kick out of what they are attempting to do ""Scale""wise with this game.  Don't worry, they took the ""Pay to Win"" element out of the game that you read other people whinge about in the comments. The ""Crowns"" are a hinderance here and the fact that the monetisation was on this currency that was required for building and upgrading most things was an insane choice. Stick to speed ups and other convenience monetisation if you are to include any at all. Although the game is not ""Fully Cooked""* AI seems to be lazy and disobedient quite often (Pausing in place instead of heading into battle, with no feedback as to why.)* No real progression tree for Peasants/gatherers making this part of the game a dead end grind for resources.* Frame rate drops all over the place as something goes on under the hood that requires some serious optimisation.I do like the game and recommend it to any gaming dabbler that likes playing ""Newish"" games that are attempting something diferent. I've send the game drop in price below 10 usd. You may wish to grab it then.			",595,222,45,89,83,1,128

Great strategy, great customization and awesome fighting.You start out with simple soldiers, but as time passes, can end up with an army of Wizards, Dragons, Minotaur and Ogres.

												Hello everyone.I would like to let you guys know what i think about this game.Well its has great graphics.The game is easy to get started in getting resources.The community of the in game people will help you out the best they can.They are very friendly Building stuff in the game is very simple and easy to learn.How the game keeps playing while your off and your people still gather resources is a great thing to.The things this game could use is 1 to be able to send resources to your friends while they are away like an inbox service 2 to where the friends list updates when someone signs on there has been times where i had to log off when my brother would log on cause it wouldn't change to him being online.Being able to make other towns instead of having to stay with the same town would be nice. But this is my review of the game Thank You			",101,6,2,14,29,0,11

												The pace is slow, can't deny that. And the learning curve could be bypassed a tad more by providing longer resource-boosts throughout the beginning stages for newbies. God forbid they build 69 houses and wonder why they're broke. A more in-depth tutorial wouldn't hurt, either - but then again a good portion of players skip it with a yolo mindset. Their towns don't last long.Anyhow, The graphics are fair, even on the Maximum setting(s). The mechanics (movement) is somewhat clunky, and it takes a good bit for your soldiers/army to realize they've walked past the enemy. A few key commands take a while to register at times, but it could be server lag(?)Resource accusition isn't unbearably slow, but it's nothing to hold your breath over; it's definitely a long term game.This is more or less what the browser-based-strategy MMO gamers wanted, BUT IN 3D!Overall, this game has DEFINITE potential to become something great. 6/10 for now. Will continue to expand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdom Wars, previously known as Dawn of Fantasy, is a controversial game.On the one hand, it offers some unique features well-made and set on a balanced way for the player to enjoy, when you could be expecting grinding. Despite being a FPS (free to play game) and, surprisingly, it offers very few advantages for players who decide to spend their money on it. Namely, you can buy singleplayer, a handful of skins for buildings, banners and heroes, some treasures (basically a 1 push economic boost that will give you a lot of resources) and the premium mode, that gives you better drops of Wealth (an ingame resource that is obtained through fighting), being only the premium mode timed. Excluding the treasures and the premium mode, everything else put together doesn't reach 5€ euros. One of the most non-greedy FPS MMOs I've seen in my gaming life.Gameplay wise, it has its ups and downs. The player freedom is absolute and there are no restrictions to what you may or may not do, at all. There are 2 stances in the game: PvE (Player vs Environment, the AI) and PvP (Player vs Player). Each player has his own game bubble and therefore is own environment, allowing him to fully refuse any player interaction and stick to the questline (which works as a tutorial and introduces you to open field and siege battles to prepare you for multiplayer, as well as offering a grinding option to obtain crowns and loot. Completely skipable but enjoyable). Each player bubble is connected to the rest through the server. In order for 2 players to fight, one of them must select the PvP option always available, and a search engine will find you the nearest fair opponent. The term ""fair"" refers to a strenght value that every army has got attached, avoiding this way imbalanced fights in terms of army size and quality. You may also choose to play cooperative the same way to take over a town, defeat the AI or complete a quest.As every MMO, there's a grinding component: obtaining Wealth. This is the most precious resource in the game that will allow you to upgrade buildings, recruit heroes and some other functions. However, you're free to choose your own way. You may earn as much gold as you can and trade it for Wealth. Raiding the countryside, taking over AI cities, player cities, armies, quests, unlocking achievements. Your own path and style all along.The looting, construction and squad/formation system, as well as the training and siege mechanics are very peculiar and enjoyable, actually making you feel like you're fighting in the harsh mediaval age and adding a very important and heavy strategy factor. There's a wide variet of units and strategies for each one of the 3 races (Humans, orcs and elfs), being the player able to hire troops from other races at any given time. The art style and looking is quite colourful and lively, your town shines with activity from the very beginning.On the other hand, not everything could possibly be good. The game has some unpolished factors and plain issues. Graphical glitches aren't hard to see, minor bugs (units getting stuck, happens very rarely) and a general feel of non polished textures and wierd motion when zooming in the battlefield. The beginning is quite slow and can make new players hesitate about playing the game any longer. The general perfomance FPS wise isn't the best either, making the less powerful PCs sluggish in large sieges and battles.Only time can tell if the game is going to fix these minor issues and become a high quality, popular game.Time has passed. I, as a beta tester who played the game almost 2 years ago now, can tell the development team has only improved in their work. New features are added almost every month, patches are released regularly and in good amount to fix both bigger and minor issues reported by the players. The community as a whole has a generally positive and friendly attitude. Mods and admins attend to every request the players make, include multiple (viable) suggestions and interact with the playerbase. There's almost everytime at least a set of mods in the chat in order to help players who have issues or don't know how to play the game, get started, etc. Refunds for minor losses, glitches or disconnects are instantaneous in-game and take a timelapse of (usually) less than 12 hours to happen. The support team also solves non gameplay related issues single- handed. (This is my own experience: I bought the game 2 years ago, and now that the system has changed, I've been given all the content that my original purchase included and some extras. For free). The playerbase grows in daily basis, the game is always in constant development and there's not such a thing as end-game.All in all, the gameplay after a few hours become very enjoyable. It's by no means a fast paced game: you may take your time to take decisions, reconsiderate the ones you've taken and scratch the ones that didn't pay off. There's a long-term plan. Even if you don't know. You're not going to build your castle overnight: it will take weeks, maybe even a month, as mentioned previously, the beginning is slow. The sieges are highly challenging and PvP is never easy, but the rewards are great. You'll lose entire armies that you'll have to rebuild from scratch, and you'll crush cities, kingdoms and races. The vassal system will allow you to eventually take over every AI center, and be attacked by players who desire such influence. The game is good, it's going to get better, and it's free. It's nothing like you've tried before. You should give it a chance, go ahead and have fun with it. The entire community and support team will be available for you at every point of your Kingdom Wars experience. ",5,0,0,4,0,0,8

												I personally enjoy this game a great deal.  It reminds me of Strong Hold, Age of Empires, and Total War all wrapped up into one; taking certain elements from each and using them to the in such a unique way that it is niether a copy of the games, nor is it a jumbled mess of all those favorite elements from those games.  The mechanics of the game are not at all difficult to learn, especially if you have experience in any of those games that I have listed above.One of the best features, and the one that I most enjoy, is that the initial starting protection does not expire while you are offline.  So someone like me who has to spend 9+ hours a day working is not penalized for that.  The game also allows me to move at my own pace throughout the game; let me choose to explore, raid local areas, siege towns, and then pick up right where I left off.Even though I could continue on with game place itself, I want to take a moment to say that this game does not run hard on my computer.  I have maxed out the settings and it still moves flawlessly.  As a whole, the graphics are not top of the line, but they are naught bad either.I do not recommend many things, but when I do, it means that there is something decent about it.  I suggest that you give this game a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had to redo this review that i put cuz i was enjoying this game and i knew i wanted to spend many hours into the game. What the ♥♥♥♥ are yall doing though after this last update it restarted my whole base i had created yall took everything outta it and gave me level 2 walls that i havnt even built yet if i didnt have food in an army on the freaking world map i wouldnt be able to continue with my base. Plz fix what yall messed up i wouldnt even be mad if u give me just my lvl 1 walls instead of the lvl 2 that u gave me or i wont come back to this game even though i do enjoy playing the game.

												This game is not what it used to be, it has far improved from its original inherited state. As a moderator for the game, I may be biased, but my knowledge and experience gives me the confidence to say that if you choose to download this game, you will not be sorry. However, there are still some bugs, one of the problems with using an old engine. Despite this, they have completely overhauled a majority of the original game, fixed the broken pathfinding, made the world conquerable with the addition of vassal cities, added alliances, and so many more features. All of these additions were free, and now that the game has gone F2P, there is no reason not to try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a really fun game. Creating your mighty city from the small speck of land is a satisfying experience ( It takes time though as does building up an army, but it's worth it). There are always people online and the community is very helpful. A bit of advice stick to the world chat rather than regional chat. Co-op and pvp are fun, you can take npc castles (you can make them your vassles and they will give you tribute) together or challenge each other on the field of battle or in epic sieges. Since the last update I have not had a crash, which was the games only real drawback before,  though it did not stop me from playing 170 hours.Edit ( Becuase I forgot to mention)There are DRAGONS in this game, there are wizards too, but I like dragons more. (Pets his Ice Dragon)			",29,5,0,10,3,0,6

												At first, this seemed like a good idea. Still is a good idea. But, poorly executed in my opinion.Some issues I ran into:- While the tutorial covers how to play as the humans, I tried playing as the elves. Must have been playing for 2 hours before I figured out how to add additional buildings. Not at all clear.- The text in the game is an odd mix of old-english and modern. Threw me off quite a bit.- The elven language uses a lot of custom words and lexicon. But they don't explain what many of the words mean, and you have to figure it out from the contex of the conversation.- Tooltips for the upgrades referenced other upgrades that I could not locate.- Graphical problems. The game would freeze randomly. Sometimes the game would suddenly flip back and forth between day and night multiple times over a few seconds. Turning down my graphics settings didn't seem to help.These are just a few of the issues I had.			",451,145,1,106,46,2,118

												Update: They seemed to have fixed the lag issue, and the game is once again playable. Do not get this game ...yet. I have played the game for quite a few hours, spent around $60 on in game crowns, and the moment I got to a quest with any large amount of things going on the game FPS drops to 0, and freezes making the game unplayable. Windows 7GeForce Radeon 5700 SeriesIntel i5-3570K @3.4GHz16 GB RAMSolid State DriveI have tried all forms of troubleshooting (low graphics, no advanced logging, etc), and even had the luxury of installing the game on my pc after a reformat and fresh install of Windows 7, but the problem still persists. Wasted about $100 on a game that appears to work just fine, but apparently it isn't. I took one for the team, so please stay away until they fix this.			",120,19,5,22,62,0,19

												-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------KW, is a game that make you  forget the time, this is an important thing because  mean that the game are very good and funny.However have many bugs, the most irritating thing is where you are playing online with another people. The game sometime crash and kick you out, losing all the progres in batlle, time protection etc..This is the point that make me feel more angry, because the strong of the game is that point and can not afford to fail in this.I hope the developers continue implementing it and improving it, adding new additions, and most cooperative and perfecting everything about the connection with other players. One way of statistics would be fine either global or battle. In short, this game hope and desire to grow and implement more because here is gold, but need to resolve BUGS, BUGS, BUGS, that only give you frustation. Losing one hour to capture a city,bugged to stay on the loading screen after the victory¡¡, or units through walls, to  name someone..---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdom wars is not only an RTS with in-depth leveling system on units, it is an MMO. The ability to co-op seige npc towns to gain bonus resources and crowns (used for upgrading technologies, and advanced units) is remarkable.Combat system - Each group of soldiers has a number of units inside it, and as long as 1 lives the entire group can be healed. The abilities of each group of soldiers also come with abilities which help in the midst of battle, some are more defensive abilities while others can deal heavy damage or movement speed in tough situations. In all the combat is well rounded with units that counter other units, and ways to win if strategically done.Building and Resources - This game is not a win in 1 day game, it takes patients and time to succeed into being a king. The resource gathering is per minute, which draws the building out but is worth it. During the time it takes to raise walls and gather resources for other builds you can spend time doing the Unlimited quests in the game for Crowns (In-game currency). Each building takes time, but you can build it all at once if you have the resources for it, or if you become impatient on a nessecary building you can rush the build with Crowns.Questing - The game has unlimited quests, this gives you a never-ending pve aspect to a largely pvp game. From Quests you recieve Crowns, and/ Resources. Some quests are very challenging but with co-op quests it notifies you that you can get assistance doing the quest (either from a random player, or from a friend off of your friendslist).PVE - I enjoy the pve the most. The battles in each of the zones is different, elvens fought in elven zones, humans in human zones, and orc's in the orc zones. Beyond that there are zones not allocated to a race. These zones have harder creatures to fight like orges (a unit of the orc's but the entire zone is ogre's), Dwarfs (a style of unit bought with crowns), goblins (another unit of the orc's but the entire zone is goblins), and even an extremely hard zone of Dragons!PVP - The pvp is setup as matchmaking, you will never fight someone much bigger then your army/town and you will never be able to pick on the weak. Its balanced so that you can enjoy fighting without the fear of being slaughtered. If you choose not to fight a player who is trying to fight you then you can do a ""payout"" option and sacrifice some resources or a few units to not have to battle them and it allows you to return to what you what to do (Quest, farm, pve, etc).Not pay to win - I want to state that in no way is this a pay to win game. There is options for buying packages, and being a Premium account but it gives only crowns, resources, and a bonus daily reward for premium accounts. These are all things you can aquire very easily in game but by buying a package you are not spending 30+ minutes gathering the resources or farming the crowns. Buying premium not only saves you time gathering crowns, it also helps the game grow and gives incentive to play. As a closing statement to this i will repeat - Its not pay to win, its free to play. Buying only helps you grow faster and helps the game grow faster. In all I must recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, this breaks the mold of what RTS use to be and brings a new light on the future of RTS. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game and hope to see more content in the future.			",33,0,0,12,4,0,2

												First off i gotta say i went into Kingdom wars aka Dawn of Fantasy with a couple of excpectations.I was excpecting the game to be slow as all hell early game , cause its a MMO rts . And usually these kinda games can be a chore early on.Certian features seemd to look promising . Stuff such as naval combat and building your own settlement , defences and castle's .And finally i was excpectin some form of conquest .Lets start off with the first bit shall we ? This game is by far one of the few MMO type startegy games ive seen where the ammount of resoruces you accumilate is drastically fast . Most games of this sort will have you mine for like at least a month before you get your city to a presentable/Combat ready level . Not in this case ,ive managed to get my city into a decent fighting shape within a week .And for those fearing they might not be ready by the time their battle protection runs out , no fear theres several systems in place that should assure that newbie players dont get ganked up on or attacked by a higher player .Expectation number 2.Now sadly in the game everything is decided for you in terms of where buildings will go with specific poitns o nthe map  . The whole point of the game is besiegeing enemy castles right ? So its kind of dissapointing that you have no say in where startegic defences should go , instead its all pre determined for you . Even the placeing of houses for human players is determined ahead of time .The game should at the least allow you a small ammount of freedom when designing your castle . Like being able to place decorations such as parks or statues etc as well as houses , will make besiegeing each city at least feel somewhat uniqe .From what ive gatherd Naval is currently not in the game as it was unbalanced , the trailer is misleading and they shouldve taken that out before the steam release .Expectation 3 You can conquer NPC cities and make them your vassals . So theres that .Now ...these things seem mostly kinda negative ? Okey now onto what the game does well and features that are good.Quests while generally simple give the player a good sense of what he can expect to be up against , Quests also scale as the players armies grow in size (at least grind quests ). CoOP ing sieges or quests can also be alot of fun as well as you and a random strange coordinate your attack on a stronger opponent .The gameplay during fights can be explained rather simple with one word . Chaotic.Now what i mean with this is , if you dont keep a eye on your units ESPECIALLY melle units it is EXTREMELY difficult to tell weather your units are winning or loseing .Cause all units simply mesh into a large blob , not to mention individual untis from a squad tend to just go wherever and seperate themselfs fro mthe group leading them to end up who knows where.As it is the units move / fight way too quickly to keep up with what they are doing and makes fights more determined by the guy with the army that has the higher level units/ numbers as opposed to strategy.The most input you have during a melle fight is watching out your guys health doesnt go to zero and pull him out  , for a game like this micro manageign every unit like this can be a real pain.Bugs unfortonetly still plauge the game but the blow is somewhat softend by the constant moderators that in a sense refund you for your losses sustaind cause of a bug , so kudos to good communtiy managment .So this review sounds awefully negative right ? In a way it is , but i DO recommend this game , its free to play and it feels like it , all prices and all things they charge for are extremly fair and it looks like it wont be yet another pay 2 win game .The game has potential , especially seeing as how its developed by 4-5 developers . The games graphics are somewhat dated , but they get the job done , which means great news you dont need a strong computer to run it .Overall i highly recommend Kingdom Wars for actually being F2P , being properly supported and fixed , good community and potential for a REALLY great MMO RTS with time as the game and developer grows who knows what we might see in the game			",109,20,1,9,13,0,47

												Kingdom Wars is a fairly decent city builder. You start out small and slowly build up your kindom, which is instanced, and eventually start sending your hero and army out in to the world. There is interaction and PvP with other players and players can invade your kingdom. I enjoyed building my kingdom and doing the castle seiges. Anyways, if you enjoy RTS and online play then you will probably enjoy this game.			",265,102,3,80,26,2,56

												One of the most atmospheric RTS game's I've played and I've played a lot. The graphics/textures may not be AAA quality but they get the job done. The textures are greatly overcome by the stunning lighting and ambient sounds. The three races are very unique and all fun to play and each come with their own strategic playstyles. The City building is especially fun to show off and makes defending them a whole lot more important. The pathfinding needs some work and there is a ton of lag in PvP as there are no Australian servers. The battles are quite overwhelming with the vast amount of units and micro managing is very tedious as unit selecting is glitched. Overall it is an enjoyable game once you get around the many minor technical problems. 7/10			",23,0,0,3,1,0,0

												This is a great game that takes concepts from Middle ages and takes it to another level. Fun to play and most of the time nice rewards for comming back to the game. If you are in to Real-Time Strategy games that lead to a lot of fun to play and give some epic wars, this is one of those better games. There is still a lot to do for making the game more playable for a larger public, but devs are active or at least seems to be active :P For this money, just enjoy the game and hope that some better changes will follow! Have FUN with it! (personal i prefere the single player, multi seems to be a bit buggy in bigger battles). (my score : 8/10 for the first game - 7/10 for the second like it is now). And thats an honnest score for hours of fun!			",144,17,0,65,18,0,32

												So I have played kingdom wars for over 200 hours, and I must say, I would rate this game a 3/10 because it is full of bugs, and mishaps, and problems they're non stop, whether it is based around my resources in my city disappearing out of thin air, or the game not saving and my entire game resetting to multiple hours if not a day in the past, making all the time I had spent playing for nothing, I like how this game is played, but I think it has too many bugs and problems to even be considered to be played, after the problems that have occured to me playing this game, it questions me if it is even worth my time paying the $20 for the second game, considering how bad the first game was, I have a feeling the second game might just be as bad. Therefore I suggest people to skip this title and look at the next RTS. Thanks for reading, hopefully those of who HAVE bought the second game don't run into as many problems as I have run into with the first game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this has a lot of bugs and its had it probelms with servers, it has a lot of potential within it. This game really combines a lot of different game genres e.g. city builder, stragey etc. and if you ask me has a unique play style. The graphics for a free to play are actually quite impressive if you ask me and you will not find yourself easily bored. In its current stage i would give the game 6.5/10. I would have given it more but there are a lot of things the developers need to work on but overall its fun, diversive and in my opinion has a lot of potential to become a fantastic game.

												Okay, I'm going to explain the good and the bad about this game. Keep in mind that this is my first review.The bad: You cannot manuelly place buildings, they are all automatic. If you're hoping to leave your workers to gain resources for you while your offline then you'll be terribly mistaken, while offline you gain 50% less resources than you did before. The game is terribly buggy, Some units walk across the sky in sieges, some walk over mountains and the pathfinding is not that great. The AI are some of the worse I've ever seen; While doing a custom siege I sent my reinforcements to attack the army that was besieging me and after they killed my reinforcements what did they do? they stood there for the next 45 mins doing nothing when my castle was rype for the taking. Some of your troops wont attack certain troops when they're standing right in front of them unless you right click on them to attack. The game also has a terrible learning curve and you will ofen get bored playing this game. You WILL spend most of your time in the world map traveling between cities and to new strongholds to attack. Also when starting off in southmont players can attack your townhall from outside your double layered walls and immediately win the battle since battles are won by destroying the town hall, not the army nor the city. The town hall. Mods are also usually never on, I've never seen one on anyways or one that would actaully do something productive and help players. The good: PVP is fun. Sieges are fun and battles in general are fun. The storylines are decent. Though you cannot manuelly place buildings it is always nice to finish your city and admire its beauty. Theres also a nice little shop that you can spend crowns on to get special units or more resources. Crowns can be rewarded to you through attacking other players or doing quests or by buying them. You also require crowns to build walls. I played 12 hours into this game, so before you haters say I didn't play the game enough then think again. I played 12 hours into this game and i listed all the things i could think of and most of those things are bad. This game may be for some but it's not for everyone. If you can get past all the things listed above then this game might just be for you. 5/10. Im not the best at giving ratings.			",80,3,1,13,13,0,27

												I only have 2.5 hours in the game, but I used to play it on my brothers account for him before I used steam for games, I only actually had Steam originally because I needed a Valve Account to play TF2 on the PS3.. So I used the one my brother made for me. But yeah, I put a little of 200 hours on it for my brother, he ended up deleting the game when I got my own PC so, and the PC I got wasn't able to play the game, so I ended up forgetting about it. So about a year or two ago, I found it again and started playing, I had a better computer then, and so I played it every now and again usually only for about 5 minutes just to check up on my village, and rebuild my defenses. So I didn't do much. However from when I used to play, it was still full of Microtransactions so it wasn't like it's not the same as it is now, and I loved it then and still do, you also have to remember, back then there were a decent amount of hackers... not as much as War Rock but they were still there, and they weren't all that blantant, no free gold, just faster troop movements and probably slightly faster build speeds. So it wasn't really that noticable unless people were recording them invading, and their accounts got looked into by the devs, Most of the time they didn't get banned, the devs just patched the game to disallow the hacks being used. Nowadays I rarely see anything about hackers in the forums, so it doesn't seem like an issue anymore.			",68,3,1,8,7,0,9

												Kingdom Wars, a fantasy RPG game based around 3 races, the Elves, Humans and Orcs. This game is an ''Open-World'' RTS with RPG Elements here and there, with a great execution on Mass-Battles it can be kind of unbalanced here and there, in PvP for example if you have a highly trained army of 25 people you will be easily killed by a weak army of 10 units. The game still requires alot of scaling in many different aspects but the developer team which by the way exists out of only four people who are working very hard to provide you the best possible RTS game they can make out of this.Gameplay, the gameplay aspect of this game is still wonky and outbalanced by bugs or mistakes in the ''Scaling'' system but overall it is still a solid part of this game and most ''Hardcore-RTS'' players will be able to look past it. This game is  not very competitive because of a simple mechanic called: Battle protection. It allows you to not get attacked by anyone at all for a long time. In most FTP RTS games the Battle Protection timer continues even when you are Offline, but in KW Battle Protection pauses removing the Competitive aspect of this game by a lot. Luckily though, you can never be matched against an army bigger than your own. After some mishaps here and there and unbalanced features the gameplay is still solid and since it will most likely be improved in future updates it isn't such a big issue. I give the gameplay in this game a 6/10. Which will most likely become an 8/10 or a 9/10 if they fix these issues.The biggest problem in this game so far are the graphics and the countless bugs that keep appearing, while this may sound like a stupid thing to say, in this case it really isn't. The resolution in this game is incredibly low, I have seen games from back in 2001 that look better than Kingdom Wars. And Kingdom Wars was made in 2010. The bugs though are far worse than the Graphics. People are constantly reporting in that they crash during Sieges or that they bought something with real money and didn't get what they bought an even bigger issue is that the resource counter doesn't work. For example, sometimes I make 10 food per minute and 95 wood per minute and then 10 minutes later I make 29.9 food per minute and 63.5 wood per minute, the Resource counter is by far the biggest issue. Small things like this can be quite irritating at times but it is also to be expected from a WIP game and will most likely be fixed eventually.Cons include:-Outdated graphics-Several unbalanced gameplay elements-Lots of bugs-Huge amount of dialogue can be a bit overwhelming at timesHowever this may sound negative, the pros in this case outnumber and outscale the cons by far. Pros like:-Solid gameplay-Lots of detailed lore -Frequent updates usually containing lots of bug fixes-An ever growing, non-toxic and friendly community-Great and active staff members-And most importantly, NOT pay2winThis game has a lot of potential. As long as the developers get rid of bugs and expands upon its pros, this game will have a bright future ahead of it.			",12,0,0,3,0,0,0

Dawn of Fantasy features both Online PvP play as well as a few single player modes more geared to the casual player. Single Player mode is broken up into three sub-sections; Lay Siege is a quick jump in and play random scenario that starts the player with a squadron of troops and siege weapons (such as Belfries and Trebuchets) in a basic camp just outside the enemy fortress .The goal is to invade the enemy fortress break open the main gate and kill the king. There is only one wave to play in lay Siege and the outcomes does not affect your save file Homelands.Next we have Castle Defense, a little more involved, where players instead are given a hometown with peasants,soldiers,and walls. Tower upgrades, many archers, and spike traps are key to surviving the long siege as wave upon wave of enemy troops march towards your castle front. One problem with this mode is that the enemy troops swarm up by their target gate but do not move out-of-the-way for the battering rams to do their job. Soldiers don’t break in, siege weapons stand around, in fact everyone stands around slowly getting picked off by a single battalion of archers perched within the final keep. Even when the next wave arrives the only rip apart what they can easily access. Again all spoils go to no one after victory/defeat is declared. Lastly for single player there is the Kingdoms mode. This is like a campaign but more open ended. It uses the World Map but with less instruction than the Online Kingdom provides. And instead of quests and tutorials players are given an expected battle every few minutes regardless of progress made. The goal of this mode is to conquer the entire World Map without your Hometown being captured by the enemy forces. This is in my experience the hardest part of the game,and if you are new to the game and confused on how the world map works, don’t fret, it is explained in the Online Kingdom mode, the main mode of the game,which is next.The Online Kingdom mode is a go-at-your own pace experience that guides players through a story based on the player’s selected Kingdom. This game differs from the single player games because it revolves around taking armies out from your hometown and bringing them to the World Map so that they can travel to other towns and quest locations. Other towns give means of trade, buying mercenaries, training units to do other jobs; and in a pinch acting as a place holder for precious units when the town population cap(s) are full. Swapping between the two perspectives, world map and town, is the vital key to Dawn of Fantasy’s uniqueness.Along with all the mechanics introduced in the other modes, this one has an extra influence resource known as crowns that can be used to buy other resources,speed up building constructions, and most importantly buy special units such as dragons and Dwarven fighters. For $9.99 you can buy 120 crowns which grants one the option to purchasing the Royal Dragon, the most powerful unit in the game. Unlike the Kingdom’s Mode of single player, battles are engaged at the pace of the player. The image below is a swarm of Orc Riders actually waiting to speak with my towns hero before deciding to attack my precious colony.With all these gameplay modes spending an hour or two building armies and raising an effective economy is quite easy. Units are created in squads of multiple members. Instead of training one peasant for 180 food the game actually trains 5 little guys on the screen, same goes for infantry. Despite these 5 little workers being spawned the towns’ population is only increased by 1 for doing this. Building houses also increases the total population cap by 1, making a booming economy a very long-term goal. Paradoxically, gathering times for resources in Dawn of Fantasy  are a slower than some may find comfortable. This is to encourage the World Map exploration and trade, as well as looting the dead corpses with peasants for that extra economic boost. Erecting buildings requires no peasants, but takes on average an hour to complete without the use of any crowns.Presentation of the game has a few minor bugs in it as well. Some background cameras in town menus do not stay on course and can be spastic. Leaving your mouse on a button can provide information, but it does not help when the information box is in front of another button. The ticker above head saying the resources gathered per minuet is also inaccurate, and will not update even when there are peasants collecting a resource .Despite these few hiccups the game itself is a treat to play. The camera controls are well done, same can be said about the speech banks. Unlike Age of Empires, the characters in-game actually say what needs your attention, instead of the sound cues you has to learn about through multiple session will not disappear Dawn of Fantasy is a game filled with hours of gameplay for the strategist waiting to capture castles and rule a world of fantasy. The PvP options now are for the competitive player mostly, because you cannot share resources with other player in-game, however alliances in a multiplayer game .			",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

												This game is a lot of fun... at first.It's a fantasy based real time strategy game with a surprisingly good interlacing story for each of the three factions. The free-to-play model is actually very good and isn't as pay-to-win as some people claim, especially since they added a hard-limit to how many crowns (the in-game currency needed to buy the most powerful upgrades/units) you can buy with gold. You can take control of dragons. O.oIf you're clever, you can thrive in this game very quickly. PvP is.. fairly balanced but it feels like an afterthought. What stinks is that the game almost forces you to co-op if you want to take large NPC cities as you only have 30mins to complete a seige. I really, really want to give this game a thumbs up because it IS a lot of fun and has a ton of potential BUT it is absolutely plagued by bugs. You will most likely rage quit the first time you spend 25 mins trying to take a city and the game crashes.. which happens OFTEN. Armies and units will get stuck and you might have to start over entirely. Controls lack finesse. Ehh.. if you're reading this and love fantasy RTS games, feel free to give the game a try but expect a few technical difficulties.			",6,0,0,7,0,0,1

												The game may seem slow at 1st, but you'll come to love it when you start owning the npc and after that, pvp.  The game has all kinds of monsters that you can train into your army, dragons for example.  You can explore, man i love exploring the world, destroy anything in your way.  It's not pay to win so anyone has their chances of winnning.  So far it has everything that a medieval age game you would want.  There's mages too, which i barely got 1, they're hard to get.  There's 3 races atm, Human, Elf, and Orcs but i look forward to more races(undead).  Hopefully there will be navy fleets too from the looks of image pop ups.  So far the only bad thing is some bugs, and the archers are mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  You would think that they would shoot the enemy but they shoot the buildings(does no damage depending on what structure) or on the ground cause of the level of the ground is too high.  So basically you have to manually control them so they dont waste arrows.  As for the my last words, I'mma about to get a hydra! lol			",14,0,0,1,0,0,0

												I personally like Kingdom Wars a lot. First of all I have to say this ISN'T pay to win. I think people saying that didn't understood the game at all. Everything is achievable through gameplay for everyone, only payable items are pure estetics, also the premium just gives a speed boost in certain ways, it is for example like buying an exp boost on league of legends, you just go faster, not better. I repeat, this is a free game, so you can't blame people who use the premium, you can get the full gameplay without it. Guys spending money, are just helping the devs and the game getting better and bigger, is that a bad thing? That said, the game is great, I see a lot of potential. Yes, there are some bugs (what game has no bugs?) and the devs are awesome in fixing them as fast as possible. Just try the game and see yourself, it is free.I really hope new players will come, this game truly deserves it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been playing the past few days and I feel like I can finally make a decent review. Does not seem to have many pay to win aspects to it which is very good for a free to play game. Can get a $10 and $20 pack which will put you ahead but does not seem to give you anything you cant get already, devs need to eat too. Has a sort of Age of Empires feel to it which i like.Unit pathing currently seems to be a bit derpy but definitely not a game killer as im sure it will be fixed. Some other bigs here and there but no game breakers and im sure theyll be hammered out soon so that wont rly affect my judgement much.Be warned if youre at 90 pop cap in your city do not try to keep buying houses to increase your population, price will increase and youll keep paying wood but no new houses, they should definitely disable the button once you hit the cap, again nothing really major just something that made me a bit sad when i realized what happened.Game has a bit of a learning curve (like any mmo / rts). Could likely use some pop up hints perhaps to help new players along. Few of my friends i brought along to play were getting frustrated and i had to help em along, Which isnt a big deal i could just see players not having someone to help them simply giving up out of frustration. Yes i know there are tutorials in the game but lets be honest. Aint nobody got time for dat.Other than those few things which werent really al lthat bad i cant really think of anything negative so now ill start on the positive!Siege warfare seems so far to be implemented pretty well, I like the different world view and city views. You definitely have an mmo feel to it with the quests and your hero but also functions as a very good RTS, They have balanced it pretty well which makes this game pretty unique. I like the trading you can do in the game as well, different cities seem to have different prices for goods which also seems to fluctuate. Gives you something else to do other than the regular quest / kill grind.Early game they have you start off pretty well. You have an income boost which helps a whole lot and really gives you a good nudge to get growing quick, I like the fact that they did this as it makes it so there is little down time / sitting around waiting for resources to accumilate.Different races seem to have different ways of collecting resources, for example orcs dont have farms like humans and they must hunt. Not too sure on elves as i have not played them but differences like this really make each race feel different and adds new things for you to do and new ways for you to play which can keep this game feeling fresh and new for a long time.Normally when i see a currency in a free to play game (crown in this game) I immediately have a bad feeling about the pay to win aspects. They seem to have made it so that after every battle or quest you get crowns, and you dont really need too many to progress. and the packs you are able to buy are limited to one per city slotso someone cant spend all this money and get 10 million crowns. Kudos to the devs on that one.Well thats pretty much all i could think of off the top of my head. Overall i would rate this game at a 7-9/10 (7-9 only because i feel like i would need to play to the end game in order to really be sure)			",174,13,5,15,62,2,59

												Español: Tengo que admitir que no me esperaba mucho de este juego, que sería algo tan simple como construir y matar. Pero estaba equivocado ... llevo pocos días de juego y me está encantando. Simplificándolo mucho, podría decirse que es una mezcla de un juego de navegador, tipo Ikariam/ogame, y un total war, para las batallas. Es un juego donde tienes que esperar X tiempo para conseguir recursos, unidades, etc ... combinado con batallas en tiempo real a gran escala. Además de una buena diplomacia incluida, buen transfondo y multijugador. Entre otras cosas. Haciendo que la gestión de cada raza sean completamente diferentes entre sí, además del estilo de juego.Es un tipo de juego que jamás había visto y que no me esperaba que me gustase tanto.

												Kingdom Wars is a amazing title to play if you are into the rts genre. Taking the scale of the total war series and stronghold games it is a game you are sure to play for hours. My inicial recations and thoughts on the game were that it would be a pay to win players dream, but this was not the case. Like many F2P games out there paying only gets you cosmetics that have no greater purpose. The ingame economy system is also well balanced with limatations to just how much you can acheive. Based around four main resource types and crowns, the harder to earn currency, you'll have a fun time trying to arrange your workers into such a way to balacnce it out. Another strong point in this game is the graphics and model textures. For being made by a realtively small company the game is very well looking with some much going on at once with minmal to no lag what-so-ever. Going off of graphics they have a very sound sound engine (pun intended) that has very realistic effects and ambience.Now no game is perfect, this game does have a few bugs now and then, but nothing gamebreaking. The devs and mods are on all the time with their fanbase and players supporting and helping when they can. It can also be a little on the hard to run side if your computer is a little on the lower side. With the amount and time the devs put in this game can only get better in the future.

												Kingdom Wars is a real time strategy game with a twist. think stronghold kingdom meet age of empire. i really enjoy the game so far,, when you first start , it give you a 20 hours safe from pvp buff.  im up to 13 h into the game, got my army wipe a couple times,, it could use better tutorial  to prepare you for tough battle, but its not so hard to give up,, you feel proud when you succeed a siege of a stronghold, after adjusting your tactic because your full army got wipe the first time you tryed.   overall, its a very fun game, keeps you login you back after a few hours to spend your ressource , big plus is it doesnt look like its pay to win, altho i have to say, it can be a while to gather crown to spend on upgrade. maybe im doing something wrong.  so ya,, if you like this sort of game, where it takes days/ months to build your empire,, its a great try at least,, hey its f2p  you cant go wrong with that.  try it.  cant wait to see what the pvp looks like,, 7/10			",168,26,4,20,14,2,10

												So the game itself is phenomanal but the only 2 things i have to complane about is: The loading screens they're 2 mins each for me and the second thing is the bugs i had a lvl 60 hydra and i logged off one day and the next it was gone, deleted from the game and so i had to save up 160 more crowns just to get another one but other than that i give it a 8/10 rating and i definetly recommend this if you like midevil/fantasy/mmo/ruler games.

												I bought the game about 2 years ago.  Back when they had the cash shop.  Although some poeple felt that it was pay to win, it was not in the least bit since I never spent a dime on it and still was able to pve and pvp without problems.  Still to this day now that it's F2P, you still don't have to pay for anything since your armies are always matched with people of similar armies.  It's a really good way of handeling a cash shop.  If you don't want to pay any money, you will have to learn how to play is all, which isn't a bad thing.It was a buggy game when I first got a hold of it, as most newish games, and that did deter me for about 4 months.  After a while they had a few patches that made it less laggy for me and that's when I started racking up the hours, Building more cities, destroying more foes, and gathering those crowns for more armies.  I grew up playing RTS games, Age of Empires was my first multiplayer game, and I played that for a couple of years along with Empire earth when it came out.  This has strong elements of your typical RTS, but it has so much more.  Long term cities, taking over NPC towns, exploring the map, questing, and co-op sieging just to name a few great things that seperate it from your standard RTS.I had so much fun that I invited a few friends to play with me and after teaching them how to play we were pillaging empires left and right.  When you play with friends, it usually makes a game that much more fun.  You invite friends, your friends invite friends, etc..  Soon you can start an alliance with people you know that you will get along with.  Although you can only 2v1 vs AI, and 1v1 in pvp, hopefully later in the games life they can expand that.   Good times were spent on sieging cities with a friend. I wasn't too interested in the MMO part of this game at first, I had played world of warcraft for about 2 years back in 2008, and grew out of it, but this game fits right in and youre not overpowerd by MMO nerds sitting on a♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket and trying to hit on a night elf.   I grew up playing age of empires, empire earth, and starcraft.  Although this game isnt on the same level, it's still tons of fun.  More of a long term RTS.Since I bought the game, fast forward to today, Reverie has had many great patches that improved the game immensely, and with the launch of their FtP model, it's better than ever.  New units, new buildings, better performance, vassels, and unit balencing (and that's just the tip of the iceberg)Also, I have a guide on my profile for new players to get some all arounds tips for the game.9/10  Unique, fun, cheap, and helpful devs/mods.  Would buy again.			",112,12,0,13,11,0,6

												Now with Age of Empire Online out of the way "" News Flash They Closing Doors"" This game could shine, for those who enjoy strategy game and commanding a kingdom, I really do reccomended this game. I enjoy playing this very much, i am sure you will as well. Even while logged off your kingdom thrives and collects resources, totally awesome. It is slow to mediumly paced but you won't feel it as you immerse yourself the many facets of the game... Either onsale or for 19.99 it's definately worth the price, luckliy i just started and today there is new content being added... See yah!			",101,3,1,5,5,0,2

Personnaly this is my favorite game and touches everything I like and want from a game and it does not require you to spend money to have a nice time, yes it might have a few bugs/glitches but, in the overall, after you`ve spent a little time and gave the effort while playing you`ll realise that it`s a truely amazing game.Not only is the game itself simply fantastic but, the Veteran players themselfs are awesome, while not only just providing help and guidance to new players but they also help out the developers on fixing and adding new content to the game. I strongly recommend you to try out this wonderful game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold meets AoE fused with Mount n Blade with dash of awesome. Dispite what the critics say this game has kept me engrosed and engaged.  It has a learning curve but once you get the hang of it you better hang on tight. PVP yes, it has that. Guilds, Yup! Solo play, they got that covered too. Base building for sure. Oh, you just want to sit back and quest. You got it!Graphically speeking its not the prettiest but it's loads better than any Stronhold game. It's RT based so plan your time wisely or you might just get hooked enough to make your friends think you moved and were enrolled in some witness protection program.Try it now!  ",54,6,0,11,16,0,11

												Funny Total War like game with RPG elements and Browser games elements.It's no more P2W but it has marginal Pay2Progress elements.Devs keep upgrading the game nearly every week and try to improve the game further and further.One Problem that this game has is that creating formations with your units is a bit messy because the unitcontrol system is not a powerful tool.It is very hard to march forward in a specific formation or place your units in the right order on the battlefield. And the ""Hold the Ground"" order is really buggy and not working perfect.That is something that should be improved.A other Problem is that single units can be too strong. Something that defentily should be fixed. The last problem is, is that the AI is extremly passive. You can lure enemy AI units one by one out and kill them.It is possible to conquer a whole fortress with very few units.But this game is still great and has alot potential.There is no other game like this out there.

												Stunning variety amongst the three races with their unique Units and Research. Your given so much Freedom to acheive what you want with this game. Rather beautifull lands and buildings   ( unless your orc, lol ). Combat in Quest battles is of the type where if you don't think on the run, you'll lose your troops en-mass, a terrific challange alone, without the PVP added. It's not that combat is alligned against you but the choice pre-battle of your units is critical. Fortunitly you are given a very wide range of units, if you choose to research them from amongst each race and choice of mercenary forces also wide are available to be hired from cities. Very good help within game and support.			",12,0,0,4,3,0,11

												I have been playing this game for the last few weeks.  I was so excited about this game in my first day, that I draged 5 of my friends to play this game.  With any game you find what you like and don't like.  What sets this game off for me is, its what I expect an MMORTS to be!  When friends of mine ask me, whats the game like or how to compare it.  I tell them that this is a unique game, then I tell them I can help them learn.  I personly found the game easy to learn and so did my friends.  The game is complex to get you very excited, but not difficult by any means.  The game runs smooth on the graphics and is very appealing to the eyes.  Yet of course my favorite thing of all about this game however is the building of my own castle and how I want to build my army, hoping for more styles of castle and land layouts down the road!  So would I recommend this game to anyone, yes deffenitely!  Even if you don't care for  the multiplayer aspect or your not a true rts fan, give this game a whirl, I bet you'll find something you highly enjoy about Kingdom Wars.			",107,6,0,20,7,0,17

												This game is a very unike and good game.im going to be listing the good factore about these games and the rating of each sectionCombat- 7/10 the combat in this game is very good, but is still sort of buggy. sometimes during the combat you dont even see the soliders swinging their swords or anything, but the descriptions of each troop stating their weaknesses and stregths actually take place in the conbat. overall i think the combat has a lot of potential, but lacks a bit. it is definitly the only weakness of this game graphics-7/10 as we know this game was released in 2013 but the graphics arent bad for a free game. im not too sure how this game company profits off this amazing game becuase you can really see that a lot of time and money went into this game, but it is still free. the graphics in this game are bummy in some areas, but are pretty good overallStrategy-9/10 this game requires a lot of brains and time to be successful. it is a very slow game to progress through (i got 10 hours and i still dont have walls) but it makes it very realistic, this isnt like a game where everything happens and its very quick. however when you do spend money it speeds up this process, which is obviously intended so the company can make profit,Multiplayer-10/10 this game has an amazing multiplayer layout. you can send your friends resorces, do campaign with them, and fight with them. To me the multiplayer is pretty straight foreward, and i wouldnt change a thing about it.Difficult- 9/10 Im going to admit, this game is VERY difficult. your troops die pretty easily and its not easy to get precious resorces like wood stone gold or food. by building a wide variety of building, it eats up all of them. this is where the money spenders come in and get a free run to successionoverall i would STRONGLY recommed this game due to the fact that it is free and is AMAZING, and i would pay for this game any day. this game is a mix of banished,mount and blade, and stronghold crusader. if i were you i would get my hands on this before the developers put a price on this. i hope this helped you make you decision:)			",42,3,0,9,5,0,1

												This game is excellent for all of those people who are dying for a patient, Non-Pay2win game. Kingdom Wars is like the Total War Series + the Age of Empires Series. What I love about this game is that there are 3 Factions that are playable, the Humans, the Orcs, and the Elves, each with its own unique strengths. There is also a conquerable map that has little settlements that have their very own, very detailed lore. This game is also not a frustrating Pay2win game, although, there is a special currency called influence that you may buy with real money, and the currency is needed to grow your Empire, it is not that hard to get though. There are many ways to get this special currency, one way is to log in everyday and debate whether to claim Influence or the Random item, another way to get Influence would be to battle with other players. The Community so far seems very nice and so far I've not met many people who want to make you have a bad time while playing. The game offers very fun challenges that really are challenging! So far, I am having a blast playing, I've been very addicted to this game and ever want to pull my eyes off the screen, I'd highly reccomend this game to your friends!			",11,0,0,2,1,0,4

												Oneof the best RTS Resource games to come out in forever. Love the combat system that actually forces you to think about your units and where to place them and the seige mode is very clean and well built.  The Addition of winter changing resource gathering was also a great idea. It is a refreshing change from games where in an hour you could be pvp ready and decimating those who were just behind you for easy points. Definitely recommend this game to all those who like games that require patience and skill with resource management.			",90,8,1,14,11,0,6

Offering an evolving online environment, in which you will be gathering resources, constructing buildings and walls, directing your citizens, completing quests in the service of mighty nobles and fiendish rogues, and managing your economy - all within an online realm that grows, works, lives, and breathes even when you log off.

The game looks nice, and it also has a good gameplay.BUT, the game is full of buggs and the Dev's don't give a ♥♥♥♥.Every time i play the game all goes good untill i get to the first big mission on world map.Every damn time i finish it, the game crashes and i cant log back in.I have tried EVERYTHING mentioned on the forums, and i still cant get the game to work.The only thing that works is deleting my city, restart game, start new city, and then magicly i can log in !Untill i get to the same mission again and the game crashes and i cant get back in.I Have tried like 5 new city's now (all different races) And EVERY damn time when i get to the same mission the game freezes up and i cant log back in.This is why i have like 16 hrs played. (I also have tried logging in to city's like 200-300 times so that also makes up for 2 hrs in-game)....The most important part is that the Dev's dont answer my questions and they dont give a ♥♥♥♥.Bought the game more then a week ago and they still haven't replied to my e-mails.Steam doesnt refund my cash because i have more then 2hrs played.So yeah, here i am, with a game i wish to play but nobody giving a ♥♥♥♥ about the situation.DON'T waste your money on a game like this.Just keep searching for something better !

												This game is OK, it could be a great game, but it has some flaws... actually it has three flaws.1st : You have a huge army and attack a enemy, but you can not launch a huge assault, because you can only control a limited amount of units, but this is a minor flaw.2nd : This is a big one and really annoys me. Some times the game just freezes... just like that, mostly it starts running again after a minute, but some times you have to close it via task manager and when you restart it then, your progress of over half a hour of gameplay is lost... and that happened to me two times.3rd : This one is a even bigger one and seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. The trebuchets are broken.I was doing the quest ""Dangerous Neighbours"" and attacked the second of the three strongholds.It had 2 stonewalls, towers, mounted trebuchets a.s.o. I had a full army of swordsmen, maceman, and archers, with 10 trebuchets and 1000 stones. I ordered my trebuchets to throw the stones on one wall segment of the outer wall and set them on ""hold fire"" so they kept shooting and shooting. I know that catapults are no accurate weapon, but with the trebuchets in this game you can be happy if they hit anything. After several minutes some buildings were damaged, but those were mostly buildings inside the walls and a few soldiers were killed, but nothing happened to the wall segment which i told my trebuchets to attack.Many frustrating minutes later there were no stones left to throw at the enemy. In the end my trebuchets destroyed two towers and dozens of houses, but the targetet wall segment still had about 50% of its HPs left so i had to cancel the attack, because there was no way i could get into the Stronghold anymore.BUT I still recommend this game because those things can be fixed by patches and because this game is free to play.

												So heres a quick and honest brake down of the game. This game offers a ton of replay value, rick lore, cool faction units and epic pve and pvp battles rangeing from seiges or open feild. The world feels active and alive and as a pvper on a good day i can fund my cites easy from pvp loot. And a huge more, but this game has a ton of game breaking bugs the devs have promised to patch since I played in beta. A huge lack of a support team the updates have stoped to a hault no cummuncation to the players. Pvp system is buggey most of the time ui is very out dated the match making for the game is lacking big time as a pvper my self I haft to spam click the auto search sometimes it feels 100 times before I even get any thing and then that person just pays out. Most days I cant find any thing and the fact that there is no auto search function that I can pop and go do somthing else it bothers me alot having this account and 2 others I've pvped on. I should ot haft to click over and over again. But putting that aside if you are lookinf for a ftp mmo rts that you can pass the time with and not haft to pay to get any thing back this is one of them. Tbh this is the first mmo rts I've played on steam that was not 100 % pay to win. I think kingdomwars would be defined as pay for time you can get crowns very easy in the game. The only benifte i see it giving is faster build times. So that said I've played this game through 5 so called mistake server wipess and I can say I never regreted playing. But with a bunch of new rts mmos going into alpha next mnoths peeps I would say leave this on the back burnner for a bit. It might explode on its self ride safe and long live the orcs!

												Overall this game is pretty enjoyable imo. There are some things I feel could be better - notably the lack of customization with regards to walling in your settlements - but it's a solid RTS I feel, with solid combat and enjoyable-enough game mechanics that it's worth your time. Definitely a good F2P game. Solid 6.5/10 in its current state and the devs are working on major overhauling improvements, so I can only hope to see that score increase over the next few months.

												The f2p model is fair - you get enough to get started and there are no paywalls. There are starter-packs that give a minor boost, but you can't call that pay-to-win at all: the matchmaking is very restrictive.The AI has bugs that can be cumbersome, but the devs/mods work fast and resolve problems reliably. The UI is borderline terrible and the build options could really use hotkeys. As you get dragons, that can be disabled by the enemy but not permanently killed, the good outweighs the bad and I can recommend the game.			",177,52,1,45,14,0,36

												This is NOT a pay to win game.  Yes, you can buy crowns, but I make so much gold that if I had the storage for it I would not need to spend mony on crowns.  Most of the micro purchases are cosmetic and give access to units that you can get in game anyway.I have been playing this game for about 3 months now and I like it alot.  If you liked the total war series you should like this one.  It reminds me a lot of that series of games with the added benefit of Orcs and Elves.  That being said there are a few things I don't like about it, takes for ever to walk to the battles in my opinion.  I know there are technologies you can unlock to march faster, but they are quite expensive as far as crowns go and the one that I have didn't really increase it much.  THe trading system in the cities seems a bit odd, like I lose money everytime, but then I am not too powerful as of yet and don't do a lot of trading so maybe I am wrong.Anyway, I really like the game and contine to play it and will continue to.

												Yes the game is excellent, there are some parts that lag a bit but not too bad at all like in the world map. The UI for moving material is a bit complex and some times requires a little for thought before hand. It would also be nice to put a quest on hold if it is still out of reach power wise and start a new quest so troops can level up instead of stopping in a blank area on the world map.....I havent been through the whole world as of yet but it also seems all the stops in between the cities and town always have the exact same map....it seems anyways i could be wrong on that one,  Over all out of 10 I would definately give this game an 8 to 8.5 on my own personal sfinter scale, great job making this game you all.Mike.

But it was well worth itThis game is free but there is in no way Pay to win Clearly these developers know what they are doing because we all hate P2W.Now there were some Hicupps in the begining but they were quickly eradicated in the following months.Now there are little bugs stopping development and the updates are coming faster and faster every two months.I will be honest tho i would like to see more updates and more focus on this game instead of KW:B2 It seemd like a cash grab to me.This is my score       7/10   Also did i mention its free?!

												Kingdom Wars is truly a unique take on the RTS (Real Time Strategy) genre and is truly worth a try for both fans of the genre as well as those new to it.  People who are fans of city-building simulators will also find much to enjoy in this unique title.While Kingdom Wars has gone through many changes, some good, some less-than-desirable, overall the experience is really something that has to be experienced to understand it.  The very early stages of the game can be somewhat confusing, however it is my understanding that the developers have addressed this issue in the time since I was a new player.Although there is the option to spend real money (in fact, I obtained my copy of the game back when it was still a regular purchasable title) the game truly is ""free to play"" in the sense that, while you can beef up your army using real money purchases, you will not be penalized for not doing so.  When PvP occurs (which is largely optional) players are matched up roughly based on the strength of their armies.  This is not an absolutely perfect system, however it vastly eliminates the possiblity that your opponent will have an absurly stronger army than yours via real money purchases.Also, both the PvP and the PvE aspects of the game are truly exciting and offer an experience not found in other RTS games or titles from other genres.  While similar to PvP, the PvE side of the game can be better tailored for those who like a more relaxed approach to playing.The thing I like most in the game is the building of one's kingdom, which is a gradual process that can take weeks or months to expand, depending on your playstyle.  It is really fun to carefully plan your defenses out and try to set up ambushes for would-be attackers, while at the same time it can be very engaging in that you take semi-permanent losses from battles, so you are encouraged to really think things through.  This is the most true for the human race (who specializes in defense) however all of the races, humans, elves and orcs, have an aspect of this.The different races play quite differently and I actually have yet to branch out into the orcs and elves, but their playstyles are all unique and offer a vast amount of play time should you choose to explore all three.  Even with only having focused on one race, I have spent many hours on this game and feel like I have only scratched the surface.This game has its rough edges, but the developers are serious about making it as polished as can be and have been working hard to make many changes that both improve the gameplay and well as the look and feel of the game.  Bugs have been being addressed over time and overall the game can be played and enjoyed with few interruptions caused by bugs.  The UI (User Interface) could use some attention, however it is still quite functional and usable after some experience with it.Overall, this game is really fun (which is the most imporant part to many people) and worthy of sinking at least a couple dozen hours into it before deciding if you like it or not.  Do not be fooled by the graphics or the first few minutes of the game - this game is huge and in a very good way.			",63,3,1,14,8,0,6

												So heres a quick and honest brake down of the game. This game offers a ton of replay value, rick lore, cool faction units and epic pve and pvp battles rangeing from seiges or open feild. The world feels active and alive and as a pvper on a good day i can fund my cites easy from pvp loot. And a huge more, but this game has a ton of game breaking bugs the devs have promised to patch since I played in beta. A huge lack of a support team the updates have stoped to a hault no cummuncation to the players. Pvp system is buggey most of the time ui is very out dated the match making for the game is lacking big time as a pvper my self I haft to spam click the auto search sometimes it feels 100 times before I even get any thing and then that person just pays out. Most days I cant find any thing and the fact that there is no auto search function that I can pop and go do somthing else it bothers me alot having this account and 2 others I've pvped on. I should ot haft to click over and over again. But putting that aside if you are lookinf for a ftp mmo rts that you can pass the time with and not haft to pay to get any thing back this is one of them. Tbh this is the first mmo rts I've played on steam that was not 100 % pay to win. I think kingdomwars would be defined as pay for time you can get crowns very easy in the game. The only benifte i see it giving is faster build times. So that said I've played this game through 5 so called mistake server wipess and I can say I never regreted playing. But with a bunch of new rts mmos going into alpha next mnoths peeps I would say leave this on the back burnner for a bit. It might explode on its self ride safe and long live the orcs!

												Kingdom Wars is an amazing game, putting good combat with a good economy, as well as building your own base, almost EXACTLY the way the want it, Archeage and Stronghold Kingdoms had a baby. The graphics of this game are amazing (Although my computer can't run it) for anyone who can run them. I totally recommend ths game to almost anyone except people ages 60+ (Sorry Grandma.) The game mechanics take some getting used to, and the music is alright, not terrific, however. You can siege castles with siege equipment, choose your race, where you live, (Desert, Forest etc.) and overall what you do in that world. You may set up camps in a random area on this game's amazing map, and kill the people/beasts living there for food and gold. The camps you set up have different prices, if you want to make your camp hard to destroy, sent a bunch of supplies with that party, and make a big azz camp, if you are there for supplies, spend less. The quests in the game are, however, sometimes glitchy and unexciting. But, you know, whatevs when you could be slaughtering thousands of humans with your ogres (Go orcs!) Anyway this game is amazing, I KNOW GRANDMA GO PLAY SOME COD, and I totally recommend it to anybody lookin for a time spender. :D			",46,6,0,8,3,0,14

												First off, I do recommend this game. Other titles of this genre tend to be slow moving and often play at a stand still pace.  Kingdom Wars has much more to do and livens up the game play and that is a nice chance of what you get used to playing these types.   Lots of options for varied town and playing styles. My only critique is that for mission completion there is no help guide.  Certain functions are no explained, so just use the chat to ask another player, so far the community has been pretty helpful.			",7,4,0,4,2,0,0

The Siege combat on another players land, is truly immersing and has such an epic feel when your troops are marching up the hill and his troops are raining arrows down upon, your sending fireballs in there base it's just so epic.

												I actually bought the game back in the day, stumbling upon it during a massive sale. At the time, I wasn't particularly impressed, as it lacked a lot of the freedom of your typical city-builder, and the progress seemed slow enough that I wondered if I'd ever see my town grow into a city before losing interest in the game.In retrospect, I think I had largely missed the point. As it has gone free-to-play, firstly, I'm glad it avoided the pittfalls of becoming a pay-to-win game in the process, as the two more often than not go hand-in-hand. My town is still small and undeveloped, and as more of a city-builder myself, I have yet to really go deep into the siege/warfare aspects of the game. The controls for that, in what little of it I have engaged in, were a little clunky and troops were difficult to manage, but it seemed that it was surmountable, and that with time and experience, one could probably master the warfare system, should they be inclined to do so.As a city-builder, which is where I'm coming from, it is a bit limited, as you don't really choose where buildings go as freely as you do in most others. That said. it has been fun seeing my town grow, and stocking it with a large enough garrison to defend myself against any potential attackers. In fact, the game is probably more comparable to an online game I used to play called Travian, but it is very polished graphically in comparison, and much deeper in terms of variability and different units/buildings.The slow pace of the game might deter some, but I've come to enjoy stopping by every so often to see how many resources my villagers have accumulated. I check in once every other night or so, and in that span they've usually cobbled together enough stuff for me to be able to signifiantly add to my town with each log in.All-in-all, it's not a game for everyone, and it limits the freedom of both the city-builder and the strategy/siege models, however in return it provides both of those in one game, doing something unique and playable, to me anyway. There's a lot in here for one game, and not necessarily too much, as is so often the case these days.The price is right, these days, so it's certainly worth giving a shot, and remember to log in a few times before giving up on it, if you're not enjoying it so much. It wasn't until my fifth login or so that I started realizing that I was actually having fun with the game. Be that a critique or not, I recommend the game as it currently stands.

												This is one of the best RTS games that I have ever played.There are major differences in playstyle between each race, and each race has three different areas that will have a large impact on what your playstyle will be like. which makes the game have an incredible good replay value. The combat is very solid and fulfilling, sieges are amazingly fun, and when your village grows it is definately noticeable.Also you can spam and repress peasants  10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 I would give this game a far more favorable revew, however when my town was struck with a bug that deleted ALL of my buildings, units, aswell as resources i was distraught to say the least, The game in itself is pretty good and worth spending a bit of time on. It has solid mechanics and works just as good as any other RTS, but that part is not the best one. It is the mix of both RPG and RTS that changes my perception on the game. It is the type of game that i have always wanted to play, it is a very rough diamond however. It suffers from atleast a few gamebreaking bugs, bad pathing and questionable AI. The customization options are severely lacking unless you cough up some real money for it, which to me might have been fine, if not for the fact that you cannot customize anything in the game without real money. I would write more, but this will have to suffice until the Devs give me my kingdom back. I will give people a very sceptical recommendation.			",7,0,0,4,0,0,1

												What I liked the most in the game is the capacity of building your town/city as your style, the management of your armies and economy it's also very good. The politics are very simple and so the mechanics of the game, such as: trade, hiring mercenaries, heal units. I believe that what can get players confused or a bit annoyed it's the camp, on the Online mode you only receive the bonus from the camp if you're online. On the offline mode, the single player it's more simple than ever, some may not like it, because you only manage your armies and you don't make your city/town grow to be powerful. You have to deal with the armies and a very small part in managemet of the city, this could improve by letting players using the building system inside the city on Single player. Now, in other words, this game is excellent to people who enjoy strategy war games, it's really amazing the system and the graphics are beautiful and easy to play during the battles. This game could improve? Yes, but it's also give us a great new experience in this new style of strategy-war-rpg-management game and also it's very fun and addicting. I truly recommend this game to anyone who enjoy being a ""king"" even in a fantasy world.			",6,0,0,5,1,0,5

												If you are into games that return on your investment of planning, time, and forsight this is a great game. It truly benefits the planner, and has some fun storyline action as well. Later on while moving into higher level PvP and PvE you can find yourself having to think on the move as everyone has a new trick and generally speaking players keep strategy to themselves. Although there are a few glitches/graphical errors, the games Dev's and Mod's have done a great job fixing what we complain about, if we complain about it through the right channels. This is basically the first game ever that you can pay to improve, but it's actually not pay to win, everything can be earned in one way or another that can be bought. The only exceptions being a few aesthetic changes.Can't wait to see what they come up with next!			",23,3,0,14,17,1,17

												Kingdom Wars... Something I've been looking for, for a long time. It's quick, fast paced, and full of action. Lacking in a few departments though, as outlined below (for now.. maybe they'll update.)  Remember Warcraft? Starcraft? The strategy it took? yet how short the games were?  Well this is a persistant version which will span the eons~!  This game, putting strategy to 11, and action to 12. Kingdom wars is my personal new addiction.. My girlfriend says I should stop playing it, after putting in over 60 hours in less than 5 days! The up-to-date graphics and the strategy. It's all wonderful.. Here is some things they could add to make the game much better:Add a ""Formation setup"" option for pre-battle, so the troops are already set up the way you want instead of some weird star, or all mashed together.. it makes it difficult to grab the troops you want.  Or just a ""formation setup"" in the choices on the world map for the armies. like where it says ""Transfer"" ""Camp"" ""split army"" etc..Have seperate tabs for troop types when they exceed the maximum ""select all"", or preset saved tabs for number keys, instead of having to reset them every battle. for an example.. (i don't know the max 'select all' option)  Say the max was 10 for example.. and you have 15 of said troop in your army. when you click the tab for knights, 5 would be not selected. Have a seperate tab for those extras.Auto trade routes.  for instance, setup where you can set an army on the world map to go to a certain town, trade, for gold, and return home automatically.Pre-battle map spawn choices. When you join someone in a coop battle, both players troops are all mashed together, and we spend 5-10 minutes just seperating them and setting them up. Or if we wanted to flank in opposite directions. the choice and versitility would be a nice addition.. or atleast setting us up seperately instead of all mashed together.Ability to choose which army is picked for coop battles... countless times I've been asked to coop, but it gave me one of my side armies, and not my main one.  An army moral bonus (small bonus of some kind like +3% bonus to all stats or some crap) while within a certain range of your main hero, if it's on the field.Ability to choose organise pesants in your home town... I don't know how many times I went ""hmmm... how many do i have chopping wood, gold digging, getting food, etc etc.. how many are doing what?"" lol. A list would be nice..Ability to organise troops by your choice, not forced choice. I personally like to organise my troops by level, but it's impossible to do your current way.Randomize the maps.. not areas, just where enemies spawn.Ability to move / rezise the chat box... it's in the way, or if it's not in the way, we can't see it.EDIT: Auto battle / map clear ability. Say you are training multiple units, you send them off to a region, and usually keep combing over the same area over and over.. set a choice to let the units clear on their own.Stretch the world map a few thousand units, and allow players to see other players towns.. this would open up player sieging by choice, not random chance.Archers target walls / doors / buildings sometimes, which can be a pain when you want them to attack the enemy archers on the walls / bridges to protect your rams.Aside from these, I'm a huge fan of the game so far.. cheers. Keep up the good work.			",70,1,0,7,2,0,9

												Hands down one of the best games i've played in the past 5 years.  It's very addictive and captivating.  I like the 24 hour grace period that allows a new player to get used to the game and learn how to play before becoming a target for the rest of the online world.  And i like that everyone is pretty much on even ground.  You can't buy yourself in to the top like a lot of games online nowadays.  If i didnt have to work to support my family, i'm pretty sure i would focus about 80% of my time to this game, and my wife would probably divorce me.  I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone.			",5,1,0,4,7,2,11

												This game, as slow paced as it is, has to have been one of my more favorite RTS games. I've played plenty of Warcraft in my lifetime, but this, even with its low graphics and complicated play style, has been very fun. The co-op missions were also a great way for me and my friend to set goals in the game, since it gets harder with a friend than by yourself. With the races, humans have to be the most balanced between resource gathering and troop building, elves are easier to being able to build but harder to gather food to build an army, and orcs are the zerg of the three races with troop-making being a lot easier. I recommend this game for anyone curious to play a RTSMMO.			",78,8,0,9,6,3,19

												I highly recommend this game. I honestly thought this game (being free) was going to be unimpressive/ boring  etc. None the less I have had nothing but endless fun playing it. I've actually lost track of time so you know something is being done right here. None the less I feel like this game is a more intense/diverse version of Warcraft and it's just amazing. I don't really have many complaints other than some minor bugs that occur here and there.			",48,4,0,9,5,0,0

												The game Kingdom war is a some what a slow pace game. The game is a very easy RTS game and it is fun when you play with your friends. Trying to get troops some what easy. I do the like idea for having battle protection to kept the other online players from attacking you. Also that having other races like man, orc, and elves is great because it reminds me that the game is almost like Lord of Rings. The resoures in the game are great because its like what the medieval time will have. In conclusion the game is a easy RTS game and has 3 cool races and it is a really fun game to play.

												Interesting game... I will explain.First off I highly recommend you do the tutorial and actually take the time to read the texts. There is never to much written but there is no voice acting. But the tutorial gives you a lot of needed knowledge to get the hang of the game. Also you might want to start as humans first, the other races, elfs and orcs. have confusing build structures.Now when it comes to explaining this game I would have to say, it is stronghold kingdoms map combined with a sort of Total war style combat / with age of empires sort of peasantry. Read bellow this for a further explanation.Stronghold Kingdoms - When in the main world map you will see separate borders. Your settlement will be one of several in a sort of county, with several other faction areas in a province type area. A border separates these which makes it easy to know whose who.Total War - When it comes to units in this game, you do have large formations of units instead of single soldier running about. When you construct a unit 20 come out inside of one. So when you enter war or move your units to investigate a camp, you will have the different archers in their group, soldiers, knights, so on.Age of Empires - When it comes to building structures in this game it feels like Age of Empires. Granted you wont find yourself having the peasants build the buildings, but instead you select an available spot on the ground to construct a building. Now the peasants are used to gather materials around the town area, Gold, Wood, Stone, and food are all the average resources you need to have them gathering.--------------------------------------------------------------------Things to know when you start!- You have a 24 hr peace period, meaning other players cannot attack you until after 24 hours.- Your selection of traits and plains where you build will decide a lot of stuff. Such as if wood is plentiful (plains area) , if stone is easily accessible (In mountains) , Also lastly is wooded areas (In Forests).- Doing the quests at the beginning will advance your story line, get you free resources, and decent experience towards the game as well. They are easy and actually very fun to complete.- This is a Stronghold Kingdoms style rts. Which means buildings will start building slower and slower the more you construct. If you don't want to put much time in a breathing game you may want to steer clear.- I have done little castle work, besides in the tutorial. My reflection on it though is like a Total War style castle. You build the wall then garrison the unit squads along the walls. You also build single siege weapons to attack the walls, making it easier to maneuver or attack different sections of the walls.- I did not access the market as of yet, though I clicked on it once to view it. It did seem a bit pay to win, as you purchase crowns like on stronghold kingdoms. Then you use the crowns to get resources , fast building , though it does not seem to allow unit purchase. You can purchase dragons though... not sure how OP they are.--------------------------------------------------------------------My Impressions- Early stages of the game I am enjoying. It feels like Age of Empires as my units charge around to wreck the wicked soldiers and goblins about. Making gold and other resources depends completely on how many peasants you send to that specific resource.- The late game makes me nervous, I really cannot tell if the game has the system like Stronghold Kingdoms that sort of punishes higher lvl players for attacking lower , newer players. But I guess that will be something we see in a few days if I just get rolled by some troll.- So far I do like this game, its worth continuing to play and I hope to see the population on the game grow.

												This is a really entertainment game i literally spend the whole weekend playing it. i one of the ones who bought it before it went free to play and the truth is that i quit it for a while due the lack of content and lag on the co-ops and pvp. then last week i decide to come back and see what was new and i find my self spending 12+ hours playing it :/ .the new contents are amazing, game play still need some work,  specially the co-ops. i have seen my self helping PPL on a sage and then from no where i see they stop attacking or that im the only one doing it,  and when i ask them in the battle chat they say that they are actually already inside or waiting on me. so i guess that's a bug on the co-op that they need to work on. co-op should be helping each other trough strats to get the difficult objectives,  like those long sages.the other thing is that they should consider the fact that not everyone is willing to PvP all the time, maybe its a way for them to force ppl buy shields to have some peace while playing,  but overall its really annoying and i consider that there should be better ways like other F2P game does to get cash like skins, and customization for your armies and stuff instead of forcing ppl buying shields, that will push some players away.another thing that maybe they should work on is the AI of the armies when on battle some time i just don't know wth they doing out there lol. i need to cancel and re assign objectives all the time before they get killed.ill still give this game a 4/5 maybe when they work a little bit more on it ill give them 5 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finnaly, a game that is good and not pay to win. It's about time. The game is amazing and easy to start of. The game gives you daily rewards each day which makes it easy to get more stuff if your stuck. I haven't played for very long but it is very fun. One suggestion though, can you make it so that bandits spawn in your village more frequently. it is very slow for me to get stuff and i like being able to send out the worker people and get gold from it. So this is why i advise this game for people who do not like p2w and, also like Rts games. I run a pretty bad computer and havent had to change the video settings so even if you think your computer is really bad just try it.			",23,2,1,4,16,0,10

												So at first i didn't know what to think about this game. And i have to say i was suprised of how fun and addicting the game was.  The beginning was a little slow but whe you are starting to get quests and your building massive armies it's awesome. For example i had an army of 60/60 all swordsmen, archers, catapults, and battering rams. I was super confident with this army lest to say because they had seen some fights all of the swordsmen were like lvl 10. But i got a little to confident and tried to seige a orc city and man i had no chance. I like the fact that i cant just jump in and seige the hardest city and expect to win. Right now im doing my best to improve my population and expand my power. It is definently a game with plenty of replay value because you can play as three different factions the Humans, Orcs, and Elfs. Right now having a blast with this game look foward to playing everday and completing more quests and becoming the strongest. Totally recommend this game for all strategy game fans!

												Kingdom Wars was just another free game that i would browse past when i was searching for a new game to play, but when i saw that it had recently come out on steam i decided to take a look. As i saw the trailer for the game it had only peaked my interest more, so i downloaded the game.(best decision ever~) Once the game had finished, i booted it up with no problem and was brought to one of many dream games that i had been searching for! It had conquest in a way that other strategy games could only hope for, but the games that could achieve that level were no where near as Kingdom Wars. This game was well thought out and the graphics are perfect for this kind of game(due to huge♥♥♥♥♥armies and monsters filling your screen) runs pretty damn well on a laptop. all in all, im hooked, im in love, and i got to stick a sword in another lord's face.

												Kingdom Wars is a massive mltiplayer Real Time Strategy game without the concept of pay to play, and in my opinion, it's a really neat game.First, the visuals are very nice and quite smooth and give more flavour to the medieval atmosphere of the game.Second, the game is very user-friendly: When you first choose the race and location and all of the details of the city you want to manage, the game makes sure to explain every single option and give the benefits of each side chosen. Also, the game makes sure to help the player as much as it can by having an option to contact directly to the creator, and giving a well-planned tutorial line of quests and a 24 hour protection (that counts ONLY when you're online) which I personally love.Third, It's just fun! You can customize the looks of your town, build a powerful army and siege all of your opponents' citis, striking fear into their eyes! Also, the NPCs are very entertaining and the game in general gives you a great expirience while playing.My final point: The game is great, and it's free so if you have the time and will you should DEFINATLY give it a shot. You won't regreat it. (and if you will, don't worry. The community is very helpful and the developers are open for suggestions at any time, so you can help them to make the game better! :D)			",15,2,0,4,1,0,1

												This Game is one of a kind. You get to build your own medieval town or city whilst doing quests either in pvp, co op, or solo. You get to play as humans, orks or elf's, each have there own unique way of building cities and armies. You can recruit armies of darwfs and summon dragons to you aid.If your into big fights on a large scale with pvp or pve with 1000+ armies on each side battling for gold, crowns,  power and land, this is the game for you. Its a fun medieval game just waiting to be conquered.  It's not all about the war though, you have to use your mind and skill to build your empire. You need to upgrade the armor on your troops for better defense in battle. You can also upgrade your sheep or cows for more milk and wool to trade for any resources you may need.  You can upgrade the tools the workers use and the clothes that they wear so they work faster and it improves the quality of materials they produce.With every great army theres a great leader chose your hero, build your empire and destroy your rivals.

Also you have many options in battle which make it so you can craft your empires own victory or defeat?!

												This game is amazing. You run an entire kingom that you build from the ground up. While there are still bugs that you will encounter, i give this game 5/5 stars for what it is.  If you want to tactically command an army, just as a king would lead his men in to battle back in the mideval ages, this game is for you. It's a game that doesn't go too easy on you either. There is always a new challenge due to the PVP system. The trading system in this game works just as you would think too. Send trade carts, and send troops to protect them from other hostiles, risk your resources, and be rewarded for being smart.			",40,1,0,9,2,0,4

												A game so badly balanced thats its no surprise no one plays anymoreA small newbie army can easily face four dragons 1 hydra and a wizard in the pvp range of 550 points(a  common newbie army) the elites wil be mid level at that and walk all over any other armynever seen  such bad balance or complete  lack of it as is the case hereThe sieges themselves are great fun for a short while, but  with no end  game content at all its hard to see many stopping long other than for pvp( and see above for that)Theres no alliance wars, not even race wars or any content for group play, like  a race related city to build up for race wide buffsIn other bug  newsyour as likely to lose units to bugs as the ai or pvp, even your city isnt safe just in last week at least 4 in chat have said  thier entire city was lost to bugsUnits often instant die for  no apparant reason in  both pvp and  pveThe servers casue massive out of sync issues and that isnt new, I put a lot of time into the game before it went  f2p and we were forced to use steam to play and out of sync was really common even two years agoThe game has some great ideas, the combat system is fine other than terrible balance, but the bugs and flawed pvp make the game unplayable for me most of the timeplay for a week or two for the pve side then move on to a proper gameIf game is still in this state  four years after launch its hard to see it improvng much now			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply Awesome game!This game brings alot  hours of fun!At the first moment i was thinking,maybe not a good choice because not the best graphic...After 10hours was addiction for me!!  :)NO Pay to win!Only decorations,some extras and starterpakets what you not make imba ;)You can choose Humans,Orcs or Elves.Got your own village,where u can build alot buildings and get walls for a better defend and let the village grow up.Units go up to lvl 20 and u can deploy skillpoints,some Units like the Hero go higher than 20!Cool units with different skills inside likeOgers,Minotauren,Dwarfes,Mages,Hydra,different Dragons and much more!!!Many upgrades.You walk with your armys on worldmap.Can look for some npcs fights,quests,pvp,siege and whats really cool you can play co op ,much more fun :)You got a PvP protection and nobody can farm you :)And when you fight,only vs the same strength!!!!Friendly helpfully moderaters there and a nice community!Sometimes small bugs but they work all time on it,and when you lost something they replace it normaly :D The fightsystem can be betterMy archers shoot at wrong targets where nobody(or maybe 1guy in a wall) is at castles.I have to give a lot of commands that they shoot to the right targets.What they can improve on Better fightmechanic.Better Ai.Maybe lil bit better graphic but is really not importent,enough fun!!!More mystical units would be awesome.More changes for the hero like weapons,a horse or other cool animals to ride,and some more skills for him.Make it possible for a ally/friend to help to defend the own castle.Make more cool different places on map to visit and fight.And some special siege where u need a third player will be cool.More cool stuff for the shop And at least at the moment for me 1-2more races to play.Thx for this nice game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game so badly balanced thats its no surprise no one plays anymoreA small newbie army can easily face four dragons 1 hydra and a wizard in the pvp range of 550 points(a  common newbie army) the elites wil be mid level at that and walk all over any other armynever seen  such bad balance or complete  lack of it as is the case hereThe sieges themselves are great fun for a short while, but  with no end  game content at all its hard to see many stopping long other than for pvp( and see above for that)Theres no alliance wars, not even race wars or any content for group play, like  a race related city to build up for race wide buffsIn other bug  newsyour as likely to lose units to bugs as the ai or pvp, even your city isnt safe just in last week at least 4 in chat have said  thier entire city was lost to bugsUnits often instant die for  no apparant reason in  both pvp and  pveThe servers casue massive out of sync issues and that isnt new, I put a lot of time into the game before it went  f2p and we were forced to use steam to play and out of sync was really common even two years agoThe game has some great ideas, the combat system is fine other than terrible balance, but the bugs and flawed pvp make the game unplayable for me most of the timeplay for a week or two for the pve side then move on to a proper gameIf game is still in this state  four years after launch its hard to see it improvng much now			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdom Wars is an intresting game the diffrent options you have to control your empire is pretty cool. Also you have many options in battle which make it so you can craft your empires own victory or defeat?! But honestly i would recommend this game to anyone wanting to give this game a try or wanting to return to this game since the developers are adding many great additon to the game and allways fixing any issues that pop up.

												This game is amazing. You run an entire kingom that you build from the ground up. While there are still bugs that you will encounter, i give this game 5/5 stars for what it is.  If you want to tactically command an army, just as a king would lead his men in to battle back in the mideval ages, this game is for you. It's a game that doesn't go too easy on you either. There is always a new challenge due to the PVP system. The trading system in this game works just as you would think too. Send trade carts, and send troops to protect them from other hostiles, risk your resources, and be rewarded for being smart.			",40,1,0,9,2,0,4

												This game is great, in my opinion. There are pros and cons to it though, so I will list them below.THE PROS:A. NOT pay to winB. Each in-game race (Orcs, Humans, or Elves,) offers a different playstyleC. The Developers of the game seem to have put a decent amount of effort into this game, even though it is free to playD. IT IS FREE! seriously, this is important - even really poorly done games (This one isn't poorly done though) are nice if they are free - all you need is hard drive space to play - Why not at least try it if it is free?E. It offers many hours of play time.F. Updates to the game are released periodically, and they are also completely free.G. Doesn't require a super powerful PC to playOK, there are cons too thoughTHE CONSA. Not enough people play this game - I have only ever seen 200 people online at one time - not exactly MMORTS (Massive, Massive Online Real Time Strategy) more like just ORTSB. It has some bugs - they aren't game-breaking, but they are there.C. It is very difficult to actually gather enough army strength to sucessfully lay siege to an AI town - you need expensive and exotic units like dragons, Minotaurs, etc,  to do it reliably.D. Most of the playerbase seems to be either Old, experienced veteran players, who have all of the best units, all the upgrades, and essentially unlimited resources. They are all but unbeatable unless they fight themselves. Most of the rest of the players are new to the game, and don't know the most basic things about playing yet. In essence, there are very few players who fall in between these two extremes.E. If you choose to play elves, it is more difficult than Orcs and Humans to gather resources.All in all, though, this is a great game, even more so because of the fact that is it free. I would recommend it to anyone that likes Real Time Strategy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												!!!CONGRATS!!! I finnaly foud a game that is like clash of clans, and a great job for the people who made this good game. IT IS REALLY !!!FFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! You can buy crowns or like currency that gives you the elite itemsLet me state this game keeps on improving. They are coming out with a add-on in 2015. With this awesome game there is a second one called kingdom wars 2 and they are both improving both of these games all the time. They care for what you say when your on fourms theres no hackers, which means its more fun to most of us.I will reccomend this game because its great to me and hopefully the 3 expansions will make the game better than it is. Also i was looking at the comments i heard that there is lag, but theres not unless you have a bad connection, bad internet, or your computer needs some upgrades.The only bad part about the game is the crown system, i have heard rumers that there going to remove them for units but not the buildings them selfs. Because if they took it away people would have a army of max ranked dragons, minotaurs, hydras, and dwarf tools, which all makes you (over powered)=>OP <=(over powered) like 3,000 army power, which is way to OP. This is the reason the game is getting more populated over the years.I hope this review was helpful to you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having grown up with the Stronghold series, this is a must try for anyone following in similar footsteps.There are several features that I love from Kingdom Wars that gives it that little boost:Firstly Resources are gathered when you are both on and offline which help greatly, especially when you are trying to raise funds to buy crowns.Decent F2P Model. While there are always the Cape-Crusaders who will nitpick at every F2P and say how P2W it is, even though they aren’t, KWs is a Play to Win as opposed to Pay to Win. While there are of course boosts and the ‘premium’ currency, all of this is earned in game and is rather pay for convenience.And one of the best things I have seen on here is the fantastic moderator team they have in game. There never seems to be a question too trivial for them and they are willing to go to the ends of the earth to help you or give you direct link with someone who can.			",229,31,2,43,32,1,35

												It is a great game that need to be a little bit polished, I all ways liked and wanted a medieval game like those you play on internet but no one catch me like this one, since I started to play I didn't stop hahhah. There is the traditional bugs and issues of all new games on the market but doesn't is enough to make you stop playing this one, the battles requires a lot of attention and tactics and is even better when you are in battle listening The Lord of the Rings soundtrack, the only thing that makes me angry is the lag but is not the servers errors, is my fault hahaha I don't have a good connection, but how i said isnt enough to make me stop.I would like so much if it have the run button like you chose a unit and press ""R"" instead you have to click twice to make units run and the forbidden trees because I hate to see those fallen trees near my town XDOk thats my opinion about this game, I hope you all enjoy like I enjoyed this game o/btw I'm Brazilian and not a huehue br ok?(my nick in game is JesusAndrey)			",13,0,0,3,1,0,4

												You know what would be ♥♥♥♥ing great, if the game actually launched. Or if the e-mail I sent about the issue, got responded to. Or if my account wasn't deleted, or EVEN if they just brought it back again. That'd be great. Unfortunately, and obviously, none of the above have come to fruition. I really loved this game when it got 're-'released. I'd love to be able to play it again now. I'd love the jump on and see what my kingdom has become and rebolster it to what it was. But I can't even get past about 10-15% loading time in the start-up. This isn't just game breaking, there may as well be no game at all if the loading screen is the only thing I see.

												I was reluctant to play the game because of the bad reviews, but I had to try it myself, when I first started I admit I was confused. Although when I got into the game, I thought it was a really really great game! Its a mix of building your castle in Stronghold to fighting battles as you see in Total war! The PVP is also fun, I have lost most of my battles, but I always love to compete against other people. There are some glitches, but they aren't terrible people who have made reviews on the game that are negative haven't had a chance to explore much of the game! I recommend 9/10!			",52,2,0,8,7,1,11

												I would like to start off by saying that I am a big RTS\RPG fan.  I am also a big fan of MMO games.  I have played this game with an open mind, as I suggest anyone else who tries this game, do without having any pre-conceived ideas or expectations.  The game mechanics are very user-friendly and easy to become accostumed to.  I have read many comments regarding the graphics.  Being an older gamer (over 40) I found myself getting a little nostalgic, which I really liked.  The game is excellent.  The concept is great.  The experience is one of the best I have had.  The most appealing aspect of this game, in my opinion, is that it is Free-To-Play.  Keep in mind that it is a RTS game and it will take time to do all the great stuff there is to do in this game.  So without further ado, good luck building your Kingdom and forging your Empire!			",9,1,0,4,3,0,10

												Not a free to play - This is not a free to play game, and it is easy to see that it is not. Most games that are MMO city builders like this rely heavily on users buying boosters. This games does not. First of all, there are only three boosters in the game, and you can not use more than 1 of them per in-game account/city. The boosters that are there give you resources that are helpful to a beginner, but if you build your city up a bit, they can easily be aquired.PvP - When I first started, I was afraid of going into the PvP part of the game. I was afraid that people who have already made giant cities and huge armies could walk in and take all of my things; this is definitely not the case. They have balanced the game enough so that you can only fight people within 10% of your army strength. 10% is so little, that it makes you rely only on good tactics. It makes EVERY siege/co-op/defence really fun and actually a really good match. Also, most of the online playing is co-op, which is honestly one of the most fun parts of the game. You can raid AI cities or do quests with your friends, and it makes the gameplay really fun, without getting completely screwed over. Also, if you REALLY do not like PvP, you can buy the single player campaign for only $1.99, which is honestly a good deal for how fun this game is.Building your city - It is hard to build your city at the start, since resources are scarce. This is the point where the co-op takes place and is a big help. You can do quests with your friends and fight armies, and take all of the resources off of their cold dead bodies. This part beats every other city builder into dust. You can actually command your armies, instead of it being auto resolved for you. The game features 3 different races: humans, elves, and orcs. Each race is very balanced, and it would be a very hard decision on if you were to ask which race was the best. This lets you face other online players (or play WITH them) without worrying that their units are SOO much better than yours.Raiding cities - Later on, once you have a big and tough army, you can start raiding AI cities. There are 30 (from my knowledge) cities that you can siege and either loot or make your vassel. Looting can be helpful, and gives you a lot of resources; while vassels give you resources over time.Do not be turned away because it is an online city builder. Most of this game is co-op, instead of facing other players. You can join a clan and help each other out by sending each other resources. My in-game name is Enki, for anyone who has any more questions or wants to raid some AI with me! :)			",67,1,1,10,6,0,13

												New to this game being playing for about 3 days now. New to RTS style of game. This is my very first RTS. At first when i found out about this game and looked at the steam page i thought ""Hmmm this looks really good for an RTS"" I neven seen my self say that for this genre. So i bought the game and stared playing...minutes after...and OMG i made the....BEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! When i stared playing i was more immersed in the game. I never thought of my self say that ""I love the RTS genge and it's because of this game! 1.000.000.000/10 Keep up the good work and free expansions. And thank you for this amazing work of art!

												Kingdom Wars is a great game if you like city building and rts games. I have spent over 100 hours playing and love it.  The game does have bugs and crashes once in a while though.  You can use ingame money to buy pvp protection if you do not like pvp.  You may notice that the game has a cash shop and think that the things the packages gives are overpowered like 100k gold and 5 minotaurs and so on.  That amount of gold is easy to get after a day of playing and minotaurs are only good if you know how to use them.  The game is not pay to win in any way since the amount of bundles you can purchase is limited and everything you get from the bundles can be killed or looted.  I have personally destroyed people with bundle troops with some of the weakest troops in the game because they did not know how to use them.Overall a great game that I recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Everything I want, Nothing I don't  Kingdom Wars is a melting pot of different styles of games and game elements/mechanics. I personally view it as a Stronghold Crusaders + a dash of Total War + World of Warcraft (the RTS, not the MMO) + A strong influence of the game elements/mechanics of those web browser based games where you build a base and army and attack other people, get attacked etc. etc. I'm sure someone will correct me on the abreviation for that kind of game but I cant remember right now. Now here are some  VERY IMPORTANT  distinctions from the rest of those games that I and many people have been asking and looking for but have never found with other games similar to this one. The developers built into the game features that actually prevent a P2W environment!  For example there is absolutely no 'Low Energy! Come back tomorrow... OR pay us $5-$10-$20-$50(best BS deal!) to keep playing!' because  there is no energy.  You cannot be attacked or attack players of higher or lower level (premium units? stronger opponents!) and  you cannot be attacked while offline!   Finally, thank you!  Waiting for resources to gather and/or something to finish building and feel like there's nothing more to do in town? Make an army and go fight NPC/AI on the world map for gold and then use your spoils of war to buy those resources or even new units! Oh did i mention this is a great way to level up your units at the same time? Or just log off and go live your life and come back to find the resources collected while you were offline! Yes there is 'premium' currency  but  it is  reasonably and realisticly  obtainable in-game for your time + effort for free! Quest's and NPC/AI battle's being the best way I've found persoanlly. An actually entertaining story line. A suprisingly indepth and well made system for selecting your race, skills, and city location(s).  Single player  modes including campaign, seige, and seige defence.  You do have to pay $2 to unlock each of these modes however.  Personally this is not an issue for me as I don't plan on using single player mode, however it could be very useful to try out different seige strategies and really $2-$6 for this game is a ridiculously good deal considering some of the alpha games on here that cost $15 in the  hope  that they turn out good. Predetermined building locations make your city(s) astheticly pleasing, strategically challenging and easy to build! None of that layers and layers of wall's shinanigans like every one of those crappy web-based Base Building RTSMMO's Wow those first five elements are  exactly what people have been asking for in games similar to this for years.  That is a  huge  reason I like this game. Now I can feel satisfied that I finally found a good game out there where the developers/owner(s)/publisher actually give a **** about what me, the player, wants in a game rather than how much money is on the paycheck. From the bottom of my heart,  thank you  and I hope you cotinue building the game like this while keeping the same ideals! You know what's even better? If you actually do spend money on the game, lets say you buy a dragon for your army,  they protect your investment.  While your normal units disappear forever when they die, your premium units, like the dragon you bought, only get knocked out and lose a few levels. Oh and you can't make an army of just dragons because that would be P2W plus they can still be countered and defeated by a prepared player, there's a dragon slayer i got for  free  after all. Right off the bat they are giving me a unit that counters one of the stronger units in the game! To make it even more balanced there's a unit cap, each unit takes up a certain amount of space, so you have to choose what you bring to battle wisely, a small but individually strong group of heavy hitters? Perhaps a massive amount of inexpensive foot soldiers with archers? It's all about the strategy, not who had the larger wallet. Also you wanna know something awesome the premium days you can buy in this game? You choose which days you want to use them for. How many games can you think of that actually do that for their players? Personally i don't know a single one, because money. Now for the other side of the coin, this game has flaws as all games natuarlly do. Animations are decent, but not great. Yes things still take time to build but it's not ridiculous amounts (i.e. 5-7 days). You have to pay for extra cities (gotta make money somehow so this is perfectly reasonable and fine with me). The controls can't be customized and are a bit clunky, biggest issue for me personally is the right mouse button. It controls your units  but  it also moves the camera if you have a single unit selected, very annoying esspecially when your trying to moe just your hero. plus there's is a very noticeable delay between the click and the effect (at least for me on my laptop). Then sometimes nothing happens at all. Trying to organize and manage your units is awkward and needs to be streamed lined. Especially when you have to do it quickly (Very Frustrating). Not to mention you have to indiviually select units to activate their abilites/magic/skills/powers which is very hard when they are in combat. Theres also some minor graphical errors, especially when the weather changes and in a couple of cut scene's where the character(s) slowly turns invisible and OHMYGODTHEIREYESANDMOUTH! Personally I find that last type of glitch hilarious as it's actually pretty common in a lot of games. Upgrades and improvements of any and all kind require 'premium' currency, walls for example require an especially large ammount and you have 4 different one's to build, but like i said about premium currency, it is obtainable in-game for a reasonable amout of time and effort so a somewhat moot point. Still I love this game and plan on continuing to play it for quite some time at a casual level, kill some time here and there, build this and that, do a quest here and there. This is a game that easily works with how you play games, hard-core, casual, it dosen't matter because it caters to any type of play style. I have only been playing for 9.3 hrs at the time of this writing but i can already feel that within 30-45 days, I will have an impressive city and army to boot and will be knocking down a few peoples walls! I absolutely, highly recommend this game for people looking for a RTSMMO with RPG elements that lets you play at your own pace, your own schedule, your own style, your own budget and actually rewards you if you dont want to play all-day-everyday and throw money at it. Even if you do throw money at it it still goes  far beyond  what any other game I have played or known will do for you for your investment. See you on the battle field and if you attack me, you shall feel the power and dismay of my elven arrows and Magical superiority!This review helpful in anyway? Let me know below by leaving a comment and/or give a thumbs up and/or down.			",24,3,0,5,12,1,10

												This is an online game with the opportunity to build a castle with several armies and destroying your enemies or being destroyed.Resources in game are food, wood, stone, gold and crowns. Crowns you only get with quests or sieging AI cities or other players cities. Crowns are needed for wizards, dragons and also for building your castle and buildings. You also need crowns to upgrade buildings.You can do quests on strongholds co-op and you can do siege on a AI city in co-op. You can also attack a player in the field and find out who is better. Loosing is cruel as winner can choose units from your left over army.Building your own castle is great. Size of the castles in this game is the way it should be. This is your home and you want to protect it at all cost. Building all kinds of buildings in castle or outside it like archery and upgrading it is like your normal  command and conquer style as your armies get stronger with levelling up. Next to that you can build extra armies with wizards, dragons, humans, elves or orcs. You can choose a few types of wizards and dragons to make a good mix with elves, humans and orcs. This with limitations to dragons and wizards to an army. Sieging an other player is a tactical mind game you want to win. Defending your castle against another player is not for the faint-hearted. Next to that you have several computer AI cities on the world map. These are rated from easy to epic. The AI is not easy to beat you need all your skills and a well balanced army to defeat it. One of the things I found a bit stopping the fun is that you need to buy an alliance for 500 crowns. This to create an alliance. It should be free as it would help new players to help each other quicker now you have to hope you get let in when alliance recruiters are online if not no chance.Another thing I think is wasting to much time is the skill points. This should be automatic but maybe reason is that manual doing it gives more variety. Anyway it is a time consuming thing when you are in the middle of a battle when units level up. If something goes wrong with an army or something else you can send them an email or contact moderators in the chat channel and they will give you your lost army or other things back. This also helps them to work further on these bugs. Yes there are still some there. More information will make it easier for them to solve it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												from a small town to a massive city, from a few units of archers to a large army completed with dragons and powerful wizards. kingdom wars has never bored me! there 3 different races. each with its own characteristics. Elves, humans and orcs. this game is one of my top favorites and will stay that way. but sadly my computer is too old to play this game (2007). but it will run fine on most computers. and the best thing about this game is its not pay to win and its free to play. so give it a try.

												Extremely horrible game. I thought it would be like Age of Empires II but it's even worse than Age of Empires I.

This is a city-builder, not an MMORTS.PROS1. UnsureCONS1. PvP Protection?You can build it later in the game to buy PvP Protection. You can build a building to buy PvP Protection.2.

												I have played this game for a few hours now.  It does need some work, its sluggish in areas, and it can be unforgiving.  The game has tons of potential!  I have enjoyed the time I have played.  If I knew that the game plays the way it does then I would have got it when it was Dawn of Fantasy and you had to pay for it.  Thats how much I like it right now.  If this opinion changes I will update.Ok.  I still really like this game.  I am noticing some bugs.  I have an issue when I try to start a quest on the world map it will not load correctly and I have to restart the game.  Also there seems to be some sorta disconnect between what happens on the quests and what my army is like when I get back to the world map.This game has awesome potential.  The devs. are working to make it more polished.  After a few fixes and maybe a graphical overhaul (not horrible but could really be better) this could be one of the best fantasy empire building games I have played.			",66,36,0,45,58,0,60

												The damn game is riddled with bugs....but it is one of the funnest games I have ever played. Be prepared to lose armies to crashes and weird void bugs or a common one is where the walls will be going but you dont have them. If you try to build there you lose all the resource and the building isn't built.There is no pay to win and most of the stuff being sold is cosmetic or one time buy for resource per city (Can only have one city unless you pay for more) It is rediculously fun and it would be a game I would pay subscription for if they fixed the bugs and tweaked a few things.All in all it is an awesome game and well worth your time.

												Feels a lil glued up in the unit tasking, but other than that looks good in my mind and instantly had a lil bit of a Black and White feel to it. I like that units are in platoons, but a more Total war approach with unit orders in battle would be nice. I give it a personal 8/10Edit 1:So now that Ive gotten some more time in the game, I must say Ive been gladly surprised with Kingdom Wars. However, as with any game, there are problems, and Ill try my best to be the most helpful I can to new players and to the devs in ideas I have. 1. units orders: The manner in which units are ordered around the battlefield is good to a point, but seriously sucks in combat. Basically, if you arn't used to normal RTS games and using those command groups, then be prepared to be annoyed. The forming of solid lines of defense/attack are simple to the point of insanity. You either just run everything up at once, save for cavalry and archers, and hope you win or you take too long to form proper lines and risk taking huge damaged from enemy archer or crossbowmen in the process. The way to fix this in my mind would be to rip the current system and add in a more Total war type of battle system, making for a more fluid experience (Or just add in the ability to lock different formations to a hotkey, Idk)2. The economy: This games economy surprised me for the better in some areas, but I found lack luster in others. The dominate reliance on wood is good, but the ability to build houses out of stone instead of wood would make for the bigger projects and upgrades coming faster, and make the city look better if they had the textures to match. The crown system is amazing, being a resource that you gain from gold instead of a bought currency for real money, and making it essential to manage your crown total very carefully so not to leave you without that one vital upgrade. The food resource in this game also makes for fun play in that there are not just farms but also animals to use to produce and it just adds a much greater sense of life to your city.3. The combat: The full on combat of this game is the biggest complaint I have. It seems that the battles try to simulate tactics, but in the end it seems all that is needed is to have a direct line to enemy units and just be a Russian as possible (Quantity wins) I would recommend changing it up to make it so certain units like the crossbowmen would do so much damage that it basicallly one hits units. Another this is the special units. Through the quests I recieved a Dragonslayer, which in my mind, would be fairly good agaisnt Dragons. But when I sent him agianst the Dragon that spawned as part of the quest, well, lets just say the rest of my army was quickly heading that way. I believe that some of the special units should be very, very good against what they are meant to go against.This is my current review, as I discover more of the game and figure it out for myself, Ill let every one know what I think, still a 8/10.A video review will be uploaded within the next day or two, will post link with this written one.

The race of men is good as it brings a traditianol style to warfare. Orcs are savage as you would expect and can build many small towns the combat is good and requires planning and reckless thinking can get your army killed. I like the daily rewards as they help me save up for that wall upgrade or unit one. I have played this game for 42 hours and are still learning and need a boost of crowns to help me and are stuck on the elven quest of defending the princess.			",50,2,0,8,8,0,16

												The damn game is riddled with bugs....but it is one of the funnest games I have ever played. Be prepared to lose armies to crashes and weird void bugs or a common one is where the walls will be going but you dont have them. If you try to build there you lose all the resource and the building isn't built.There is no pay to win and most of the stuff being sold is cosmetic or one time buy for resource per city (Can only have one city unless you pay for more) It is rediculously fun and it would be a game I would pay subscription for if they fixed the bugs and tweaked a few things.All in all it is an awesome game and well worth your time.

												Game is fully out but still feels like a beta, here are some exemples of what i mean.- it is slow.- units dont attack when they should be.- doen't have the pay-to-win aspect (as they claimed), but man does it feel like its there. Real money to buy in-game currency to upgrade, speed up, and get resources faster. Also theres a flashing icon that annoyed the hell out of me for me to join ""membership"" which is based on real $$$.- Glitches and breaks half the time.To simplify, its free but don't wast your time with this game because it seems broken and/or badly done.

												The best I can say about it: a pretty gameOtherwise Other games beat it from almost every point of view (possibly less from the claimed unique siege point of view)EXTREMELY aggressive on pushing the player on spending cash.

Unless you are prepared to spend a constant amount of cash be prepared to not be able to upgrade your units or buildings, nor will you be able to get tat group of units which can actually put up a fight and you will be stuck with VERY basic units.

												This game so full of bugs that i'm surprised bugs aren't flying out of my computer smacking me in the face. There nothing that isn't bugged in this game it has bugged quest that get so bad that it just breaks your whole town forcing you to delete it, and start a new. Like the first quet for the orc race which wants you to lore a orger into a spike trap after completeing it the spike trap suppose to disppaer, but it doesn't an everytime one of your workers or warriors walks over it it completely kills them everytime, and the orger respawn in your town killing you workers, and warriors everytime you reload your town. Then there pathfind bugs siege units get stuck on walls units get stuck climbing siege ladder or just stop moving for the reset of an instance if they some how survie a spike trap. Then Fire really annoying your troops will run into, and try to attack it for some reason, and even when it gone your unit still take damage when there in the area that was on fire. There some werid gather bug that just start in the most recent patch it took me 3 hours to collect 2 pieaces of wood when i had 10 workers try to cut wood. It should be 3-15 wood every sec depend on research or amount of workers. There also a bug with the ingame currency were you'll just randomly lose all of it for no reason so don't pay really cash on crowns cause you will lose them for no reason. Also you can gain crowns from PVP/PVE, but that also bugged 60% of the time your not reward with them after a match. An this is only about 1/5 of the bugs in the game there many more like treants bugged movement speed sometime they have a movement speed of 9999 they'll be so fast they just teleport across the battle field other time they have a movement speed of 2 they move so slow it takes them 3 hours to get across a map. There also a bug with the single player were it will say your cheating, and are unable to play the single player. The best bug so far is this extremely annoying bug that will just roll back your whole town to what it was when you started it when you get attack by another player, and the devs say this is a very rare which is Bull-**** cause it happen to about 15 people everyday which compared to the fact that 1000-1500 people login every day it about 1% of the population. So after 20 days 20% of the population town has been completely rolled back to the begining.  An the Devs are useless they don't fix bugs they take forever to post on the forums, hell there was one time were the devs didn't post anything on there website for 6 months striaght. People just started saying the game shutting down on there forums, and they didn't reply to any of thos post what they did do was delete thos post when they started posting on there site again. An for some reason the Devs are ban happy as it stands banning people for no reason at all. So overall don't waste your money on this game if you want to play it to see how buggy it is your self then just wait for it to go F2P/P2W.			",41,6,0,12,7,0,10

												This game is action pact 3D stragey game. i Recommend all people think thier good at stragey game to play this/ It is like Rome II and Shogun war when you battle. At frist it may seem boring but if you keep playing you will end up liking it. There 3 race elves, orc and human. You cant really choose a banne ryou like unless yo upay $1 which suck, but rest part is pretty good. This game also make yo uthink how to seige a castle and make you find a opening thourhg a enemy castle. Also you cant see player on the map unless you go find them thourgh the search thing and you can fight them there, for this part is the reason i dont like it. I recommend the game change that.At the end it a fun pvp game. i Hope you all enjoy it. It will take some time to become powerful in the game good luck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. Within two days I have managed to clock in about 9 hours. I like how you are able to build your city while, doing trade and going to war. I am still in Protection mode which lasts for a day. It helps teach you as you go if you don't want to do the training. You don't have to worry about leveling up. When you stop playing your time stops aswel, instead of you leaving and coming back two days later to your town totally destoryed. The graphics aren't bad at all and you even get to pick your race and which area you wish to start in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest here the game has quite a lot of problems, mostly with the units pathfinding and overall grind to get enough resources or crowns to build important buildings or even stone walls which kinda killed it for me a little but the combat can be very interesting. When it comes to the combat it can be a real challange at first, not so much because of the pathfinding for me though, but because the AI's are able to move more units then you can to specific spots. But thats the fun about it, you can easily out take out the AI if you do things right but sometimes you can easily screw up and lose a bunch of units, which to me is fine again, forcing the player to think about how to go about it without losing every soldier they gained. Not to mention that the game dev's are constintly at work to fix many of the problems that are poping up, they are very aware of the situation that the game is in but are having trouble fixing them due to a recent failure going to NW2 which caused a few problems as mentioned in the recent updates section. Many people say that it isent working but to be honest once more I have a feeling that they just are trying to be trolls cause I have one of thee 2nd worst gaming laptops in my house and it runs very smoothly after I adjust the graphics. Lastly overall the graphics bring me back to my childhood days of gaming, like I said above this resembles Battle for Middle Earth quite alot in the way of graphics but I am by far fine with that, I never was a stickler when it came to things like that, just so long as the models arent sticks flouting around. Overall to me this has so far been a great experience and might even put a bit of money into it just to possibly get the starter pack or something mostly to support the dev's and because I feel like throwing money in their faces, lol. I may add more to this review wether bad or good over the coarse of the next few months and I am planing to deffinitly play this over thanksgiving, so things may change but my opinion of the game will never change, epecially since this is a newly made game, were anything could happen....and yes 3-4 years old is still considered new to me considering ages for other games.

												To be clear, the game is free; payment only gives you access to two one-use-only-ever chests of resources which you don't need one bit. There are also a couple DLCs, but if you look at development/patch notes you realise the vanilla game is rich and you won't want to pay for the stupid DLCs even into late game (e.g. there's a SP-only dlc - for the incompetent only). Please read on.3 races to choose from. Build your city, your army, your garrison, whatever labour forces you may want. Two very important factors that I find separate this game from those you may think this is similar to (involving MMO strategy games with building a settlement):1) You can't be attacked when offline. If you're not logged in and playing, you can't be attacked - meaning you don't need to worry or dedicate ANY time to this game. (You also have a cancellable 24hr-game-time-only battle protection for noobs, after which you'll have a great base. Additionally, battles are always between similar-strength forces).2) Your buildings can't be destroyed beyond 1% health. No conflict you will ever have will reset your city. Your buildings will be repaired over time and you'll just lose a token amount of resources, from what I understand you'll even get a few crowns (useful for upgrades or renaming units etc).I recommend, if you have any interest in a forgiving MMO RTS game with visual battles and really quite rich content, you should download and try a couple of the races. Read the descriptions to see what you'd be interested in and have a go. Just be wise on how you spend your crowns in the beginning as they're earned through quests (story line), battles, daily-gift of 1 crown if you login and trading in gold. P.S. you will want to make gold one of your primary mining operations, because if you shop around at some NPC towns/cities, you can usually buy more than 100 of any resource with 100 gold.I first tried the orcs (about 8 hrs), which I liked but I didn't do very well with.. Then I went to try the elves (now 14 hrs) and I love them. I don't get to design my city layout because we build in trees... but it's fun enough. Check out some of my woodelf screenshots.

												I find the game quite enjoyable. You manage a small village which, slowly, grows to metropolis. You have to decide on whats best for your village, paying off bandits, or deciding where to build the new blacksmith. The town is tailored to your design, be ye human, filthy orc, or hippy elf. The games graphics are pretty good considering the amount of individual units  each moving. You can see it at its best in the environmental changes, the winter was nice thing to in the game, although not for my peasants who were unable to plow the fields. Although the game does have its fair share of bugs mostly in the ai. The most notable were my peasants choosing to drop resources at my keep instead of a cart which was right next to them, and a dragon swarmed by footmen trying to attack my dragon slayer in the back stuck and not attempting to attack anything else. My least favorite thing about the game is the fact that you have pay money in order to have additional towns with a different race. It saddens me that i can't even try out another race without paying 5 $ or deleting my first town, im fine that you can buy boosters (Its not pay to win, you are matched against players with equal army strength) but atleast let me try the other races.Overall a fun free game 8.5/10			",138,8,0,36,14,1,33

												kingdom wars has changed so much from when it started, but it was a good change . Though there are minor issues that i have with the game such as you have to pay so many crowns for special units and storage for your hometown is limited to the number of slots(human),trees(elves) and space(orcs)you have available to you. the up side however is that u have to use your brain when playing its not about biulding a giant army and destroying everything in site its about the future of the race you belong and every choice you make effects the outcome of wether you are going to win or lose the war against the other races.Another upside to the game is that you can help other players out i have friends who play this game that always get stuck on missions but because we always play online together we can help each other out when things get hard . Overall kingdom wars is brilliant game for people who like challenge but it easy enough that everybody can enjoy it.			",103,7,0,14,23,0,29

												The game is simply nice:)Living in a fantasy world ,you can see your village become a walled city and grow up your economy.The game have some little problem but i know that the team is working hard for the solution.Very nice the music in the background, maybe to expand with other musics to add in a future pack!Other possible development could be the add of sound of the marching troops,maybe advanced by the sound of the horn or drum.An other suggestion could be the possibility to choose the helmet for their Hero and change the helmet of the halberdiers, maybe with the "" Bacinetto"" to be more realistic.The game is a good basis for developing one of the best games of the category.A nice thing is that you can grow up on the game without spending real money, you have only to play and to be experienced.Nice the help of the friends in battle and for have more resources.Thank You very much REVERIE			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played alot of stratigy games over the years and the one thing alot of them seem to lack is story. Kingdom Wars actually gives you a bit of background on what's going on in the world. A reason to go out and conquer.  Being the huge nerd that I am, I am part of a renaissance group who studies and reenacts historical battles in real life. I like the diversity of figthers and fighting styles. Halbreders are good against horses, sword men with shields are good against defending arrows and so on. This gives battle a bit more realism for me.  On top of that there is customization to your heros and armies and it's not rediculously expensive to do so. This is one of the few free to play games I acutally put money into customization because I know I will play it for awhile. There is a slight lack of options in the customization department but it is a young game still and I am sure that will grow. All in all I think the game is pretty great so far.

												I started playing this game last night and though I have only just begun it seems like I will enjoy it quite a bit. I like the strategic aspects of the game as well as the ease at which it can be picked up. There does not seem to be a pay wall as much of the items listed in the shop are things that do not seem overly difficult to attain in the game itself. The trade system could maybe use some work. I have tried doing the quest to trade cows and I cannot seem to get it to finish. Maybe i am doing something wrong but I feel it could be something to work on either way. That however would really be my only complaint so far. The game is fun and I love that I can build a castle for myself. I have not tried playing with a friend yet but I will have to do that very soon. I plan on telling some of my friends to join because it seems like it will be really fun to play this with them. Overall I rate this game as an 8/10 so far. A good fun strategy game that is not overly difficult to get a grasp on the concepts. Definitely a solid game.			",78,19,2,25,18,0,27

												Somehow the Game Stronghold Online could have been. The troops are well balanced, allthough you need to get to know them to use them right. The three races are all provided with weakness and strength so the choice of race is rather a choice of taste. Bugs are not too seldom but support reacts relatively quick. only real downside for me is that castle building is not individual but for the sake of game balancing this is a necessity. If you like real time Strategy games then i recomend to at least give it a shot.			",69,4,0,10,5,1,19

												I rarely write reviews but as a game tester for alpha, beta, and online mmos, i do gotta say this has been a very pleasent supprise. This is one of the few games that don't build hype to let players down. Theres not much pay to win, theres a great ballance with the units of the game, and all in all its a strong well crafted idea which I can very much put in 50 - 80 hours into this game. I do gotta say alot of the times rts are more like a gamble then strategy and this game is more of a gamble situation. Basically during battle the enemies have a range of aggro and thats really about it. I don't mind that as any war is a gamble of strength, luck, and some strategy and manuvering involved and this does put this very well. There is one otherthing that might be a bug is that the selection rectangle stays on the screen sometimes when you select a unit. Not a game breaker but it is a glitch they should look into. So far they have troop training as you enter cities, looting corpses with civs, and buying mercs and selling loot you get from enemies. The map is quite big and you can coop or even vs enemy players in segies and other pvp battles. I haven't got to test that part out yet, but you basically get your own map to your self to train your army anyway. Mount and blade strategy meet rts for the first time! It is defeently one of the more interesting games that i've seen and as a avid gamer, I am quite picky about what I play. I hope this helps!			",149,12,8,32,41,0,18

												This is a great game, it has many casual gameplay elements taken from Rome total war, and some building elements from The Settlers (7?). Controlling your army, and leveling them up on the over world is great fun, building your city and aquiring upgrades also plays out well. The timers on building buildings don't hit as hard as I initially thought they would, with twenty minute build timers on some of the larger buildings passing by quickly as I focus on other portions of the gameI have to say, that by far, BY FAR, i enjoyed the first part of the game the most, the psuedo tutorial. Running around with my hero and a few units, clearing my lands from bandits, coming back to find a messenger had arrived, or a lord wanted me to do something was thrilling and immersive.The game looks fantastic for how many units are on the screen at once, and every battle I find myself Roleplaying as my hero, and ordering my units to take the field and feeling the loss of every man in all of my squads.  The only thing I really dislike are the crown earning systems, I find the process too slow, where PvP may net you the most crowns the fastest, that can come at the total loss of your army (save for maybe one or two units if you are lucky), which means it's back to the drawing board to re level up your units. (You can also buy your units levels at nearby towns with in game gold)You could also take your leveled army, and farm the overworld maps for crowns, but after the third run through of a map, I find myself getting tired of the same placement of units, the same patrol paths, the same spawn point. Vary up the maps a bit more, is all I ask, make the single player overworld a bit more varied for map selection, instead of relying on the same one or two exactly the same maps per section.It's a great free to play game if you are into city builders with PvP elements. Enjoy it while it lasts.			",139,8,2,26,13,1,14

												The game is great. I love basically every single aspect of it so far. The races are well different to make them unique (unlike just changing the units a little bit, each race has different mechanics, which is a must for any great RTS). The Microtransaction shop seems to sell some pretty nice customization for your town, + I love the way the whole game works by having a main town to work around, instead of building a settlement in one match than a new one in a later match. The map seems to be well done and different from area to area (seems like there are some unpopulated areas that may be used for future races, but I can't tell). The graphcis are nice. Many people complain about them, but I absolutely love em'. They look like what a nice RTS should look like. This is a game I surely look forward to playing further and maybe even spending some money on microtransactions. Keep up the good work!			",18,2,0,2,0,0,1

												Hi guys, Hellbound Commander here.  I think i've possibly found the best medieval strategy game that is Free to play, maybe even in general.  I was searching in the f2p tab on team and i came across this game.  I got interested and I downloaded it.  It was worth it.  Kingdom Wars is the best game i've played in a long time!  The level of depth to the game is almost unparalleled in anything I have seen.  There are so many features that I really can't fit into this review, so I want to ask you guys to download this game and start playing it so that you csn get a feel of what i mean.  The graphics are amazing, the battles and wars going on all around you add so much content to your experience that there is really no way to get bored of it.  You have the campaigns and the quests and everything that are sitting right there to become available to you as you build up your castle and venture out into the world of Mythador.  There are so many features, one of which is what the devs cleverly labeled the ""Home Warfare"" law which was passed by King Erian IV (I play as a human lord).  It offers you the chance to attack your neighbors and also other players to gain more resources, get some battle experience under your belt, or just simply entertain yourself.  To protect new players however, as on many other games your castle/town is not attackable by other players until you've spent 24 hours of real time on the game.  I've still got almost 18 hours left on mine.  It closely resembles the Stronghold crusader series because of its real-time combat and detail to the units, structures and features.  As you progress in the game you eventually become more attuned to your surroundings.  It is important to start with a strong workforce and a small army, as well as a desire to do the quests you are assigned.   That usually opens up doors to more quests, campaigns, and other features of the game.  There is a special currency in the game, called Crowns, which are used to buy some elite units, make castle siege defenses, upgrade buildings, etc.  You can buy these crowns with the in-game money called Coins, which are obtainable through Gold Mines, battles and quests.  You can also get coins by bringing a group or two of peasants along with you and tasking them for 'Corpse Looting'.  This enables them to loot corpses, whether they be your's or your enemy's, for materials and Coins.  Other ways to get Crowns are to do quests and win battles, for each you receive a specified number of crowns.  Crowns are essential in your ability to progress through the game as a successful player.This game, unlike most 'F2P' games out there is not a pay-to-win game.  The success of players isn't determined by how large their wallet is, but rather how much patience and perseverance they have.  If you Persevere you can eventually rise to the top and become one of the strongest players throughout Mythador.  I bid you all farewell future lords and ladies, and I wish you good fortune should you choose to join me and many others on Kingdom Wars.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi.   Ok, I'm a newb, just a few hours played.   Look at it this way, I have over 50 games in steam, haven't played more than a day in most of them, this one, I'm on my 3rd day.  I like the art.  I like having quests mainly because I'm retired and old and don't want to think too much.  I seem to have a little trouble with losing workers somewhere and haven't figured how to find them yet.  I'd like more tooltips with more info, I'd like to pause without logging out if no one's attacking me.... just because going pee (I'm old, it takes a while and often) and you come back and whatever you killed quest-wise has resurrected (it took me a while to figure out you gotta finish any quests you start before logging out, I was thinking I was having a senior moment and never really did what I thought I did -- which is scary)  I do feel like I need LOTS more direction and explaination.  Any way to move that chat box?  I like to listen in but it's in the way.The music is nice but I find myself nodding off.  This little box is filling up.  Oh, soon I'll be vulnerable... does a guy joining this late have a chance of survival if attacked?  lbattros@hotmail.com.			",33,2,1,6,7,0,16

												Kingdom Wars is a very unique and addictive MMORTS. You attack, defend, and manage a kindom with the option of three playable races each differning in their own unique ways. You start off with a simple kingdom, but in time it can easily grow and prosper into a epic empire. It is not a pay to win type of game either. With both time and skill you can easily succed in this game. I definatly recommend to strategic players.			",7,0,0,1,1,0,0

It brings a wonderful way you can build your forces and strageties to defeat enemys at the same time adding fun quest you can do and provide a challenge to your way of game play. And the best part about this game is that it's FREE to PLAY which is AWSOME in my oppinion. So all in all I reccoment this game to any one looking for some fun.			",51,11,3,15,12,1,27

												Keep in mind this is an rts down to its core.  Now saying that I would recommend this game to my rts friends.  The game is slow at first but over the long term its fun and can be challenging.  The lore is told well through out the game as far as I have gotten.  The combat is really fun and will make you think before engaging combat on the map with npc's but as always in pvp you must think before engaging.  Despite the few bugs I have seen does not break the gameplay experience for me.  Irritating yes but still easy to continue.  WIth the patches already released they are actively working on fixing bugs and the community is helpful.			",92,17,1,28,34,1,22

												I have been playing this game  for about  a year now and would like to say first It really is a fun game!.I have seen  many changes and bug fixes but the essence of the game is still the same.  The co op battles are great ways to take on the big cities and get lots of crowns with out spending hours in the battles. I would like to see some things  different like a off line option so that saved game data cold be restored after an attrocious battle wipes out your favorite army or something like that.  Maybe a way to bring your favorite army back to your town when the town is attacked. (Only been attacked at town once).  Having paid for the game and not been made primete automiticly is a valid complaint that I hope gets resolved to my benifit.  I also liked the chest menue for elite heros or dragons. dwarven members but now they are sprinkled around in your town. I kie this game and have invested as many hours in one year as I did in Skyrim for 3 years.			",9,0,0,4,0,0,0

												well ive already put 18 hours into this game in the last week into this game, so that has to be saying something.being a total war fan i instantly grabbed onto this game due to its graphical similarities to age of empires and its strategical correlations to total war. this game is harder than both, how ever, due to the succesful balancing system. unlike any total war or age of empire game, the fights will take a long time and so will the civil and militaristic progression.to those thinking "" oh this game is centered around PvP, a newbie will get slaughtered"", thats not true. this game pushes the fact you will only get attacked by someone of equal strength. another great feature is being un able to ""pay to win"". unlike clash of clans, this game focuses skill and truly working to get to the end goal. this company isnt greedy; its obvious they are pushing for a truly strategy based game that will never have you face an overwhelming force.as a whole, this game is hooking, not greedy, and incredibly well balanced and fair. great game			",20,3,0,5,2,0,17

												Kingdom Wars is a fun game that pouts an emphasis on working for your victory rather then paying for it. It combines the long term strategy from games like Civilizations, the real time action of the original Warcraft games, and the hero manipulation and questing of Mount and blade in to one great game.

												Hello my name is rotanahte well my gamer tag that is, today im going to talk about Kingdom Wars. Kingdom Wars is a fantasy MMO that incorporates Orcs, Elves, and Humans. The game mainly consists of YOU and YOUR mouse. What i want to ask you is, how many of you out there like to command people or in this case be in ""charge""? I do and when i saw this game i freaked out! I love this game my friends even tell me im playing too much of it. I've only been playing for about 1 week. I honestly thought i spent 3 hours ingame, turns out i spent 23.2 hours in one week in one game. I highly recommend this game to anyone out there.			",58,10,1,7,21,2,10

												This game is a grand exsample on how FB games can work with Rts the building over time and the recruitment time needs along with other parts of the game that other town builder games lack make it entertaining at the lest for when building a massive army. the Rts in the game is also in depth for such a grand F2P game. I recomend others in desire for long term rts or for town builder games as it mixes the two in a mystical and addictive game.			",101,13,4,21,32,0,31

												i love this game with a passion. the free to play game that is kingdom wars is bringing back what it means to strategize. this old style game has been done like this many times before but they are not around anymore, the whole mid evil scene died out, but this game is bringing it back old school with knights, castles and seige units. this game is so much different than other games because of one thing, Siege. Nothing is more fun than attacking a castle with a friend. Anyways this is a very fun game, play it hours on end, and very well made :)			",30,0,0,1,2,0,0

												I love the game. its like all those king and queen games you want all in one. the army battles are huge, the ai does what its told....sometimes atleast. what problems the game has, which to be rather happy with is very little. is fixed within hours or within days. if you let them know whats wrong they will more than likely fix it. its fun to have a huge castle, ive been playing the good part of a few weeks/a month or two and ive barely scratched the surface. the range of units is great. each has strengths/weaknesses nothing is too overpowerd. there really is no spam this unit you win. seige weapons are innacurate but funny but do a lot of damage and whats cool is they use resources to fire. you get raided and the enemy doesnt bring enough resources then good luck him seiging. ive not been attacked yet and you get free premuim on start aswell as not being attacked for 24 ingame hours. not a day if you play or not. your villagers gather resources even when you are not there. the world map is lovingly huge. there is so much to do. you can play as much as you want. there is always something to do. its not like a game you can just leave running and visit an hour or day. you can just keep playing if you want to. it works both ways. the game is great. i hope to keep playing it as much as possible and as long as i can. the graphics are not top end but everything is shown. everything has good animations and the combat is fun. i hope they make graphics a little better but thats my opinion. its a great great game. those who like stratagy games will love this. there is three races too with there own sub factions. humans can get dwarves and mages to help which is cool and as far as i know each race has there own storyline but is on the global map. its great!! keep up the great work!a few things that could be fixed/improved upon. in my opinion and just general fixes that may or may not be noticed that could be done1: The formations and stances can be set but if you log out and rejoin some auto revert without being told otherwise.2: graphics. but thats just me3: a little bit more info on what formations do but not layed out in a basic format. e.g loose formation makes it harder to hit with arrows but does it decrease things in stats, if so by how much, not simply ""It reduces this. but not say how much"" 4: i would like to see a unit range decal so i know where archers/crossbow men and seige equipment can fire from and where best to place in defence.5. Cycle icons or timers on research and production. there is already a black loading icon but with some research i press the button and its either instant or is researching slowly, either way i cannot tell if its been researched or is researching. maybe grey out the button or say ""researched already"" e.g the mill, irrigation i researched but it still remains there showing the purchase amount but its no longer clickable, ok i know it means its worked but to others they might click it and go...well what now?6: the mouse feels like it lags when clicking things, sometimes it wont select a unit liturally right behind another unit or when you attack they will walk, maybe a toggle run button too but mainly the way the mouse feels. it seems to feel like its lagging when clicking. or you have to multiple click somethings a few times.7:the female hero after leaving the capital then returning will spawn, when it auto walks to the return way point it walks with a broken graphics, looking like its legs are were its arms are and its arms right outwards with the sword pointing outwards.keep up the good work!

												I want to first start out by saying, I have owned this game since beta, So I have been through all the Bugs and junk like most games when they first come out.....Game Review goes down like thisYou can Custom each unit as well as your Castle, different textures armours and how they fight for example you want Knights with tons of Arrow defense and huge hitting power or low hitting power but can heal up super fast. I guess once you lvl up your units it will somewhat blend in as there are caps...Main types of people you can play ORCS, Elfs and Human. I play Human as my main and Orcs... I hate elves!!! It is not a Pay to win game as it has a system to match people up to somewhat equal balance. The graphics are great, now I have a power house machines so I can't really speak if there is lag or Frame rate issues as I get max all the time. The map and fights are pretty dynamic and if you are a Total War fan this might be your game!! It is also a full RTS game no turn base crap which is nice. I have a O.K army with 1 Red Dragon and a few Minotaurs LOVE Minotaurs. Most people have a lot of playing methods. lots of people like Archers and some like things that can run fast and destroy Archers like Minotaurs hehe. Your Kingdom is setup in such a way that if you get a attacked you have a chance to win if you play smart. You will always retain your Castle if you lose and it is pretty easy to fix it back up.  I would suggest playing solo a few matches to see what your base can do and find the weaknesses. There are plenty of people so lvling up makes it easy. You can lvl up really fast so don't think you will be left behind, this games some what take care of that weakness really good. They have units that you can buy with crowns find out what type of fighter you want to be then unless your power...Crowns that word can be scary but like I said this is not a Pay to win game.... So you can earn crowns pretty easy by fighting and doing all the quest... Now I hope the devs still do this, but they are know to give out 100 crowns for just being nice in chat.... or helping others, I have received close to 300 crowns in total over the years. Devs,, they listen for the most part and seem to have a great connection to the chat channels, patches come out pretty quick and all the extra content is free. PS there is a way to have to have a full Dwarf Army very bad♥♥♥♥♥ I have 50% full army now that I am lvling up. Thank for reading my wall of text..... See you out there			",17,0,0,12,11,0,22

												Kingdom Wars is not for everyone. It is a slow, complex game, though that's not to say it's any more complex than your average RTS. Starting the game the first time has a steep learning curve of about 7 hours. You have to learn all your normal RTS things like what buildings can go where to make what, what upgrades are available to each unit, basic economy & tactics, etc. But then there is an overworld map, quests, army management, sieges, and a tight constraint on crowns/influence, which is the reward for beating quests and winning combat and absolutely necessary not only for research but for special units, too. And consider this: there is a PvP element, which you either can bypass by paying off the attacker or engage and risk your units, and either way you can only rest safe for one hour of in-game time before you can attack/be attacked again. So you start off with 24 hours of in-game PvP protection. Just 24 game hours to prepare for PvP.PvE is all about quests and getting crowns/influence through quests and battling on the overworld (think random battles from older Final Fantasy games but you choose when & where.) One big flaw is the cumbersome quest system which makes you inch your way over the worldmap to the quest giver's city and then load the city map and then wait while your hero runs across the city to the quest giver. And turning in a quest often results in another one being available, but you have to exit the city and enter it again, walk your hero back to the quest giver and get the next quest in the chain. Most quests are repetitive, and don't directly scale in difficulty. You will often have to fight two armies, seige two cities, etc. and both often occur on the same map, but you have to, again, inch your way over the overworld map to get from point to point. Now the idea behind this is while one army is moving up to four additional armies can be deployed as well. This makes it possible to split your forces and multi-task on the world map, building an ever bigger collective army.Battles can be quick, though. I got to a point in the quests where I decided I would have my hero kill eveything solo, and that takes forever. But if you don't go Hero vs. World, seiging a castle can be quick, routing an army can be quick, it all depends on your playstyle and how much you risk your units, if you worry about looting every penny, spending every skill point asap, etc. This is the kind of game like OgreBattle where you can easily drop 80 hours and not even see a fraction of what there is to achieve in the game. This game is a place to escape reality and become absorbed in the fantasy RTS game, with the added pluses and minuses of PvP. There are so many details, potential strategies, and an ever unlocking complexity that keeps you learning well past the 30 hours I've put into this game so far. Despite the flaws, it is easy to get absorbed. Come and stay. We don't bite - much. :)			",64,0,0,12,2,0,6

Posted: November 2, 2014
												So Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars now just known as Kingdom Wars is a rather unique MMORTS with a persistent world and economy.So let's go over this with the good the bad and the improving.The Good:This game has one of the most ACTIVE dev/moderator communities I've ever seen. There are almost always devs or moderators with community supporting abilities online and they respond very quickly to player queries/problems/bug reports.City Management: It's really fun getting your city up and running, your economy working and it really helps build up a feeling of ""This is mine!"" when you log in to your city.Army building: The roster of units per race is not overly large or cumbersome but there is room for a lot of diversity and tactics. The way they go about this is fairly fun and unique. Each and every battalion levels up  not just the heroes. And as each battalion levels you can allocate points to that battalion so that it better supports your tactics which means you can have two players with say a swordsman battalion and each sword battalion can be the exact same level but be specced out in two totally different ways.This leads to a lot of fun with building YOUR ideal army rather than some all encompassing army of win that so many RTS games have.Battles: Battles in terms of PVP are done via matchmaking which means you won't generally have to worry about armies many times your strength coming down to slaughter you while the veteran player at their helm laughs at the newbie. DON'T be mistaken though because it is fully possible to have two armies of identical strength rating but with totally different power ratios.This can lead to some unforgiving learning cures where you need to figure out ideal combinations to match your strategy. Do you want quantity or quality do you want an ideal mix of both? Are you a player that can micro manage good enough to have a small crack corps of heroes over an army of regular soldiers? ALL of these options and combinations thereof are waiting for you to figure out.PVE: The PVE options to take and conquer AI cities is fun especially when you get co-op up and running and can work together with other players to take particularly difficult targets.Quest system: The quest system while nothing special allows you to earn some extra money and resources while not having to do the more challenging PVE or potentially unforgiving PvP battles.Opt Out: You can ""pay off"" a player that wants to attack one of your armies or your town so as not to potentially risk losing units you otherwise do not want to lose. This is a good thing as the above mentioned potentially unforgiving early PvP learning curve may cost you questing time/ability.So let's move on to the Bad:Right now you have a few severe bugs that while not game breaking for MOST can become so for the less patient or mature players amongst us. If you get easily frustrated with bugs and don't like having to report them or talk to moderators to get your lost resources/gold/whatever back then at the moment I'd recommend holding off on this game.Can be unforgiving: As stated with the battles section of ""the good"" this game can be VERY unforgiving when you lose a battle since this is a persistent world those losses are for good and some players might take days to rebuild from the loss of their core army. While most of the community is currently rather friendly and often willing to help new players with tips and tricks on how to get your economy up and running the early losses that players WILL suffer can sometimes be a little spirit breaking until you figure out how to create newer better armies and get a solid economy running.So lets move on to the ""Needs improvement"":So far the idea that the game is ""pay to win"" can kind of seem like a thing for new players because of the way crowns work and how slowly they come in for a new player.In truth I think the crown price of some units could afford to be lowered but this is personal preference.There are bugs that definitely need to be sorted out before this game can be a 10/10 and some of the promised features need to be implemented such as the naval options and the like before I can say this game is truly what the developers advertise.So for now at it's current stage I have to give this a 8/10 because it is not really ""feature complete"". There are bugs some of which can ruin an impatient/less mature player's experience. On the flip side the devs/moderators are extremely active and very willing to help people with any losses they've suffered and for such a small team (6 developers) they are fairly active in attempting to patch and bring this game up to a full 10/10.

												So I bought this game in 2012 after it was fairly new. Keep in mind, this game was new at the time and was still getting sorted out. I played for 100+ hours in the first week, It brought me in and it kept me wanting to come back and play more. I had to get the walls built, I needed to build that army, I needed to siege  that city. This game has improved more than I could have imagined since then. I literally bought it a second time because I couldnt resist, Now after a year and a half break I am back. I was able to import all of my old cities and pick up right where I left off. This game is great in the RTS aspect. Lots of units, versatile factions, even the ability to conquer other cities. It also has great strategy becaus every unit has a weakness, but it also a strong point which could help to change the tide of a battle. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable, laid back, RTS. The mods are great and the community is a lot of fun. This is a game thatcould get you hooked.			",8,0,0,3,1,0,8

												kingdom wars is a great game in opinion, it has all the aspects that a game on the dark ages or at least this kind of game on the dark ages should have. it has some up sides and down sides too. i realy like how you can choose a race between orcs, humans, and elv's it just add's in that lord of the ring touch. the down side is that the recorsess take a wile to collect and it take's a long time to get crowns to builed defences. and one of the best fetures are that you can ricrute different races into your armi. one of the bad things is how long it takes fore your soldures to cross the map. and the graffics are dicent not great but there ok for what it is. over all its a great game and the developers need to ceep on going and doing their best to improve the game.

It's a nice game, and I loved my old times playing The Lord of The Rings Battle From Middle Earth and for those who likes The Lord of The Rings Battle From Middle Earth, I would recommend this game!

												This game was AWESOME !!! At 1st on how I found this game is, I am just finding for a Free-2-Play games and when I saw the Cover of the game and its Trailer, and its AWESOME THRILLING MUSIC in the Trailer !!! It reminded me of Lord of the Rings, so i downloaded it, the game was GREAT !!! The Graphics on ""Low"" is kinda bad but the game was AWESOME ! It's like Total War, but Total War never shows its awesome growing base on LIVE not like on KW !! And the Changing weather effects in the Game ? Like Snow, Raining, Storm, etc... KINDA AWESOME !! And watching your town growing, your peasants working, your laborers making stuffs and something like that, It's a mixed Strategy Game ! And  the best part they've done in the game is, they made it F2P (Free2Play), I've been playing for 16+ Hours because it's kinda Addictive, if You're a Strategic game fan i don't know if you're gonna like this game or not, but to me, It's Awesome... Anyways my vote to this game is 10/10 :D It's just so Fantastic...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdom wars is an Innovative kingdom builder.  I like the economic system, the more peasants you have working the fields, the more resources you get.  There are also upgrades for said peasants to make them more efficient, as well as upgrades for your military.  I like the fact that you don't need real cash to make crowns, which you get by completing missions, reaching accomplishment milestones or trading for gold in the game.  Trading is probably the fastest way to make gold in game, as you can create an army with a few horse carts and peasants to carry goods to market, plus add farm animals to the army to sell those in different cities.       Creating an army is easy enough, just need to go to the world map.  You pick the units you want in it, military, peasants, animals and send it on it's way.  The combat leaves a bit to be desired, I think the AI needs a bit of work, as I leave my force sttationary, send a unit of archers up to snipe at the enemy.  As soon as the enemy starts moving toward my army, I run them back and wait for the slaughter, as the enemy only sends in a few units without archer support.  After their melee units are dispatched, rinse and repeat on their archer units, who blindly follow into oblivion.  Send in the peasants to clean up the corpses and you get a nice bit of loot.  I also like the wide variety of units allowed in the game, the fact that you don't need to worry about using real money to buy the better units, as they cost resources and crowns and are available to everyone.     I haven't gotten to build up my castle yet, as I have been concentration on my economic upgrades, but from what I've seen, it really looks worth building a castle as soon as you can afford the crowns, stone and/or wood for it.  I haven't tried siege warfare yet either, so I really have no knowledge of it other than the turtorial I played.       Overall, I find the game a lot of fun, it's a kingdom builder that really allows you to build a kingdom.  You have diplomacy to ally yourself with npc's or other players, forming guilds/clans.  It is an awesome experience. ",16,1,0,12,5,0,21

												The game starts off with you and your hero in a humble little town that you have just aquired. You are given quests that you can follow for rewards, and get you familiarized with the game. In the beginning you are placed in a status with a timer that counts down, and after the amount of ingame hours expire you can now be attacked by armies of relatively the same strength as your own        Or       You can avoid the quests, try and build your army and city your own way, go on the march, start pvp by turning off the protective status mode, going on a coop raid of a city. Whatever you decide to do, the beginning may feel a little harsh because the gathering process feels really slow until you get everything rolling. Your units keep gathering resources while you are offline and there are daily rewards mailed to your in-game bank.The game has a sort of ""Knights of Honor"" and ""Warcraft 3"" feel to it. KOH because: There are some diplomacy aspects that can be done with the NPC cities like giving gifts and trading with them to improve relations. NPC cities that you defeat can either be looted for additional resources or placed into vassalage under your command and there are alliances that can be made with other players. When fighting you go into  a zoomed in view where you command you units in the field, give them direct orders of where to attack, what types of formations to use, as well as special abilities that each unit may have. Units can be hot keyed 1-9 on the battlefield to make it easier to bounce between your units. What I like, is that you can mix and match your army for some variety, like taming ogres, or hiring other races as mercenaries to fight for you. There is alot of building that needs to be done to improve your cities defense, offensive capabilites, resource gathering and storage. The buildings also have upgrades on them that can give your units bonuses. There is a population cap in your city depending on the number of houses you build, and different units require different amounts of population requirements, like a dragon requires 10 open slots while knights or archers require 1 slot. You gain veterancy on your units, the more they fight and survive the more levels they will earn. Every level awards 3 points to spend on attack, defense, health cap, stamina cap, or health regen.Warcraft 3 because: As a Realtime strategy that is going on, you have peasant type gatherers, melee units that focus on slashing, crushing and piercing damage. Ranged piercing damage that can be done by archers, there are elite units that you can make like the: tribal shaman, high knight, wizards, multiple types of dragons, while all expensive units to buy, if they fall in battle they will not disappear like a regular unit would. they will just be unavailable till the end of the fight, and then be back in your army again with low health and acouple of veterancy levels lost as a death penalty.The three races you can play as are:Orcs (can build goblin units), Elves (wood elf and high elf) and Humans (can build dwarven units).They all have differences about them, like the range of archers, the defense and offense of melee units, special abilities like heals, hiding and beserk. It all puts a little spin on which race you decide to use.This game is free to play, with a sort of booster shop available in game. You can get the boosters if you want, it will help you get to a more advanced city status quicker, but has a 1 time purchase ability for your city. Its not necessary in order to be competitive or anything like that, it just gives you some gold, and some exta crowns that are required to upgrade some buildings and build advanced strucures and units. You earn the crowns from fights and quests, but the booster and the ""premium"" status you can pay for will give you some bonus rewards, again not necessary, just available if your the type that has no patience and wants to try and speed things along.Pros:The game as it stands right now is a tremendous amount of fun for me. There is a pretty active community and I like how the story and questing is going, the random coop sieges, the quest battle requests, and the occasional invading enemy army that I either buy off to leave me alone for a while or engage. Different playstyles for different people can be tried out in the skirmish mode. Its like fighting with your army and trying out different tactics without the consequences of losing them in a fight by trying something different. Like I have fought with someone that had an army the same strength as mine but he used only ogres, another used all cavalry sprinkled with some archers. Infantry with cannons. Minotaurs with trebuchets, you name it, alot of variety in what you can use. I like how it only faces you against people that have around the same strength, so your not getting beat down on by the people that have been playing longer than you have. The moderators, like the game masters are always in the chat channel, and can be asked questions anytime in the help channel. They'll offer advice on questions you may have about using units, and suggestions if something with the game is working properly.Cons:The game can seem slow in the beginning. It is meticulous with alot of micromanaging that needs to be done, both in battle and in your town. Building up the wealth required to buy some of the units can be difficult in the beginning of the game if you dont follow the quest line. There have been afew issues that I have seen in chat channel about some people losing some units from their army after the last update, but the Mods have been helping people out. The zoomed in quest giver view, like when you see you character up close and personal when he/she in talking to a quest giver, you can see that they dont look so good, I guess there wasn't alot of emphasis on the polish of the quest givers but not a really big deal. There is also some lag when you are doing a coop battle with someone or logging in, you'll see it get choppy for afew seconds before it smooths out.Well I hope this has helped out with Your decision to play this game. If you are a fan of RTS games I would highly recommend this to you. It's free to download and free to play, I go by the name Ish in game so maybe I'll see you there.			",35,7,1,11,2,0,13

												This game is a grand exsample on how FB games can work with Rts the building over time and the recruitment time needs along with other parts of the game that other town builder games lack make it entertaining at the lest for when building a massive army. the Rts in the game is also in depth for such a grand F2P game. I recomend others in desire for long term rts or for town builder games as it mixes the two in a mystical and addictive game.			",101,13,4,21,32,0,31

												i love this game with a passion. the free to play game that is kingdom wars is bringing back what it means to strategize. this old style game has been done like this many times before but they are not around anymore, the whole mid evil scene died out, but this game is bringing it back old school with knights, castles and seige units. this game is so much different than other games because of one thing, Siege. Nothing is more fun than attacking a castle with a friend. Anyways this is a very fun game, play it hours on end, and very well made :)			",30,0,0,1,2,0,0

												I love the game. its like all those king and queen games you want all in one. the army battles are huge, the ai does what its told....sometimes atleast. what problems the game has, which to be rather happy with is very little. is fixed within hours or within days. if you let them know whats wrong they will more than likely fix it. its fun to have a huge castle, ive been playing the good part of a few weeks/a month or two and ive barely scratched the surface. the range of units is great. each has strengths/weaknesses nothing is too overpowerd. there really is no spam this unit you win. seige weapons are innacurate but funny but do a lot of damage and whats cool is they use resources to fire. you get raided and the enemy doesnt bring enough resources then good luck him seiging. ive not been attacked yet and you get free premuim on start aswell as not being attacked for 24 ingame hours. not a day if you play or not. your villagers gather resources even when you are not there. the world map is lovingly huge. there is so much to do. you can play as much as you want. there is always something to do. its not like a game you can just leave running and visit an hour or day. you can just keep playing if you want to. it works both ways. the game is great. i hope to keep playing it as much as possible and as long as i can. the graphics are not top end but everything is shown. everything has good animations and the combat is fun. i hope they make graphics a little better but thats my opinion. its a great great game. those who like stratagy games will love this. there is three races too with there own sub factions. humans can get dwarves and mages to help which is cool and as far as i know each race has there own storyline but is on the global map. its great!! keep up the great work!a few things that could be fixed/improved upon. in my opinion and just general fixes that may or may not be noticed that could be done1: The formations and stances can be set but if you log out and rejoin some auto revert without being told otherwise.2: graphics. but thats just me3: a little bit more info on what formations do but not layed out in a basic format. e.g loose formation makes it harder to hit with arrows but does it decrease things in stats, if so by how much, not simply ""It reduces this. but not say how much"" 4: i would like to see a unit range decal so i know where archers/crossbow men and seige equipment can fire from and where best to place in defence.5. Cycle icons or timers on research and production. there is already a black loading icon but with some research i press the button and its either instant or is researching slowly, either way i cannot tell if its been researched or is researching. maybe grey out the button or say ""researched already"" e.g the mill, irrigation i researched but it still remains there showing the purchase amount but its no longer clickable, ok i know it means its worked but to others they might click it and go...well what now?6: the mouse feels like it lags when clicking things, sometimes it wont select a unit liturally right behind another unit or when you attack they will walk, maybe a toggle run button too but mainly the way the mouse feels. it seems to feel like its lagging when clicking. or you have to multiple click somethings a few times.7:the female hero after leaving the capital then returning will spawn, when it auto walks to the return way point it walks with a broken graphics, looking like its legs are were its arms are and its arms right outwards with the sword pointing outwards.keep up the good work!

												I want to first start out by saying, I have owned this game since beta, So I have been through all the Bugs and junk like most games when they first come out.....Game Review goes down like thisYou can Custom each unit as well as your Castle, different textures armours and how they fight for example you want Knights with tons of Arrow defense and huge hitting power or low hitting power but can heal up super fast. I guess once you lvl up your units it will somewhat blend in as there are caps...Main types of people you can play ORCS, Elfs and Human. I play Human as my main and Orcs... I hate elves!!! It is not a Pay to win game as it has a system to match people up to somewhat equal balance. The graphics are great, now I have a power house machines so I can't really speak if there is lag or Frame rate issues as I get max all the time. The map and fights are pretty dynamic and if you are a Total War fan this might be your game!! It is also a full RTS game no turn base crap which is nice. I have a O.K army with 1 Red Dragon and a few Minotaurs LOVE Minotaurs. Most people have a lot of playing methods. lots of people like Archers and some like things that can run fast and destroy Archers like Minotaurs hehe. Your Kingdom is setup in such a way that if you get a attacked you have a chance to win if you play smart. You will always retain your Castle if you lose and it is pretty easy to fix it back up.  I would suggest playing solo a few matches to see what your base can do and find the weaknesses. There are plenty of people so lvling up makes it easy. You can lvl up really fast so don't think you will be left behind, this games some what take care of that weakness really good. They have units that you can buy with crowns find out what type of fighter you want to be then unless your power...Crowns that word can be scary but like I said this is not a Pay to win game.... So you can earn crowns pretty easy by fighting and doing all the quest... Now I hope the devs still do this, but they are know to give out 100 crowns for just being nice in chat.... or helping others, I have received close to 300 crowns in total over the years. Devs,, they listen for the most part and seem to have a great connection to the chat channels, patches come out pretty quick and all the extra content is free. PS there is a way to have to have a full Dwarf Army very bad♥♥♥♥♥ I have 50% full army now that I am lvling up. Thank for reading my wall of text..... See you out there			",17,0,0,12,11,0,22

												Kingdom Wars is not for everyone. It is a slow, complex game, though that's not to say it's any more complex than your average RTS. Starting the game the first time has a steep learning curve of about 7 hours. You have to learn all your normal RTS things like what buildings can go where to make what, what upgrades are available to each unit, basic economy & tactics, etc. But then there is an overworld map, quests, army management, sieges, and a tight constraint on crowns/influence, which is the reward for beating quests and winning combat and absolutely necessary not only for research but for special units, too. And consider this: there is a PvP element, which you either can bypass by paying off the attacker or engage and risk your units, and either way you can only rest safe for one hour of in-game time before you can attack/be attacked again. So you start off with 24 hours of in-game PvP protection. Just 24 game hours to prepare for PvP.PvE is all about quests and getting crowns/influence through quests and battling on the overworld (think random battles from older Final Fantasy games but you choose when & where.) One big flaw is the cumbersome quest system which makes you inch your way over the worldmap to the quest giver's city and then load the city map and then wait while your hero runs across the city to the quest giver. And turning in a quest often results in another one being available, but you have to exit the city and enter it again, walk your hero back to the quest giver and get the next quest in the chain. Most quests are repetitive, and don't directly scale in difficulty. You will often have to fight two armies, seige two cities, etc. and both often occur on the same map, but you have to, again, inch your way over the overworld map to get from point to point. Now the idea behind this is while one army is moving up to four additional armies can be deployed as well. This makes it possible to split your forces and multi-task on the world map, building an ever bigger collective army.Battles can be quick, though. I got to a point in the quests where I decided I would have my hero kill eveything solo, and that takes forever. But if you don't go Hero vs. World, seiging a castle can be quick, routing an army can be quick, it all depends on your playstyle and how much you risk your units, if you worry about looting every penny, spending every skill point asap, etc. This is the kind of game like OgreBattle where you can easily drop 80 hours and not even see a fraction of what there is to achieve in the game. This game is a place to escape reality and become absorbed in the fantasy RTS game, with the added pluses and minuses of PvP. There are so many details, potential strategies, and an ever unlocking complexity that keeps you learning well past the 30 hours I've put into this game so far. Despite the flaws, it is easy to get absorbed. Come and stay. We don't bite - much. :)			",64,0,0,12,2,0,6

Posted: November 2, 2014
												So Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars now just known as Kingdom Wars is a rather unique MMORTS with a persistent world and economy.So let's go over this with the good the bad and the improving.The Good:This game has one of the most ACTIVE dev/moderator communities I've ever seen. There are almost always devs or moderators with community supporting abilities online and they respond very quickly to player queries/problems/bug reports.City Management: It's really fun getting your city up and running, your economy working and it really helps build up a feeling of ""This is mine!"" when you log in to your city.Army building: The roster of units per race is not overly large or cumbersome but there is room for a lot of diversity and tactics. The way they go about this is fairly fun and unique. Each and every battalion levels up  not just the heroes. And as each battalion levels you can allocate points to that battalion so that it better supports your tactics which means you can have two players with say a swordsman battalion and each sword battalion can be the exact same level but be specced out in two totally different ways.This leads to a lot of fun with building YOUR ideal army rather than some all encompassing army of win that so many RTS games have.Battles: Battles in terms of PVP are done via matchmaking which means you won't generally have to worry about armies many times your strength coming down to slaughter you while the veteran player at their helm laughs at the newbie. DON'T be mistaken though because it is fully possible to have two armies of identical strength rating but with totally different power ratios.This can lead to some unforgiving learning cures where you need to figure out ideal combinations to match your strategy. Do you want quantity or quality do you want an ideal mix of both? Are you a player that can micro manage good enough to have a small crack corps of heroes over an army of regular soldiers? ALL of these options and combinations thereof are waiting for you to figure out.PVE: The PVE options to take and conquer AI cities is fun especially when you get co-op up and running and can work together with other players to take particularly difficult targets.Quest system: The quest system while nothing special allows you to earn some extra money and resources while not having to do the more challenging PVE or potentially unforgiving PvP battles.Opt Out: You can ""pay off"" a player that wants to attack one of your armies or your town so as not to potentially risk losing units you otherwise do not want to lose. This is a good thing as the above mentioned potentially unforgiving early PvP learning curve may cost you questing time/ability.So let's move on to the Bad:Right now you have a few severe bugs that while not game breaking for MOST can become so for the less patient or mature players amongst us. If you get easily frustrated with bugs and don't like having to report them or talk to moderators to get your lost resources/gold/whatever back then at the moment I'd recommend holding off on this game.Can be unforgiving: As stated with the battles section of ""the good"" this game can be VERY unforgiving when you lose a battle since this is a persistent world those losses are for good and some players might take days to rebuild from the loss of their core army. While most of the community is currently rather friendly and often willing to help new players with tips and tricks on how to get your economy up and running the early losses that players WILL suffer can sometimes be a little spirit breaking until you figure out how to create newer better armies and get a solid economy running.So lets move on to the ""Needs improvement"":So far the idea that the game is ""pay to win"" can kind of seem like a thing for new players because of the way crowns work and how slowly they come in for a new player.In truth I think the crown price of some units could afford to be lowered but this is personal preference.There are bugs that definitely need to be sorted out before this game can be a 10/10 and some of the promised features need to be implemented such as the naval options and the like before I can say this game is truly what the developers advertise.So for now at it's current stage I have to give this a 8/10 because it is not really ""feature complete"". There are bugs some of which can ruin an impatient/less mature player's experience. On the flip side the devs/moderators are extremely active and very willing to help people with any losses they've suffered and for such a small team (6 developers) they are fairly active in attempting to patch and bring this game up to a full 10/10.

												Kingom Wars is, now, one of my favorite games. It let's you mix your long-time strategy such as (building, recruiting and reaserching) with your real time strategy (battles, questing and teaming up with others in co-op or PvP).I have for an long time searched for a game with this concept where you control the whole picture and not only the tiny battlefield OR an entire nations economy and army-positionings, but both!I have played the game for over an month, and for each update it's becoming better and better. The last updates have been really good improvments and I'm sure that is just the start. You might thinkt that the game has become an ""pay-2-win"" game since it's free now, but as far as I can see, that is not the case. Sure you can speed up things for money or buy some ""dragon pack"" where you get a dragon or something. BUT! It doesn't ruin the game, at least not for the other players (I haven't bought anything and I feel that I'm on the same terms as anyone I've met). If you're a strategy fan, as me, then I deeply reccomend that you'll at least test the game. The more people playing it, the more action-packed it gets!// Mr.Page			",29,0,0,8,9,0,14

												Kingdom Wars is a really nice RTS-MMO-CO-OP game, if you ask me is what I was searching for many years :D this kind of game allows you to build a really awesome stronghold and nice managing. Allowes you to build a really nice sizable army and attack others players city/stronghold in many ways of sieging. Ofc it has many things that still needs to work on :D but how I see it, the moderators are hard working on those problems and is a nice to see that, you can say they want to go far with this game :D. And I sure hope so, try it on guys it deservers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game cant stop playing it,I havent got to do any pvp yet as my army aint strong enought but looking foward to it also you dont have to spend a penny of your money to win its all completely free.I would recommend doing the tutorial first it dose'nt take long and shows you enough to get started.Pros..as always everything uses resources but they are easy to come by you either farm for them using your peasants, trade goods and livestock for gold to buy them or just buy them with what gold you have instock by going to other towns you can also gather resources by taking peasants out with you to combat to loot the bodys.The building side of the game is easy just click on the building you want to construck and it starts building, it takes time and patients but feels great when you finish, I cant wait till i have a full sized kingdom.When it come to the army its so much fun watching the battles im impressed with the way you can control your individual units unlike some mmo's where its hard to control and keep track of your men this game tops it, the controls are easy just assinge a group to a hotkey and access them at a touch of a button, also the different formations prove very useful when in combat.If your not ready to go out and attack a fort then just go out and you can fight againt pvp who have the same sized army as you,combat is great fun i love watching a hundred men battle it out but its not just a case of run in and chop away you have to be very strategic plan your moves and organise you army accordingly.Cons..I have only one problem.It can get rather expensive on resouces as you kingdom grows so it take a long time to progress.Overall this game is great so get it a.s.a.p			",107,8,1,10,6,0,3

												The best way to describe this game is by this short sentence: ""Real time strategy meets MMO"".We all know that will be your response.Well yeah .... the question is ... is it good?Short answer: Yes.Long answer: It's complicated.The good:   - it's free   - the tech tree is quite well defined and the progession is not to difficult    - the units have nice upgrades at level up (and yes the units level up), and it makes sense to have a main army that you carefully level up to a good level and have that as the main force in PVP later on   - the map is quite large and you have the possbility to set small strongholds around the home city to further protect yourself   - the game continues when you are not online (this feature is exaclty what I was searching for)   - large armyes   - ok graphicsThe bad:   - it has quite a few bugs(units sometimes walk thru walls, arrws stuck in mid air, garison units that don't fit the wall are shown at ground level outside the walls ... and so on)   - while map exploring the enemy units are always spawned in the same spot and have the same pathway ... some variation would be great   - sometime the game laggs when in battles (I have an ok PC: octacore AMD and r9-290x, and sometimes I do get these laggs)The bonus ( :D ):   - the administrators here respond real quick to any complanints or bugs you findSoooo here comes the grade:     Considering that I have yet to experience all of it and that it's still a young game, I am able to give it a grade of 7.3 out of 10.PS: If at any point I change my oppinion I'll make sure to change this.

												This game is action pact 3D stragey game. i Recommend all people think thier good at stragey game to play this/ It is like Rome II and Shogun war when you battle. At frist it may seem boring but if you keep playing you will end up liking it. There 3 race elves, orc and human. You cant really choose a banne ryou like unless yo upay $1 which suck, but rest part is pretty good. This game also make yo uthink how to seige a castle and make you find a opening thourhg a enemy castle. Also you cant see player on the map unless you go find them thourgh the search thing and you can fight them there, for this part is the reason i dont like it. I recommend the game change that.At the end it a fun pvp game. i Hope you all enjoy it. It will take some time to become powerful in the game good luck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun one. too much scripted gameplay, and not enough world design. But, PVP does take it up a notch. Free to play value is very high. Only pay money if you want cosmetics. Expanding and having multiple castles is always satisfying.7/10			",74,9,1,17,10,0,11

												An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.Its fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)Leveling up your units!:This game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on. Eventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected. Special Units:Every faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.Quest line:Theres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own. Due to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.Traits and RegionsIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.These are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a ""turtle"" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.Either way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.Choose wisely. :)Non-Mandatory PvPIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.It is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.The graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features) The gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_FantasyYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.Regards,Brandt.

												This game is a great game. But it needs more. Like being able to trade crowns with other people, leagues like bronze, silver, and gold should be added for the PvP ranks. You should also be able to place your building anywhere like the orcs can while still being able to rotate it. There are many more suggestions I shall make but it will be just a long list of things that I personally want in this game. I still recommend it although.			",55,5,0,19,11,1,8

												Genius game! Pros: Slowpased fighting and building which gives you a lot of time to figure out strategies.         Fighting mechanics are very easy to understand when you've played a few games.         Should be lag free on most computers Cons: Tutorial needs a lot of improvement. It only teaches you how a small part of the humans works. If you want to play any other race as first race, you'll barely understand anything of the game. I began as elves, played for a short while and was then going to uninstall the game, because it was confusing. Luckily I decided to try humans, and that's how I learned the game. So basically you can skip tutorial, it doesn't teach you anything, other than the things you learn from every other game you play. It totally forgets the things it's supposed to teach, like what's unique about this game.			",50,4,1,12,7,0,6

												Rating: 9/10Pros:-Works like a Facebook game, you can log out with peace of mind knowing that players cannot attack you unless you are online. And you get rewarded for daily log-ins!-If you are a rich and prosperping player, you might be able to pay them off with gold or stone, etc.-Feels like Stronghold - but without the pesky tasks of ""cleaning up gong"" or ""peseants stealing from our granery sire"" -Mobile armies: You can build a force and level them through campsites and taking on enemies in the wilderness around you, making you stronger and your units stronger for battles to come.-Well designed lore of castles and beautiful landscapes.-No ""PayToWin"": As they say in the news on the game ""this game is designed to avoid the pitfalls of FreeToPlay games....focusing more on skill and persistance than bigger wallets""Cons:-Very wonky (slow) combat. You have to make sure you units don`t get stuck and cluttered as they will get moved over by the smallest force if you`re not careful.-Co-op is not as smooth as I had hoped, while you can send supplies to your friend, getting them to play with you to aid in a quest or seige is a bit frustraing if you dont pay close attention to what you are selecting.-Npc workers [peasants, etc] tend to get stuck up in hills or behiind fences when chopping down trees. -The initial title screen has very LOUD audio - first tiime players make sure your audio is turned down some or your ears will get blasted away. While this is epic sounding, if any player has their volume up they might get quite a surpize once the tittle screen loads.-Slow loading screens between transitions. [ While this really isn`t a *con* it can be annoying waiting for that bar to load up when there is little to nothing in your home city to load ] Another transition issue is between begining to seige and actually entering the seige. These problems are on and off, and while I havea solid internet this *may* vary between players. Overall this game as great potential to kick out Stronghold and its gong-infested cities and brings forth a potential for a shining sheild in castle-sim-like games. ",30,0,0,6,3,0,0

												Kingdon Wars is a fun game when it works. I spend hours in the world. it's lore is very deep but could be further made aware to the player. Building your city is fun but once you ""get"" everything you need you won't need to do keep track of it. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you play. The units are interesting and can be upgraded to increase their armor and attack. Combat is fun but if you play with someone else the lag can kill your game experience. Overall the game is a fun experience that you can get lost in for hours at a time. 8/10			",2,0,0,6,5,0,8

												Greetings steam comunity,5cents on why this game is recommendet by me and why you should waste a part of youre precious livetime playing it.First of all - why should one play it?- its fun- its free- its got castels- its got dragons (some of them slightly three headed)- its got mad magics- its not a pay2winTo give this a more serious aproach - the pro stuff:+ The game is a fine mixed castle building, army training and stuff wrecking experience(, a little of what i wanted as a stronghold fan :) ).+ Three playable races - elves, man and orcs.+ The gameplay of the battles is well done. Whyle the overal controling mechanism is rather simple one may invest some energy into the micromanagement of unit stances and rotations to gain the best from the troops efforts.+/- The castle is limited to a few number of designs and placement spots - which are nicely done to alow the player a rather wide range of tactical options.+ The Armys consist of up to 60 units, including sige engines and workers to get all those shiny coins from the corpses. As the units gain experience they may be upgradet to fit the players needs.+ The KI citys are chalanging and differ greatly in theyr designs+ The pvp system seems promising, presenting some late game challange, interesting battles and army compositions and the rather easy and fair mechanics of avoiding it by paying a part of ones ressources to the attacker.+ The overal unit ballancing seems to be sound and while its not perfect the developers are working to improve it.+ The comunity is alive and quite friendly.To play it is a little like....One may upgrade his camp to a formidable stronghold. While the walls rise high the troops may march to complete the first quests and plunder some stuff on the way. By doing so one aquires the in game currency of crowns - and even if there is a rather great heap of those in the in game store, the number one may get there is limited.In time the army will get experienced and gain enough power to take on the great citys of the world. The choice between looting a vanquished city or taking it on as a vassal is rather rewarding - more so if you just managed to gain a victory inside the walls of the capital :).On the dark side ther are a few things to be said:- The KI is just not up to the task. While the unit KI is ok with only some minor *whydoyoustupidhealersengagetheogersinmeeleagain >.<* kind of problems the KI troops on the battlefield remain stationary until engaged, most of the time. Most of the movements an enemy will do are rushing his remaining troops into the keep, if you break don its gate, and some counter charges if this gate did not belong to the keep. The odd exeption is a charge of the reinforcement troop. Those apear after half an hoer into a KI sige and are pathetically easy to block, by disengaging your troops from the city and mincing the reinforcements. - The ballancing of the fractions is not finished yet. The orc race seems to be a little on the downside, in the overal army performance.- There are few end game challanges out of pvp matches. If one has put some thought into the army composition and the upgrading of ones troops there will be next to nothing left to stop this army.-/+ The game is still in the making. While not essentialy bad, one may get slightly annoied by a few bugs and gliitches. Also ive experienced two mayor bugs up until now, of the *dude where is my castle?* kind. On the other hand: those where solved in a matter of one or two days and the mods did theyr best to recompensate the losses. Also one may hope to see some further improvements to the gameplay and some more content to come.oh, and cookies, because.... you know....In summa summarum i recommend this game.Hope to see you (try) torching my city some time :),best regards, Cyraion.

												I've been looking for a game that melds a lot of features from some of my favourite strategy games into an online environment, a game that is set aside from others within the same genre, and this really is it. The game is not pay to win and is paced really well, it's not slow nor is it fast, you really feel rewarded from what you receive through the steady rate of progression. The quests help to push you in the right direction while you're starting out, and after just a few hours you'll be making some really steady progress toward the more end-game options. Positives: As mentioned previously, the game is not pay to win, finding a game like this that is both enjoyable, f2p, and not pay to win seems to be the gaming equivalent of finding gold in your back garden, for this I am very grateful. You have several different options in terms of how you would like to play the game, do you want to be economically focused, do you want to focus on military, etc; this kind of choice makes the game strategically diverse and allows you to shape how you want to play the game, and I felt that this made the game far more enjoyable, especially if you play with friends and work together by taking up different roles.Negatives: The game is a little buggy right now, and performance can vary. While trying to use the windowed mode feature I found my game crashing very frequently, and I ultimately had to disable that option. I also got stuck in one of the tutorials while trying to access the menu. So the game is definitely in need of some polish. Combat could also do with some work; the current system gets the job done but is quite clunky and very messy. You send your units in and then sit back and hope for the best. Of course the graphics are quite basic but they are bearable, a slight overhaul would be a nice quality of life improvement. A little more direction for players completely new to the genre would also be very useful. Overall, from my gameplay experience and from the masses of reading I've done about the game, I think it's great and absolutely worth a try. The developers are keen on improving the game and are asking for feedback whenever possible, which really tells me they have their head in the right place.			",51,3,2,13,8,0,11

												Kingwom Wars I still remember my thrill when I heard about this game being released. If I had to explain this game in one sentence it would be: The game is like Travian, Tribal Wars, ... but in real time 3D RTS mode.I have little play time on steam, that is because steam release was buggy at start, it payed off more to play using official launcher, meaning not using steam. The gameplay is simple, you start with a town which you upgrade. It has no deep depth of techology, it is rather simple and straight forward. You do not even need super strong economy to get decent army. I mostly play Elfs since I find their economy and troops most suitable to me (Archers :) ). Game has single player and multiplayer side which do no differ too much. You can play singleplayer offline with no problems, multiplayer gets you closer to other players. Multiplyer is same as singleplayer but you can go into CO-OP battles with other players, either with or against them. Maximum players inbattle are 2v2, which is kinda limiting. Guild/Clan/Alliance has meaning in terms helping each other during attacks. Game itself looks like Total wars series where troops and cities are managed on global map, while battle itself is in spirit of total war series where 2 armies clash. Combat system is same as with total war series archers(mounted, foot, crossbows), infantry(heavy knights, pikemen, swordsmen), cavalry (one type mounted knight, elfs have mounted archers), monsters with orcs etc. Each unit formation could lvl till 20 and had stat points for you to manually upgrade which provides decent ammount of depth. Each unit type has its special skills, where some have to be researched using crows, which are acquired with battles and quests. At start it was that simple, during time game developers kept close contact with comunity and invested great time to fixing bugs and providing new content. At release time game was once time purchase, now it is free to play model with premium. New content added mages, dragons, dwarfs, new heroes/special units, sieges but for all of it you need massive ammount of crowns which arent easy to get. There are also some bugs where you spend 250 crowns, but s*it happens, server reverses your upgrade and town state and u lose 250 crowns which finally made me quit game. Game itself is fun and worth playing, developers are moving forward and wont forsake the game, but KW2 is comming and you can feel that they are more focused on that release. Have fun it is nice game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I love how this game can simulate thousands of people at war without crashing your computer (like some games do) even if the graphics aren't spectacular.

												An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.Its fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)Leveling up your units!:This game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on. Eventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected. Special Units:Every faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.Quest line:Theres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own. Due to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.Traits and RegionsIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.These are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a ""turtle"" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.Either way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.Choose wisely. :)Non-Mandatory PvPIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.It is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.The graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features) The gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_FantasyYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.Regards,Brandt.

												The game is very easy to get into. It's almost like you're typical RTS game. The visuals aren't the best, but the game makes it up in gameplay itself. I wish it would have been more expanded however, on races perhaps, a bigger world, and not so many bugs. While the game is (from what i've heard) a work in progress, I would hope they will fix these issues in the future. Otherwise, a very good game to play everyday. I highly recommend it to people who like strategizing and working with other players to conquer cities and gain loot.			",43,5,0,19,0,0,6

												This is not worth your time, at first glance a ""MMORTS"" sounds fun. But there are huge problems with pathfinding, ever see a army you spent hours building up walk into siege fire and die? this game will do it. most of your battles will be farming the same area of the map repeatedly for ""crowns"" a currency you can farm or buy from the shop. I spent two days building an army and had no way to get any more crowns, the minimap in your battles is horrendous and isnt even working in real time, it ♥♥♥♥ing updates off of refreshes every couple of seconds. the graphics are so poor you sometimes cant pick out smaller units from the terrain. I dont even know how to structure all of the problems. If it was one or two big things fine, its an indie dev.

												The game is very easy to get into. It's almost like you're typical RTS game. The visuals aren't the best, but the game makes it up in gameplay itself. I wish it would have been more expanded however, on races perhaps, a bigger world, and not so many bugs. While the game is (from what i've heard) a work in progress, I would hope they will fix these issues in the future. Otherwise, a very good game to play everyday. I highly recommend it to people who like strategizing and working with other players to conquer cities and gain loot.			",43,5,0,19,0,0,6

												This is not worth your time, at first glance a ""MMORTS"" sounds fun. But there are huge problems with pathfinding, ever see a army you spent hours building up walk into siege fire and die? this game will do it. most of your battles will be farming the same area of the map repeatedly for ""crowns"" a currency you can farm or buy from the shop. I spent two days building an army and had no way to get any more crowns, the minimap in your battles is horrendous and isnt even working in real time, it ♥♥♥♥ing updates off of refreshes every couple of seconds. the graphics are so poor you sometimes cant pick out smaller units from the terrain. I dont even know how to structure all of the problems. If it was one or two big things fine, its an indie dev. But there are so many small things wrong with the game that the act of playing the game forces you into a battle with the game itself, you have to fight the bad game design to play this. and thats a real shame, i want to love it.

												I noticed that a lot of people are not recommending this game because of the feature, ""Pay to win"", is in the game but that is entirely optional. You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.Also I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.Anyway my review...Overall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.However it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the ""storyline."" The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.Overall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdom Wars is a very interesting game. At first I had a very low opinion of it, but if you can overcome the first hour of the game and look past its shortcomings you'll find a very addictive experience with so much potential.Negative impressions: Visually it looks as if it made in the early 2000s, and the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Once battle is joined unit formations devolve into disorganized mosh-pit like globs with very poor unit collision detection (if any at all.) The animations are primitive and very basic, not just in combat but for walking, idle, and cutscenes dialog. There are also a host of bugs, many of which are highly destructive and infuriating. The worst I encountered was when I lost an entire army, 28 units, because a quest sent them into a void and left me with an empty army on the map- without even starting the quest. I was left without my hero unit, and an entire day worth of invested resources that I used to build said army.Positive Impressions: The economic system and a load of fun, and by far the best part of the game aside from the general idea. You can make profits by trading, harvesting resources, looting battlefields, and questing. Each option presents its own benefits and challenges. If you decide to harvest resources at home then you will looking at the safest and most reliable way, but it also means you need peasants working the land which drags on your unit cap. Trade is the quickest way, but it also means you’re at risk of losing caravans and thus your cargo. It also requires more management and the natural risk of losing money on a trade if you’re too hasty.The game has a pretty mild pace, which is certainly a positive in my opinion. You won’t become powerful overnight, and all buildings and soldiers take quite a bit of resources and time to make. There is also a healthy variety of units and plenty of defining traits to pick from. Units gain experience from battles which lets you upgrade them, in addition to researching new technologies and equipment. From what I can tell there is no pay-to-win advantage either. The cashhop is purely aesthetics and speeding up the process of questing rewards.If the combat would be overhauled then I think this would be an easy game to recommend, and if animations and visuals where modernized then it would be a jewel. However as it stands it’s a give and take. If you can overlook its issues there is a lot of fun to be had, but not everyone can do that. ",93,5,0,14,3,0,6

												This game is one of my favorite RTS games of all time, but it is also still in progress, which means it can only improve from its current state (Still great in its current state). I have about 90 hours in the game at the moment, but with the new progress on the game right now, I can't wait to get back into the game. The developers are communicative and work with community to make the game better for everyone. The game reqiures strategic units and positioning to overcome defenses and overwhelming numbers. Kingdom Wars also allows you to make a town from scratch and build it into a fortress, along with controlling massive armies to conquer the many cities on the map. The progression of your city is slow but that make every little addition to your city feel huge. The campaign is mostly missions to keep you busy and have something interesting to do, but they give a good amount of gold. You are allowed to choose between three races: elves, humans, and orcs. Each have their own strengths and defenses, which means a variety of different play styles, thus giving the game replay value if you ever wish to restart. I definitely would recommend this game to any of my friends because it also allows you to team up with them to take down strongholds and do missions. If I was to rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say it was a 12. Kingdom Wars is phenomenal and I can't wait to see what they have in store for it in the future.			",111,6,1,12,3,0,4

												In my opinion any game that gives you 1 hour of fun per dollar spent on it is worth. That said, I spent 20$ on this game a year ago and I have never regretted it. Now that it's free, there is zero reason why you shouldn't at least try this game :D It took me 75 hours and about 4 months of playing to get one built up city and I haven't even touched the other two races yet, so needless to say this game will occupy you for a while. Also zero pay to win advantages, everything is aesthetic. You can buy in-game currency with gold you acquire in the game, and now that's the only way you can get it so everyone's on the same level.

												Kingdom wars is a great game that I would totally recommend. The gameplay is fun, and slightly addicting, yet its also enjoyable to log off and next time you log in you have the resources, gathered by your peasants while away, to get right back to work at building your kingdom. The graphics aren't the best but their plenty good in my opinion. The combat is enjoyable, sieges are fun, and sometimes costly to your army, and overall, its got loads of enjoyable content. Also, I sent an email to support and recieved a super quick and super kind response plus was generously compensated once the issue was fixed, and they fixed it in no time at all, quite impressive.

												Definitely a must for all RTS fans. Especially since it is free, right? Unlike most game's that are free, this one also comes with the guarantee that it isn't pay to win. Wait one second. Free game not being pay to win? That's right! Paying in game with hard currency does not give you an outrageous advantage over people who choose not to pay and many options are simply for visual effects like battle standard and the like. Ha I'm gonna make my army bear the picture of an electric guitar. What? There weren't electric guitars back then? Darn.Well anyways, This game is in my words: ""A more drawn out MMO version on Age of Empires."" Set in the medieval time period. Here you get to build your city, raise armies, capture enemy strongholds then choosing whether to control them or simply plunder them, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. As for you mythical lovers, there's also dragons, and wizards, and dwarves, Oh my! Choosing between three races is pretty cool, but here you can also select unique traits to focus your race on. Let's see here... Orcs with reduced market rates and prices? Umm no. I'll take combat mastery and take the goods I want by force haha. Fear me you peasants! Ah sorry, I let my power hungry self out again... Let's continue shall we? I don't know about you but with over 20 enemy cities to siege, 3 regions for each race with other unexplored territories, and the ability to enter the world on any part of the map for different experiences, there is clearly a nice feeling of change to keep you refreshed. There is also a very competitive player versus player system as this being it's main aspect and a great co-op feel, although it beautifully sows player versus environment elements into the game even giving the option to quest and play the game solo.While the game still has many bugs (many of them being quite annoying), it is completely compensated by the amazing staff that keeps the game afloat. I've never seen a game change and advance as quickly as it has to find and fix problems affecting everyone and even problems affecting one person! One bug here, next day solved. Great game you must give it a try it is truly the next RTS brought to life. It's here... And it's evolving as we speak.Till next time,                   Canine (In-game name: FrozenSteel, Referal code: REF1100001083111D8)			",54,3,0,7,4,0,3

												DON'T BE FOOLED!In a battle of The Good, The Bad, and ugly, this game defiantly comes out on top. It has a very unique style in its class, a great community, and Devs who listen and respond to its players. The game provides plenty of features, lots of different tactics to try, and does a good job rewarding you for hard work. Let's break it down:The GOOD:- Lots of units to mix match and unlock- I love research, upgrading, and expanding. Everything from buildings to individual units- Crazy epic and awesome units are immortal. Meaning when you save up all your crowns to get that dragon. You love him, pet him, and feed him, give him a great home and BAM! Some glory dragon slayer slays your dragon! (Noooo) But no worries, he may lose a few levels of experience, but he is not lost forever!- I love how epic my cities feel. In the early stages of the game things feel slow. A little humpty-Dumpty, but the pace quickly picks up. Especially when you start sieges.- Siege Battles!- The real money exchange system isn't a pay to win. They have boosts to help get your city going, but most everything else is aesthetics.- Co-OP options are awesome. When doing something that you need a little extra oomph… Go Co-Op!The Bad: - What can I say, games got bugs. While Kingdom Wars has eliminated most of the 'Show Stoppers' an occasional boot out of a battle, or a vanishing GUI can still provide headache. Even though the developers have done a great job reimbursing any lost time / effort, it's still a hassle.- Friends / Guilds / Chat system is a little clunky. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone is online, or directly chatting with you.- I have mixed feelings about the map. Part of me wishes we could see other player cities, while another part says this is a very interesting setup. I like not being camped, people sitting outside my city waiting for protection to fall, but on the other hand. I kind of miss doing it?The Ugly: - The biggest complaint I have about the game is some of the weird, jerky movement in battle. I hate having to issue orders multiple times to get a unit to perform a special task.- Though I love Co-Op, sometimes finding someone to help you perform a task is… troublesome. Sometimes I sit for 15+ minutes looking for someone to siege with me.- The popup messages are troublesome. They ask or provide you with certain information. ""Would you like to vessel a city, or loot it for xx crowns."" If you don't answer before another message is triggered you lose both options. Being invited to a Co-Op is sometimes confusing. Yes it tells you the name or quest, but it zooms so far into the map, it's hard to tell where you really are.Overall, I would highly recommend the game. The units, city building, and unique features add a very refreshing spin on the RTS genre. The Free to play is truly free as you will not find a hidden 'Pay to win' market. The community is helpful, and the Developers are extremely repsonsive. Raise a mug to Kingdom Wars! ",116,11,2,17,25,1,44

												I really love the gameplay of this game and the combat,siege and defense mechanisms. The grapgics are really good and detailed for a strategy RTS game. However, while yes it technically is not pay to win, its more pay to play. I was very surprised to find that i couldnt even play a skirmish without paying, while i can understand the developers need to make money, i wouldn't call it free to play if 3/4 of the features require actual money. A good example of an ACTUAL free to play is Neverwinter; every single ounce of content is free, even the things you can only get with special items is still achievable using multiple methods in the game, on top of that it's solid, fun, addictive and satisfying gameplay and story. So while im very into Kingdom Wars i think making it fully free to play or even just unlocking the skirmish modes would bolster the popularity and reception of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the brief time that I played, Kingdom Wars was problematic at first, and challenging after knowing what to do. The game is arduous and not rewarding in the small-term. However, if you like Empire-building, RTS's, and making strategic decisions, this will be for you - so long as you have patience. If anything I said doesn't sound appealing, only try it when it is on sale.			",158,16,0,29,18,1,21

												Kingdom Wars is an RPG Indie-Strategy game. It takes place long ago. You can choose from being Elves, Men, or Orcs. You are also able to choose from three different starting locations. As you progress through the game, you learn more and more about the lore. I, truly, very much like this game. It has all the things I like. If you have ever played Sid Meier's Civilization IV, Beyond the Sword/Warlords, or Civilization V, you will notice a lot of similarities. This game will keep you occupied for hours, and I, personally, reccomend this game to people like me who LOVE old fighting styles, and LOVE a good RPG/Strategy game.9.5/10 I'm sure there are many great things to come with this game.

Kingdom WarsBefore you read my ratings understand that i consider a score of 20 and below to be a bad game a score between 20 and 30 a decent gamea score between 30 to 40  to be a good gameand a score of 40+ to be a awesome game Priceworthy - 10/10 Consider the fact that you don't pay anything for the game. Graphics - 7/10 looks decently good. Sound - 6/10 somewhat decent music in the game. Gameplay - 7/10 i really like the game but getting tormented in pvp sucks. Worth playing - 7/10 The game is worth experiencing.Kingdom wars gets a total score of 36 out of 50This is a truly great game but as all games that don't have the backing of a multi million dollar company it has its big flaws like some latency to other players and somewhat odd pathfinding for units at times, but as we gamers know they are trying to patch whatever the problem is it won't be instant but they are working on it. The 2 somewhat bad things in this game is the really unbalanced ""HERO"" units,and the really really unbalanced pvp system.I Would really recommend this game if you are a RTS Fanor really just want to play a rts game with a friend.

												Well i may not have played for a long period of time in this game and it seems like i cannot login into the game now due to some bugs. I still think this is a good game overall, which is why even after i encounter a rare bug which still have had yet to be solved and the developers are working on it. The pros and cons are much like what other players have posted out in the reviews. I personally think the most attractive thing about kingdom wars are the pvp system and city protection shield. Unlike other games, this city protection shield only tickles when you are online on your kingdom and playing. When you go offline, your shield will be the same as when you login again. That is extremely attractive for players like me who are busy at work with little time to play games everyday. In other games, you will normally get sieged and lose resources or even the whole kingdom and you have to restart again which is very frustrating. Here, you can take things slowly as you want, explore the maps, conquer some npc cities or co-op siege with the community. If you have the time and army, you can just remove your shield and get onto some pvp for more fun.There are no worries on how you play and whether if there are overpowered players that pays to win as everyone is more or less the same depending on what strategy you use and time spent to experience the game. I hope everyone finds it fun to play too.			",26,1,2,7,3,0,10

												I have follwed this title since beta, I pre ordered the game and played it on off for years. It was the first true mmorts in my eyes, the dream of a persistant age of empires game or similar really came true here.During the transition to Steam I lost my account so I decided to start again on here as a free to play.I can honestly say from having a paid account I have managed to reach exactly where I was before for free. there are no pay walls or timers to get around. Most of the paid stuff is cosmentic however given the poor visuals it doesn't look great.Pro's: Gameplay, the feeling of laying siege to a town and carefully planning your strategy is great. This game is for the slow methodical players, rush competitive gamers will find it lacking.Con's: Graphically dated and the interface is really clumsy!			",10,0,0,1,2,0,3

												Well personaly i found that the bugs runed it for me, yes there is decent gameplay, but there is more.How anoying can these bugs be? let me give you example. i was raiding a NPC castle. a few units were sent to deal with the artchers on the wall. NORMALY they dont stand a chance, untill a stone tripper (a wall defence ment to drop stones of foes) turns around and beats the S### out of my units, understand, it should only hit you onece, and not on the walls, it has one ammo which means one attack, but no with its high health and its massive 500 DMG it just slaugter. and the exploits well there there. one time i had a invasion in my castle. his troops simply went through the gap between the tower and the wall. perfectly intact building, he just had to wiggle makeing it that mutch harder.PVP? well the cooldown\grace timer you get is great, but the matchmakeing can be terrable. i was just walking around and in normal settings only battles may take place between armies 20% weaker or stronger. ond the other option is be be risky and take a risk of fighting a army 50% biger (but not smaller). i got attacked (not wanting to fight) with a massive and overpowerd army. RIP everything. and then the game crashes occatonly in any instance of units fighting, particurly in missions. trust me almost beating a 1 hour map and haveing it crash, its infuriateig. and one day you may log on and your kingdome is erased, poof gone. that has heppent to me once.in the end if your gonna play this prepare to deal with a buggy mess.

												I saw the video and read up on the game a bit and liked to co-op assist feature online for attack and defense.  Also, I was hoping the game was not as dark as the video, but it's just as dark if not darker for some areas on maps.  The movement of the troops was clunky at best and not based on lag or GPU/CPU/RAM, but just clunky as created.  The UI is very outdated and plain (some games had this 15 years ago).  So for a rerelease = not too good.  Nothing really else stood out as amazing or stand-outish in a way that really grabbed continuing insterest.  The castle building is expected at best.  The one thing in movement that stood out most was the inability to click to move around some objects and not much transparent environment when a unit is behind it; not that units get lost, but in the heat of battle it could make some difference.  The last killer is that there is no Multiplayer really, unless you play with friends.  I saw mainly 1 or 2 online games, but that is about it.  Also, in PvE the A.I. is mediocre at best.I would suggest some other RTS like Stronghold; which is very similar, if not what this game is trying to clone.So unless some changes are made I can't recommend this game.  I was hoping to, but like I said there is nothing really too unique or anything that stands out as great, just expected remakes of this & thats in other games of the Genre.			",148,13,5,25,8,0,24

												After playing this game for 12 hours it's clear this is a free to play, or pay to win game (just about pay to play).  The developers say they aren't going for that pay to win game however the time it takes to build anything is staggering without paying.  Everything in the game costs crowns which you earn by completing quests, killing a players army, playing co-op, or defending your keep.  By no means a small amount of crowns either so basic upgrades cost 10~120 crowns each.  Note that defending your keep doesn't happen often enough to make gathering crowns in that manor a viable option.  You can purchase crowns which makes the game go quicker as you also get gold when you do this to boot.  Thus making the game actually playable if you pay.The delevopers give out a starting bonus deal to help new players get into the game.  Compared to how slow the game moves, the bonus didn't make that much difference.  The issues is simple resource generation bonus for 10 minuts at the x10, x8, x6, and x4 level, and a 5 hour x2 resource generation.  I stopped playing before that ran out as I couldn't imagine playing the game at normal resource generation without pulling my hair out.  You also won't get attacked by anything for the first 24 hours.  To be honest I cancelled the protection as soon as I started to see if I would even get attacked at all.  I didn't at 12 hours of play get attacked once.  Which kind of makes having a walled village pointless.The game itself has a good concept.  The graphics are okay but not great, the sounds, and music is garbage, the game play is kind of interesting.  The bugs are many.  The biggest issue is that it's a 100% server sided game.  I can log out and get more resources than I can while playing due to the lag between the server and my game.  I have an above average rig that can handle any game out on ultra settings so no it's not my computer.  If your army dies there is a glitch that doesn't reset your population count at your home base cuasing some issues trying to rebuild an army.The main reason I don't recommend this game is becuase there is so much work involved with building an army after you get defeated, or even just play and win a battle.  Compaired to the loot you receive from a battle the cost of building an army is crazy.  An army can cost around 1,000 resources per unit with an army cap of 90 units it can get expensive.  The first major battle in the game requires around 25 units to beat.  However the losses are about 20 units.  The treasure gained is around 2,000 gold and about 400 wood and a crown or 2.  The 20 units cost around 30,000 food, and about 15,000 gold.  You don't gain land, units, or anything else in the first major battle.  It was cool to watch just not cool enough to waste 5 hours rebuilding another army to go on the next mission.The peasant AI is horrible as well, and the gathering of resources is limited at best.  Some of the peasant resource gathering upgrades are bugged and actually don't improve what they say they will.  Which is similar to placing buildings, some locations are even bugged and you can't place anything there.  You have to choose wisely what you will place as you are limited to so many slots unless you get an upgrade to the slots of buildings you can place.  Which also requires crowns, and a lot of them.  The population cap in town might be to blame for everything wrong with the game.  With a glitch that doesn't calculate the population correctly, to not showing you all of your peasants when you click on the view all button it would seem the developers haven't finished this game yet.  The population cap is sitting at 90.  While I was able to max mine out at 50 in town after having to use population for animals to get extra food resources I found that I couldn't generate enough to build an army of 30 in a day.  It took about 5 hours to get a army of 25 going.  After that main battle which lasted about 5 minutes.  Having to rebuild all but 4 of those units there simply wasn't enough motivation to continue playing the game.If the developer reads this I would recommend focusing on fixing any bugs the game has.  I would also lower the cost to upgrade anything with crowns in the game.  I would also rewrite the treasure you get after a battle to match the size of the battle, and the losses you will take on at an even matched battle.  If you lose you get nothing, if you win you get enough to at least repair, or rebuild most of your army.  The resource generation is so slow that it would take weeks to get anthing interesting going not to mention all the crowns I'd need just to upgrade my town hall to a castle might take months.  I would recommend changing the population cap to 100 for peasants, or fix the resource generation to make the game pace faster.  Playing 1 battle every few hours is dull and boring after all.  As the name of the game isn't kingdom building it's kingdom war. Compared to other games out there I can play that in this genra this game comes in as boring, and slow at best.  It has a ton of potential to be great, it just simply isn't at this time.			",60,11,0,22,14,0,18

												Its interesting game I like it, but I crash every 15-30 min, I have Asus x71v, 4gb ram, intel core duo, nvidia gt9600. Its a good game, but it crashes a lot, I hope I find a fix, I will tell if I find anything.edit: I have reinstalled my windows 7 from 32 bit to 64 bit, so I can use all 4 gb not only 3 gb and I can say that I dont crash any more, I have played for an hour now, I will play more later and report. When I was on 32 bit, I watched how much ram the game took before it crashed, it took 1.7 gb ram, and atm as I said I have played for an hour it stayed around 1.5-1.6 without crashing an extra GB of ram makes wonders lol.

												built lots of soldiers, next time I logged in, they disappeared.Even worse, knowing that my cool-down was coming to an end, I slowly and tirelessly gained gold to exchange for crowns (the p2w currency) and eventually started building the cage, which would allow me to get a dragon/hydra to defend myself.To put things into perspective: to get one crown, you have to spend 5 thousand gold, I started in the region with the most minerals, and even then I got only 10k per day, amounting to 2 crowns, even if I sold all the remaining resources for as much gold as I could, I still managed to do 4 crowns a day, that's 10 days of not doing anything but gathering gold that you spend only on the p2w currency.When I came back today, having patiently waited the 12 hours that would take to build it, I was greeted by a surprise:Not only did my cage simply vanish into nothing, but all the resources I spent on building it disappeared with it! That's days upon days of tireless un-fun work gone to hell, 40 crowns vanished into thin air.Unless you want this to happen to you, don't play it, it's practically stronghold:kingdoms with better graphics and a (bad) skirmish mode anyways.

												As we've seen countless times with these non-sub games, is the ""pay-to-win"" franchise taking control. Dawn of Fantasy is no stranger to it either, with a couple of euros/dollars, you'll be able to purchase the strongest units in-game that you can't normaly attain, but if you disregard the ""pay-to-win"" methods, I think the game offers good times for a wide range of players, be it a old school RTS player or if you've just started playing, this game is for you. Battles can be huge, also tactic is needed to beat even the NPCs, no more facerolling down the battlefield to collect the town.Because of the ""pay-to-win"" idealism that this game hosts, I don't recommend the game. But overall I'd give this game a 5/10.			",15,0,0,1,3,0,0

You control your units like in age of empires. build buildins like in rise of heroes. building is also very cool here. You can choose where and what to built but in the same time your buildings form beatiful streets with great catle's walls. The thing I like the most in this game is offline resourse mining.

												A game targeted at all Stronghold, LOTR:BFME, and Age of Empire fans.Task villagers to harvest resources, build up your castle/stronghold, raise armies to go questing/clearing areas/sieging/pvp, all while the units in said armies gain ranks and can become quite powerful.Battles take place Total War style, the only setback is the fact that unit collision has little to no effect, battalions don't stick together, so tactics have a somewhat reduced effect here. Bringing villagers to battle is actually mandatory, because looting the fallen yields amazing amounts of resources, especially from PVP.After any PVP (field battle or siege) you get some PVP protection time, so you're not overwhelmed from annoyingly nonstop PVP. Although, keepi in mind that the rewards from participating in PVP are quite bountiful. If you don't want to participate, a small bribe is possible, which is proportional to the army size. Smaller armies = smaller payouts. You do get PVP protection after a payout so it is possible to skip the whole PVP deal alltogether.There is a special resource (crowns) which is necessary for all upgrades and high level units. It comes quite slowly at the beginning, but are most certainly attainable without paying real money. Ammasing gold is the way here, because crowns can be bought for gold at a rate of 1:5000. A solid economy is key, which is a must for any player of this type of game.Solid game, If you loved Stronghold, BFME, or Age of Empires you should definitely try this one.			",18,5,0,5,3,0,8

												I have a crappy Laptop my game lagged incredibly but i played enough and it wasnt as laggy to not be unenjoyable. The game brings a great sense of having to know where your troops are how and when. Its reminds me of my favorite game series Total War. The game is seriously alike but Total war Suppases this game 1000000 to 10. Neither the less this game for being free it is doing an amazing job. I do not recommend for people with crappier PC's like me you will not be able to have the full experience.			",44,4,0,12,1,0,3

												If you've ever played an economy focused RTS like Age of Empires, built up a flourishing and efficient town over the course of a match, and then felt a twinge of sadness on the statistics screen at the loss of said town, then Kingdom Wars is a good bet. (Especially for the low low price of completely free.)Early game you'll spend most of your time optimizing your economy. Training more peasants, setting them to mine gold or stone, gather lumber or farm the fields, meanwhile using your small starting militia to complete the basic quests.After a day or two however that part of the game virtually disappears, with you making only a few adjustments now and then. The economy does everything it needs to, but not a lot more. The main meat of the game is BATTLE. :DPVP works like so:1: Put together an army that you built in your town, and bring it onto the world map.2: Click the ""Search pvp"" button and choose between attacking a city or fighting an army head on.3: If you're fighting an army you'll find yourself on a small open map with some mountains and a few camps of neutral forces.4: If you're in a siege the layout of the land can differ greatly depending on the homeland of the player. Siege weapons are required of course.5: Rewards for winning is gold that you loot of the bodies and Crowns just for winning.The actual combat is squad based, similar to Total War.You can switch between different formations to optimize various types of defence, movement speed and damage. Troops will level up as they participate in battle, allowing you to spend ability points to increase their stats.It's very worth bringing up the F2P platform, as many people shy away from games like this based on the fear of a Pay to Win barrier popping up in their way every time they were just starting to enjoy the game.Cutting to the chase, you don't ever need to spend money in this game. There is a currency called Crowns which you can gain through the following means:1: Winning any ingame fight - either against the AI or players2: Finishing quests3: Paying for it through microtransactionsThing is though, in the case of this game you don't really pay to gain an advantage as much as you do to skip large sections of the game. Sure, you can buy a ton of Crowns in the store and get loads of endgame units and be matched with the best players, but then you lose out on all of the Battles and Sieges that, assumedly, are the reason you are there in the first place.It is currently not possible to actually take control of AI castles, but this will be changed in an upcoming free expansion.PS: Don't pick the human female hero. The voice acting will drill it's way into your skull.			",112,14,0,16,12,0,44

Posted: November 8, 2014
												This game is being given my rating of a current 4/5 due to good performability. I will explain the reasons why I like and feel a recommendation to the game as well as the defects and failures in this game, let start with the failures first as most people like to read the Good n Bad in order, yeah...I don't do that.----BAD!!!#1: The Current Cash Shop Model allows you to literally buy your way to victory for only 10-20$ USD and is practicly forcing players to do this if they want to get their walls' up before the peace-timer ends. Not only that, the daily transaction limit on crowns should be removed, 30 Crowns a day is about 2 Upgrades of the lowest pool, not even remotely worth it.#2: Sieging requires a very large force or a very small for of units you could simply buy from the Cash Shop, Simply buying 5 Minotaurs grants you 280 Power for your army and is in no way fun to deal with as a single minotaur can kill 5 ogres by itself, let alone an entire 8 battalions of cavalry. My gripe on this is, you can also buy army power by making nothing but archers and catapults, buying fire arrows and siege munitions then stacking stone and sitting back and not doing anything as your archers have 700 range and infinite ammo.#3: Respawns are an issue when fighting other players and in missions, I play as Orcs personally because I like their resource system, it reminds me heavily of LoTRBFME, But as I could clearly see, if you buy a ton of goblins, get them all to level 20 and then max out their health regen and HP, they can literally die in combat and be instantly replenished, this obviously needs to be fixed, Goblins are in no way weak, Why buy a bunch of slayers when I could just mass so many goblins it causes the opposite player to lag out?#4: Marketplace, Oh god...This eats my RTS time soo much, Unlike ""Age Of Empires"" where you can setup an auto-transaction pool, you have to click the icons manually, I wish this game gave you the ability to say: ""If a resource hits this  much, sell it into gold"" or add a ""Always keep this much on hand""; I hate having to manually click the sell resource button multiple times only to be rewarded with a deselection of the marketplace or barely any outcome.#5: The Pathing Engine, Oh lord, I broke this on the first day, apparently you can only have 3-4 Orcs harvesting a single deer, and I have about 40 Marauder Squads gathering food, problem is, there is only like 20 Marauders of the 200 collecting anything, the rest are rumbling and grumbling around like idiots, Its like watching turkey vultures trying to take turns pulling a carcass off a busy intersection, Everyone wants a stab at the corpse. This dissapoints me heavily and I believe the Pathing AI needs to be adjusted for better efficiency, because of this, I cannot bring my food income above 90.0.#6: The Resource System, Yay! not so bad now, but still underperforming. The amount of resources players are given per map, at an interval of every 3 days of respawn is stupid, If I build in a Desert, I expect far more stone than gold. And the worst part about this is the fact that the resources can only be optimally harvested by 2 harvesters each turning this into a ""Starcraft 2 SCVs per Mineral Field Moment"" Overrall, I either think the amount of resources per minute gathered from these needs to be increased, or increase the movement quality and gather rate of all harvesters, even with upgrades, they are still snails at this time.#7: The Upgrade System, Okay this is my final gripe, as it stands, you can literally train units to get certain skills and passives that make them sometimes, in wording of Goblin Hordes; Unkillable and other times just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. How would you feel if someone's hero walked into your army and started 1-shotting all of your men and you couldn't even do more than 1 dmg to him while he regens 80/sec? Or if someone bought a set a Archers and got their movement speed, health regen, range, damage, and resistances maxed out? and just solo'd all your cavalry with arrows? Say...aren't archers supposed to be weak vs melee? It sure doesn't look like it to me. Another issue with this system, is not every unit can be upgraded, which bothers me, I cant increase the replenish rate of my Wargs, Yes I use wargs as outrunners to kill runners, and I can upgrade my laborers, even though they spawn at level 5. I would love to improve their movement speed. I realize this game is not done yet, but seriously?------GOOD STUFF!!!------#1: Performance = The game performs very well on my crappy computer, I have everything that is below the minimal requirements listed for downloading the game, my Graphics card is even out of date by 8 years. I'm suprised I can run the game at 60-113fps in terrain that would normally eat my computer, however there is one terrain that drops me below 30fps, and that is the swamps, that terrain is either high on particles or overrun with reflections. The graphics options are lack luster and need to be evaluated, but if this game turns into another 64x system required game, I swear I'm going to break a kneecap.#2: Animation Quality = I love the chopping down of trees and the maiming of overly maimed corpses, the arrow firing and ring-rung animations of swordsman swinging their swords in 4 different ways at least gives heart to this addition, I hate games like ""Rome Total War"" where there is literally 1-2 Animations for everything except pre-scripted cinema gestures. The only thing I noticed is the level attack animation, it looks like there is no attack speed pool between attacks as soon as the target engages within melee range. This might need a look into.#3: Map Movement Speed = I like this system, however I have seen it in many other F2P and B2P titles and some of which are much faster, this system prevents sieges from occuring too-often which is nice as players have to constantly run back and forth from their major city to replenish supplies and then run back, the only problem I see is when you are doing campaign or single player effects like quests, I think your movement speed should be increased for these and only these, especially if all your going to have to do is talk to some old fart.#4: Unit Composition = I love that you have brought back the obvious, Archer vs Swordsman vs Cavalry vs Pikeman vs Siege effect, but there is alot of balance to be had and as it is clearly obvious, Archers are the best. I also want my Trolls, what Orc army doesn't have a giant Cave Troll? Ogres are not as good as Trolls. I think if you were to add a Troll which you should, it should replace the useless Meat-Grinder and cost crowns to make.#5: Heros = Many games don't have a natural hero system, as it is very hard to balance, ""IT IS"" but either way, kudos to the Devs for adding it, however I would rather be given a choice on what type of hero I am interested in, it gripes me that  every Hero I've gotten so far has been melee, I would atleast like a ""Switch Weapon"" effect or be able to choose if my hero was a Mage, Archer, or Warrior, this would give the game more variation and would make buying Vanity for the individuals more effective as you would have more to choose from instead of 3 pathetic pieces of army that look the same.----FINISHED----Why I write reviews?-I write reviews to give developers and players a heads up and truthful perspective of what effects are taking place in the game in order to prevent the wrong crowd from joining a game they don't expect. I am a Balancer and Play-Tester of other games and have a huge tendancy to find bugs, or bugs find me and break the game entirely, or find things that are uncanny and imbalanced. I don't do these reviews for money or excerpts, I only post them as notifications, I have no interest is retaining any order within said game. Things need to be fixed, I post what and how in the review of the current stage. Simple constructive criticism.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly i have been serching for a game like this for a very very long time.  This game gives everyone thee own estate and lordship in a fantasy mideval society.  In this estate you manage your troops your people and recorce income.  As you progress in the game you go from small town to massive fortress with many various maps to start your town on.  The combat is were the game truly shines however.  When you go to attack a enemy stronghold it takes alot fo preperation examineing eney fortifications trying to find the best point of attack.  And there is always the option to battle against players and npc settlements either solo or co op.  At the end of the battle there is nothing quite as satisfying as seeing your enemys walls fall to your armies.  The pvp element in this game encompases the majority of the game but if you are like me you can choose not to participate.  When you start you get a little featuer called battle protection this keeps other players from attacking your settlement.  This initial protection last 24 hours now at first you think 24 hours real time but no its 24 hours of game play in your current game and there is a in game option to extend that time.  So if you are like me and enjoy just playing the many quests you recive and building your settlement up you can do that without fear of getting attacked.  Another great thing is that if your protection is off and you are attacked you ca only be attacked wile you are logged in and then only if the attacking army is eaqually as powerful as yours so it is always a fair fight.  And should you choose to not fight you can pay the other player a tribute to keep from fighting.All in all this is probably the best mideval strategy game I have ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A strategic and tactical middleage war game i find difficult to compare with other ones i played. Strategic, a bit of RPG, tactical, Business, Timeintensive, older graphic typeMostly i would make a compare with age of empires genre to build units and get them to action, but in difference it remembered me to such browsergames, because of the time you have to wait on your constructions till they are ready.Bulding a fortress with all things a middleage settlergame u imagine and take units out of three races and some special units like mighty dragons. Every Unit of every Race is for every player getable without paying money. As one of the old users (i bought the game times ago) i know there is such a massive progress in debugging and improving this game - nearly unbelieveable. This process isn´t still at its end and there are still some big points of loosing enthusiasm. But i have to admit, that there is a strange element in this game, that forces me to play again and again everytime for a while and to explore the hole game. Good for me: - Business system with some tricky elements to provide my progress, like peasant armys, Vassals producing ressources, - new progress poossibilities with all the buildings .. now it´s not still all researched after 3 days .. Thats very important for me. I want to have aims in game and there are still a few, that i didn´t reached all the time. Aims of Quests or Aims of my desire- mixing and combining armys in any comination.. Great, not one skilled army for all tasks- enough possibilies to get this crones, with which you can buy anything in addition to ressources (not pay to win)- great pve battles - army vs army or amry vs castle ..- great support by nice players all around- good quest system- the possibility to go many way to win.. every unit works fine on its wise. --> Not only one way to make a strong and functioning army Disadvantages of the game - Still since my starting its very slow in every discipline. Commands and orders have a standard delay of ca 1 sec--> this delay raises in pvp battles up to 4 sec. and graphic settings don´t change that. Because of that pvp isn´t still playable in my eyes- not answering gamesupport- not comprehensible effects of life reg on the different units.. a dragon with 50 life reg / s will not have over 10 life reg / real second. Knights instead can regenerate massive life - surely with their greater number of part-units- sometimes its dificult to find out the reason for missing the friend for an coop game. Since it is free to play i can recommend this game and minimum 10 hours that u will see a bit of the content This game is for you, if you like to get part by part stronger by saving up for mighty units and leveling all units and finding your own tactical way  ",53,3,4,9,5,0,17

												Free to play game.Also as an RTS is very balanced and the AI is pretty intelligent.Those 3 races you can play(elf,orc,human)and the existence of dwarfes(which you can also use in combat) + dragons and other creatures makes you feel like you are playing Lord of the Rings,and the combat makes you feel like you are playing Total War.Even it is Free to play,it is not a Pay to Win game,so you can simly be as good as others that pay.The PVP sistem is very nice too,You can battle army versus army or siege a player's castle.You can also PVP army vs army at other castles(controlled by AI).And the variety of quests(which can be played co-op) makes the game even more interesting.But definetly by far the best thing in Kingdom Wars is siegeing.Take your mate and siege a castle,and I guarantee you won't regret seeing thousands of men fighting.IF you have a wizard,dragon or a hydra with you,the battle will be even more interesting.

I decided to get back into the game, and I was amazed. This game has grown so much, and I enjoy every last second of it, and often find myself just leaving the game open, while I'm off doing other things so I can come back to it easily.

It has part of RPG (heroes in your army) and all units can level up too. The construction of the city is progressive and allows you to build several buildings daily. The battles are in real time and allow full control of the units. It is a game you can spend only time you want and it's free sojust download it and try it !!!!			",105,11,5,14,13,0,12

												The strum of a lute serenades my ears as my peasants dutiful mine on my homeland, carrying sacks of stone and gold, tending my fields, butchering livestock, and working hard in the forests surrounding my large keep with it's mighty stone walls. A babbling brook works through my stronghold as my men patrol the walls with crossbows, blunderbusses, and bows at the ready. Bubbling oil gurgles away at the top of my gatehouses waiting to pour onto those who'd dare breach the sancitity of my realm. Trebutchets sit atop round towers waiting for the drums of war. My quiet management of my fief is piereced by the panoply of trumpets hearlding a welp who dares to raze my homeland. So I herd my peasants in and lock the gatehouses. I assemble my personal guard to the outer courtyard and lock the inner gatehouse. The enemy arrives at the edge of my walls and my trebutchets begin to sing with the whistle of flying boulders and the ""swipp"" of arrows leaving their strings. My men bubble out from a far gatehouse and make battle with the enemy on the fields and ruins of my homeland's outfields. They are bloodied but are victorious, the enemy driven before them.  The gates open and the peasants return to their tasks. The lutes play again and the once again peace falls over my land. It feels good to be lord.Kingdom Wars is a PVE/PVP oriented MMORTS where you are lord of a tiny homestead on a vast and deeply detailed world of Mythador. Populated with Orcs, Elves, and Humans it reminds me deeply of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings but with a distinct Reverie Worlds spin. You can choose a race, two traits, and three different homelands that help give your kingdom a unique feel as well as mechanical benefits. You can engage in PVE quests or PVP content with additional Co-OP offerings. By far my favorite MMORTS to date and has hours upon hours of enjoyment.			",212,14,2,38,27,1,66

Training more peasants, setting them to mine gold or stone, gather lumber or farm the fields, meanwhile using your small starting militia to complete the basic quests.After a day or two however that part of the game virtually disappears, with you making only a few adjustments now and then. The economy does everything it needs to, but not a lot more. The main meat of the game is BATTLE. :DPVP works like so:1: Put together an army that you built in your town, and bring it onto the world map.2: Click the ""Search pvp"" button and choose between attacking a city or fighting an army head on.3: If you're fighting an army you'll find yourself on a small open map with some mountains and a few camps of neutral forces.4: If you're in a siege the layout of the land can differ greatly depending on the homeland of the player. Siege weapons are required of course.5: Rewards for winning is gold that you loot of the bodies and Crowns just for winning.The actual combat is squad based, similar to Total War.You can switch between different formations to optimize various types of defence, movement speed and damage. Troops will level up as they participate in battle, allowing you to spend ability points to increase their stats.It's very worth bringing up the F2P platform, as many people shy away from games like this based on the fear of a Pay to Win barrier popping up in their way every time they were just starting to enjoy the game.Cutting to the chase, you don't ever need to spend money in this game. There is a currency called Crowns which you can gain through the following means:1: Winning any ingame fight - either against the AI or players2: Finishing quests3: Paying for it through microtransactionsThing is though, in the case of this game you don't really pay to gain an advantage as much as you do to skip large sections of the game. Sure, you can buy a ton of Crowns in the store and get loads of endgame units and be matched with the best players, but then you lose out on all of the Battles and Sieges that, assumedly, are the reason you are there in the first place.It is currently not possible to actually take control of AI castles, but this will be changed in an upcoming free expansion.PS: Don't pick the human female hero. The voice acting will drill it's way into your skull.			",112,14,0,16,12,0,44

												I didn't know what to expect when I first loaded this game, but a deep and intricate RTS / Base Building game was not it. I was kinda expecting a dull resource extracting game with high grind and no depth. I was very pleasantly surprised. This could very well be my new jam.It's definitely worth taking a good look at it if you like the idea of a slow burn but actually deep RTS to keep you entertained over a long period of time.

												This is a giant timewaster of a game. If you ever played a facebook cow clicker game, this is basically the steam version of those. It's free, sure, but I still think I paid too much for it.It feels like I spent 95% of my time spent playing this doing nothing but waiting for enough resources to get the basic economy of my settlement going. I literally just sit and wait or play other games so that I can have enough resources to build a single building, and even that takes hours.  Then I logged out and when I came back later, the new building was just gone again, along with the resources. This game is a buggy mess, like so many reviewers have mentioned before. I had quests bug out, forcing me to restart the entire quest line because the dialogue happened in the main game screen, then the dialog scene began and there was no way to exit it again. I was even able to get the rewards for everything twice. Units fall through bridges before clipping back on to them correctly, sometimes the resource over time display just changes wildly for no real reason I can discern. I could forgive that, since the strategy genre is in a bit of a decline lately and options are scarce, if the rest of the game was fun.Well, do you enjoy watching a miniature model slowly walk across a huge map? Then you're in luck because that's what most of the game is like. The entire game is slow, slow, slow. Wait forever to get enough resources to build a handful of troops (which are pretty weak unless you upgrade the training facilities for currency, which also takes ages to gather enough of). Then spend even longer watching these units slowly trot across the map to a city or a quest location, where they will just get slaughtered.The worst offender however is combat. There is no control to it. You can't give orders to units because for some reason, while all units are trained in squads, you cannot issue attack commands to target specific squads. You just issue an attack move in the general direction of the enemy and hope your units don't die first. If there is a trick to it, the game doesn't tell you in the tutorial or in the time I spent playing it.And if your units aren't levelled to the maximum level, you might as well just zerg rush with all races because good luck keeping anyone alive. Units will ignore direct commands to disengage, frantically trying to rush back into the enemy army despite the squad being at 1|15 units with barely any health left. Your direct commands as player are just ignored by a batshit crazy AI that makes tactics or planning impossible. And to top it off, the animations of the units are ugly and repetative and the graphics look a good deal worse than Spellforce 1.			",132,12,2,25,25,1,48

												Every aspect of this game is extremely frustrating. If you play this, you will constantly deal with missing resources, missing building, dumb AI, terrible path finding, awful controls... Battles are so hard to play, because controlling your units is simply a nightmare. Sometimes it looks like the developers have NEVER played a RTS on their lives. Don't waste your time.

												Pretty much a chore to play. Slow, grindy and with the micromanagement focused on the boring parts like econmics and whatching over your farmers so they don't stand idle or get eaten by wolves when they wander off, but none of the fun stuff like actually chosing where to place your buildings and walls and you know, build a city and castle to your liking. Horrible UI and gritty graphics makes a mess of everything, but the fact that buildings pop up where the game wants them to, not where you want them to, really killed it for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												    Played about 10 hours.  This game has familiar things most rts games have.  When you start you choose between the 3 main races and and then choose between 3 start locations.  You then get an estate to start building up.  Its similar to stronghold series.  You  start to get some quest that introduce you to the game and let you start collecting some resources. Eventually it leads to you making an army and you go on from there.  I ended up getting to a part where i had to destroy 3 unrulely lords.  I wasn't very pleased with how the siege went.  It was buggy i needed to click many times and units sometime just do the oppostie of what you want.       For me it ended my time with the game.  I spent about 10 bucks on some cosmetic stuff.  Yes you only get 1 default option for everything.  You can then spend some money and buy limited choices.  For example you can pay a dollar to get one of the 5 choices of armor skins.  Or you can pay to decorate your heraldry.  Im ok with paying for some stuff, but don't break it all down into tiny micro transactions.  The game is free, and if you have little knowledge of these types of games i bet it can be a lot of fun.  For an rts vet some of the bugs are unforgivable for me.  I can still recommend it due to its freeness, and the fact that some real work was obviously put into it.  Just not enough for me.			",18,2,0,15,9,0,18

												Kingdom wars is a MMORTS that boasts incredible F2P a great progression system and a massive variety of units. The game plays like a massive single player campaign through your own private instance of the world map. PvP and Co-op act like random encouters for your armies and villages. PvP can be easily avoided but rewards even the loser well. Co-op sieges with randoms or friends are good fun and expose you to more strategies.Currently the game features 3 playable races: Humans, Orcs and Elves. You choose 3 traits at the start to customise your races performance. Dwarves and Dragons are availiable as special units to all races. All races seem unique and quite balanced with the humans probably being the easiest to learn with.Your villages and armies cannot be attacked while you are offline and attacks can be avoided very easily with small amounts of gold or  battle protection when you are.If you ever liked any RTS game ever you should download and play this today. A really clever use of an online communitty for this genre. Hours and hours of fun for solo and social gamers alike.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdom Wars is  ideal if you like a game you don't want you running for 24/7.   It really doesn't pay to be logged in for the sake of it.  Also you don't become punished for your success as you don't have more than one city on a server to look after and build up.  The game is perfectly playable without paying, but if you do pay the game is not particuarly unbalanced for it.  There are loads of options to invest in research, whether for better catapaults, or better yield from your farms.  You will probably want more than one standing army, each tailored for various tasks and so you will need to generate gold to train the troops, though they will slowly train by winning battles.  It is more likely you will pay for their training as it is by far the quicker and economical option.   You will probably also need help fulfilling the battles that unfold as your story progresses which apart from chat is your only avenue of co-operative play with others.   You can make friends and ask them along which, if they have an army of similar strength, they have the option to do.   Added to this, attacking others happens on a random basis so far as army matches go. If you like, you can scour the area and maek battle with innate cities/armies.  People will attack you, and if you don't have the time, or don't want to take losses you can pay them off instead, rather than fight.  So I find when I need to off load goods that my industry is generating and recruit or train more troops, I log in every few hours.   If I want to battle I log in with expectation of taking maybe an hour - some sieges demand an element of patience - and If I just want to sort out my armies, again Iog in for a while as necessary.  So although many of the sieges are similar, they are not tedious, and since some players have been at this game for a year  or two, it is sustainable and so far as things go, I think I might be found here in this land in a few years time too.

												I loved this game. I had three different areas I was working on, got my buddies to play it too.  Then, one day, I was attacked by someone, when the battle screen came up all I had was the starter area, no troops, nothing.  I lost half my forces, and my money.  The developers were awfully smug about it and said it was my issue and offered a half-^@A#(A way to fix it.  Nothing worked, nothing has worked.  The community was great, they tried to offer help...but, in the end, the developers did not care about the fact I did spend money on their game and had a lot of hours into it...

												Many work doneMany work to doi think this is the best review i can give after 1-2 days Gaming experience i personal really like the Game Real Time Strategy without Pause or i didnt find it ;).The Graphics Details are ok the Videos on Steam have way more Bloom and Effects which is a bit sad but maybe it will come. If u Zoom in you cant actually see the warriors face just the Head.It is playable even if you encounter a Bug or something Glitchy it still is fun to play and free to play. Yes this game really is no OP Donations :).Sound feels ok too.About Balance between Races i dont want and cant write.The Map and Siege Battles are wonderfull intense and make Fun!Even if it got alot negatives Bugs not the newest Graphics , theres much positivethe Team (Developers and Moderators) are in Chat and friendly.I enjoy the game so far.

												Hello, Rhoken7 here.   I wanted to try and explore the game a little more before i tried to write a review for this game. I feel that it is a very well thought out game, I enjoy it. The battles are pretty epic in most points. The original sounding names of the places, the lore, the size of the game itself, and how you get to build your city the way you want, for the most part. I did the tutorial but i felt it lacking. I dont know if i missed a advanced stage or what, but some things you find out later in the game that you wish you knew at first. For instance, i wish i knew that my population cap didnt go over 90. I wouldn't have wasted my time trying to get it even higher and spend my earned recourses that i got in game on expanding building plots. the only positive out of doing so gives oyu the ability to increase your storage capacity. But i was a little let off when it told me that i could build more houses but when i got back to the game my population cap did not increase. Also i have knoticed that the PvP notifier is a little lacking as well. I dont spend all my time playing the game, once I finish what i can at that very moment. I may send an army out to a mission and i will go check something like youtube or Facebook. Which brings me to another point. Sometimes it can be very slow going. Which has caused some friends of mine to not give it a chance after one day. The times it takes to build, travel, or even gather enough recourses can take you days. (days of real time, not in game time). But back to PvP. There has been times I alt tab out of the game. or even while in game, im told there is someone at the gates for a fight, and nothing happens after that, the game will automatically ""pay off"" the person coming to my little town. I would much rather take my chances at fighting the person instead of the game automatically paying them off. Last thing i would like to point out is the graphics of the little characters running around. It can be horrid at times to see a horse that has no eyes. Just saying. The landscape graphics and buildings graphics are good for this game, I jus tthink the NPC's and other Characters in the game need a little bit of sprucing up. Other than those points i find this game to be very fun. I plan on playing it for a long time and would recommend it to anyone who likes something like Clash of Clans, C&C, or even Star Craft. It takes elements from a game like Clash of Clans where you build buildings and train units, upgrade those buildings, and go fight people. It takes a RTS point of view during battles and out of battle as well through out the game like Starcraft and C&C. If you like being a Commander of some sort of army and like to make a pretty cool little kingdom as well. this game is for you. Because of the bad character graphics, long wait times, and un-locatable PvP indicator at times, i give it a 7 out of 10. its a good game, just needs a little work. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I say give, Dawn of Fantasy : Kingdom Wars a fighting chance..MMORTS - are really addictive forcing you to online most of the time and in some you can even lose all your progress in just hours of offline.This game was well designed to counter those flaws..The game has potential to be top notch.. however it needs publicity..I really hope to those who can pay.. to buy something to help the devs for the future of the game..Really excited what will happen to this game if funded and with continuous development of around 1-2 yrs more.

												Alright, time to get a review on. I am here today to give a review to a game I don't think gets enough credit for what it does. Are you ready? Good! The game that we are going to dive into today is none other then Dawn of Fantasy Kingdom Wars. If you are not excited and you love strategy games you need to get excited because this game brings so much to the table. First off we have three different races to choose from humans, orcs, and elves, the later of which I am currently enjoying. These races are different in just enough ways to make you want to keep coming back for more. The humans may be versatile, where the orcs are tough and brutal and the elves are elegant. Don't fret there is no need to be careful on what race you pick you can have multiple armies and city's that you have built. I believe that having multiple armies is good for the game it keeps it fresh, I also like the looks on each races cities. Be careful here you can easily sink hours into the game just creating your city. This game is solid in all aspects of strategy, story, and mind numbing sieging for those of you who just want to get straight to the action. You also get heroic units that allow for fun, Mages, Minotaur, Dragons, and many other goodies. You can also customize your cities the more you put in the better your people will be protected! Now the game does have some bugs that can be frustrating. The game doesn't give you an option on whether or not you wish to participate in pvp all though it offers a buy out for the siege it does get frustrating when you are in the middle of building and you get attacked. I have listed the Pros and the Cons of this game but in all honestly you need to pick the game up its free on steam and decide for you self whether this is a go or a dump. This game does allow you to bring friends along on a siege so dust off your armor and lets get ready to go to war!  If I was to rate this game I would give it a solid 7.5 out of 10 the game has to much replay value and is definitely a trend setter in the strategy game department.			",16,0,0,7,0,0,2

												Kingdom Wars ReviewPros: Money System + (u can get everything easily just think, u can even get tons of crowns and don't cry about ur army if u want to keep damaged units fall back and attack with full hp units just think it's strategy game)Sieges +Siege Battles +Trading System + Normal Graphics + Cons:No online Players -This is Great game and highly recommended. it's true that there are better games but this one is free and deserves more positive status.

												I really like this game lt has a unique rts mmorg play style it does have the potential to be great.Pro's : you cant get attack when your offline or have protection on, resources still build up,open player map and great npc battles and the fact you can randomly get attacked by player while moving on map is great feature.Con's : Low player base but the ones that are on are dedicated, minor bugs from time to time and needs more reasons to be in guild has no guild wars feature or anything.In my opion great game could be better if added more pvp options and more guild options and if you guys come and play bring the player count up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												fun little game dont get me wrong, and decent for being free. but theres a lot of little quirks such as if your hero dies in the quest you have to restart(not to mention all damage to your units stays and the ones that died dont come back :)), which makes sense, but one of these heroes in particular is superrrr easy to kill, even easier than regular units, and on this game its a pain to micro manage one unit. Its a pretty game but there are a few funny looking things mainly the walls and faces of people. But i will give it that it has a very unique system for seiging and trading, but for me this game just isnt on par with the others on the genre but even so ill probably log in more hours			",12,1,0,3,8,1,14

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Rts. The community is helpful, the gameplay is fun. The only thing it needs is more player base, and people to stop giving it a thumbs down because they give up to do thinking it is either too complex to understand or don't have the patience for it. Great concept, love the mmo-rts style. A great new step in the genre, love to see things evolve in a different light.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I submitted a report over 24 hours ago and have yet to get a reply. Everything I lost cost crows which = real money. They have a special right now to buy a starter pack but I suggest you steer clear. Its not worth the risk of it vanishing and then not getting any customer service!It seems this company is all about getting your money but not doing anything when you have problems. I woiuld simply choose another game...I mean look at this, they released Kingdom Wars 2 and charged money before they even got this one finished, which cost 20$ when I got it.. didnt get anything for that either. #reverieworldgreed Also with the new DLC it says.. Rest Assured we are not making our veteran players pay for the DLC... Really Ive had the game since release so why Am i required to pay for the DLC?			",80,9,2,23,3,0,9

												I say give, Dawn of Fantasy : Kingdom Wars a fighting chance..MMORTS - are really addictive forcing you to online most of the time and in some you can even lose all your progress in just hours of offline.This game was well designed to counter those flaws..The game has potential to be top notch.. however it needs publicity..I really hope to those who can pay.. to buy something to help the devs for the future of the game..Really excited what will happen to this game if funded and with continuous development of around 1-2 yrs more.

												Alright, time to get a review on. I am here today to give a review to a game I don't think gets enough credit for what it does. Are you ready? Good! The game that we are going to dive into today is none other then Dawn of Fantasy Kingdom Wars. If you are not excited and you love strategy games you need to get excited because this game brings so much to the table. First off we have three different races to choose from humans, orcs, and elves, the later of which I am currently enjoying. These races are different in just enough ways to make you want to keep coming back for more. The humans may be versatile, where the orcs are tough and brutal and the elves are elegant. Don't fret there is no need to be careful on what race you pick you can have multiple armies and city's that you have built. I believe that having multiple armies is good for the game it keeps it fresh, I also like the looks on each races cities. Be careful here you can easily sink hours into the game just creating your city. This game is solid in all aspects of strategy, story, and mind numbing sieging for those of you who just want to get straight to the action. You also get heroic units that allow for fun, Mages, Minotaur, Dragons, and many other goodies. You can also customize your cities the more you put in the better your people will be protected! Now the game does have some bugs that can be frustrating. The game doesn't give you an option on whether or not you wish to participate in pvp all though it offers a buy out for the siege it does get frustrating when you are in the middle of building and you get attacked. I have listed the Pros and the Cons of this game but in all honestly you need to pick the game up its free on steam and decide for you self whether this is a go or a dump. This game does allow you to bring friends along on a siege so dust off your armor and lets get ready to go to war!  If I was to rate this game I would give it a solid 7.5 out of 10 the game has to much replay value and is definitely a trend setter in the strategy game department.			",16,0,0,7,0,0,2

												Kingdom Wars ReviewPros: Money System + (u can get everything easily just think, u can even get tons of crowns and don't cry about ur army if u want to keep damaged units fall back and attack with full hp units just think it's strategy game)Sieges +Siege Battles +Trading System + Normal Graphics + Cons:No online Players -This is Great game and highly recommended. it's true that there are better games but this one is free and deserves more positive status.

												I really like this game lt has a unique rts mmorg play style it does have the potential to be great.Pro's : you cant get attack when your offline or have protection on, resources still build up,open player map and great npc battles and the fact you can randomly get attacked by player while moving on map is great feature.Con's : Low player base but the ones that are on are dedicated, minor bugs from time to time and needs more reasons to be in guild has no guild wars feature or anything.In my opion great game could be better if added more pvp options and more guild options and if you guys come and play bring the player count up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												Game is fun, very slow paced, addictive at the grow part of it, a few side missions and quests vs AI.. but i still dont recomend it due to many issues i found on the very first couple of hours of gameplay that makes the most give up fast:-game crashes often, in one of the times it happened to me, when i logged in again some of my buildings were gone like i havent even built them. so i lost 1 hour of gameplay after playing 2 or 3 hours. wich made me to give up imediatly.-you start a tiny village with 24h atacks free, but as you see the world map everyone else around you got a monster developed city compared to yours and you wont be able to compete after that safe time.-chat system is crap, you can see a list of players online and talk on general chats, but you have no idea wich city belongs to who in the map, and you cant manage to contact them, or at least not in a direct user friendly way so you kinda feel alone in the world surrounded by gigantic empires you cannot fight fairly.-game is pay to win.

In fact its so bad I would dl the game and play a bit just to see how bad the pvp is. I like this game I do it is fun but your armies can get crushed (FIRE ARROWS SUPPER OP)  AND IT takes so long to get them good or alot of coin Traing pretty op to and then just have them die in like a 3 min battle UNINSTALLED right their this game is fun like I said but if you want to play and go pvp GET FIRE ARROWS ABOVE ALL LIKE ASAP ALL THAT MATTERS and take prozac or smoke some herb cause u going to be mad at the lag time and effort you put in after you see your army die in a blik of a eye			",41,2,0,14,3,0,7

												This game kind of sucks, it has so much potential but it just falls short. The gameplay/combat resembles the lord of the rings strategy game but with a million years more waiting and ""crowns"" which you slowly generate through battles or you can just go pay to win and purchase them with real money, the coop is kind of pathetic with only certain missions being able to be cooped and you have to have similar armies and be in same region so if you want to be different races you will have to do lots of walking and waiting to coop, you cant see other players only your own city so the whole world map seemed pointless to me. The game is pretty laggy in pvp and coop, i know the company has been trying hard to reduce it but i bought this game back when it was first released as dawn of fantasy a few years ago and it has yet to be improved. This game doesnt have to many hackers but there are a few who ive had the displeasure of battling. This game is very slow if they got rid of the crowns it would be better but i guess they have to earn money since this game failed when it wasnt free to play. Graphics are pretty good in this game but there are a few bugs such as walls not touching ends of cliffs properly so when people attack you they can just walk between the gap rather than haveing to actually attack the walls or gate and units sometimes have issues staying in groups when you put them on the walls or towers not to mention they sometimes dont shoot inside of the base from the outside walls when units swarm in. Overall this game does lack quite alot but if you want to win pvp just buy a whole lot of crown units they will overpower the average units in any battle even if you are completely outnumber crown units will be able to get you an easy win, they definatly do need nerfed but as long as people keep spending real money to get them im sure they will stick around for a while. definatly do not play this if you are looking for a good coop game, this sucks and should just be considered a mmo at best. Game had so much potential am kind of disappointed but am looking forward to the new game they are making and hopefully they will fix all the issues with that one which they never did in this game.

It takes a century to build stockades around your base and there are always hordes of 1,000,000,000,000,000 enemies show up at your gate ready to rip your intestines out.                                     10\10 would rage quit again.and again. and again.

Build walls, defend sieges with 10k+ players. COOP sieges and PvE and PvP whenever you want. Well worth 15 bucks. It is in alpha with bugs but it is normal :)			",50,3,0,4,10,0,13

												Not sure how my last review was deleted but I'll post again. :o) This is a pretty good game but you have to be aware of a couple things. First and foremost, the developer has shifted focus to their next game, ""Kingdom Wars 2: Battles"" so you jumping on a ship everyone is getting off of. Secondly, this developer has in the past done complete wipes IN RELEASE state! That was when I quit.As for the game itself, it is definitely worth a play but realize you can't really play with friends like you would think for a multi-player game. The process is very convoluted, and buggy from my experience. The part that stands out is your ability to have a persistent home city you can come back to to get resources and defend from invaders. Which brings me to my next point, you can be attacked any time including while you are away. If the AI didn't suck that might be fine lol.If you are looking for something free and entertaining by all means give it a go but go into it with the above expectations and understanding. All in all, I can't recommend this game when there are better ones out there.  ",48,4,0,8,0,0,6

												Given the different behavior of the game at each connection, one wonders if the preferred method of the developers is not to copy and paste entire sections of code without really knowing what they are doing !!! A strategy game where nothing is predictable !!! * Units lose health or disappear without reasons. * The walls and buildings deteriorate without reason * In your inventory, resources disappear or fluctuate without reasons -   There may be expenses for maintenance of the city, but not equivalent to a life cycle of a mine stone,  in just 30MN.* Mines are recovering at different speeds (from a connection session to another)* In PVP, friends or enemy units may have the same colors (a stupid choice)* More, the NPC and players can have the same color !!* Use the mouse to select  something is arduousBecause the automatic reset not working on the forum, I asked the  KW support. Here is their amazing response : ""we will reset your forum password, and contact you in a day or two"". Many players animate and participate in forums games,  so they have an idea of how they work. It should not take more than five minutes to change the information in the user management interface. 2 days and 4 even if I consider the date of my first email is not credible.Do you have had problems with your mouse or the keyboard keys since the installation of the game? Valve should have some security requirements : Valve responsibility can be clearly commit if it turns out they distribute rogue software on their plate-form. Online games may have  become a method of money  laundering for all  maffias of the world. Valve tell us if you contribute to that !!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorry I just can't write a good review for this game. Kingdom Wars could be a great game, BUT, The devs refuse to part with wizards that can wipe out whope amies with one spell. Until the devs get rid of the wizards OR make the wizards only able to cover a very small area instead of 1/4 of the screen with their spells. this is NOT a fun game to play.  Wizards were always more of a healer than a battle unit, and even as a battle unit they are only able to attack one unit at a time, NOT half a battle field. No Wizard, even Morgana or Merlin ever had that much accumulated manna stored up to cast that kind of magic and had to reserve their mana and use it in small amounts as if you deplete your mana, you have a good chance of dying, unable to defend yourself from other on the battle field or even from disease. The wizards in this game do not even have to use their mana to keep a field around themselve to stop or deflect damage, but instead are just higher in kill points and life points as you level them up. I founf NO limit to how high you can level a wizard up. UNTIL they get rid of or change wizards to conform within reality like the other troops in this game I will recommend that no one purchase this game.			",15,4,0,4,12,0,4

												Super mittelalterliches spiel.realistische belagerung und gute schlachten ein gutes spiel für jeden der mittelalterliche spiele mag.I must change my review... because it was a good game but well the dev desided the units there to strong so he nerfed theam (extrem) nerfed healing alot and nerfed the skill points extrem. the dragon fire killed back in time every unit with 1 fire ball now it makes absolutly no dmg (the nerf is so overdone)he even higherd the space 1 unit take in a army so you can have 60 units in a army but my army from years ago are now 80/60 size and i can't move theam or do something with theam and the mods or devs just tell me: "" delet some units"" ok thanks... and thats not even the worst thing.the worst thing is that you had to buy the game before it was f2p and all what the players who bought the game for 20€ got was a premium account for only 30 days their towns that they already played (so just what they achived already in game) and some cosmetic crap. by the update he even removed the marked where you could buy heroes and special units for crowns. instead of this you now have to build a house that costs crowns (and the space for houses is limited and you already have to less space and now you need to build this first that you can just buy 1 or 2 units from 1 of these houses).the prices were higherd for the units too and all crowns you had over 1000 where deleted. (thanks they stole me about 500 crowns) to gain crowns you have to pay money, siege enemy cities or do pvp. I should even mention that where is no way to buy pvp protection anymore. so you HAVE to do pvp cause you can't buy protection anymore. the majority of players who bought the game stoped playing the game long time ago and are just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause of all the crap the developers done. it was a awesome game long time ago but sorry he just patched crap in the game. i shouldn't say something about the bugs or extrem laggs all the time. and look at the trailer it has naval in it. but he never worked on naval he made crap instead and even removed the town where you could just get to with ships			",85,14,1,3,21,2,21

												Got it for 5 dollars so for that price it is worth it.  Graphics are decent, gameplay is standard, nothing shines.  Took me a while to debate on a positive or negative review and the ONLY thing making me give it positive is the $5.00 USD price.  Any more and dont waste your money its still heavily bugged.  I cannot create a online account when I try it says, ""The username and password cannot be blank (wasn't) and you can only use letters and numbers (did.""  When you click on buildings it plays some stupid melody that dosent fit the game, the guides are junk, audio keeps messing up on load screens, etc, etc, etc.  Good for $5.00 any more keep on lookin!

												The game is a true scam, the graphics are terrible, the game is original but in fact this game is all but playable, i've played it only because it had a good storyline and because i had to spend my time through the days. The game generally needs loads of improvement and fixing, as the many crashes, bugs and lag prevent me from actually having fun playing it. Also i cannot believe that all those companies liked this game 10/10 (watch the trailer and you will see the many recommendations which in my opinion cannot be true). The money they receive from the people buying their games, is not spent into the game itself but surely into other things.I do not recommend this game and i would certainly not mind if gaben banned this game from steam if he could.

												The game is awesome and really hits the spot when it comes to solid RTS mechanics.Bugriddled but confident enough to sell ingame currency. I didn't pay for anything but I don't understand how the developers would expect anyone to. That being said, the game is anything but pay to win and it's not very difficult to get crowns (the currency you can purchase). Everything about the game is conceptually well designed and executed, playing can be alot of fun if it weren't for some issues.If you enjoy constant crashes and losing hours/days of progress and frustration is your cup of tea, then you absolutely must download this game. Armies stuck on Mountains, Special units bugging out your whole army and forcing you to disband them completely, user interface glitches, connection errors, desync in pvp, general unresponsiveness of units to the point of ignoring your commands completely, pathfinding issues.. I could go on and on. It's a waste of time if every aspect of the game is filled with frustation. The game has crashed more often than I've been able to exit properly.The developers offer support in the form of reimbursement of losses if you contact them per e-mail, but I honestly would have to write one every day, that's just not the kind of game I want to play. I couldn't begin to count the amount of posts I've read from devs saying they would or had fixed the exact problems I'm running into. They either don't have the time, because of their newest release, are incapable, or uninterested in fixing the issues. That seems dishonest to me.I'm kind of angry, so you might still want to check out the game regardless of what I've written.			",90,1,1,8,9,0,12

												Its free to play so why not? The thing is when watching the trialer videos and pics of the game i got really into it and couldnt wait to download and play! but over a few minutes of playing i started to fill disingaged with the game..=( This is because the voice acting is just poorly done no effort into it, the combat is poorly done. Like when a horde of idk golbins come an you send some of your men to fight them it ends up looking like i hocked a bloody lugy on my pc screen.. An all that time i spent trying to tatically set my troops in formation starts to fill pointless cause there all going to end up packed into one which can leave room for an easy flank. One more things bugs! uh im not sure you call this a bug or poor timing but there my hero was talking to this guy about a guest next thing i know i see is a big♥♥♥♥♥oger that comes out of no where  an starts killing people an messing everything up an i couldnt get out of the diolog that my charater was having with this man and i couldnt get through the diolog because it was messing up an kept repeating the same doilog but lucking my men where in enough distance to auto lock on the emeny an they succefully slain the beast but i had to go to task manger an end the game bc i was still stuck on the same diolog repeating itself.. if they would fix the combat and all the bugs they can it be a outstanding game. but still deserves a thumbs up all the things that make agood game are there just needs some polishing up. i guess u could call this a review a poor one. but give it a try i only but 1.5 hrs into an going to add more but thanks for reading an sorry for bad spelling.

												I could sit here and tell you it's a great game, and it's worth the money, and you are missing out if any one says otherwise...As a veteran of this game I can truly say out of many RTS games that go from online to single player. That Kingdom Wars has been the only game to catch my interest in years.There is much to do, and yet so much to acomplish. The land is full of ripe adventure you just need to discover it.                                                     This can be some what of a spoiler, but proves my point.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I favor the orcish hordes. With being a Warleader of Orcs who will call you Grr Mada meaning great warrior in orcish. I can tell you that every race has a great and mostly unique way of making you feel like a powerful ruler, if not peaceful savior. The orcs take what they can get rather it be meat from an animal, ogre, or human alike. The elves protect their lands from taint, and brutality. They respect their land and give back. The humans prove their worth with noble tasks. Either by protecting the weak, or just simply fighting with inspiration courage.  ",93,3,0,24,5,1,9

												Got it for 5 dollars so for that price it is worth it.  Graphics are decent, gameplay is standard, nothing shines.  Took me a while to debate on a positive or negative review and the ONLY thing making me give it positive is the $5.00 USD price.  Any more and dont waste your money its still heavily bugged.  I cannot create a online account when I try it says, ""The username and password cannot be blank (wasn't) and you can only use letters and numbers (did.""  When you click on buildings it plays some stupid melody that dosent fit the game, the guides are junk, audio keeps messing up on load screens, etc, etc, etc.  Good for $5.00 any more keep on lookin!

												The game is awesome and really hits the spot when it comes to solid RTS mechanics.Bugriddled but confident enough to sell ingame currency. I didn't pay for anything but I don't understand how the developers would expect anyone to. That being said, the game is anything but pay to win and it's not very difficult to get crowns (the currency you can purchase). Everything about the game is conceptually well designed and executed, playing can be alot of fun if it weren't for some issues.If you enjoy constant crashes and losing hours/days of progress and frustration is your cup of tea, then you absolutely must download this game. Armies stuck on Mountains, Special units bugging out your whole army and forcing you to disband them completely, user interface glitches, connection errors, desync in pvp, general unresponsiveness of units to the point of ignoring your commands completely, pathfinding issues.. I could go on and on. It's a waste of time if every aspect of the game is filled with frustation. The game has crashed more often than I've been able to exit properly.The developers offer support in the form of reimbursement of losses if you contact them per e-mail, but I honestly would have to write one every day, that's just not the kind of game I want to play. I couldn't begin to count the amount of posts I've read from devs saying they would or had fixed the exact problems I'm running into. They either don't have the time, because of their newest release, are incapable, or uninterested in fixing the issues. That seems dishonest to me.I'm kind of angry, so you might still want to check out the game regardless of what I've written.			",90,1,1,8,9,0,12

												Buy this game!If you are a fan of RTS games, as well as a fan of games that allow you to continue an online progression over a long period of time, this is the game for you!  Build up a city:  3 different ways of doing this based on your raceUpgrade that city:  No cosmetic upgrades but the buildings will perform better as you put more resources in to themBuild an Army:  3 distinct ways of doing this, with the ability to hire units from other racesSIEGE a city:  Like never before in a game, tear down a cities defenses brick by brick and funnel your forces in to storm their castle, fly powerful dragons over the walls while your siege weapons lay waste and make your opponent tremble in PVP or PVE battlesDefend YOUR city:  PvP from within the safetey of your city, watch as armies smash like water dropplets off your mighty walls as your archers rain fiery arrows down own their undefended heads, setting the ground around them ablaze forcing them to scatter!)Send Trade Caravans:  Build a city that generates more resources than you ever need?  Send caravans to every corner of the world and make allies to trade with so that you can recruit and train units, or just to earn extra gold for your goods to spend on upgrading your units or for crowns to buy powerful dragons/elite units/ Dwarven helpers and more!Everything you could possibly want in an RTS has been crammed into this title.  It IS being done by an indy company so game updates come a bit slow compared to some other games, but it does not ask you to keep paying around every corner to be able to enjoy your purchase as so many games with cash shops do. ***CASH SHOP CLARIFICATION*** You should really read this.This game has 'Crowns'.  Crowns are earned through questing, completing achievements, through pvp, you can buy them with gold, they can be given to you by your guild treasurer, for refering a friend or yes, you CAN purchase them.   I have owned this game for 1 month and I have 700 crowns and NO need to spend them on anything ever again and I've only spent the initial purchase price for this game.  THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN.  I have never paid a dime past the purchase price and I currently own 8 level 40 dragons and 6 elite units ALL earned from questing/pvpThis is the definition of pay-to-save-time.  Everyone is on an even playingfield here.  The cash shop is ONLY there as an option to provide extra support to the project while allowing yourself to get these units/walls/upgrades without putting in the minimal effort needed to otherwise do so.Some of the Cons:  (Sorry indie game, all games got em and nobody is paying me to say otherwise :p)Graphics:  Dated, to say the least.  While the assets on the map and the cities look great, the up close graphics of the units are OLD.  They look like Dungeon siege 2 units.   That said, just look at the screenshots, what are you doing so zoomed in to be staring at one unit for ANYWAY?   Well, cause a good portion of the game is talking and you are forced to see this.  Otherwise you'd never really notice it.Pathfinding:  This is currently not great.  You tell units to go to a place and most of them will fairly quickly after, but it definitely leaves a lot to be desired.  That said, the free expansion coming out this month is called the 'Arcana and Pathfinding' update.  So yeah.Glitches:  Every game has it's issues... this one has troubles with finding coop groups if you have attack protection on, units will get stuck in places they shouldn't be allowed to even go, you might have an instance where a resource vanishes after pvping.   That said, the staff is very quick and courteous to get back to you.  It might take a couple days to line everything up, but they are great at communication as long as you use the proper channels.No you?! Currently the games biggest flaw... Where are you?   We need more players to join in the fun!			",140,10,0,22,15,0,19

												the game is getting old now at least 3 years old and graphics seem much older than thatbut not a major factor to meimported from the standalone client played a LOT therehard to give a great review atm, the game is crasihng constantly for me in co op and pvpthe game is great fun when running right the best  mmorts ive playedget to level up uints and asign points where you want them so can have tank dps or jack of trades all in the same unit type if you wantednot  even a hint of pay to win, crowns(which can be purchased in tiny ammounts as  one offs) dont win you pvps herebut are good to slghtly speed the game uppvp is as fair as it can be, same sized armies fight so cant get wiped out by adavnced players with massive armies if you dont have same sized armycity buld is very secondary to the game predefined build areas for 2 of the races. with orcs getting more free buld elements, walls for all three races are predefeined thoughthe tech tree is non exisitant, not even a tech twig really so no option to research long term tech like archery lvl1 to 20 or anything just some basic upgrades IF they could ever sort the lag in co op and pvp and  game crashes and some more minor bugs this would be in my top 10 games as it is with  the lag bugs and crashes i couldnt recomend ita close call, game is a few steps from real sucess but seems to find ways to shoot itself in the foot when it gets  too close to that			",1,0,0,3,2,0,1

												The issue is that Dawn of Fantasy is not a good MMORTS. For most computers you are going to be playing on low and still experience mind numbing lag from the tiniest seige battles at the beggining of the game. Resource gathering has nothing to it, nor do things like skill. Tech tree is tiny, you will have built everything by hour three and thus has every unit for your faction. Then lets go to the combat. Every unit you create at home has a level up system, which much be activated manually for each of the 30-40 units you feild. Thats right, before every battle you have to individually level up every single unit. I was playing orcs, and this got boring by the time I had a screen full of goblins. Kingdom wars is not a good game, and Reverie is under the impression if they keep adding tiny packs of content to the game it's suddenly going to fix every problem in their games code; or better yet suddenly turn their game into a strategy title. You won't experience multiplayer, nobody plays.			",307,39,5,54,54,2,120

												If you're looking for an actual RTS or base-building strategy game there are plenty of other options that are more fun.  This game is awful.Visuals: 2/10 - A lot of fluff screenshots, the actual aesthetic of the game is very poorGameplay 2/10 - Nothing original that you can't get from a better game that's been made in the past 30 years.User Interface: 0/10 - Up there with the makers of Cossacks in creating some of the worst RTS user-interface.Customer Service: 0/10 - ""Error inputting premium code"" No response or help from the company that made the game after I bought the game and now it is free to play.

												Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free game to be honest, I've played other free games on here and Ive never been so disgusted by this game. Poor unit support, poor unit placement support, poor unit feedback support the game is just so shtty overall. I dont mind paying a buck or two or even $10 for a game that actually works MOST of the time rather than half the time. This game isn't really ""free"" and they say it isn't pay to win but that isn't really the case. This game in fact is CLEARLY A PAY 2 WIN because you can buy the ingame currency(crowns) for cash and enhance your army/city way faster than a freebie player would. Honestly don't play this game, this is coming from an avid RTS gamer and sadly there aren't many great free RTS games here on steam. Full of bugs too, it's really annoying. KW 2 is coming out so the devs won't have time to fix this sht. So if you actually waste time and money on this game I feel sorry for you. Do yourself a favour and save some valuable time and money. Don't play this horse sht.			",4,0,0,1,0,0,3

												You have to pay money to unlock core aspects of the game, including the actual Campaign and Skirmish modes. Now, I have no problem with DLC, or even microtransactions, as long as you're getting something ADDITIONAL to an otherwise well-featured game. But this is just penny-pinching here. They've clearly stripped several aspects of the game away, and then forced you to pay to unlock core features.This is basically the PC equivalent of ""on-disc DLC.""			",680,245,33,120,50,8,108

Poor unit support, poor unit placement support, poor unit feedback support the game is just so shtty overall. I dont mind paying a buck or two or even $10 for a game that actually works MOST of the time rather than half the time. This game isn't really ""free"" and they say it isn't pay to win but that isn't really the case. This game in fact is CLEARLY A PAY 2 WIN because you can buy the ingame currency(crowns) for cash and enhance your army/city way faster than a freebie player would. Honestly don't play this game, this is coming from an avid RTS gamer and sadly there aren't many great free RTS games here on steam. Full of bugs too, it's really annoying. KW 2 is coming out so the devs won't have time to fix this sht. So if you actually waste time and money on this game I feel sorry for you. Do yourself a favour and save some valuable time and money. Don't play this horse sht.			",4,0,0,1,0,0,3

												Well....i like town building - war mongering games. From basic ones like Travian, to complex ones like Dawn of Fantasy , Clash of Clans and else.Dawn of Fantasy is a good game, but i am skeptical to say its worthwhile.three points kill this game : First : Combat is stupid and bad...its frustrating to play, units are dumb, combat is slow, you need no strategy most of times...its plain, dull and boring.2- Pay2Win, crowns when i first saw them and got them from missions made me happy, then i realized that most things need crowns and even if you keep repeating boring missions or pvp you will never have enough.3-Low building diversity, your castle is pretty, you have like 20 slots to build in each area..and  like 8 buildings...its odd, seems like its a broken system, i cant explain.So...if you compare the gameplay of travian or clash of clans, this game is horrible....its just has some cool graphics, pretty town and world map....overall i would give a ...well, sorry a 4 of 10.

												Nothing quite works right. resources say a certain ammount per minute they do not acumulate as said. armys that should win in a pvp match get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with higher point strength army and even  role advantages and upgrades still loose in pvp matches. and no its not because of player skill level either.boring grind for crowns the same missions over and over and over again. or buy.. thanks though at least its not punch in your face buy to win.Heros are over powered. one can kill entire armys.games is geared for pvp not my thing. its not the games fault for that. there is no real point in playing the game.games are really going down hill these days... they should be getting better.glad i didnt spend a dime on this game.Maybe when they roll out V1.2 i might change my review.

												I am not impressed by this game. Perhaps eventually it will evolve into something worth playing. At the moment it is too easy and too forgiving upon making a mistake.			",33,0,1,4,8,0,10

												Edit: Changing this review to negative. They updated there game and it wiped my city, admins said theres nothing they can do about it and i should be happy i got a free fully upgraded city when the whole game revolves around you BUILDING the city.PvP and Co-op is horribly laggy and litterally is 2 steps forward and one back, and soldiers dont listen to any order you give them and just wander off on there own.I can forgive strange bugs, resource glitches, men literally walking in the air, units being hit through walls, bad hit detection but wiping my city i spent over 70 hours on, and telling me theres nothing they can do is unforgivable.

""The Great Nerfing"". It started out like any other day, i hopped on and logged into my kingdom ""Hitlers work camps"", to notice work camps had been nerfed... later i found out that you could no longer sell units for money as in slaves and workers, then i found that crowns had been made even more rare, the one currency that makes this online world go round, all in the space of 3 days. i present to you, the GOTY, nerfsville. The devs should fix the bugs and rework the game before they start nerfing all of our tactics. Oh! i forgot to mention, all the large towns and villages you see on the title screen? they aren't player created. those are npc towns that they will most likely make you fight and destroy if you want to progress in the game. yep! your gonna fight that large wall with archers and catapults lining its top, with a little less then a catapult or two and some knights. good luck and dont win.

												I really want to like this game.Great pvp setupCo-op Sieges are the bees kneesdoes NOT feel like a 'pay-to-win'I found the base-building enjoyableBalanced tech tree / costsI have just ran into too many issues that leave me more frustrated than satisfied. Formations don't saveStandground doesn't always make units stand ground.I can't assign troops to Ctrl+[7-9]units stack infinitelyunbalanced unitsSo I end up loving the game until battles start getting intense and it becomes an uphill fight just to manage the army from running off after one unbalanced unit as it just casually walks past all my frontline to archers/siege-equipment. Feels pointless to worry about actual tactics the way the units can stack (just put tanks on top of pikes on top of healers on top of dps etc). Also found that reinforcements on a 'very-easy' level to be equal in challenge to a 'hard' level so that was also very off-putting. I can't expect this game's mechanics to play fair and thus cannot reccomend this to the public.			",125,30,0,29,22,3,30

I've got normal win7x64 system, almost everything runs fine here. Not gonna touch this one more time, deleting KW2 from my wishlist for good.Развод гхалимый. Полна глюков как кетаминовый приход с самого начального экрана - не смог ввести свое имя в приветственное окошко за час битья башкой (проверил целостность файлов 3 раза, мышиный курсор появился, но текстовая строка так и не заработала). У меня нормальная система вин7х64, почти все отлично идет. Больше к этому не притронусь, удаляю вторую часть игры из списка желаемого навсегда.			",1430,574,54,157,159,19,229

												Unplayable, the mouse is frozen on the menu screen.  Looking over the forums, the solutions range from reinstalling the OS, to reinstalling mouse drivers, or some mice work and others dont.  Ugh, when every other game almost on PC works with a  mouse and this game doesnt.  Its the game thats broken not the user's computer.  Who knows if this game is any good?  Who cares anyways, if the dev couldnt be bothered to even make a mouse work, it kinda says alot about the rest of the game.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			",2655,1122,101,267,367,29,398

												This game looks awesome in the pictures but when you get into the game and try to play it, it's really bad. The graphics and play style are slow don't work like they should.

												Played this game a while ago because it promised a lot of things... and it didn't deliver on those promises.  I could sit here and type out a really long review, but I'm just not motivated to do so.  The game was just so uninteresting and just so time-consuming that I hated it.  The pay-to-win design takes away any sense of accomplishment and ruins the competitive nature of the strategy component.  What's worse is that the game tries to be an MMOG in all the wrong ways.  The expansions make no sense at all and should really just be considered game updates instead, but the devs behind this game do not seem to have common sense.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												To all who plan on playing this as a fun strategy game, I highly discourage it. I purchased this game about a year ago and the game had a great idea and setup to it. problem is, I paid $20 for this game so I exspect the full version. I came to find out that literally everything you do from building to upgrading cost acutal money. PLUS, in the latest update they introduced ""premium gaming"". Now you have to pay more money in order to get the full game. Unless you have hundreds of dollars to throw away at a, at most, decent game, go look for a different game to buy. A game that doesn't cost money upfront also money later on.			",65,3,0,8,5,0,8

At the moment the multiplayer function is not even working, it says 'Connection timed out', I assume this is because their servers are overwhelmed as it's Steam's deal of the day and on sale for 75% off.

												Edit: Issue fixed, I'll have to give it a try some time soon.The game would probably be good if resource gathering early on wasn't so slow. Progressing is as slow as the pace of the game - it's not really a RTS when you have to wait so long on upgrades and things.Even though it is a MMO, it keeps you waiting too long; why not allow everyone to progress faster?However, if you have the time to spare and enjoy slow paced games, then go ahead and try it.

												This game could be good.. it COULD be, instead it highly sucks for few reasons:1. There is no unit collision, you don't understand anything in battles and you can't even defend walls cause there's no unit collision, we're in 2014 ffs.2. Graphics really sucks. I am not a guy who looks at graphics, but in this game you can't even set the resolution, there's no antialiasing, shadows keep moving, models and textures are fine instead.3. You can't place buildings/walls where you want, there are ""pre-made places"" where you can choose what to build, and in an ""RTS"" this sucks really hard.4. MOST IMPORTANT... You have to wait DAYS to get some resources, and yes REAL DAYS. Look, I just went to fight the army of a bot cause of a quest, my men all died, and to make the army again I should wait real days. If you get like 25 units of paesants to cut wood at the same time, in an entire day it will give you 5000 wood more or less, and you spend it all in 10 seconds. Same for food and gold. Making the army requires food and gold, and it's really really really slow.5. Formations... I would like to ""customize"" more the formations of the units, like in a Total War game, I really don't like it how it is now.. and by the way, without collisions and stuff, battles are just a massive charge and the more outnumbered wins...I won't play this game anymore untill the developers improve these points, I had literally no fun playing this game, I don't want to wait days to get some resources, and I really don't like those other bad points I listed.This game could have potential, I hope the devs start fixing at least these 5 points.

												Not pay to win, but it is pay to play. To research almost anything you need Crowns, Wealth, or Influence, synonyms for Premium Currency. You gain this by doing quests, but you gain 1-2 per quest. You can gain them through PVP or PVE, but you get 1-2 per quest. To build walls around your town you need 32 Crowns. Increasing worker speed? 8 Crowns. It's not worth the grinding, and the grinding is required. I'd rather they just stick a price-tag on it and let me build my walls in peace.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Take stronghold add huge amount of waiting from browser games like travian and you get this... the game could be fun if they could fix all bugs and give player UI that would actually work and give you some info on whats going on on the screen... for pretty much everything in the game you need currency called crowns (earlier it was cash shop currency but thank god P2W got removed). You need to buy crowns for 3k gold each or earn them from quests or fighting online with your armies or cities but the amount of crowns you need just to build walls is ridicullous and when you actually build them your attack protection will start to count down and then you become someones farm... income bar is bugged as hell and its critical problem when you try to play elves bcs they get everything from income... not even gonna start on units AI its pathfinding is fine but the rest is terible. The game is kinda fun but sometimes it feels like pretty much everithing in the game is working agains player and so my thumb is down at least for now if your looking for RTS just run away.

												The game sounds intriguing and when you first start it's kind of ""cool"". Very very mind numblingly slow RTS after the first 3 or 4 hours. Resources are gathered by the minute, which is ok when you're just starting out and it's .1 of anything. The starting quests get you built up fairly quickly, but the regular game play does not transition well. Kind of like giving a kid a bunch of money and expecting him to be able to budget properly later.AI is very simple, and there are some core things missing from this to really call it a ""strategy"" game.pros:Set it and forget it farming (offline resource gathering)Each unit is actually a squad.Semi-persistent worldYou don't notice when units die because there's a pile of corpses everywhere and the victor can make get some loot. (you were the victor right?)Problems:No attack queueing (can't tell units to attack more than one target)Units who are told to attack, move to the target units position and will run right passed the oncoming hoard to reach their ""destination"" which usually ends as being a corpse.Unit control is next to non existent, often with some sort of resource allocation group there's a couple of government workers just standing around.No real strategy to speak of, unit placements and formations are abominable at bestHuge collision problems, with units and other items. (elf hero can run through great trees but gets stuck in a berry bush...)Unit designation (alt+#) does not persist when you go from world map to local map (even if units never left the field)Seemingly random unit selection as commander when selecting large amounts of units instead of the hero.There's no real benefit to having a hero. They are squishy, always the target, and often gets lost on the fieldThere's no hotkeys to speak of for unit skills, have to select each unit type at a time to make use of what skills are available anyway			",71,39,1,26,5,2,20
