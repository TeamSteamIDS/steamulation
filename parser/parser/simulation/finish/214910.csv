												I adquired this game with the last humble bundle for a few dollars. According to that, I think it was a good deal taking into account how much I expended.The game itself has beautiful graphics and if you like WWII aircraft, you´re going to enjoy the views. On the other hand, controls can be a little bit hard to get even if you have a gamepad (I strongly recommend trying different settings at the realism part of the game settings window) and after some missions, it gets kind of repititive.In summary, not a good buy for 20$, but a reasonably good one for 5$ or less. I would rate it with a 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wouldn't consider this a simulator if I was at gunpoint.  The flight mechanics are... rough to say the least.  The keyboard mapping is almost absent from what I can tell.  Flying by mouse, there are maybe five or so keys including a second primary fire button... just in case your left click breaks.  Taking off from a carrier I found myself rocketed abruptly upwards by some mystical force halfway across the deck and then when landing stopped about as abruptly as hitting a brick wall.  The voice acting in the campaign felt a bit forced and was empty of depth or feeling (especially in the Japanese campaign) and didn't really contribute anything to a storyline.  The missions are extremely repetetive as well (bomb a target, switch planes, bomb said target again).On the better side, the game did have some pretty cool explosions and the planes burning out of the sky were as asthetically pleasing as it gets.  Bullet and cannon impacts in both soil and water are pretty well mimmicked although the auto aim defeats the whole purpose of WWII dogfighting.  Ships will sink if they are destroyed, which is nice, although I found it odd that the USS Arizona was capsized by torpedos and fully submerged in shallow water in about one full minute...All in all I'd say this game is worth 3 out of 10 stars.  Would not ever recommend this to anyone looking for a ""flight sim"" despite what any of the trailers or pictures make it out to be.			",111,11,1,18,23,0,41

												{This is the second version of the review. The first one was published in Dec. of 2013}OK, my first experience with this game wasn't good - the game just crashed every few minutes, making it unplayable.Now, more than year later I decided to give it a chance launch it again - and it's a miracle! - it worked! It still crashes occasionally, but it's pretty playable now.But I'll stand on what I've said before. This is very different game compared to previous parts. Difficulty had been pumped up - even on easy level with arcade control mode it still very challenging. Developers decided to remove infinite ammo, and the planes are getting damaged faster. Switching between them is weird and uncomfortable. Even rosters editing is very complicated.But the main problem of this game - you don't get the feeling of the battle. The ships are just occasionally shooting the sky, enemy fighters very rarely engage you in a dogfight. And your own plane is moving like it has some sort of ""car speed limiter"" option turned on, and whether you're gaining speed or slowing it down - it doesn't matter, it will feel the same.The pro's would be huge amount of missions on two campaigns - but that's a pro for those who'll like this game. Nice graphics. Also, the game mostly stays true to history books - if some particular ship had sunk in WWII, it will sunk in this game too, no matter what you'll do to protect it.My advice - buy ""Secret Wars"". It's much more entertaining.			",317,59,13,18,21,2,38

												Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is an arcade flying game set in the Pacific Theater of second world war between the Imperial Japanese Navy and United States Navy.Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers gameplay is quite simple and arcadish. Like the name suggest, your plane mostly start from an aircraft carrier before flying into combat, and your main missions all the time is to protect your carrier from enemy attack while doing mission assigned to you in the same time. As the American Navy you will relive the story of the legendary USS Enterprise, the last surviving American aircraft carrier in the pacific.The graphics of Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is quite good. The water shader are incredibly beautiful, and since the game are mostly naval sea battles/carrier battles, it makes the game so epic. The planes and ships models are also beautiful and realistic.Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is another good arcade game. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			",1158,351,58,143,167,12,228

												Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is an interesting take on the Pacific War, with the Japanese campaign especially bringing a more human element to the story. As a history buff, especially concerning the war in the Pacific, this game has piqued my interest for some time. However, there are several historical inaccuracies, and gameplay becomes repetitive after the fifth hour or so. I have encountered multiple graphical bugs, and a game crash at the end of the final Japanese mission. If you can get this game for five dollars or less, and you love flight simulators or World War 2 flight games, then by all means go ahead and pick it up. But if you want a game that truly shines when showing naval and aerial warfare in the Pacific Theater, check out the Battlestations duology. Otherwise, stay clear of this noble but poorly executed attempt to recreate the War in the Pacific.			",25,1,0,1,4,0,6

												Good game all round despite things. Yes there are some crashes. Menu bugs that prevent you from going forward. Stuck missions - especially the ones where a certain ship is scripted to survive according to history making it really frustrating for the player that just 'accidentally' had 10 torpedo runs on the ship and every torpedo was a dud. I suppose miracles do happen on the pacific. War is hell. Graphics are gorgeous, story is pretty decent. Especially JPN campaign that is told by the daughter of the XO. Game strikes a pretty decent balance between arcade and sim and end result could be best described as satisfying enough.  Flight stick is recommended.			",776,311,45,87,97,7,148

												A complete piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥  Arcade battle forces Z axis to the X axis and you cannot roll or yaw correctly.  The game hitches graphically when in 3rd person view but no other view.  The air model is so ""floaty""  you get sea sick playing it. I seriously wanted to like this game... and spent over 2 hours TRYING to make anything and everything work but it was useless.  I even tried to contract the developer AND even the lead programmer himself and they refuse any help at all.  It looks pretty in pictures... and plays so so.. but you will either have game stopping crashes, control issues where you cannot fly the plane (like a plane should fly) or just frustrating missions where the damage models are way off.  I wasted $9 on this piece of pretty crap and of course cannot get a refund.  Air Combat Secret Wars was fun... and I was hoping this was much better... looks MUCH better... plays MUCH worse.  Buyer beware...  Sad that this has SO much potential but is nothing but pretty junk software!  >:(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I say I don't reccomend this game I don't mean it fully, the game itself is really fun and the historical battles are all nice with I would say fairly decent graphics, but the let down is the oversights that the developer made, alot of the times you would end up searching up for ways to complete missions, and mission tasks alot of the time arent really that clear. There's also few bugs here and there but the game itself isn't too bugged to hinder enjoyabilty, sure sometimes the oversights are frustrating, but overall it has alot of potential and quite a decent game, you just need to decied whether it's worth the money			",45,1,3,2,8,1,5

												There should be an option to select ""I sort of recommend"" this game.  As there isn't I have to select Not recommended.It's an ok game, it plays well with  a joystick, I don't recommend mouse and keyboard, it's possible but not much fun.  To start with, this is not a sim as in people who play flight sims would possibly call one.  If you go in thinking you are going to play a WW II sim then you are going to be disappointed.  The reason I can't recommend this game is due to the game breaking bugs.   For example I have just uninstalled this game as I got to a point where I could not proceed any further for which I percieve as a bug.  I had to ram an enemy bomber, it just wasn't possible to get anywhere near it.  I am full throttle, full speed in a straight line and the mission fails before I can get close to the enemy. There is nothing else I can do, unless there is a hidden nitro button I am missing. I have started an new profile and even re-installed the game but the same mission fails.It's very annoying as I wanted to see out the rest of the game.The first game of the series is great and I do recommend that.  I haven't played Vietnam yet but I will next.			",282,114,40,22,26,7,28

												Good: Nicely controllable planes(you can use controllers, mouse or keyboard). Decent graphics, nice looking sea. Lots of action.Bad: Some missions are boring. For example some patrol missions, where you have to wait like 4 minutes until you can spot enemy planes. Somekind of weird bugs don't let me start the mission, where I have to attack Japan. I pressed 5 times ""continue"" in a row and then it crashed. There are only a few types of planes.If you like shoot-around games then this game might be ok for you(or maybe not if you encounter those weird game crashes like I did, my system is up to date, including drivers).Windows 7 64, AMD 7870 2GB, latest drivers			",35,0,0,4,5,0,2

												No. Just no. Don't waste your money.I was interested in seeing how historically accurate this game was, but couldn't get past the poor gameplay. According to other reviewers, it wasn't much. From the little bit I've seen of the game, it had a fairly simplistic view of the war and Japan. Quite honestly, it felt like the gang from Team America: World Police had a hand in the writing. I'd be intested in seeing the Japanese campaign, but the gameplay was much too boring - sometimes frustrating to actually bring myself to unlock it.The keyboard controls are fairly simple. Hold Shift: go faster; Hold Ctrl: go slower until your engines cut out and you start to stall (good luck dropping torpedoes because you'll stall before you can go slow enough to drop them); Hold no keys: speed remains somewhere between stall speed and max speed; Hold Tab: Target cam (bonus points if you can spot the problem with this default); WASD: various camera angles.If you're like me, you'll get bored once you figure out these basics and you'll be sitting with your head propped up on your arm trying not to fall asleep while you line up a shot with a slow moving bomber.The game breaks a cardinal rule concerning the tutorial level. ""The player cannot fail"". If a player fails at any portion of the training level, he/she will have to play all the way through it again. At best, if a failure occurs, the game should commence from a checkpoint that's fairly close or the scenario should be designed in such a way that the player cannot fail easily. Instead, you can quite easily find yourself in a progression break where the only option is to suicide.This game is developed and designed like a budget title. I'd say this game is worth maybe a couple bucks. Don't buy it if it's any higher than that.			",111,16,0,18,14,0,28

												I have played Air Conflicts: Secret Wars and I have this game too, but somehow I just can't get into this game. Basically, this simulates the Pacific Carrier Wars between US Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy of WW2, where you pilot planes from either side on various missions featuring rather arcadish controls. Graphics are actually quite good, with multiple views: cockpit, follow-cam, or forward-no-cockpit. For planes with rear gunner, you can go there too. Planes suffer realistic damage when hit. Flak will put holes and ragged edges to your control surfaces and wings, plane will start to smoke, and so on. Ground detail is also quite good, with all the terrain features very visible, and structures easily seen. Sound is decent. The game gives you a ""play in a team"" feel by giving you several AI squadron mates. However, they don't seem to do anything. Instead, you can switch to them (swap planes) and fly them when your plane ran out of bombs or whatever. Then when you jump back out that pilot will fly back to carrier to rearm and come back out. However, the controls are horrible. I don't think it's my gamepad... which is a Xbox360 wireless only a few months old. I can't seem to stablize the plane to do the bomb or torpedo runs. The plane just bounce left/right/left/right as if my controls are lagging. After prolonged play all the planes want to nosedive (lost calibration). This doesn't seem to affect dogfighting much as planes are always going all over the place, but for stable bombing this is impossible. Furthermore, there's no explanation on bombing or torpedoing. Nothing in the manual. Missions are extremely long, as you are supposed to experience very bit of the battle. Instead of 3 different versions of battle from 3 different POVs, you will play all three... First you launch as fighters to sweep the sky of enemy planes, and bomb a few AA sites. Then you go in as dive bombers and take out structures and fuel farm. Then you play as torpedo bombers and torpedo 2 cargo ships just off the island. When bombing and torpedoing aren't working, frustration sets in. Somehow I just can't enjoy this game.  ",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Hey gyus,this pacific game is awesome. Let's start with the defects: a repetitive crash at the end of the final battle of the japan campain, after you won, and moreover a so difficult to complete final mission in ally campain, due to the smart time you have to play. This means in any case that I've finished both of them... So, a part those defects, the game is fully enjoyable even if you have never met a WW2 fly videogame. I played many years ago Il2Sturmovick gaining a bad feedback due to the huge difficulty of the game. Down here the sky is blu, the airplanes are easy to manouver and the zero get down like cards on poker tables. Of course there is a simulation mode that I skipped without any remorse. So I've travelled between the pacific wars looking to historical reproduction (I suppose) of what really happened in those years. You have to understand that if in a mission your carrier went destroyed in WW2, also here will be bombed until the end. What you play is a part in this scenario that try to transmit to you the suffering of the naval battles of the pacific.And it reaches that. So I can only suggest this game, in arcade mode (not in simulation), to anyone!Lord's Hol Napult's experience: 8/10Nice Shot!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting game, fun to play once you learn the controls, similar in some ways to the original air conflicts game but different in others, you can use three types of air planes, dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters, and in certain missions medium bombers, bombing can be difficult as you have have your wings level or your bombs may miss also you are in charge or an entire air wing of aircraft, and you can chage between planes, the missions are not historically accurate, for example the Enterprise was not able to launch an entire wing of fighters at Pearl Harbor, and the Arizona was hit by a bomb not a torpedo, also some of the missions crash the game for an unknown reason, meaning I am stuck on the Doolittle Raid on the American campaign  (Won the game on different profile)			",32,2,0,0,6,1,1

												First things first this is not a flight sim, it's an arcade game, a terrible terrible arcade game. That said as someone who plays flight sims I couldn't even keep these arcade planes in the air, try any kind of manuvure and you'll come out of it flopping towards the ground. You have no yaw controll and no throttle controll making dogfights impossible, combat is pretty much a case of drive by spray and prey auto aim. Really, you have to play it to see how bad it is, but please dont! I got it as part of a HumbleBundle. Sorry to be critical, but it's just not in the least bit fun, it's barely playable. I'm really not sure what the developer what trying to acheve with this game.			",226,57,8,13,25,3,30

												A decent arcade flight sim; other than the Yorktown-class carriers (which they bumble pretty badly), the game is very faithful to historic detail and letting you take part in some well detailed battles of the war.  Both campaigns are engaging and varied and the combat is pretty and fun.  Like previous installments, the AI occasionally forgets what it's supposed to do and flies in circles, but it's not a deal breaker as it's not constant.  Ship and plane explosions look as good in game as they do in the trailer and the multiplay is fast and fun.  Overall, expect an arcade flight sim and shooter, the management angles are very overhyped, but there are better games for that out.  You want a game to fly historic WWII naval aircraft that you and your friends can fight and bomb each other's carriers with?  This is your game.  Anything more in depth, keep looking.

												Extremely buggy. Stay away even if it is free. Controls are not easy to get used to. The graphics are good from far but far from good. Once you get your plane close to anything you get disapointed. They spent time making the water look nice and that's about it. Ships needed to look better with more deatil. A game called ""Pacific Carriers"" needs to have great looking ships. Not so in this case.I give the game a 4.5/10			",81,22,1,14,8,1,19

If you like flight combat sims get War Thunder or World of Warplanes, they are free and are far better than this game! I'll say it agian, DO NOT BUY!			",86,3,0,6,20,1,18

												Badly programmed. Practically unusable under Linux.Flying planes with the mouse is much TOO responsive and fiddly. Joystick support doesn't work correctly (yes, the joystick works fine with other programs...).[Edit: Got the joystick working through fiddling around with some libraries. Control is still terrible , nothing even close to how a real plane would respond. I've had fighter planes games on the Amiga 500 that had a better feel)Screen resolution setup is a mess. I use two monitors, one low ress for displaying tutorials and such, another full HD one (configured as the primary monitor) for everything else. This works fine in any other game, but AC:PC messes this up and tries to use both monitors, even if the configures resultion doesn fit... I'm not going to reconfigure my whole desktop setup everytime i want to play this game!.I also want to note that it has been ages where i've seen another game that has half the configuration options in an external program and half within the game engine. Didn't companies stop that nonsense years ago...?			",41,11,1,4,14,0,10

												If you own a Hotas X Joystick. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. The flight model is completely broken for it. Wobble from left to right, with no way to fix it, the turning is unresponsive and feels heavy. HORRIBLE. I am not sure if this happens with all Joysticks, but with the Hotas X it is. I tried playing it with a gamepad, and it felt terrible too, that might just be me being used to Joystick, but I dont think so, I played all of the Ace Combat series on gamepad, and those felt a million times better when compared to how this game felt on a gamepad. Uninstalled. Secret Wars, the one before this is great, and the controls work far better on that one. If you plan on getting one of these get that, or wait for a Steam sale. You can get Secret Wars, this one and the Vietnam one for like 5 dollars.			",180,25,2,22,19,1,20

												Stay away.Came in a bundle, but if I could pay a few pennies to get it removed from the list of my games I would happily do so. What on earth is the point of realistic looking graphics and setting if we need to invent a new word to describe its mechanics with one, that is the same to 'arcade' that 'arcade is to 'simulation'? Why WWII seriously? If you just had abstract colourful 3D bodies in 3D space, that would make a lot more sense, but leave sea, warships and aeroplanes out of the equation. Please.The mechanics will break any immersion the graphics could offer.Even the name of the game on my list is waste of my monitor pixels. Well, I have a custom category for the like, called 'Rubbish' and I keep it collapsed, but it still annoys me. Honestly.			",293,34,18,49,46,3,81

												WARNING! I'm writing about Linux version in this review!I bought this game in bundle with others for a few dollars. Well, I have to say that I'm pretty happy that I haven't paid 20$ for this.This game is pretty easy to play, if you don't have problems with mouse just like I do (like moving inside rectangle - that effectivelly means that you cannot fly all the way you want, sometimes you can't climb or go down...).I don't really know what I expected of this game, but I know that my expectation was not met. I don't recommend this one, I just can't.EDIT (22nd december 2013): Well, after another 40 minutes of my life wasted, I still won't recommend this game to anyone. I'm playing this on Linux, I don't know if it is the same as on Windows with the problems - I can't see any enemy in watchtower mission (thus I fail them everytime), the game crashes every so often (~10 minutes), I can play mission 2 (can't see any enemies = failed mission), 3 (this one was fun), 4 (crashes everytime at the end), but I cannot play mission 1 because it crashes right at the start - everytime. I play it with PS3 controller now, it's much better (remember, mouse doesn't work for me; don't know why), but still - 20$ for this game? War Thunder with its graphics, models, aircraft types, details, ... is F2P and you want somebody to pay for this? No, thanks. I'm glad I didn't spent that much on this crap. Knowing it is that bad, I wouldn't buy it even in that Humble bundle...EDIT: (19th november 2014): Wait for it... I got the game running again and we'll see if something has changed.

												This is actually a pretty good game. It does not present the most accurate or detailed portrail of the War but it is fairly enjoyable. The game feel slike it would be right at home on the Xbox 360 or Xbox 1. That does not mean its a bad game or it plays like crap o nthe PC but that it definitely is more of an arcade game based around conflicts in the Pacific then an actualy simulation of said conflict and its planes. What is refreshing about this game that unlike many others that offer unlimited ammo and tell you where to go, and point to you what to do the game has limited resouces and actually requires you to think and pay attention. (Oh my gosh no way!!!). So during a patrol mission for example like mission #2 you are told to spot the enemy. You have to take off and actually look for them insead of the game pointing it out ot you. I understand that this mechanic for some of you might not be appealing but I find it a breath of fresh air in a world of games that keep telling me what to do to a point that I don't even have to engage mentaly anymore. Another nice touch is that durring combat you have limited amunition. For example you might have 5 planes in a single engagement and each will  have 1100 ammo. If you happen to run out of ammo you are screwed for that plane and he might get shot down. What you can do is switch and take control of any of the other planes by hitting the back button on the controller. This is a pretty cool mechanic and quite fun. The graphics are very good in this game especially the water. The game is colorful, the sky looks and feels beautiful and the planes at least the conckpits look good. When you dive you will see the cockpit shaking and hear some windsheer. Explosions look good and enemy planes behave, break up and fall apart in unpredictable and random ways.I am playing the game on an xbox 360 controller. The game can also be played using the mouse and ising the keyboard. All control options allow for basic (arcaade) and simulation controls. The music/score for the game is good although the few missions I have done so far a little repetative. It sounds like a movie score, being very cinematic. The game reminds me of a Michael Bay movie when in combat with the cinematic score, and good visuals.   I think that this is a good game and I am enjoying it then again I don't have unrealistic expectations n where everything is either great or♥♥♥♥♥♥and nothing in between.  The game is fun if you feel like playing a WW2 non hardcore sim/arcade game that deals with the Pacific theater.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To start things off, I've always loved these fighter planes-esque games (e.g. War Thunder, Pearl Harbor). AC:PC was honestly the best game on my joystick that I've ever played (other than Star Wars: Rouge Squadron). Two separate campaigns in the WWII era, having the choice between Japanese and Americans were very interesting. Upon initializing the mission, you'll notice that every mission is taking off from an aircraft carrier (duh!). And unlike most single player campaign mode fighter games, you aren't the only one in the sky. You've got a whole squadron behind you (or in front, I'm always in the back) and the best part is that you can switch planes like how you switch players in FIFA. The pilots also have a ranking system e.g. Private, Captain and added skills to them depending on rank. It gets emotional when one of my starred pilots die in combat. The overall dogfighting is very fun and engaging, but when it comes down to missions, not so much.Yes, there's two campaign modes, but all the missions are very mundane; some just bore me to death, literally. These include trying to spot an enemy carrier that's off the coast for 3 minutes, attempting to dive bomb a radio tower because your fighter planes ran out of ammo, or trying to kill the rest of the enemy squadron with one plane left. Not to mention that the flak cannons on the ground do insane damage. Aim is quite hard with a joystick (you can play with a keyboard, but it still doesn't help the aim) and the bombs/torpedos take some skill to land unless you're literally right above the enemy unit. However, that still doesn't take away the fun of things.What I really enjoyed most was bombing ships. I love bombing runs; going down an entire stirp of an enemy aircraft carrier brings me so much joy. Knowing you have air superiority against this bomber always brings me to rejoice my lovely machine guns. Also, you can specialize the weapons on the plane to the mission, making even greater firepower.Overall, the game was very enjoyable. Missions were a pain, but atleast AC:PC got the basics down.

Second, even if you change ANYTHING in the graphic options, it does very little.  If you have it in windowed mode, the resolution is too messed up to move past the first screen.  The frame rate drop horribly in the title screen, preventing me from even creating a profile.  I wasted $20 dollars on this game.  I wouldn't even pick it up if it was a Free-To-Play.  Warthunder is free and it's a better deal.  Go get that.Just tried this on Windows.

												Now this game is sort of hate-love relationship.I did play the game with a XBox 360 controller on simulation settingI did not play the multiplayer part.It does have two different control modes: Arcade and Simulation, both for Mouse/Keyboard and controller.Arcade is what the name suggests, easy controllable fast action.Simulation, on the contrary, is much harder and more realistic in terms of flight dynamics. For this mode some training (like the training mission) is advisable. But even when using simulation, the game is still more arcade than some other games, so if you're a hardcore simulation fan, you won't miss anything here.The missions are relatively straight-forward: Destroy that ship, destroy that many planes in XX minutes and so on.I lacks freedom, but if you don't mind that, the air-action is doing fine.There are however some boresome missions, like on the japanese campaign where you have to do some very precise bombing with limited number of planes (and bombs, that is). Here I needed several relaods of that single mission to make it in time.That being sad, the scripting is still buggy; and I don't expect it to be patched any more.In 2 levels the level border (you cannot fly too far away from the main objective) is set really stupid; I even had 2 occurences where I switched to another, previously AI-controlled plane, and instantly ended up in loosing the mission due to ""leaving the battlefield""...Overall, 60% of the missions are really enjoyable, the rest ranges from ""nice try"" over ""boresome"" to ""annoying"".Also there is at least one real show-stopper bug:After finishing the last mission in the japanese campaign, the game crashed. And looking up in the game hub, it seems not to be an isolated problem--In general the game is not bad. It's entertainable for about 8-10 hours each campaign and there is a multiplayer part.But I suggest you buy this game only if you don't mind some bugs, a more or less arcade-like flying style and relatively straight-forward mission design.For myselfI don't think I wasted my time here, but if I'd payed more than 5€, I would be sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥due to the bugs and mission design flaws.

												Bottom Line:Simple arcade fighter sim that provides small bursts of excitement, yet the action rarely ever carries throughout an entire mission. Managing your squadrons should offer a chance to manipulate the game to fit your playstyle but there is not enough depth to take advantage of the system. In real life, your wingmen are the life of the squadron but in AC they are flat and meaningless. The game just feels as though it made empty promises. If you are hungry for any kind of arcade sim then pick it up on sale, otherwise it would be best to avoid the game. Read all my thoughts [weweregamers.wordpress.com] ",157,85,1,48,28,2,54

												I'm not a huge flight simulator guy, but this came in a bundle and I like to always branch out when I have the opportunity. Meh, if you've ever played a flight sim and realized that its only fun for a short while, well that's my recurring experience with the genre too. This game would be much more fun to me as a level in a full videogame (Like how GTA V has pretty detailed flight in their planes). Just the game alone doesn't have enough diversity for me, the idea that you are going to be doing the same exact specific thing throughout the entire campaign, makes it hard to enjoy.On an opposing note, there are different planes and different weapons and different enemy targets that do mix up the levels enough to make it bearable. The first couple levels are actually fun until you try to fire some torpedoes (Those things will always be a mystery to me), and if there was a bit stronger storyline, I might be able to get more into it. Text scrolls across the screen and shows you a map of pearl harbor and other islands. Actually as I'm writing this, I'm realizing how terrible this review will be. I mean its obviously targeted at people who are into flight sims and/or war games enough to read a review about one written by someone who has absolutely no interest in either. So how about this, don't trust me, unless you are here because you also dislike war plane games and for some reason want to give them yet another chance. I'd say if this game is free or under $2 then you'll probably enjoy it that much. Otherwise, it gets old pretty fast.The biggest problem with the game is the ever changing difficulty level. Rookie, the lowest casual level gets hard to the point where all of the backup planes with be blown up before you can even switch to them. Don't even get me started on the actual simulation mode (as opposed to controller arcade mode).  So to summarize this confused/confusing babbling: It keeps you somewhat entertained briefly and then get too difficult to be fun anymore. I beat the primary campaign and am leaving it at that.Note: Again, I am not into this genre so take this opinion lightly.Overall Score: 6.5/10 (The actual game play was done well)			",577,200,18,74,76,10,80

												I'll always have a soft spot for WW2 flying games - especially those in the Pacific theatre. My first ever PC game from November 1992 was the classic Aces of The Pacific by the now defunct Dynamix.And this in essence is biggest gripe about AC:PC. Apart from the graphics and sound, the actual gameplay doesn't appear to have moved on in more than 20 years. I ploughed hour after hour into Aces yet AC:PC just leaves me feeling empty. It feels like a hollow game with very little substance and the enemy AI has a bizarre fascination of wanting to fly directly into you? :S The last 'skirmish' game I had resulted in a K/D of 10/6 - with all of my deaths through direct contact with opposing aircraft. Very silly and frustrating.Barely 4/10 for this and that's being generous.			",326,46,21,42,39,2,85

												Visually well created, this game has some serious control related issues. I will be the first to say that I didn't even bother to take the time and use an Xbox 360 controller, because although the story (tried and true WWII) is well executed, the controls as a whole felt sluggish and unrealistic. Switching to ""simulation mode"" didn't even help. War Thunder leaves an entirely better taste in my mouth.			",67,15,6,12,25,0,21

												If you have a Controller, this game can be fun. I played it in Contoller-Arcade mode.Probably not worth the full price, but if you got this game from a pack, then you won't regret playing it.There is a decently long American and Japanese campaign where you get to patrol the skies, fight in historical battles and sink a lot of ships and even some large Historical Carriers.With each faction, you get three types of fighters: dog fighters, ground bombers and sea bombers.You control one plane at a time but can switch to the next pilot at any time. This is done to get you back into the fight without wasting time going back for ammunition.With each battle, your surviving pilots gain experience and maybe even a few perks. You can edit your roster between missions to train weaker pilots or to make sure you have good AI pilots by your side.If one of your planes goes down, there is still a chance that your pilot bailed out and survived. If you are not pleased with the outcome, you can always restart a mission or redo the last checkpoint.I personally like playing this game (with a controller) and some of the missions, though sometimes hard, are quite fun.I can't recommend you pay the full price for it or try to play it without a controller, but you won't regret owning this game.

												Played only the first campaign mission.Felt like I was flying a potato.I can switch pilots, but for some reason can only use each one once?I personally shot down 11/12 of the planes in the first mission, then spent 30 minutes trying to shoot down the last one which was running circles around me.  My copilots seemed like they were just watching me do all the work.If this was how US WW2 planes were in real life I'm not sure how we won the war.OR DID WE?			",370,110,11,47,53,2,78

												Now what is good about this arcade style world war 2 combat simulator. A pro in this game are the graphics. It is very well done. Firing the guns is amazingly realistic looking. Must have been a lot of hard work to get it to that level. The game runs smooth but setting up the controls is difficult. Especially when you want to use a joystick. Repeat after me...JOYSTICK! Its a thing that ""would be"" pilots like a lot in games. So the sensitivity level is way too high even on the lowest sensitivity level in this game for several joysticks I used to test the game. Result I make rolls with planes without actually touching the joystick that much. It has nothing to do with not flying fast enough by the way. The sensitivity in the controls makes aiming more of a burdon that it should be. I also tried flying with keyboard and mouse. That is a lot easier but not the way I want to play this kind of game. Also the lack of coop is a con in this game. Perhaps on some gaming fora there are some sollutions to this problem. It seems to me this game has some minor bugs still, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun.			",234,2,7,4,27,0,42

												Good arcade-style shooter. It even have a bosses as carriers and battleships.As a simulator it have many flaws:- stupid AI- some stupid missions- repetitive- historical inaccuracies- all planes are alike- arcade flight modelBut as arcade it is fun in small doses and for couple of bucks.

												Its a good little mindles shoot-em-up. There is not a huge amount of skill involved and the game can be buggy sometimes but all in all it is good fun. If the game is on a sale I would recommend buying it, otherwise it might be a little to expensive for what it is.			",347,72,9,62,59,2,64

												I encountered none of the crashes or glitches that these other reviewers have lamented over. The game is labelled as a simulation but it's very arcade-y and easy to pick up and play (Controller highly recommended).While not a particularly deep or complicated game it is actually a rather fun experience.Pick it up on sale if you're into flying and blowing up lots of stuff.7/10 ",469,100,9,62,70,6,103

												To start off with: this game is pretty fun. You most likely wish to know if it is full-price fun. In short: no.Taking into account the production quality and some dodgy mechanics I'd suggest you pick it up if it goes 50-75% off. That is, if you enjoy arcade flying games. If not, there is not much to see here.3/5 - Fun but flawed.			",580,182,25,93,66,11,103

												The is nice, you fly with multiple planes and can switch betweem them. It also looks pretty sweet (for the money spend that is). What is less nice is that it took effort to get it running properly: edit the config.ini to get a proper resolution, but also when i alt+tab out, i cant get back (didnt find a solution for that yet).Its worth the few euros but dont expect too much.

Choosing configurations brings nothing. I can't configure the game settings. - I hope somebody can help me or the developers will make some upgrade or check about this game!The game it self is very nice and for short gamers who wants to feel the freedom of flying!

												i'm pretty sure multiplayer is more than dead, and the single player can be atrocious, enemies prefer to ram you instead of dodging you about 60% of the time if you hit them even once, takes 3 seconds to change between planes, WHEN it actually lets you change, sometimes there will be a bug where they dont let you change the plane,  in case you run out of bullets and bombs, forcing you tolose, and best of all, the mission is to do x thing then your ai plane ""friends"" will be about 500-600 meters away from it. so if your mission is to protect/destroy a certain thing, well dont run out of bullets or when you change planes they are all ataking nothing and pretty far away, so by the time you arrive to your spot, you probably lost or one of the enemies (or even your friends) will ram into your airplane and force a defeat and full restart of the mission. oh and sometimes, but just sometimes, there is no checkpoint even if there where 2 checkpoints in the mission before, wich means if you lose, you restart the whole mission again.
