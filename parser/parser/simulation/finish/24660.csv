												Got this cheaply from a bundle and was not at first impressed at all. after awhile the simulation part starts to show and you go deeper and it starts to look much better. This particular game is however basicaly 'trainz lite' due to non-functional save game. If you can keep the PC on at long times then no problem using this game. This game managed to hook me pretty well quite quickly even without save: there just is something in it trying to manage a huge freight train, or trying to keep up with timetables when you move passengers. Steam or electic trains for choice, Simple toy train DCC controls or realistic CAB control modes spice up the experience well. Things go sour if you really must have save and dont have any other trainz game that saves sessions properly like Trainz 12. I'll be playing that game now. Working save. Better content and proper tutorials that this game lacks.  ",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												I just can't give this any kind of a review since the last time I played it? You can't even still use the SAVE function. It really had some great potential too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely Great, and everything I used worked just as it should. Even sounds and actions were co-ordinated, more than I can say for Rail Simulator 2013!  Pity about lack of instructions though, but that is common in all these simulator games. Lucky I have crystal balls.			",0,0,0,0,10,0,2

												What a fantastic set this is, nice landscape, track, trains, and industies for loading and unloading stuff.The man who made this should be knighted by the queen for his work. ;)Also works with the newer ts12 3d engine for even better and smoother look. Its a steal at 7 euro as you can use all the assets in your own routes too. Before i bought it I was hessitant because of all the bad revieuw this got but its great its the modeltrain track you always dreamt of as a kid only virtual so it gathers no dust and doesnt need an extra room in your house. I'm waiting for murchison part 3			",400,139,27,99,128,7,159

												To me this is supposed to be a dumbed down version of TS2012.No building and just less.So a intro to trains, all the fun but no work, except ...I don't find this a fun game.You move a slow moving train up and down preset tracks.It's a job to play this game, which is not fun to me.If you get this really really cheap try it out, if you have to pay more than $3 ... just pass at it.If you have a choice between TS2012 & this, get TS2012.

												When I ""play"" the game, it loads up what looks like a Wiki page describing the updates to the game.  Does not open in 1920x1080.  This is an older game not designed for current computers.  Waiste of my 1 minute figuring things out.1/10			",288,37,9,20,31,0,38

												This is epic! I would DEFINETLY recommend people to get it especially if theyre gonna add this pack to TS12 since TS12 comes with only 3 steam engines ( not including DLC ). Plus I think if you want to do a machinima kind of thing its map would be great for that! Oh yay another thing, this pack comes with ALOT of steam and a few dieasle locos.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even as a stand alone route-version of TS2009, It is fantastic! Many miles of track to keep you occupied and a good amount of senarios to enjoy. While it also includes Cabon City and Seattle & Carlisle...I HIGHLY reccommend this to anyone loking for a good stand alone version of Trainz!!!			",33,7,2,3,14,0,2

												The old and still playable train simulator. If you are looking for cheap train simulator, buy that! You will be happy. It doesn't look like the Train Simulator 2015, but it's still classic and playable game! Just check it, if you dont believe me.			",103,13,6,12,17,1,14
