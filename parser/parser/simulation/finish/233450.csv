Early Access Review
								This ""game"" ruined my perception of the human soul. Let me explain. I had a prison going, a real human rights violation if ever there was one. 300 high-violence inmates crammed into a single holding cell like animals. They had 10 beds to share among them. Two (working) toilets. Three showerheads. Constant shakedown searches, armed and k9 guards every twenty feet. A 25 square foot exercise yard where they were forced to spend most of their days crammed together like sardines. At lunch time, most of them didn't even get to eat. They were hungry, smelly, and angry. But they never rioted. They kept to themselves and just walked around all day complaining.So I sold the prison. And I built another one. This was a utopia. Most of the offenders were normal risk. I had adequate housing, food, staff, showers. It was clean. Every cell had a TV. Most of their day was spent in free time. I had GED classes for them, substance abuse programs. And THAT wasn't good enough for them. It all started with one inmate. ""Fish"" was his nickname. He goes to his alcoholics class and within a matter of minutes, he beats the therapist to death right in front of the other inmates! What a jerk. The other inmates must have become stricken with terror because as I'm locking the guy in the hole, another inmate stabs a new arrival to death right in front of a guard. The new arrival hadn't even been booked into processing yet and there he is bleeding out on the shower room floor! As the guards are dealing with stabby mcstabberson, two more inmates start tearing the beds out of the walls in their cells so they catch beatdowns from the guards too.At that point, the other prisoners decide they want no part of any of that and go off to their cells. The murderers / violent offenders spend 48 hours in solitary.I guess what I'm trying to say is that this game is awesome, especially considering it's Early Access.			",555,133,21,95,89,8,93

								If you think you are going to like this game, you probably will! Prison Architect is pretty much exactly what it sounds like it is going to be. It's a prison simulation game where you manage a prison. But it does that very well!There are different ways to play but in one way you get a certain number of minimum, normal, and maximum security prisoners dropped off every day. You need to make room in your prison for these guys, you need to keep them happy, and you need to make sure they don't run away or kill each other.To start off you can either build a large holding cell or smaller individualized cells (the individual cells are much more expensive but it keeps the prisoners happier). Each prisoner has needs like the need to shower, to eat, to sleep, to go out to the yard, to talk to their family, etc. You can see these stats on a per prisoner basis or as an overall stat at the top of your screen. The more unhappy your prisoners are the more likely they are to try to escape, to cause a riot, to kill people, etc.The other thing you need to keep in mind is money. You are running a for-profit prison after all. You can get money from grants at the start of the game (they are kind of like mini quests where you get half the money up-front and the other half once you complete the objective) and you also get money depending on the number of prisoners you have. You spend money every day on things like food, guards, other staff members, etc. You can hire less staff members or reduce the quality of the food but there are risks to doing those things.So what's the endgame? Once (and only once) you decide your prison is profitable enough, you can sell it. The game gives you a monetary score depending on how well you did. You can use this money to start your next prison and make it even better.			",448,132,27,81,60,6,125

												Thank you for this wonderful game. I have created many prisons and I shared it in the workshop,(Walking the Mile) this is definately one of my best. I have to say the game has got my full attention, the way you have created each individual prisoner  keeps it real interesting. There are a few  thoughts I have that these should be in the game always, such as a medical ward, much like the protective custody. Some prisoners are insane and should be labeld that way, then they could serve there time in the medical ward. A gang rehab class, trying to remove the gang label. a confession room for the chapel. Maybe a prison cemetery for those that die in prison and have no family. Other levels of death penaties, gas chamber, lethal injection based on what he arrives in prison and the judge appoints which penalty! The sniper towers are great, these sould be used indoors as well, makes you think there is an upper level.I do not use the mail room, the prisoners dont work it fast enough and I get piles of mail bages in storage, also it ties up guards picking up where they left off. I also dont use the forestry, piles of wood are everywhere, in conjunction I dont use the carpenrty tables or programs, it takes forever for a prisoner to learn and produce, but the time they do this the get released. I think the library should be open regardless of education levels, so I dont  use this feature either. Overall this game is great. I recommend it it to all that enjoy building population of any sort.			",35,37,1,5,8,2,11

								If you're interested in this game, just buy it. It has workshop integration with an active modding community. Earlier tonight I changed the theme to star wars with a press of the button. This is a very addictive game where real time begins to speed by in a blur. 5 minutes becomes 5 hours and you only noticed because you need to use the restroom. There is a wonderful charm about it and the fat little characters. There is a lot of micromanagement so if you're the kind of person that hates to think, can't oil your brain because it hurts, well then you should pass. It's not overly complicated but the game doesn't hold your hand starting out. It's like bam build a prison. The only downside is struggling to figure out why things aren't being built, or populated. This may further confuse someone since it is alpha which makes it difficult to distinguish between a bug and something you aren't doing correctly. Other than that you should enjoy this game.

												Prison Architect is one of those games, kind of like the sims, with which you occasionally have the brief moments of clarity where you realise that you're wasting your time scheduling and organising the lives of simulated people and you get the sudden urge to do something productive in real life like build some furniture or take a cooking class or raise a family.Thankfully these moments pass and you can go back to playing the game.

								Spent three hours planning,Had my first set of prisoners,Forget to enclose prison,After yard time they all just walked off to freedom.10/10After many let downs with other Early Access games this one gives me hope. Constant updates and enough of a full game to feel complete make this worth of a purchase. Edit 3/21/15:With over $13,000,000 these two ""developers"" made off this game so far --- and note, Heavy Rain's budget was $25,000,000 --- I'm pretty sure they're directing your money right in their pockets. -And you're mad they are keeping the money you paid them when they have been up front about their plans? I mean, if I was selling burgers for 3 bucks and people kept paying me for them I would pocket the money too.And the apologists who think devs these days have good intentions, are on a completely different planet. Instead of getting a dev team and a tester team up and ready to push this game on the shelves-Its their product and sadly they can do what they want with it. We paid to play an unfinsihed product and be the testers. EA is not so we can get our greedy hands on games before they are ready, its so we can be involved in the creation. These devs have actually listened to their players since day one.they're shoving that money right up their noses.-Thats just mean.This could have been a complete, possibly addictive and fully polished game by the end of 2014-Not with the way the people who made the game were going with it. We're talking about sprites for god sakes.-Earthbound, ChronoTrigger, Secret Of Mana, FF<6......This game has added so much on the macro and micro level that if all you see are sprites you need to go back to COD.

												This game is insanely fun. But it does have it problems.I'll talk about what I love about it and then I'll talk about what I hate.1, Gangs.The fact you can get gangs in your prison is great. They'll work together to escape and to kill/fight during a riot or skirmish.I find it perfect that I can section off gang members between cell blocks, And one day open up the doors and watch the murder spree insue, Before sending my armed guards set to free-fire in to crap on the resistance.2, Mods.With this game you can see almost anything anytime with mods, I once had a mod that is sadly out of date now, Which set the base agression of the prisoners to near-riot at all times. Me moving one prisoner to another cell set off the entire prison into a rampage. Total death toll was over 400 prisoners, 300 guards and the 5 admins, Whom, Got rushed by gun-weilding gangs.3, Armed Guards.The fact I can turn my prison into a DPRK Political Prison is just great. Putting guards in the canteena with free-fire on is possibly the best way to maintain order in my prisons while keeping the quality as low as it can possibly go. No janitors, No health care, NOTHING.Those were the things I like about this game, Time to get into the stuff I hate.1, Workers.The workers get stuck far to often for their own good, It seriously calls into question what the level of education required for their field of work is. I once had about 50 workers stuck behind a wall, and 20 more in another. The sad thing is, When i tried to free them, The oposite set would be assigned to free the other. This lasted 20 mins before i hired 100 more.They also have a tendency to shove their faces into the edge of the map once you buy a gate, Its annoying.2, Easy to trigger prisoners.Now, I did say before that I had a mod that triggered them, But it seems the mod is useless now, The prisoners in this game seem to be like their personality was taken straight from forums dedicated to complaints and petty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The prisoners can be set off for litterally walking to far. Its rediculas when you have to kill half your prison beacuse they hate WALKING.3, Cell Quality.This is a prison, Not a luxury hotel. Enough said.I hope yall found this review usefull, At all. Probably not.			",55,6,0,17,14,0,21

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			",26,3,0,0,5,0,0

								Where do I begin with a game like this. Well for starters this game was made by an indie company, no big publisher backing Introversion, they have done an amazing job getting this game to where it is at this time. In short, buy this game it is an amazing experience.For those who wish to read, I will now go over the pros and cons of this game in detail.Pros:Build just the way you want:There are very few contraints when building. I'd liken it to Sims 3 from a top down perspective in terms of building. It's great fun.Cartoony but realistic at the same time:The game has a very distinctive art style that is unique to the game, but it deals with serious topics such as if you will execute a death row prisoner or not, or if you will keep a prisoner locked up for virtually all of his day. This game makes you think.It's tough, but only if you want it to be/You can go at your own pace:The aim of the game is not to amass one billion dollars, but to have the lowest reoffending rate for released prisoners, and every in game day can be marginally relaxing if you want it to. For instance you can run a low-security, generally free environment where the aim is to rehabilitate your prisoners through the use of classes you can run, or you can run a max-sec environment punishing the most hardcore of criminals. It's all up to you.A dedicated team:I have watched nearly every alpha video that has been published, and I can clearly see that Introversion software is very passionate about the project. There were (As of writing this it's about a day off offical release) new features each month, and it was a pleasure to watch each and every video.If you enjoyed Sim City you'll love this. There are features very soon to be released I haven't gone over yet,  as well as features I missed,but you'll see for yourself.Cons:Somewhat gruelling at the start:After putting a good 200 hours into the game as a whole, this is probably my most major complaint with the game, is that in the beginning you start with 30K and the only way you can make money is via grants, but selling your first prison is practically the only way to make cash when you're still learning the ropes.Overall a solid 8.5/9 out of 10, certainly one of the best sim and strategy/managment games I have ever played. For $30 you will get a lot of fun out of this. Strongly recommended.			",49,5,0,9,18,0,10

								I first played Prison Architect during one of its earliest alpha stages. The game was buggy, limited and filled with core problems but the base idea was still really interesting and I saw a lot of potential. Over the years the game has been polished little by little and I'd say, at this point, the game feels incredibly solid. It's refreshing to see indie developers who legitimately care about making a good game and aren't just focused on appealing to a huge audience and making money.You play as a warden, build a prison from the ground up, and get regular paychecks to keep inmates locked away. You need to make sure the prisoners have basic needs met like food and entertainment, otherwise they'll get rowdy and start trouble (like murdering each other, or breaking things). The concept is very straight-forward. As someone who enjoys games like Sim City and Dwarf Fortress (as well as prison movies) this was very up my alley.You can min-max the perfect prison, or you can just have fun with it and design a chaotic madhouse that's destined to fail. My favorite prison design, my own invention of course, is to have every single part of the prison connect to one center room. That center room is the ""warden's office + shower"" combo. Watch as the warden lives a constant life of fear while the 50+ maximum security prisoners cram their way into the showers meant for no more than 10 people at a time. The warden is sitting there with lamenated paperwork, crying, trying to get something done while all these ruthless thugs wash up. The previous warden is floating, face down in the shower water, right next to the new warden's desk. Yep. Good times.Rating: A			",41,5,0,3,10,1,9

								I whole heartedly recommend this game.  At the time of review I have 210 hrs of game time in.  Far behind in my library at #2 is Kerbal Space Program with 105.  This game is perfectly paced, completely open to infinite designs and has so much depth I can easily see hitting 500hrs.  After the latest update (alpha 31) this game is packed with content and the workshop offers massive expansion and awesome mods (Imperial architect being my current fav.  Star wars prison!).Pros:As big as you wanna be!  Want to make a small 25 person prison  that runs efficiently and makes money with minimum security bluecollar criminals?  Go ahead!  Want to make a 500 person Max security only iron curtain that can hold and control intensely volatile and psychotic madmen?  Sure can!Well designed!  The UI and indicators for things like prison heat, tech tree, controlling and managing intake and regime of the inmates and hiring and firing staff, as well as prison programs is easy to understand and impliment.  I've played plenty of games that after opening them up and fiddling with for 20 minutes I can hardly make heads or tails of the UI or it has infinitely frusturating menus to navigate or item info to memorize.  Not so with PA. Entertaining!  Set up phone taps and learn a prisoner has set up a time for someone to throw booze over the wall into the garbage area?  Watch them toddle over into the area and as they head back inside stop them and counter their contraband!  Initiate shakedowns to find inmates who have dummys in their beds and are digging tunnels!  The excitement of unearthing a tunnel they have been digging for days that NEARLY reached the outside but was thwarted is always satisfying.  Recruit confidential informants to reveal persons who have knives, needles, poison SHOTGUNS in their cells.  Use sniffer dogs to inspect incoming food and items to ensure they are poison and piano wire free.  The combinations and implications are endless.No two prisons are ever the same!  One prison may be full of raging alcoholics, another may be a mix of volatile angry inmates and ex law enforcment or snitches that must be contained and seperated or death ensues!  My last prison had 3 legendary prisoners, each capable of disarming and killing guards in a single punch.  Not only must you constantly learn to streamline your prison and improve every aspect of the design you also have to adapt and keep tabs on your current and incoming prisoners, keeping the troublemakers at bay and keeping your staff running smoothly.Cons:Still early access.  This isnt necessarily a con but something to be take into consideration.  This game has all the content and playability and optimization of a full release but as new features ar implimented new bugs invariably creep up.  In the most recent patch my cooks tend to randomly pile dirty trays in the cells of my supermax and solitary prisoners.  Later in the day they pick them up and wash them.  On occasion I will assign a block to eat in a specific canteen, and then assign a specific kitchen to feed them.  Later on suddenly I will check my prisoners needs and some are starving.  I will check my food distribution screen and randomly the kitchen and canteen to cellblock link is totally gone.  Its not perfect, but none of these bugs or issues are anywhere near game breaking and are fairly smalltime.In conclusion get this game.  The developers are awesome, the game is amazing, and its not even complete yet!  I look forward to future updates and features and the workshop community is actively making new mods regularily that add even more to the experience.  98/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All these reviews talk about how much fun it can be to create a draconian panopticon of hell, but I find it much more profitable to push on rehabilitation. You get money every time you take in prisoners, so it pays to be constantly taking them in, and you get a nice bonus whenever you release someone on parole and they don't reoffend. And while housing them in constant terror can reduce their will to re-offend, it's rather difficult to get that bonus check from a dead man.And the great thing about this game? Both philosophies are perfectly valid. They each have benefits and flaws, and it's your job to strike the balance between the two to get your desired result. Go on, experiment; it's just the lives of criminals you're tinkering with, after all.			",53,21,1,16,24,1,36

												I don't normally comment on games I own, but in this case I will make an exception. Its not a review of the game, the game is about building a prison and managing it and the prisoners in it. Does that sound good? Then buy, if not then watch some youtube videos and judge for yourself if its the kind of game you would like to spend some of your time on.The reason I am commenting on this game is that for me its an example of Early Access done correctly. The Devs released a game in a playable but basic state and have consistently updated the game with new features, whilst listening to feedback from the community. Nothing was rushed, no hyperbole that left early buyers feeling short changed later, just a consistent, honest approach from a team of developers that both care about the community the game has created and the quality of the game they have produced. Its been a pleasure to play it and watch the game grow into the 1.0 launch and it means I have a connection to the game that I wouldnt have developed if I had just bought the game at 1.0.Introversion have shown what a beautiful thing Early Access can be.

								- Addicting- Fun- Easy to get into- Constanlty updated- Has a lot of objects and such that you can build/place in the game's world- Mod supportFor an Early Access game I'd say this game is doing great. If you like sandbox type of games or games where you have to manage something (in this case - a prison) then get this, you won't be disappointed!Oh, also you can encounter this:Christopher ""The rabid penguin"" Setterstrom's biography -Responsible for the pre-meditated deaths of 12 people, this man earned his nickname when it was discovered he had developed a chemical that gave penguins similar symptoms to rabies and used that so they would consume his victims leaving no evidence.11/10Would keep him in jail again!

												Years ago, I worked in a prison... Northern nevada Correction Center and Warm Springs Correctional Center located in Carson City Nevada. That being said, a few games have come out over the years trying to emulate running a prison. Prison Tycoon 1 & 2 were the first that I tried. Both failed miserably. This game has a long way to go, but it is trying... improving... and actually comes close. Riots, gang wars, contraband, escapes and even a death row. Real rehabilitation, if there is such a thing. Not all inmates go back to prison whatever the reason.This game is evolving, getting better and feels real on some levels.A critical review should be just that, critical. So while I give this game a thumbs up, it is not perfect. It has bugs, Some new, some old, but many are recognized and others have been fixed. The developers are working to improve it both in game play and fixing that which is broken. I have not seen a game breaking bug.An active community of posted prisons and mods, the spread of ideas and again active developers have made this game more real than it's predicessors and a bit fun.My 1 suggestion is to add race tension. Race wars are alive and well in the US prisons. Segregation could be implemented as it is in many prisons. However, Gangs do add an interesting aspect that mimic this, but recruitment is rampant in prisons and should be added as well. Gun towers, a better way to implement sally ports (1 door can not open until the other closes, linking doors together in some way of added user defined rules) and so forth. How about a bit of staff corruption? All of this would make the game more real, challenging and fun.			",76,11,1,29,63,0,61

												The Campaign (which also serves as the tutorial) opens with a prison that isn't quite finished yet. And you are told by your boss, the CEO of the ""For Profit"" Prison, that you have been given the task of executing a murderer. And this order comes from the state itself.The game then turns towards teaching you how to work the basic construction tools, explaining power, water, foundations, interior walls, and room basics in a straightforward and clean manner.Then the game shows you exactly why your prisoner is guilty.It is not a pleasant experience to watch as a tiny cartoon man walk into his home, find his tiny cartoon wife ♥♥♥♥ing a tiny cartoon stranger in his bed, and then tearfully shoot them both in the head.This gives us the biggest lesson of all: Prison Architect is not a happy game.Prison Architect is a top down management game where you run your prison company exactly how you want it. As far as the state is concerned, it doesn't matter how high your rehabilitation rate is, all that matters is that you have no escapes, keep the deaths to an acceptable low, and you keep the prisoners in line by any means you deem fit.Once you finish your campaign, which takes you through the systems of the game, explaining core concepts quite happily while also telling you tales of loss, pain, murder, ambition, hope, and sheer murderous rage. Of course, the problem is that the game ONLY explains the core mechanics and leaves more complicated ones for you to figure out yourself. That said, while there is a Wiki and many a guide for you, the point of the core game in sandbox mode is mostly to see what works best. To adapt to problems and overcome even of it must be done through trail, error and blood.The game provides security measures such as cameras, remote doors opened by a button or a timer, stab vests and tazers for your guards, and even heavily armed maximum force response teams kept on site with shotguns, full body armor, and the will and means to paint your prison red with blood at your command. Along with this the game will provide schedules, assignments, patrols, and even resticted acess zoning, all of which is designed to keep your prisoners under control so they do not kill each other.Along with this is provided many means to turn your prisoners into peaceful members of society if you so choose. You may provide basic education, as many prisoners lack even a child's reading and writing skills. And some of them cannot even read at all, let alone write. Give your prisoners trade skills as carpenters or metal workers. Teach them how to be cleaners or work a laundry. And then set up security systems to prevent prisoners stealing hammers or making crude knives.Prisoners may come with medical issues such as addiction, alchoholism or violent pshycological instability. Build a common room for AA meetings, an office for one on one meetings for professional mental help, an infirmary for chemical treatmeants to help with addiction and minor surgery when the prisoners try to kill, and a mourge when they do kill.Your prisoners are humans, with desires and needs, thoughts and feelings, and intelligence. Prisoners need to be fed, and you may give them things to do. Build a common room with tables, television sets, and phones. Provide meals at preset times, as many times as you want, in large quantaties and variety if you want, or a simple bowl of vegetable soup once a day if you don't. Prisoners with many things to do are less likey to cause trouble, and giving them these things may make them very happy indeed.This does not mean you may treat them like sane members of society. You are running a prison. They are prisoners. And Prisoners are not in the habit of obeying the rules. Prisoners steal, fight, and even kill in your walls. Make no mistake, you and your officers are the only order inside the prison. Without your constant watchful gaze and omnipresent guards the prisoners will fall upon each other like wild animals; killing, fighting, and breaking.If your prisoners are exceptionally angry, and if your prison is weak enough, the prisoners may decide that they can do whatever thy want and there is nothing you can do about it. They may decide to riot. Or you may subdue them, show them that any antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated, and make them docile through fear.Problems may arise in your prison, and of course these are optional. Make it so that he game throws problems your way at random. Maybe a highly contagious disease is rampaging through your prison and killing your prisoners. Perhaps a water main has burst. Maybe a generator has overloaded, causing a fire and a blackout. Or maybe the mayor has bowed to political pressure and decided to implement reform without consulting you.If you feel particularly brave, allow the game to generate gangs, and watch as your prison becomes split by three gangs into territories, and attempt to usurp your authority. And then spiral into gang wars, burn your prison down, kill your guards, and extort prisoners.Prison Architect, ultimately, is exactly what it says it is, with a remarkable and well made game that most will like.  BUt do not expect to laugh because of the cutesy graphics. They mitigate the horror, but only make it bearable.			",80,20,2,16,41,0,12

												my greatest prisoner everHe comes one day with the other 4 prisoners i ordered, all max secI look at his stats and see hes a gang member with strong, quick, and very deadly attributes on him.At this point I had just finished my new cell block and say hey he should go there since i have lots of guards there.At this point hes just chilling normally when he breaks into sudden outburst killing a snitch with his bare hands in one hitGuards on on him, they have tazers and guns and batons, he stands no chance. He punches one in the face killing the guard and he goes on rampage now with a baton killing everyone in sight. All the guards that fought died. He is murdering the prisoners. He escapes to the death row room where i have built several protective walls. He breaks down 6 solitary doors to where he can get inside the 10/10 room with tv and such. He is in there and i send 3 armed guards to get him and put him downhe kills them and he tried to run out and gets tazed. I built a Fenced off area for people like him, The MAx Sec no way hes escaping no way he can even kill here. He is put there for his stay of now 400 years from all that murder. After while all the people who have killed more than 3 guards are put here with him. The Ape goes crazy and kills all 7 of his kind and is sent to solitary where he breaks out and kills 15 guards. He is unstoppable i think as he barrgaes to the prisons end to escape when out  of no where BAM a single shot is put into his as he goes downThe Ape is dead with now 1000+ years of murder Rip 911/420 would have pshyco prisoners again			",95,5,1,11,13,0,12

								* This review is under Alpha-24c PC 31 Aug, 2014 version  Ultimate fun and addictive game imo.    Prison management is not that easy in this game.  Build a nice prison and intake more prisoner and build a bigger prison.  Prison Architect provide a lot of feature to play.  You can build Holding Cell or Personal Cell even Solitery Cell, depoly guards, dogs and army, build a infarmy facility, construct the CCTV monitor network with remote control doors, teach your prisoners in classroom with reform program and give them works to do, and much more fun in Prison Architect!    The most imoportant thing is that Prison Architect provide features to buy adjacency lands to expand your jail.  And you can even sell you jail for some funds to build the next jail with better start facilities!  Last but not least, Prison Architect support Steam Workshop, give this game infinte possibility!    If you like Strategy, Building, Managing game, you must try Prison Architect!Pros:+ Addictive gameplay.+ Simple but nice looking graphic design.+ ""Grants"" gives you short term goals and challenges and rewards.+ Various facilities to build and management.+ Logic Circuits!+ Detail reports to view and manage the whole jail and all prisoners.+ Lots of events and works in all time.+ Mods and Steam Workshop support! (language mod included!)Cons:- Still in Early Access, so obviously there's some bugs.- Not very smart routing AI, workers or prisoners sometimes stuck or do nothing.- Seldom game crash with no reason. (About 2 times in my first 18 hours, 3 times in first 44 hours)- Few hotkeys, only WASD / QE / 123 / Space / -= for camera movement / zoom in and out /  time speed control / pause / UI size respectively.- Some items have not implemented or not fully functional right now, such as Brick Wall and Concreate Wall only differ from appearence, Execution Room is no use other than introduction, windows do nothing, etc.- Bad tutorial and few in-game info.  You need to dig out and learn lots of things fron Official Wiki, Wikia and Google by yourself.The first time I played this game was so addicted and when I noticed that it's been 18 hours passed...* 這篇是Alpha-24c PC 2014.08.31版本的評論  我個人認為這是一款非常有趣且讓人沉迷的遊戲。  遊戲中管理監獄不像想像中的簡單，要蓋個好監獄、收更多犯人、然後蓋更大的監獄，Prison Architect提供大量的遊戲內容與功能，你可以蓋集中牢房、個人牢房、重犯牢房等，部屬警衛、警犬、重裝警衛等，建造醫療中心，搭配遠端遙控門禁系統建構CCTV閉路監視系統網路，透過再造計畫課程教導更生人生活技能並給他們工作協助監獄運作，還有更多有趣好玩的內容！  更重要的是Prison Architect提供購買鄰近土地的功能，讓你能持續擴張你的監獄規模，甚至能讓你販售你的監獄，讓下次開新局的起首資金更多！此外，Prison Architect也支援Steam工作坊，提供了無限的可能性！  如果你喜歡策略、建造、管理的遊戲，一定要試試看Prison Architect！ 優點:+ 讓人沉迷的遊戲內容。+ 簡單卻精緻好看的美術設計。+ 有短期目標與挑戰提供發展資金。+ 多樣的監獄設施可建造管理。+ 有邏輯電路！+ 詳細的報告內容可以一覽監獄和囚犯狀態。+ 隨時都有豐富多樣的事件和工作發生。+ 支援模組和Steam工作坊！(包含語言包模組！)缺點:- 仍然是Aplha測試階段，有一些明顯的Bug。- 尋路AI有點蠢，工人和犯人偶爾會卡住不動。- 遊戲有時候莫名其妙當機崩潰。(我玩了18小時大概崩潰兩次，44小時大約3次)- 熱鍵很少，只有WASD / QE / 123 / 空白鍵 / -= 分別控制 鏡頭 / 縮放 / 遊戲速度 / 暫停 / 介面大小。- 有些東西目前還沒實作或是沒功能，例如磚牆和水泥牆只有外觀的差異，行刑室除了教學模式以外沒用處，窗戶沒有任何狀態效果，等等。- 很爛的教學，遊戲內的資訊有點少，你必須要翻翻官方Wiki、Wikia和Google來了解更細節的說明。我第一次玩這遊戲就立刻沉迷，等我回過神來已經18小時了...購買與DLC說明http://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Steam/M.1417320457.A.535.html正體中文模組

Early Access Review
								I hope this game will one day leave early access and grace my account as a fully released game as it’s now been out over a year and feels very much complete. There aren’t many games under 150Mb these days that can give you as much entertainment as the likes of Prison Architect, and it really stands out amongst the ever growing crowd of top down, Theme Park types. Prison Architect flourishes with character and challenges the user with real choices in designing, running and planning a real prison environment. You truly do feel like god in this game and the real challenge comes from managing the character of the prisoners. Social anarchy amongst the prisoner is your biggest threat, but also the most amusing part of the game. You will forever be teetering on toppling your social structure and punishing prisoners for disobedience. It’s a fine line to walk and keeps you engaged & thrilled continually during your campaign. Only con’s so far is the steep learning curve and the price. Definitely a little over valued at RRP by about 30-40% but hopefully will reduce when it’s fully released so more people can enjoy the hell out of this game.  ",372,95,31,62,56,2,76

Early Access Review
								I absolutely love sandbox building games that aren't a cosmetic tea party.  This game has done nothing but amuse me as I've tried and failed to manage a prison properly probably a half dozen times now, but that's really the beauty of it. I could probably read a guide and get a lot of ""I win"" information, but games like these are just big ant farms slash chemisty sets where I like to be forced to evaluate my choices and try to balance a ton of factors into the plan. The best thing about this game is that everything is staged and nothing is instant. Your plan has to work from A to B and it's up to decide what you build or research next, but once you do you've sacrificed something and opened a hole somewhere. Eventually you have moments of stability where things seem to be going ok, but another wrench is thrown and the whole thing can spiral into chaos quickly.If you glanced at this and thought it would be a cheap imitation of something that should be labeled ""Tycoon"" and thrown in a bargin bin, then you are sorely mistaken. This is an OCD stress test of micromanagement, choice making and logistics. It feels like everything matters and sometimes it feels like  everything you do is 5 steps behind the thing you should have already been doing 10 steps ago. Of course you can pace the game at your choices and even play in full ""free"" mode where you have lots of money, but even still...you aren't inviting kittens into your Barbie Dream House that you are filling up full of cheap furniture. You are inviting murderers and thieves into a house full of other murderers and thieves and it's up to get a TON of variables to play nice with each other.  They are not stupid. They will revolt. They will try to escape. They will steal from the kitchen and try to stab people, etc etc.The scope to which this game has expanded is more than impressive and for a game that started off mentioning Dwarf Fortress as it's inspiration, it's created something even more unique that casts it's own shadow. Of course there have been other prison games, but this one has nailed so many concepts perfectly and given the track record for upgrades and patches, there will be more. I have found some bugs and the foundation system took me a while to really get my head around. I have to say the ""Planning Mode"" is something that every single builder type game needs to embrace right the eff now as well.This is a solid recommendation from me even in Early Access state. If you don't like to support that kind of thing, completely understandable. The devs are active and the game has had over 20 patches full of content and fixes just since I've bought it. I actually turned it on just to see how it was progressing and I'm sucked into it and hopeless trying to figure out how last more than 30 minutes without someone dying.  (I know I could read a guide or something but who the heck plays games like that?)			",271,40,20,83,74,3,101

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: As an Early Access Review, this will be subjected to change and editing as newer updates are released.INTRODUCTION:Prison Architect is a 2D top down prison building and management simulation game made by Introversion Software being financed by crowd-funding, pre-orders and Steam Early Access. Since it's initial release on 2012, the game has undergone several major updates (an average of 4 weeks per update) and has raised nearly $10 Million in revenue.PLOT (No Spoiler):The player takes on the role of a Prison owner, architect and governor who's objective is to create a prison from an expandable open world map. The player may choose the purpose of their prison either focused on reforming criminals, severe draconian punishment, or a mix of the two. Build the prison from scratch, hire guards and officers, staff and maintenance crew to keep it functioning, dog patrols to keep watch and many more. There is no end to the game, the player just needs to keep building and keep expanding until they decide to sell their prison and build a new one, or, have it burned to the ground because of a riot and find yourself in prison (seriously, your character can go to jail if you're grossly negligent in its management, ironically, in the same prison you built).PROS:+ Great 2D Art Style+ Good Tutorial: Comprehensive and easy to understand+ Vast variety of Characters (Staff, Officers, Prisoners, Guards etc)+ Expanding World Map: (Buy the adjacent lot to expand)+ Detailed Micromanagement System (Prisoner Regime, Guard/Dog Patrols, lock downs etc.)+ Detailed Construction System (Buildings, water systems, electrical wiring, computer controls etc.)+ Easy to install and uninstall MODS (Steam Workshop)+ Monthly Updates from the devs+ Old Computer friendly+ High ReplayabilityCONS:- Severe Performance Drop when the prison becomes very large (in size, prisoner and staff)- Lacking in Soundtracks- Occasional path-finding problems- No main menu (minor annoyance and not a deal breaker)- No Steam Cloud Support- Prisoners are released Naked sometimesCONCLUSION:GREAT EARLY ACCESS GAME. Prison Architect is what all Early Access games should try to be; it has constant updates, great art style, solid core gameplay, stable & playable and most importantly, easy on the pocket even at full price.WORTH IT?:MUST TRY, whether the game is at full price or sale, it's worth every penny and I fully RECOMMEND it specially if your a City Building / Simulation fan. To be honest, the game is technically finished in my opinion (just need a bit more bug fixing and performance improvements) and has more features than some of the other fully released games I've seen.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

Early Access Review
								Prison Architect is a mind-broadening experience, a game about building a prison, planning out cell blocks, balancing budgets, arranging schedules, maintaining peace, quelling unrest and thwarting escape attempts. It’s a not finished gaol-management sim that, despite still being under development, is currently available to purchase and play on Steam...and you should.Here’s how Prison Architect plays: you’re given a plot of land and a metric wodge of cash with which to build a prison. About a dozen men found guilty by a jury of their peers turn up once a day expecting the bare minimum of care afforded to them by the state. You can click on them to see their criminal records, but you have no direct control over their movements. Instead you plot out the foundations of buildings, which a team of workmen then construct, before designating functions to the rooms you’ve made. Hastily cobbled together holding cells will accommodate a few prisoners while you construct dozens of smaller individual cells. Showers must be hooked up to plumbing, cooks must be hired to work in kitchens, cafeterias must feed prisoners, guards must open and close locked doors in order to escort inmates, staff and visiting families to and from their destinations.A 24 hour clock ticks along, turning the day to night, with your prisoners adhering to a configurable schedule of sleeping, eating, yard time, work time and free time. The idea is to construct things in such as a way as to keep the largest number of inmates moving efficiently between their cells, showers, laundry rooms, workshops, yards and back to bed, all while keeping the system secure enough to detect smuggled contraband and deter escapees.Accountants and psychologists and security chiefs can all be hired and supplied with furnished offices to unlock new menu screens and information about your prison population. You can take on government grants, which offer you a cash advance in exchange for meeting certain criteria.Besides these grants, Prison Architect is a sandbox balancing act in which happy prisoners require costly amenities and unhappy prisoners will eventually riot, using contraband weapons such as screwdrivers stolen from workshops to stab up their fellow incarcerated. It’s a virtual delinquency ant farm in which you tread the line between your prisoners’ happiness and the prison’s efficiency and safety.et up metal detectors and order extensive searches of every cell and tensions will rise, but neglect to de-shiv your inmates in favour of a feel-good prison atmosphere and those happy prisoners will end up all stabbed to bits in a bodybag.Introversion are not shy about advertising Prison Architect’s in-progress state and their promise to you is that you are directly funding the ongoing development of the game with your purchase, in exchange for monthly updates and, eventually, a copy of the finished game.Prison Architect is a good game in its current state and pretty much the only early access game that hasn't disappointed so far.

												Prison architect is a prison simulator with a grid building system and an in depth prisoner needs system. Prison architect starts with the player immediately thrown into the game with hardy any tutorial. The real tutorial is the campaigns objectives. Once the player starts a game, they start with a small sum of money and must build a prison with the tools at their disposal. The player will build buildings for various rooms such as dormitories, cells, canteens, staff rooms, storage and other such necessities for the future prisoners and staff. The prisoners come in all shapes and sizes, as well as various security levels; minimum, medium and high security. These prisoners act like real prisoners, if there is a shortage of food, a heat wave, power outages, or even a death can cause a riot to break out. Prisoners can be kept happy by having visitation rooms, recreational rooms, time in the yard, or an increase in variety of food. Should a riot break out, riot police and firefighters are available to help put them back in line, and medical centres or morgues are available for the wounded or fatalities. Prison architect also has variety of options available when starting anew map, you can have weather as a factor, chose to have a large or small starting map, with our without trees, lakes or pre-existing buildings. Events are an interesting option, which can range from a power generator exploding, or a massive amount of prisoners arriving from another prison. Gangs can be turned on, which makes riots happen often, and if a gang leader is sent to your prison, the gangs can increase in size, and have wars over territory. Fog of war seems to be the most notorious of options. It prevents the player from seeing any prisoner unless a guard or camera is in the room, making it difficult, for the player to spot assaults or other such crimes. Overall prison architects objective is to rehabilitate prisoners through reform programs, such as school, culinary or workshop programs. These, if passed, provide the prisoner with valuable work skills reducing the chance of reoffending, boosting your prison grade. Prison architect does have a few things wrong with it.Some lag when laying wires or pipes on lower grade PCsLack of realism in the riots or fightingSlow to start for new players The ""campaign"" lacks real story or drive The names and descriptions of prisoners don't fit the actual crimesPrison architect does a lot right.Has a fantastic workshop Has relatively easy achievementsSatisfying gameHas a surprisingly fun escape modeArt and sound design are solidGood animations Fantastic in-depth needs system  Is prison architect worth the $32.99CAD? If you enjoy city builder type games, pick it up. Honestly if it goes on sale everyone should get it for their collection			",400,61,6,26,50,1,63

												I would recommend this game since I really like the concept and it's fascinating to see your prison run itself. It gives a bit of a Settlers vibe. However as they consider this game finished (It's not early access anymore), demand 28€ for it and announced the next update to be the last big one I cannot give it a recommendation.It just isn't done yet, and if you play for longer, the unfinished, unrefined and outright frustrating parts - none of which will be fixed by the update - will hit you in the face like a train. I'll list a few of those:- The temperature system is a complete afterthought and not done well at all. You can only lower temperature by having windows, and raise it with radiators. If your kitchen isn't adjacent to an outside wall, it will overheat constantly, and windows are always open, leading to your prisoners freezing in the winter. Radiators also can't be turned off in the summer. AC? Never heard of it.- The game rewards badly managed prisons over well managed ones. Prisoner deaths are not punished directly, technically they're even rewarded because they make room for new prisoners. Even if you have failure conditions activated, the chance of feeling actual punishment is low. What is punished are ""incidents"", which even a well run prison can barely avoid, especially with gangs activated. I can only say that I tried both, and the prison where I stuffed 300+ prisoners into a 120m² holding cell certainly rolled in dosh.- The calculations for dormitories have been broken forever. A dormitory with 3 inhabitants and 1 TV doesn't count as ""1 TV per 4 prisoners"". You have to have at least, I think, 5 prisoners in a dormitory for the calculations to hold up, which of course increases the chances of the inmates shanking each other.- Click, click, click, click. This game requires so much ♥♥♥♥ing clicking. The scroll speed is brutally slow so you have to click and drag with the middle mouse button to get around. And the developers apparently never heard of hotkeys, because you have to click to do absolutely anything. There are thousands of management and economy games that did it better. This game will murder your carpal tunnel.- Prisoner behaviour is disappointingly primitive. You'd think putting the power generator somewhere isolated and under guard makes sense because prisoners will try to sabotage it - they don't. You'd think they try to sneak into the storage room to steal some tools - they don't. I once tried a huge prison full of security flaws - the armory right next to the canteen with no walls in between, power generators out in the open... nothing happened. Not a single prisoner stole a weapon, or did anything else but get into minor fisticuffs with the guards.- Room assignment is painfully broken. Basically, whenever you add a room somewhere, the game sees it as ""reassign EVERYTHING to Shared"" and then suddenly you have max security prisoners in your min security block, cells in unfinished wings being occupied and prisoners strolling around the outskirts of your prison. This is obviously a hyperbole but seriously, you will suffer at least half a dozen escapes from this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.- Deliveries will mess you up. More specifically, mail deliveries. If your prisoners can't keep up sorting the mail, it will at some point just overflow your delivery area. And what does the delivery driver do if there's no more room for his mail? Why of course, he will just stay there and block the road for everything else - like food deliveries or prisoner buses. Solution for this? Click on a mail bag, click dump. Click on a mail bag, click dump...- The prisoner intake is convoluted and counterintuitive as hell. Something extremely simple like ""Give me 1 delivery of X medium security and Y maximum security prisoners"" can't be done. Instead there are ""Fill to X"" and ""X per day"" settings where the security level is determined in percentages. This has lead to me forgetting to close my prison and ending up with way too many prisoners so often I lost count.- The way patrols work is frustratingly idiotic. When finished with its shift, a guard will simply leave its post without waiting for its replacement, leaving your prisoners unguarded.- Maximum security doors can be destroyed. Fences can't. Your prisoners will outright give up any escape attempts if there's a fence surrounding your perimeter.- The game barely explains anything. I once tried to dismantle an object in a common room - the button just didn't do anything. Only later I found out that this room was occupied by a gang.- There's no borderless windowed mode.- And last but not least, the game - or at least the campaign - implies that you have a choice between running a prison based on fear and one based on making the inmates happy. This dualism may make sense IRL but in this game, it doesn't. If you have a prisoner with a certain set of traits, it becomes outright impossible to contain him. In real life, you'd put someone with 300 murders in his portfolio into a small room with no window and a massive steel door, but in this game, someone can destroy such a door with a single punch of his bare fists, then resist several tazer and shotgun hits and take out half a dozen guards. Then get healed up and do it again and again and again. The only way to avoid this is by making this demigod of a man happy, which in turn means that your SuperMax wing becomes the SuperLuxury wing. If this isn't counterintuitive to you, I don't know what is.			",187,25,5,26,30,1,33

Early Access Review
								Ever watch TV shows like Oz, Prison Break or Orange is the New Black and want to run your own prison? Now is your chance! Prison Architect is a simple, fun, top down, real time strategy, management, building game with a lot of depth yet it is so easy to pick up and play. While it is still 'Early access,' it feels complete and polished.Prison Architect is not like the Sims. You are just building a prison. Everything is not instantly done when you place it. You have workers that take time to go through your prison to carry out what you want. Not just that, but the trucks with the items need to arrive. It is a really nice system and the workers are fast and efficient enough to quickly carry out things. Your workers can die and if things aren't getting done quick enough, hire more workers. Every staff costs X amount to hire them, and Y amount to keep them employed every day. You have funds and a daily budget. Your daily budget cannot be in the red, that becomes the limitation and challenge of the game.Since this is a prison, every 24 hours new inmates arrive. You need to get ready for them. So you build walls, a holding cell, dozens of private cells, a shower, a yard, a kitchen and a canteen. Then you hire staff and place objects into each room to make them functional. Objects such as beds, benches, tables, kitchen cookers, freezers, a wide sofa for your staff room, desks for your offices and of course a variety of doors. Jail doors, large jail doors, staff doors, solitary confinement doors. These are all objects. Only guards can open jail doors so if one of your worker / laborers needs to get through they need to wait for a guard to let them through.When you start a game, you can select different things to make your game different, such as having randomly generated empty rooms and landscape. You can select whether or not to have 8 normal prisoners per day or a random number of maximum, minimum or normal security prisoners. This adds a lot of variety to each time you start a new game.The game lets you do whatever you want, but as a guide, it gives you optional objectives. You can only do 2 objectives at once. That's the beauty of this game, you pick the objectives whenever you want at any time. You're not pigeon holed into a scenario. When you select an objective you will receive a money grant to carry out the objective. There is no time limit. There is just a money limit. Run out of money doing a project and you'll be stuck waiting until your funds build back up. For the most part you are given more than enough money and once you're done with the objective you get the other half of the money. The objectives have a list of mini objectives that benefit and grow your prison. Everything to build a cell block that can hold 15 prisoners to all the steps needed to have a functional medical ward, which involve offices, doctors, an intermarry and a psychiatrist that need to be unlocked in bureaucracy.Once you hire a warden, he will open up bureaucracy, which is the game's version of unlocks. You can unlock a slew of new personnel such as a security chief that can unlock cameras, an armory and other things. You can even unlock an accountant that leads to land purchases for when you outgrow your plot of land. These are all nice touches that really let the game feel like your own.Since you are an architect, you need to lay out pipes and wires. Not just that, but you need to place water pumps, generators and conduits. Every room needs to have wires to it, big items such as freezers and monitors need wires directly to them. If you use too much power for your generator and conduits, it'll result in a power outage and then chaos happens. When it comes to toilets and showers, you have small pipes and large pipes, small pipes lose pressure the further they go, so you need to have large pipes, but the catch is inmates can use large pipes to crawl in and escape. So never have large pipes near inmates. There are other ways inmates can escape, such as tunneling, walking out if they break a door lock and go over an unattended wall.The game has emergency services so if you get uncontrollable riots, you can send in an emergency swat team and tell them where to go. If you have a fire, then call for the fire department and you'll see their hoses strung through your prison. EMTs can also be called in, but for the most part your medical ward / infirmary should handle things.You have a lot of control over the prisoners including their schedule, how much free time they have, when the have it, when they eat and when they shower. It is helpful for big prisons that have small facilities, you can have the minimum security prisoners eat when the maximums are showering and when the normal prisoners are in the yard. You can unlock restricting certain levels of prisoners to certain areas. On top of that you can even sell and buy stock from your prison.There is also a lot of unintentional comedy such as a K9 patrol using a broken toilet, workers getting cemented into walls, inmates killing guards with spoons, and of course the names of inmates and why they're in prison. On top of that there are mods and prison downloads, the game is really about having your fun the way you want to have it.In all the game is probably worth $30 and I rarely say that, but its been on sale plenty of times. You can sink a lot of time into the game and enjoy every second of it.			",1129,324,52,104,96,15,167

												I was hesitant to buy this game  at first as I was worried this game would be too complex for me, I could see that there is a lot to learn. A bit confusing at first with a steep learning curve. I reccomend playing through the story campaign mode which is also a tutorial. Playing through that helped me alot and enabled me to understand how to build my own prison and what is needed to keep it viable and running.This game is deep and well thought out.  Though it's a bit complex at first, prisons need to be planned carefully. There are too many bland, boring and lacking simulations. Fortunately this game is not one of them, it will keep you playing for many hours.I never get sick of building things and can always come back to this game when Iam not sure what else to play. I have played for over 200 hours at the time of writing this review and have not had any trouble with bugs or any crashing.I don't satisfy all prisoner needs as I like drama and having my prisoners riot regularly is fun.Otherwise it's boring if they behave and don't do anything wrong.So far I have sold 2 prisons and am building my third prison as it costs quite alot to build the prison you want. Though you can opt for unlimited funds, I built however I wanted, but my bank balance ended up being -2.5million in the red. Didn't like it, my prison felt worthless. You should first start out with getting all the grants you can, build along with what the grants require  and then sell when you run out of grants. Though what brings profit to a prison is workshops and a forestry.My second prison was a female prison and I did not like having a female prison as you get mothers who bring their babies with them and they need a much larger family cell as well as a seperate nursery area for them to eat with their baby, plus they have different needs than males, seem to have hygeine first, males exercise and aren't as violent as males.After 200 hours I ended up with a 1000+ prison valued at over 9million with 6million in funds without using any cheats.Escape mode seems like a tacked on after thought, not very exciting, quite boring. As the prisoner, you just damage things to get heaps of rep points, use points to skip punishment and repeat until you max out skills, it's rather quick to do. Then one hit punch kill guards and escape out the front door. I escaped when there was a riot happening, even though I was carrying keys, guards just ignored me as were busy trying to handle the riot and I just ran past them all and out the front door, when I ran out I had 3 groups of riot police chasing me, but the quick skill was maxed so managed to sprint and escape.Even though I like the game there are things that could be improved, but unfortunately looks like the developers are finished with the game, which is sad.Things aren't categorised well enough, objects in a object menu are a mess and can be hard to find unless you type out the name first, difficult for new players that may not be sure what they are looking for.I dislike that things aren't explained very well in this game, I was not sure how many cookers I would need or how many clothes a laundry provides, I had to look it up on a wiki to find out. That info should be in game, at least have it as a tooltip when you mouseover the object.But overall I recommend this game as I enjoy it mostly.Get this game if you love building, simulations and micro management.7/10			",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

""I KNEW I'D CATCH YOU TWO HERE""Build and manage a maximum security prison. That's what Store Page says. But it's not said that it's such a fun! I don't even know. I'll be honest with you and you can help me. Is there actually any deep building simulation like this? I didn't play a lot games like these, so this one is really absolutely awesome. And I believe it's objective not subjective.I consider Story Mode more like a tutorial or some in-depth preparation for your sandbox rampage and getting you ready to be biggest prison manager that ever lived. Whole story is not important addition and it's there more just for the sake of being not having any relevant weight. However, it's well-made and over each missions it will really prepare you. Some of optional objectives are pretty rough for beginners. Escape mode will give you opposite insight how prisoners live at the place you're able to build. There is just ton of ways how to escape and it really gives me feeling of real prisoner. Nearly close to Prison Break. Game supports Steam Workshop which will give you really lot of ideas, inspirations or just new ways how to play Prison Architect. Steam Achievements are well-choosen, they didn't have need of stacking 300 of them while 150 of them being totally useless. They selected few and every of them is important part of the game so. Kudos for that.Now, the building itself is really entertaining, deep and genius. You have to think about everything. Security, food distribution, clean laundry, electricity and water, deployment of units, patrols, checking cameras, taking care of your prisoners and in general it's logical. And brilliant. Game will last you easily above 20/30 hours. Well, it all depends on how long you will be entertained by building the prison, or if you want the Workshop maps or getting all achievements. For me best game Introversion Software made so far. Great job guys. Bonus Point: D.B. CooperRating: 8.5/10 ",94,13,6,7,12,1,6

												I don't think anyone wakes up in the morning and goes ""I want to build a prison today."" Penitentiaries just don't have the same feel-good appeal as cultivating a city or a business, really. I think the developers behind Prison Architect had this in mind the whole way through development, because it never really dwells on the darker elements of incarceration. What it does do is give you a wealth of building options, so many that you won't even have time to question the ethics of your creations.Prison Architect drops you off on a flat piece of land with a road running through it, and expects you to build a house of corrections. You're given an initial grant of money and some builders, and from that humble beginning you build cells, showers, kitchens, offices, power plants, laundry rooms, exercise yards, chapels, armories, morgues, classrooms... Honestly I don't have enough space to list out all the facilities you can place. The big selling point behind PA that will become immediately obvious is that you can build EVERYTHING. No detail is spared in how the prison is simulated, and every phone booth and ironing board must be accounted for.This incredible level of detail extends to your prisoners and the handling of them, as well. Each of your little ne'er-do-wells has a detailed rap sheet and biography, specific incarceration needs including security level, moods and interests, and a laundry list of stats that can be tracked. Of course, you can't just throw such complex sims in a hole and call it a day (okay you can but it won't end well). Your prisoners have a schedule to stick to that includes eating, showering, working, playing, and sleeping. You can edit this schedule to your heart's content, even setting different schedules for different security levels.There's still a boatload of systems I haven't even touched on like advanced security and visitation and work programs and research, but surely you get the point by now. Understand that while all this may sound daunting, Prison Architect handles it in a very gentle way. Early on, prisons don't need hardly any of the complex amenities, giving you time to unlock and familiarize yourself with them. You also have a huge list of options for customizing your difficulty, allowing you to even disable certain systems if you feel they make the game too complex. It's a consideration that more in-depth sims should adopt, because it means casual players and experienced managers can all find a pace they enjoy.It's rare to find such a deep and detailed simulation that also allows you to dive just as far as you want, and at your own pace. You can tool along with a mostly functional prison just with the basic food and shelter services, explore additional systems at your pace, or go whole-hog in an attempt to build the perfect penitentiary. The 2D vector graphics might not be the most attractive but their simple lines and animations help keep the detailed interactions of your prison clear. Sound design is admittedly minimal, but it's not much of a drawback when there's so much more offered. No matter your skill or interest level, Prison Architect will find a way to capture your attention.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												I have been playing this game since way back in the early access days and I am still as in love with it as I was back then.  It's  a game that can draw you in and hours pass by without you realizing it.  If you like games where you build and micromanage things, I believe you will love Prison Architect.  You build a prison that hopefully reforms the inmates while trying to fulfill their needs and keep the peace.  Gangs and events really help keep the architect on their toes.  In a blink of an eye chaos can and most likely will ensue.  Keep your eye out for legendary prisoners, they really make things interesting.  If having gangs and events are not your thing you don't have to use them.  You can just not select those things when you are setting up your new save.  I love how the devs gave us plenty of options and everything is not mandatory.   ",2,4,1,1,13,0,0

								Way better than it appears on the surface. I was pre-disposed with the graphics making the prisoners look less realistic than LEGO toys, but once you start to play, it becomes a non-issue. Designing a prison which almost runs itself is very satisfying, especially when trouble happens but your design means even minor issues are handled automatically. Sometimes big troubles may come and the most interesting part of this game is trying to find a solution to these troubles. You may finally have to re-design the whole area to find a reasonable solution. The weakness of this game is also very obvious. Some small bugs may be annoying but the biggest problem is the game becomes repeptitive after you'd setup a prison with all the features after a few days, which is also a common problem in most simulation games. A lucky thing is this game is still in the Alpha test. So users will get free updates including new features automatically, which could have become a paid DLC separated from the original game after the complete version is released just like what most fcvking EA games do.

												Early Access done right. One of very few examples of such a phenomenon. From the communications the devs had with the community through both written and video updates, to the constant patching of the game which added significant changes and additions at an incredibly effective pace.Truly, this game deserves your attention even if you're not interested in its gameplay mechanics or ideas. Simply because we ought to support this kind of transparent, respectful and talented videogame development. We need to show the rest of the industry that hard work and good communication is in the end rewarded.Oh yeah, and the game itself is of course really good. It's like a more complex and more free-form version of Theme Hospital, chock full of intentional and unintentional humor. It's virtually replayable ad infinitum due to the smart integration of really complex systems and mechanics that are still simple enough to get a basic grasp on quickly. And then you add the solid Steam Workshop integration that's already been out for months and months, molding into a vast web of minor tweaks and major total convention mods to further extend your playtime. Like the mod that lets you take control of a prisoner, and use the game's own mechanics to try and break out of your own (or someone else's) prison! How genius is that?!You could pay all the salary you're ever going to earn in your entire life, and you'd STILL be able to get a whole lot of bang for your buck with Prison Architect. And I'm not even sure if that's an exaggeration.16 shivs out of 10.			",329,55,5,29,30,2,35

												I've played this game since before it was on Steam, and let me tell you, it was 100% worth the price back in 2013, and even more worth it now. This game gives you lots of freedom; you can follow the campaign, go sandbox and do your thing, or even be one of the prisoners trying to escape. Plus, Prison Architect is just layer on layer of depth, with systems overlapping and mechanics interwining so well that it almost feels real.In short, there's no way I can't recommend this game... it's just too good.

												You know how you get bonus incentives in the form of cash for every day you go without an incident? I was 40 days in, recieving about $20,000 a day just for holding 30 low sec prisoners, until a guard told one prisoner that he looked stupid in grey, to which he replied ""u wot m8?"". That incident was enough to financially destroy my prison. Every day at least one guard told a prisoner that that color clashed with his natural complexion, so I would only see about $200 in daily profit and could hardly come up with the money to keep feeding the prisoners.10/10 hardest fashion sim out there.

Posted: September 10, 2016
												I would really love to recommend this game, but as it stands I simply can't do it for the full price. If you're able to find it on a good sale, go for it.The reason I can't recommend it is that I honestly believe that the devepeloper is moving on from this game far too soon. The recently released 2.0 is (in their own words) the last feature update, and the game will only receive bug-fixes from now on. I bought this game back when it was in early access because I saw a lot of potential in it, but sadly a lot of that potential will seemingly go unfulfilled. Guard assignments are a mess. Sure, they work, but the interface for it is awful and make setting up your guards needlessly tedious. The hourly schedule is one of the least intuitive implementations I can think of. The patrol routes apply to all guards, including dogs - so you can't have a dog patrol crossing a route that was meant for regular guards if you wanted to. You can get around that of course, but you shouldn't have to.You can't assign areas yourself. Areas are assigned when they're blocked off (like by doors). That means that if you're trying to make a fairly open prison you still have to put down doors to make these blocks. You have to do that because canteens and laundries supply these blocks, and if it's all one big block everything will go everywhere, which is obviously not very efficient. The gang system still seems very raw. It adds a challenge which is nice, but a lot of the mechanics seem very opaque. Non of the members will participate in any reform-programs (not even ones that aren't work related - such as spiritual guidance) and there doesn't seem to be any way that a gang member will ever leave a gang. Gangs can plan activities, such as planning a takeover of a yard, right in the middle of a bunch of guards, but there's no way of splitting them up or trying to prevent it from happening (you can prevent the actual takeover by having enough guards at the targeted location). Another curious (or lazy) mechanic is that gang members immediately know if their leader is being punished, even if the leader is in a different sector (or even another security level) with no gang members nearby.All policies are prison-wide. You can't have different policies for minimum and super-max prisoners. You can't feed them differently either. That means that if you choose to put gang leaders in super-max because you don't want them to interact with their members, you can't specify that they should never be put in solitary or lockdown (to prevent their members being mad when it happens, as mentioned above). This also means that you can't ask your armed guards in max-security to free-fire without armed guards doing it everywhere else too. The reform-program-page is lacking information. It shows number of prisoners in queue for a program, but it doesn't show which security levels they are. Once you get a big prison with a lot of programs running it also becomes a very long list to scroll, and a simple feature like minimizing a certain category doesn't exist.Power stations have limited power, and for whatever reason they can't be connected to each other. Again this makes for a needlessly tedious setup. Water pumps can supply unlimited water though.You can only hire one foreman. The foreman runs the workshop classes, so if you want to have multiple workshop classes (in different security levels for example) you either have to offset their work time or edit the savefile to hire more foremen. I have no idea why this limitation is there - it doesn't serve any purpose.The workmen aren't very bright. If you build (or dismantle for that matter) a long line of piping or electric cables each part seems to be assigned to seperate workmen, which means a lot of running for a lot of people. This will often slow down construction (especially as your prison, and by that the distances, grow), because a workman runs from delivery or storage to installation point and back again. Even if the material to carry out the order is right there he will run past it and let another guy run the same distance to do the job.Last, but not least, the game doesn't have a main menu when you start the game. No, I'm not kidding. Every time you start the game it just loads into an empty lot waiting for a prison to be built on it.Most of these things aren't really major, and the game works fine despite them. They are not things I would expect from a finished €28 game though. It was fine when it was in early access, and I honestly still didn't mind them that much when the game went out of early access. But I do mind that the developer now considers the game fully complete when I think there's a lot of features that point to the opposite. I don't regret buying it when it was on sale in early access, but I would regret buying it for the full price.Edit: I forgot to mention the complete lack of feedback messages when you can't do something. If a gang has taken over a yard, you can't build there. Unless you actually know in advance how gangs work, you won't know why. You just won't be allowed to build there. When trying to schedule a reform-program, sometimes you simply won't be able to because of lack of rooms or lack of personel to take care of the class. Again, there's no error message here telling you the problem - clicking the button to start the program simply won't do anything at all, and it's now your job to figure out why the game won't let you.

"" Inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and with over 1 million players having spent time inside, Prison Architect is the world’s best lock-­em-­up. ""Prison Architect is a sandbox game where you're building and managing your own Maximum Security Prison. That's the whole point of the game, actually.PROS  Build your own Prison - Is it gonna be male, female specific? Strict Punishing or completely peaceful prison? Up to you!  Endless Replayability - Get creative! With lots of features implemented in that game, you can create hundreds of different prisons. No matter how ridiculous they look!  Story Mode - A Huge in-game tutorial where you meet yourself with various objectives. From building the rooms, to choking the riots. You will be facing with the emotional cutscenes at some time, too.  Simulation - Your prisoners can be either happy, supressed, addictive (to common additions), or even suicidal depending on your Policy, Regime and many other actions.  Escape Mode - An intense gamemode if the prison meets the criterias of High Security. Have you got what it takes to escape your own prison?  Workshop - Try out other player's creations. Not just prisons, by the way!  Name In Game [DLC] - With additional content, you could, for example, add your family members, friends, or even your enemies in your prison,CONS  Lots of Minor, yet noticable Bugs - During it's 2 year Early Access, the Prison Architect was in unstable shape. Even out of the beta state, the game still has some major bugs to fix.  The Collectibles - It's not a major thing, but the game features the collection of Polaroids and Bible Pages that are somewhat rare thing to find. It can become stressful for Collectors to find every single rare piece of Bible Page.I, honestly, never thought that I would find this sandbox game that entertaining.Recommending this game to anyone!

												Prison Architect is a fun, interesting, and unique Zoo Tycoon-esque game that is (currently) in it's alpha stage. If you are familiar with any tycoon games, the formula is very similar. Build a prison and it's facilities, get prisoners, micro manage everything, rinse, wash and repeat. That being said though Prison Architect, like many games of it's genre, never gets old. It is always fun to experiment with new designs and features (which are constantly being implimented) and to see how your prisoners react to them. Not to mention, the game is incredibly polished for an alpha. I would reccomend this even if the current build was the full game. So if you're looking for a game which you can consitantly come back to, Prison Architect deserves your time and attention.			",176,44,3,19,28,1,23

Early Access Review
								2014-12-16Early access done right - Prison Architect is an early access game that is actually updating and has a team supporting it. There are consistent updates that actually add major features and improve the game, and this has been going on for a long time already. As it is an alpha, there are some bugs, which are actually being fixed. But aside from that, on to the game itself.Players in Prison Architect are set to manage a prison, which as the name implies they get to design themselves. Once the facility is constructed, in part or completely - Your choice, the player can allow in prisoners and manage day to day operation. Arrange for the prisoner's schedules for when they work, eat, sleep and so on. But keep in mind, the prisoners don't want to stay in prison. Some may not try it unless you just plain allow them to walk out the front gate, but others are more active about their attempts to escape or make life suck less. They arrange for tools and drugs to be thrown in over your outer walls, they take knives from the kitchen if they can get to them, and they'll try to dig tunnels to get out.Special attention is to be paid to the possibility of a riot. Prisoners can decide to start taking over, they can raid the armoury, knock down guards to take their stuff, or kill eachother. They aren't friendly people, most of the time.And you need to make sure they don't fall right back into their criminal habits after they're released.Teach them carpentry, send them to a basic education, treat their addictions...And make sure they don't think of your prison as a comfy hotel, it's not a vacation for them, it's a punishment. Time for the sentences appears to pass at a rate of one year per ingame day, and while this may not sound like it will have prisoners last long enough to do anything, many of them are in for 20 or more years, and some may show up with part of their sentence already done.Your income, as money does not grow on trees, comes from a few sources. A basic daily income, plus an income per prisoner, and income from the workshop. When you're teaching these prisoners a skill, you may as well profit from it, but of course, not all of them are bright enough to be able to learn workshop safety classes.I have mentioned money does not grow on trees, but that was only partially correct. The trees are money, as the wood is cut into boards and sold, or taken to the advanced carpentry stations for prisoners to create furniture out of. While probably not intentional, you can play Logging Station Architect instead. You just never take any prisoners and just plant trees to sell the logs. It's a slow way of earning money, and it is not anywhere near as fast or satisfying as running a prison, but the option is there. You can also sell off a prison you already made and use the money to start a new one, which allows you to continue playing the sold prison as well, though you can only sell it once.The graphics may take some getting used to, but they fit the game and make things easy enough to see what is going on and where things are. The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't shiny 3d models as most games use these days. In the end, Prison Architect is a great management/prison simulation game with great support by a great developper, and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in management or simulation style games			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												So, I built my prison, and decided to try out escape mode. I had an idea of what it was about, so I had a strategy planned out. I'd use my starting character to tunnel out (staying in medium security while doing so), and using tougher prisoners to do all my dirty work, like bringing tunneling materials to my cell. They'd go up to maximum security, which I would use to get more points to recruit more people, to bring more tunnelling tools. So I'm sat there, a guy called Cliefe, with basically no punishments. However, I recruit someone with the surname ""Redman"". He's a skinny guy, red hair, bumped up to maximum security. I then decided to try and use Redman to fight guards. At this point, Redman has been upgraded pretty highly. He can one-shot people, shrug off being tazed, and start riots. Redman breaks into the psychologist's office. He steals a lighter. Redman begins to burn the Common room to the ground. He kills every guard. The common room is burning to the ground, the fire has spread to other rooms. Half the prison is on fire, Redman has started a riot. Redman is unstoppable. Redman is carrying the team on his shoulders while Cliefe sits doing nothing in medium security. Redman has seen hell, and he doesn't want to stay. Redman stands while the prison burns to the ground - he's burning to death. But if he dies, he dies a maytr, a figurehead of a greater cause that is escaping prison. He sprints. The walls have burnt down. Redman is an unstoppable wild beast. The snipers have their sights trained on him, but Redman is too fast - he escapes. The prison that I worked hard on, spent hours on, poured huge amounts of effort into running has been totally destroyed, alongside nearly all the guards, prisoners, and staff that worked there. 10/10			",33,5,0,8,5,0,1

												I've been in prisons (worked, not a resident) and let me tell you, they're no fun. It's not just the company, it's the smell. The smell of body odor. It's always there. It never goes away. It creeps into your hair, your clothes, the concrete. Even the food starts to taste like body odor.And someone is going to make a game of building a prison? This is an  idiotic idea. It can't possibly be any good.Yet somehow, it works. It is good. I've spent many hours planning and building my little lovely facilities to keep some virtual peeps In Her Majesty's Service. It's great fun designing and executing a plan while ensuring the little delinquents are fed and happy (well, as happy as they can be). It's even more fun to then take away their toys and watch them become miserable lunatics while painting the walls crimson. Look, the game is simply one of the best builders you can find out there. It's wonderfully executed and it's wonderful to execute someone. 10/10, would do slave labor again.			",81,36,8,60,54,5,57

												This is truly the best prison sim i have ever played.There are other PS's on the market but none come close to Prison Architect.One of the main things i hated about prison tycoon was the micro managment, Setting sceduals for each prisoner as they come in... Segragating gangs And if you have 200+ inmates it can be anoying as hell.But PA really nailed it, Just the right amount of micro managing, The GFX and anamations are kinda week when compairing to newer title games but i love it.And even tho we are out of alpha regular updates are still coming out.New fetures, Content and a grupe of ppl that really have made a wonderfull game.If you got the cash, Buy it!Ill admit i pirated it at first.. Back in like alpha 14, But after some time i started feeling guilty that i had this amazing game but wasnt supporting the dev's.. So i had to buy it.I still pirat games and movies and dont care, But prison architect is just that good that i do care.Thank guys you made a really great game here!!			",4,1,0,0,1,0,3

Early Access Review
								Prison Architect is still in alpha - but you really wouldn't know it.  The game is as feature-rich as a complete product (moreso, if anything) and there are no game-breaking bugs. So, what is it?Prison Architect is a nod back to the micro-management games of old (I'm avoiding the word 'tycoon' because that has become a hackneyed term to mean simplified 'make lots of money' cartoon game).  It's pure sandbox so don't let the first 'mission' put you off.  It did me (I didn't find it interesting) and didn't then play the game for a year or more, but that first mission is pure tutorial just to show you how the very simple tools work.  You are then left on your own with a blank canvas and all the tools you'll need for designing your own prison.How complicated is it?It's not at all - but it can be if you want it to be.  It's genius in design for that.  You can be in the game and designing your own prison very quickly indeed without needing to be bogged down in all the minutiae of prisoner and roster management, but the beauty of the game is that, if you WANT that level of micro-management, you can.  You can set individual punishments and such for prisoners, but you don't have to.  You can schedule different daily timetables for each level of security prisoner so there are no clashes and inevitable riots, but you don't have to.  You can individually manage reform program scheduling, but you don't have to.  You get the idea.  The game automates all these things by default, but allows you to override them if/when you want to.Of course, getting a prison off the ground AND making money is that usual tycoon balancing act.  You have to start building foundations, but you can't go too large too soon otherwise you will be bankrupt overnight (and game over).  You can't expand one area too quickly (e.g. cells) unless you have the infrastructure in place to support them (bigger canteens, showers, and more utilities).  And not everything is available to you right away: you unlock  specialist staff and services as you go, providing a feeling of achievement on top of the creative aspect of the game.  The fun is in finding that balance and making your very own Alcatraz (or Reform Centre if you feel like being a benevolent architect).  The game scores you on the overall effectiveness of your prison (determined by how many riots and escapes you've had versus reformed and released prisoners unlikely to reoffend).It's a PRISON game - how is that even fun?!Oh, but it is!  If you like designing and tweaking 'something', then this is your game.  Maybe you played Rollercoaster Tycoon, or Transport Tycoon, or even Simcity or Theme Hospital.  Bear in mind that it's pure sandbox (right now at least; I vaguely recall reading that missions might be added later but don't take my word for it).  You have a planning tool that will allow you to freeform-design your layout without committing any money, then build on top of your design after.  The fun is in creating a layout you want, and balancing it to make it work well (no good sticking a dining hall at the other end of the map if prisoners cannot reach it in their allotted mealtime slot).About that 'alpha' thing...Yeah, it's not even beta, but don't be fooled.  This is in a better state than any other beta game I've tried.  There are elements still to be finished (the execution chamber does nothing I believe, despite its appearance in the tutorial mission, and some things don't seem to have much effect on environment yet), but Introversion have been updating the game very regularly over two years.  I joined the alpha at its earliest stage and still the updates come.  Even if they didn't, this is a complete and playable game exactly as it is right now, and I have close to 160 hours recorded in the Steam version alone.Mod supportThe game has an incredibly open mod support scheme and there are plenty of popular mods in the Steam Workshop right now.  I've tried the Women's Prison mod and it is easy to activate or deactivate each mod in the game.  An excellent design.  Of course, with the game changing periodically there is no guarantee that mods will continue to work for each iteration, but their easy removal means no worries.In summaryPrison Architect is a game that most certainly doesn't feel like an alpha (or even beta).  Get past the somewhat awkward-feeling introductory mission and you have all the tools needed to design your own prison.  It's a micro-management sandbox simulator that's easy to get into, fun, and will inevitably sink far too many hours of your time!  Highly recommended, and a great example of crowd-funding at its absolute best.			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

Early Access Review
								I love tycoon/building games, like Sim City, rollercoaster tycoon, etc. This game doesn't disappoint. In fact in some ways it's better.PA offers you the fun of building something, i.e. a prison, but with the details of running it as well, which you don't get with every game. You get to decide a lot more then some broad overviews of the world. You can deicde how everything works, when it works, cut cost, spend more, care for the prisoners — or don't it's up to you.The game does have some issues, such as on MAC I don't see any of the proper icons/graphics when I play the game outside of SAFE mode. It loads into your save fast and then fromt here your fine. Occasionally something breaks in the game and the devs are fast to respond and deploy a fix or include it in the next update.Personally this game could be released now, however I understand and don't want people to buy the game and it have some bugs and think that it was hald♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because of a a few minor problems.EDIT (3/13/2015): As the game has develoepd the features of the game have only gotten better, and more detailed. The Devs. tend to be pretty good about helping players fix any problems, even if it's a ""Yes we know about it, and are working on it."" kind of response, and I've found that means it's either coming in the next patch or major update. There is also the constant addition and tweaking of the minor details one might want. Liek the ability to tell prisoners they can use this Yard area only, and not this one. To deploy gaurds, or to now add a library/chapel to your prison.			",7,3,0,1,12,0,1

								This Review is written at the time of Alpha 15Did you ever want to build a prison? Taking care of locking the scum of society away and setting them on the electric chair? *  Well then Prison Architect is the game for you. But the first few hours you play Prison Architect, you will be overwhelmed by it’s options and features. It has a very steep learning curve and currently no real tutorial that explains how every mechanic works. You are playing an Alpha. Prison Architect is exactly what you want it to be. Do you want to build a prison, where no one will ever break out of? Fine.Do you want to make your prisoners so angry that they will start a riot and flee once they get a chance? You can do that, too.Your prison is divided into different rooms. Each serves a special purpose. A cell to lock a prisoner away, a kitchen to cook food, and many more. It is your job to plan a layout and build those rooms, while managing your money and the needs of your prisoners. Those needs range from very easy to satisfy ones, like hygiene to ones that require special rooms to satisfy like clothing. Keeping up with the needs of your prisoners is the most important thing in a good prison, if you fail to do so you prisoners will eventually start a riot and injure or kill your staff.Once you have run out of land to build on, you can either expand the land you own and your prison, or you can sell your current prison and start a new one with the value of your last prison added as bonus cash. Steam Workshop integration. It is very easy to share your prison with the rest of Steam. Two clicks and you have either shared your prison or already downloaded others from the workshop. So, where’s the catch? As mentioned before Prison Architect is still in Alpha. And there are still bugs and performance problems with prisons that have 150+ prisoners, but almost every month a new  patch comes with fixes and new game mechanics. *It is currently not possible to execute prisoners.

												This is a tough one. If Steam reviews had a neutral option, I'm sure I'd pick it, but as it stands, I can't recommend this game.I've played it a lot in a short space of time, so it clearly has some good things going for it. As a building sim, it reminds me of Banished - which I like a lot - in that things don't happen immediately, and that people (prisoners and staff members in this case, villagers in Banished) are your most important resource. Progress is slow but satisfying, which is how it should be. I also love that it has a campaign mode, something which is missing from many building games, but is present in the very best ones, like Zeus: Master of Olympus.The reason I can't recommend it is that it is still very, very flawed. The user interface is the biggest culprit. In the course of my campaign, I had to Google far too many things which just aren't explained anywhere in the game. It doesn't really contain a manual; clicking the help button takes you to a website - have fun playing offline! Here are some of my gripes, in whatever order they come to mind:- The campaign objectives are seriously messy. One objective is ""place a payphone in every yard"". Doing that didn't meet the objective, so I had to look it up. It turns out that you have to place *five* payphones in every yard. This information isn't present in the game at all, not even as a tooltip.- Objectives are also prone to reappearing after they've been completed. One objective requires all staff to be well-rested at the same time. As soon as that happens, even for a moment, the objective is met and the reward is paid, but any time a staff member gets exhausted afterwards (which seems to be unavoidable), it'll appear as unmet again.- Guard patrols can't cross one another without interfering, and all three patrol types - regular guards, armed guards and guard dogs - share the same patrol colour, which is ridiculous.- Selecting multiple people is needlessly difficult. There's no shift+click mechanism to select two guards; you can drag a box around them, but that's it, and if other people happen to be in that box, you'll select them too. And after you give someone a move instruction, they are immediately deselected, so you can't move them a little at a time. That's something that would be really useful when dealing with fires or recapturing a prison after a riot.- Connecting more than one power generator to the same grid results in neither of them working. Again, I found this online after I had already done it.- Right click should really deselect objects like it does in 99% of building games, but it doesn't.- Some prisoners are ""entitled"" to higher-quality cells than others. I have no idea why, and it never seemed to affect my prison population adversely that I made all cells the same quality (3). On the rare occasion when I made better cells, I couldn't figure out how to move prisoners to new cells manually. Such a mechanism exists, but it's not explained.- A lot of the objects are purely cosmetic. For example, staff need wide sofas for their staff rooms but they never seem to actually sit down...- On a related note, I never figured out which objects I actually did need more of. Cookers for the kitchen? It seemed like it. Washing machines for the laundry? Maybe, but I never saw more than one in use at a time.- The room size constraints feel very arbitrary at times. Why does a dog kennel need to be at least 5x5 tiles when a dog crate is only 2x1 tiles? What if I only want one dog? Thankfully, this behaviour can be changed with a mod, but it shouldn't come to that.- I had to save and reload my game to fix a bug where workers thought an area was ""too dangerous"" when it wasn't.- Prisoners don't seem to need much sleep at all. I started off giving everyone eight hours a night, and eventually brought it down to six, but even then, prisoners would be awake for half the time. And the lights never actually go out, even though the tooltip for the ""sleep"" regime component says that they do.- It gets very dark outside, though, which is a pain when it comes to building. Many simulation games allow the player to toggle daylight while building without disrupting the actual clock, but not this game.- Prisoner movement in general isn't simulated very well. I was very careful to restrict which areas my prisoners could go to, but my ""intelligence"" suggested that all sorts of illicit trades were taking place in completely off-limits areas. Even when I had guards patrolling them, I never, ever saw any prisoners in those areas, yet they were apparently rife with drugs, weapons and luxuries.- Speaking of luxuries, why do mobile phones not set off the metal detectors? My shakedowns usually turned up only a handful of most items but dozens of phones at a time. Somehow my guards never noticed a single phone in use though. Guards seem pretty useless in general. They're mostly just glorified doormen.- I also couldn't figure out how to search an individual cell without its resident prisoner being there. My confidential informants told me where to find drugs but I couldn't do anything about it except order a prison-wide shakedown. Great.- The confidential informants also do nothing except arouse suspicion if you don't have a security office, but that's not explained either.- When I first booted the game, it went straight to the campaign, which was strange, but acceptable. What I found really poor is that whenever I subsequently re-opened the game, it would jump directly to sandbox mode, not the campaign mode that I had just been playing, without presenting a menu or asking if I wanted to load a save file. Another quirk is that closing the menu unpauses the game if it was paused before. Such a simple bug could easily have been fixed, but no.- Opening the language menu always seems to freeze the game for about ten seconds, presumably because it was loading community language packs, including about fifty Russian duplicates, which I'm never going to need.- One of my biggest annoyances: there is a single volume control for the entire game rather than separate controls for music and sound effects. I ended up playing with the whole game on mute.- The time lapse function is hidden away in the menus. Some games, like Mini Metro, automatically record a timelapse which can be played back at the end of a stage, but this game doesn't advertise it at all, so if you've already built your ultimate prison and want to look back on how you got there, it's too late.- There are lots of floor options but they're almost all ugly. The text overlay seemingly can't be switched off and is often placed really poorly.- The objects dialog should really be sorted by room type, but instead, it's all a big mess. I often had to resort to searching for what I wanted by typing it in.- There should have been more deployment options. There's ""min/med/max security prisoners only"", but how about ""everyone EXCEPT max security prisoners""? Guards can also only be deployed to entire blocks, which is pretty useless if you try to keep things ""open plan"", minimising the number of doors, since they slow people down.- It's very hard to determine if you've allocated enough laundry and canteen services. There's no direct indicator; you have to follow prisoners' needs and see if they start complaining about it.Honestly, there are more problems, but this review is character-limited. I had fun with the game because I was willing to look so many things up myself, but I could not, in good conscience, suggest it to an inexperienced player. Luckily I picked it up in a bundle, because I'd feel pretty ripped off if I'd paid full price for it. It simply feels unfinished. Good building games have a level of attention to detail completely missing from Prison Architect.Not recommended.			",29,16,4,11,11,0,12

 Heist, anyone? Ok, although you can't perform heists in this game, you can pretend that you where taken here for failing one. - Pros  Extremely detailed gameplay The implementation of temperature is cool (pun intended), but sometimes seems like the game could just do without it (it can be disabled) Great fun to play as the prisoner either in your own prison or one for the Steam Workshop -Cons  Sometimes it gets a little frustrating when you cant cross over power cables coming from different power generators, but it is something I can live with It takes a reasonably long amount of time to collect all the Bible pages and Polaroids which is annoying because it is an achievement to collect them all, meaning that achievement will take a while to get In Prison escape mode it is sometimes easy to slip past metal detectors which takes some of the challenge away from the game, but again it is fixable by not doing it -Features I'd like to see  Multiplayer!!! Specifically in the prsion escape mode as it would be great to tag along with a friend and escape a prison together As temperature was added a little while back it would be nice to see A/C to cool the prison rather than just windows (not the operating system)Now unfortunately no free cake or other confectionaries are included with this game, but it is a small sacrifice to make with such a well developed game.Download size: ~300mb   -maybe less because I have prisons and stuffTrading cards: 8        -all roughly around 6p (in GBP)Achievement count: 18   -at the time I wrote this reviewAchievement difficulty: Easy-MediumRating:9/10Recommendation:I personally highly recommend it especially if you like games such as Simcity but with a twist, but without the city building bit but like the economy and stuff is similar...to some extent.

												Long-time player here, I've been supporting the game and the team for a few years now. For starters, this game has a huge mod database, and mod community continuing to produce for it. Developers see this and notice that some mods need to become supported by an official patch, and they are implemented. These guys have worked their asses off to prove the Early Access system wrong, and they did. This game is a sucess and proves what backers can do for developers who put their heart into their game.Game has minimal, if any bugs with vanilla base game. When you put in mods in any game you run the risk for bugs, thankfully the base game experience provides a simply incredible game, one that doesn't actually NEED modifications, but if you want them, plenty exist.Must buy for those who enjoy city builders, or simulation games.

												Prison Architect has the potential to be a fantastic game.The gameplay is incredibly addicting. You will experience the same urge that something like the Civ series will give you, except ""just one more turn"" becomes ""just one more room/building"". Once I had begun the third iteration of my prison with $500k in funds, the fun was really getting started as I had the ability to build what I wanted instead of what I had to do to get by.Or so I thought.Once my budding prison complex reached ~175 prisoners, I noticed something; the frame rate had begun to drop.. Surely this game with its 2D sprites wasn't slowing my gaming rig down...or was it? By 250 prisoners I was down below 30 FPS.Upon further inspection, it wasn't just the FPS that had dropped; the actual pace of the game seemed to be tied to the frame rate. What was 3x game speed had now slowed to a stuttering 1x game speed. A quick search of the internet revealed the root cause of the issue (and that I was far from alone).Prison Architect is a processor-heavy game. This is expected and normally not a problem; there are a lot of things happening at once when you reach the point where 500 entities are ""thinking"" and moving simultaneously in your game world. However, what IS a problem is the fact that Prison Architect only runs on one of your processor's cores, with no hyperthreading. The 3.0 GHz eight core beast sitting in the case next to me might is about as useful as the Celeron in grandma's laptop. This means that EVERYONE who plays this game, regardless of their rig's power, is going to experience the same slowdown once they get to ~200 prisoners - which is RIGHT when the game has sucked you in and you are ready for the long haul.Prison Architect is insanely fun. I spent roughly 16 of the last 48 hours playing it. Unfortunately, it's so poorly optimized that it will eventually become virtually unplayable if I continue to feed my new addiction.I cannot recommend Prison Architect to anyone in its current state. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for letting this issue exist for so long. If things change in the future, I will edit my review.Edit: After 4 months and 4 more updates to the game, this is still unfixed.			",61,9,0,15,20,0,26

												Finally, it is fully released. What can really be said about this game that hasn't already been said? It's an amazing tycoon game and I, daresay, the best Prison game I've ever played. The core concepts are simple, you build a prison with the intent on making money. You make money by accepting grants, getting more prisoners and having a bigger prison. With more inmates, comes more issues, thus requiring more money. Excess money is spent on research, salaries, expansion and general upkeep. You can build your prison however you want within the map size and I've seen some crazy prison layouts from other players (the Enterprise prison and automated prisons come to mind). They have even added in a campaign mode and you can take control of the inmates and bust out of the prison. This is a damn good game and I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in Tycoon-esque games. Word of advice, don't leave any doors open and get metal detectors as soon as possible.Gameplay Footage:

The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty.

								Made a prison with the starting budget and grants. There was a lovely riot (20% prisoners dead), and I decided to sell and let the feds run the place.Used the not insubstantial funds to build another prison. This was much better. When I had a riot, half of my prisoners died. I sold the place.I then built a third prison with almost a million dollars. I nurtured it up to 500 inmates, and then something amazing happened.There was a riot, and a war ensued. In the great battle for the kitchen, 456 prisoners and guards lost their lives.Thank gabe for freefire. Thank gabe for Prison Architect.			",49,4,0,1,7,1,12

												An inmate is attempting to escape my prison. He's running along a path between two cell blocks, with a baton wielding guard in pursuit. As I pan the camera to follow the prisoner, I notice some activity at the front gate. A couple of workmen are carrying building materials for my latest construction project. The guard closest to the gate opens it to allow the workmen to enter, and I watch with a mixture of horror and embarrassment as the prisoner times his run perfectly to pass through the open gate, and out to freedom.This anecdote perfectly illustrates everything you need to know about Prison Architect, the simulation game where the player has to build a prison and manage its day to day operations. The main sandbox game mode doesn't have a scripted story (there is a basic story in the tutorial mode), but there's lots of potential for each player to talk about unique events that happened to them. You'll spend alot of time discovering problems and figuring out how to fix them (I solved the above hole in my security by extending the outer fence and adding a second ""inner"" gate so that anyone coming in or out has to go through both gates). And unlike other management games, there's a constant feeling that your ""customers"" are actively trying to ruin all your hard work, and at any moment it could all burn down around you - literally.Each prisoner has a list of needs, such as sleep, food, hygiene, exercise, family and recreation. If you don't fulfil these needs, the prisoners will get angry and eventually start a riot. So you have to make sure you've got a big enough kitchen to keep everyone fed, build showers, hire janitors, give prisoners some yard time, let them meet family in a visitation room, and relax by playing pool or watching TV.As you would expect, inmates will sometimes attack and kill each other, smuggle contraband and try to dig tunnels to escape. To combat this you can hire normal guards (equipped with batons, upgradeable to tazers) and armed guards (guns) and select which areas of the prison to deploy them. Guard dogs are good at sniffing out contraband and detecting tunnels. You can place CCTV cameras and metal detectors. In the event of a riot you can call in special riot police and firemen. Prisoners caught breaking the rules can be punished with solitary confinement.If you choose to try to improve the lives of your prisoners, you can give them training so they can work in the kitchen, workshop, library or laundry. You can give them treatment for drugs and alcohol addiction in the infirmary, let them seek religion in a chapel or give them an education in a classroom. This all contributes to ""reform"" which influences the chance that they commit another crime after being released from prison. This ""reoffend rate"" is the closest thing the game has to an overall goal. The lower the rate, the better your prison is performing. Or you could just ignore the prisoners' well being and try to make as much profit as possible. The player has complete freedom to design their prison how they want.I do have some complaints. The tutorial campaign is quite basic, and there's alot of stuff that isn't explained. Once I started building my own prison from scratch in the sandbox I had to find answers to lots of questions on the forums. And the framerate starts to die when your prison gets quite large. My framerate was a constant 60 fps until I reached around 300 inmates, but now I've got 500 its just barely staying above 30 fps. Its still playable (framerate isn't as important for this kind of game as it is for a fast paced action game) but I'm not sure I want to go for the 1000 inmates achievement because I expect it would get even worse. Overall Prison Architect is a really fun, extremely deep game. There's a ton of more complex systems I've not even mentioned here, but at the same time its not overwhelmingly difficult to learn how to play. I definitely give a strong recommendation to Prison Architect. I've played almost 30 hours just doing the tutorial and building one prison, so there's easily enough playing time to justify a full price purchase.			",145,31,0,15,8,2,16

Too much freedom behind bars?Prison Architect is a great little simulator in the mould of Theme Hospital/Park, where you have to build and look after your own private institution.It starts off at 100mph as you uncover the reasons behind a brutal double killing and a prisoner's subsequent execution.Before long, an intuitive interface and design means you quickly pick up the basics and can run a reasonable establishment.As you progress, more options of how to deal with your prison population become available.You'll need them too; that cosy institute of placid inmates diligently counting down the days to their release and reintegration into society will soon morph into a violent cesspit lurching from one crisis to another.Right under your eyes inmates will be arming themselves and hatching plans to escape - before you know it a huge riot is under way and a gang armed with drills and shanks are making a beeline to the exit, armed with the keys of a guard they gutted in the corridor.I predict a riotBut more often than not you can quickly rectify a problem when it arises by chucking money at it; spam a few guards in the canteen when Dragos and his buddies kick off and the uprising is quashed.You won't be sort of money either; it's easy to get very generous grants by fulfilling the meagre criteria needed for most of them.Coupled with a very short campaign (which is really a tutorial), you run out of 'things to do' fairly quickly and you're left with the sandbox mode.This might be ample for some people, but as someone who likes a challenge, building a prison free of any real pressures or targets is quite boring.Yes, you can make things more difficult for yourself by doing things like accepting the maximum amount of prisoners on each intake, but it's an artificial goal with no benefits or consequences.And, of course, you're playing alone.A multiplayer option putting prisons head to head, for example, would be brilliant, or rival players trying to break out/take over a prison is another opportunity missed.That said, this is an excellent little game well worth a buy.Pros:- Slick design and interface- Easy to learn the basics- Absorbing gameplay- Brilliant prison escape mode- Good mod integration- Sandbox modeCons:- Very short campaign- No multiplayer- Too easy/lack of challenges in sandbox mode- Can become repetitive Overall 8/10 ",20,2,0,4,4,0,9

												This game is glorious.The graphics/artstyle is quite amazing.The music.....well so far I can only hear it in campaign mode and during riots, once I listen to the whole soundtrack, I'll share my opinion.And the gameplay is so much fun like it's the best ""lock'em'up"" game you have ever played; From seeing the workmen building the prison to inmates arriving and get on with their lives. Although once you finished building your prison, that's pretty much it other than trolling your prisoners or play Escape Mode.Ah yes, the Escape Mode is also my favourite aspect of the game (probably better than The Escapists) you get to play as an inmate and you can start ♥♥♥♥ing thing up in the prison including starting fights, set objects on fire, kill everyone (including visitors....even those who are under 13! Inb4 PA gets controversy complaints)You can play Escape Mode on someone else's prison on the Steam Workshop although I wish that we have needs in the game (Food, Sleep, etc) including interactions to furniture....you know, instead of trying to escape, you should follow the regime. Oh and able to join gangs manually.Also mods, there's mods everywhere in the Steam Workshop.Examples like texture mods, object mod, campaign (experimental) and more. Ever wanted to make your own Fallout Vault instead of a prison? Ever wanted to complete more grants for more money? Ever wanted to improve the game's sprites? Ever wanted to force the game to have a riot because.....for fun? Ever wanted to change the warden into a loveable Gaben? Well whatever the case you want....This game is so addicting,This game is definitely worth your time.This game is for you.9/10One of the best indie games I've ever played[Also I bought this game just one day before the release of V1 so....can I still have my early supporter badge, IV? :3]			",105,13,0,7,10,2,3

I'm a Time-Travelling DictatorI have to ration how often I load this game, as I'll start playing it and then wonder how I've invented time travel, 6 hours passing in the blink of an eye. It also made me realize I'm a bit of a cruel dictator when it comes to human rights. I build the smallest possible, cramped yet efficient rooms, give the bare necessities in visitation and entertainment, lock up prisoners who complain and make the rest work 10 hours a day, all whilst banking fat cash into my account and cackling maniacally.An In-Depth SimulationThis is a somewhat realistic simulation of the basics of human life in a prison. Each prisoner has needs, and you have to meet those needs by building a variety of rooms and filling them with objects. It sounds simple, but the gameplay is fairly complex, with emotional, psychological and physical needs all coming into play.The mechanics are straight forward seeming, but it's easy for riots to start and things to escalate wildly out of hand. Oops, turns out people reeeeally don't like it if you don't feed them. There is a deceptive amount of strategy and forward thinking required that makes each prison you create more efficient as you build up your knowledge. My first one burned to the ground and resulted in a few dozen guards getting shanked whilst the prisoers escaped... yeah okay, not only should I have fed them, I guess I should have built prison walls too. Live and learn (unless you're a guard in Prison Athravan, RIP!)Add to this research trees, staff management, educational and recreational programs, managing addiction, guard rotas and pathing, shakedowns and security, visitation, resources and financial stress and you have one hell of a deep simulation game.Modding CommunityOn top of the pretty much endless simulation, the modding community for this game is fantastic. Thousands of people have poured their heart into prison and object design, as well as scenarios and additional features, and it's all available free. The game was great to begin with, but kudos to all those who have submitted to the workshop, and to the developers for providing the tools for the people who are way smarter than me to share their creations. All I can do is scroll through page after page in awe of their dedication and skill.TL:DR A game that may look simple on the surface but has an absolute ton of depth. An extremely well built simulation game; with the added bonus of a very active and creative modding community to boot. Big thumbs up! ",526,162,9,104,76,6,105

								It's like Theme Park but all your guests spend the night, every night, while trying to kill each other and the staff you spent all your money hiring. Sometimes they will just start riots and kill all your dogs. Sometimes they will kill all your cooks and then riot because they are hungry. Sometimes they will dig an escape tunnel from Solitary all the way back to their cells, because you gave them a bookshelf. Other times they will just set fire to things. When they are not doing such, you can build them classrooms and hire teachers for them to murder. You can setup yards, give them jobs around the prison, learn new tech and issue your guards with tasers and such devices that keep them alive slightly longer, when the prisoners break down all the carefully placed locked doors you spent time planning out thinking it was foolproof. Enjoy the hilarity of having every guard in your prison delivered to the morgue you built, and having to call in emergency services in riot gear to retake the prison. You can also cut down trees for cash, make prisoners into slaves that build furniture, and generally rip off the taxpayer with 'grants' that give you thousands for nothing, just like real life prisons. This game is excellent.			",125,27,1,20,17,4,33

												Surprisingly deep game with a cartoony art style that makes the grim reality of prison more palatable. Every Early Access update was a nice step forward, and the 1.0 release definitely feels like a complete game.Best thing about it, in my opinion, is that this game is incredibly balanced. You can be as harsh as you want, or build luxury suites for your drug dealers and murderers. You can build your favorite prisoner his own home and have staff bring his meals to him while he watches TV all day. All of these are valid playstyles, and will perform well on different metrics.There are so many different game mechanics going on, but they're all intuitive, and the game's timescale control gives you all the time you need to figure out what to do. The campaign mode also breaks down a lot of the features one-by-one, which makes a great introduction to the game.			",198,31,2,14,21,5,18

												This might be Early Access game, but it reminds me when we first started in Early Access with our Starpoint Gemini 2. Community is everything. Prison Architect has a fantastic and helpful community and that's really something. The game itself has so much charm that I can just praise them and compare them to golden Bullfrog times when Molyneux released hits like Theme Park and Theme Hospital. It's fun, it's complex, it has spirit. I didn't had any bugs or crashes whatsoever in almost 15 hours of gameplay so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loved old Dungeon Keeper, Theme series and was watching Oz or Prison Break. :) Graphics:  ★★★★☆ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★★ Potential: (EA) ★★★★★   Overall:  ★★★★★ ",653,222,20,98,70,4,151

OverviewPrison Architect is a game about designing and mananging a prison. I've had this game since one of it's early alphas, and still play it to this day.

Rating 0-10   Gameplay 7   Graphics 8   Overall 7.5 Pros I haven't experienced many, if any bugs in the newest version (1.0) Not too hard, but not too easyCons Can get repetitive, and there isn't much to do after building a massive successful prisonConclusionIf you like building games like this, I strongly recommend you get this game.Short and simple review, mostly just testing this format I created, but everything I have said is true to the game.

												I was lucky enough to purchase this game for $5. I have owned it since the alpha days and really appreciate the hardwork the developers put into making this game. I have called in sick to work just to play it. I waste maybe 12 hours sometimes in front of the computer and although I know I might die in what would be a short amount of years this makes the time pass faster so its ok. I do not fear death or time passing when I am immersed in this game. I try everything to make prisoners happy. But the game is so challenging eventually something surprising happens. First time I played Iw ill not forget. Things were going good. I go get snack. I come back fire has been set in a library. over 80 casualties. Never a dull moment. I fall asleep playing game sometimes. :] thank you one more time <3			",16,0,0,2,8,0,8

Teal DeerDevelopers: Introversion Software Publishers: Introversion SoftwareInitial release: Oct 2015Genre: Simulation, Strategy, Management, Builder#Worth/NotWorth: #TotallyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationPrison Architect is a planning, building and management simulator.The main draw of this game is the sandbox mode though there is a short, interesting and well done campaign that more or less serves as a tutorial. Though the nitty gritty is not that well explained in all honesty. I should mention there has been an announcement of a version 2.0 with vast improvements roughly a month out regarding this and many other issues. In sandbox mode, you're charged with building a prison and making sure it stays operating swimmingly throughout its existence. You'll prevent escapes and cater to state grants in order to receive funding. Events, such as fires and riots take place and measures need to be taken to mitigate exposures to such things. You'll schedule the day for the prisoners and draft work/reform programs and work on security as prisoners use exploits to bring in contraband, either from workshops or familial or conjugal visits. What's interesting about this is the game is very loose and because it doesn't prevent you from or discourage any behavior you'll discover why something is totally broken or some aspect you've looked over that is causing greats strife within the prison. You'll hire workers, doctors, accountants and handymen; Psychologists and security guards. When you start your prison, you'll be given the options between male/female prisons and the warden themselves as well as any specific challenges such as having to deal with things like weather and temperature within the prison. Each warden gives specific perks; Such as mitigating the amount of violent prisoners being brought into the prison.There are many systems to build; Such as providing electricity and  water. Rooms must be given an assignment, from the canteen to the shower room. Shout out to that feeling when you build a really nice starter prison and forget to install drains and water goes everywhere. Once you get the basics down. You'll be able to build the requirements for a maximum security prison which are much more intense and robust. From the riot team armory with guard dogs and CCTV monitors; You'll need to hire guards to watch the cameras that you installed. You'll need to even wire those cameras, which may seem daunting at first as it's a separate system than the electricity but that's what makes the game so interesting is the allowance afforded to what you can do. The game almost encourages chaos as a learning mechanic. The game also has steam workshop and mod support. Including more popular things like the gangs mod which has obvious connotations. THE GISTReally great building and management sim and the devs continue to add more and more content. With the version 2.0 announcement, this is a package for anyone that pines for the days old Bullfrog management games you shouldn't miss.Follow my curation for more ",1044,295,48,106,94,7,96

Give one person power over everything and they will unleash their true selfThat's the test this game forces you to take. Being the overseer of a prison, you have access to anything, from building new facilities to designing a daily routine your prisoners must follow. At first, you probably will be kind to your prisoners: you will buy them sofas, TVs, have them live in large, comfortable cells and feed them well. And then, they will respond with riots, fires and schemes while your guards have their backs turned. After this, things must become a little bit more ""rough"".Think of the prisons in this game like cities in other popular city building simulators, like Stonehearth or Cities: Skylines: they are smaller-scale versions of ""ecosystems"", where everything must work in harmony and the wheels must always spin, or else everything fails and disaster follows.First of all, the building system is nice and well-designed, but a little bit clunky. Let's elaborate. Planning a building means you have to set up foundations, furniture, electricity and water pipelining. More often than not you will mess up the dimensions of your building, meaning you have to start from scratch, or realise you needed something bigger to satisfy your prison's needs. However, all systems work: one large building for everything or smaller ones for each specific need.Players that won't prefer to waste time on the tutorial (in the form of 5 mini-campaigns that cover the basics), will realise that they will need guides and the wiki to keep their prisons going forward. The game is so complex that you will feel lost in the beginning, and it's gonna take a while before you manage to reform your prisoners instead of incarcerating them. You have many needs to cover, from space and proper bedding to psychological support and community service. Keeping your prisoners content is not easy, and no matter what you do they will usually ask for more. Failing to give them what they demand, means that they will riot and try to bring down the facility. Personally, I like to slam them in solitary with barely any food and rest to drain them from the energy to revolt again.Keep in mind your prisoners have many ways to escape. They might steal stuff like knives and wires, dig tunnels, smuggle drugs etc. The prisoners' AI adapts to a certain degree to your actions, so if, for example, you start using patrol dogs to find their tunnels, they will start digging in a circular pattern to confuse them. Clever stuff indeed.It's a nicely addicting game and its content will keep you hooked for quite a while. If you ever wanted to dictate the lives of a bunch of criminals that noone will shed a tear for, start unleashing the sinister punisher from within you with this game.RATING:Gameplay: 8.5/10Presentation: 8/10Story: 8.5/10Unique Factor: Simulation: 9/10OVERALL: 8.5/10 ",121,15,0,28,18,0,21

												Best building game i've played. Great graphics, gameplay is fun and unpredictable which makes it really nice.Now, let me tell you about my experience.about i'd say 58 days in game time, i finished building my prison and started bringing in prisoners. I noticed this one prisoner, his name was Nathan... (dont remember his full name but whatever).  he was the only minimum security i had so i figured, he's not gonna do much harm. and boy was i wrong.He started riots and kills making him very lethal. So I figured, okay, lets make him Super Max.Couple of days have passed and not much has happened. I added lots of sniper towers, armed Guards, and guard dogs.One day Nathan LITERALLY started a large riot/ escape attempt. Of course he was one of the few that made it to the exit/ past the reception.But with all the sniper towers and armed guards that i added days earlier.It was at this moment that Nathan knew..... he ♥♥♥♥ed up.

												This game has the potential to be a fantastic game; however, at current state I cannot reccommend it.  If you're looking for a casual, small to medium prison game, then this is a fantastic game. What I was looking for was to be able to create a super max high capcity prison.  After playing ~12 hours with small prisons and learning the mechanics of the game, I was ready for a 3000+ capcity prison.  This is where the game struggles.  I have a high end system (SLI GTX 970s i-7 3820 @4.2GHz) and this game cannot operate past 1000 entities in game.  I was extremely let down, my GPU usage was less than 15% and my CPU was around 30%.  My hardware wasn't even being used.  The game is very poorly optimized for very large prisons.  I read that it only uses 1 core of your CPU.  Once I can build a gigantic prison, this will possibly be one of the greatest games ever.  But, at current state the gamne becomes unplayable for large prisons.If you're not looking for a large prison builder, then this is the game for you.  But, if you are, then I can't reccommend it.

												This game is, in my honest opinion, the crowning achievement of Early Access. Not only is the game more than feature complete, but it has also been in a fully playable and enjoyable state since the earliest of days. The monthly dev logs are a joy to watch and kept players informed about changes along the way in a very excellent fashion.Not only that but even after leaving Early Access these devs continued working and improving upon this game. I can only applaud their work ethic because there are companies releasing 60$ titles that have never even dreamt of putting in this type of sustained effort. The game is also really, really good and you should just buy it really.			",489,176,24,53,78,7,78

												I've been playing Prison Architect for about 30 hours per alpha release for the latest few versions that came out before the final release came out. An early access game that not ONLY has relesed new versions on schedule for a long time, and now actually has reached version 1.0, is, sadly, something to celebrate on Steam.Aside from the fact that the devs have used the Early Access platform the way it was meant to be used and that should be commended, it's also a pretty damned good managment game. Prison managment has been done before, but not for a long time, and never well, and it's a change of pace from the usual town managment sims. Now your ""population"" is the enemy, as well as your source of income.The number of systems that works togheter to form the complete simulation is very impressive, and even a small change can shatter a very stable system. For example. I had a prison with 750 prisoners, running very smoothly. Then a gang leader arrived on the bus one morning and started organizing the red gang, one of the three gangs in my prison. I had never had a gang leader before so I let him work for a bit before sending him to my supermax facility, so I could experience how running a prison with an organized gang was like. In supermax he lost his temper, and ended up in solitary. This angered his gang enough that they started a riot. A couple of hours later when the dust settled and the riot police left there were 54 dead, over 60 injured, and 200 prisoners who were up for solitary for their actions during the riot. The rioting prisoners broke into protective custody, where snitches and former policemen who ended up in prison are kept, and killed half of the protected prisoners. I was put on notice, and risked ending up as a prisoner in my own prison. Luckily my lawyer got me out of that... A prison is a delicate system, and care needs to be taken when introducing anything new.There is now added a story mode, to work as a guide for new players, and an escape mode, where you get to play as a prisoner, as well, but I still feel that the sandbox mode is the meat of the game. You learn some new tricks each time you build a new prison, and as you can sell your old prison for an extra cashboost in the startup phase of your next one, you will get more and more funds for each prison you build. My only problem with the game is that it starts to lag when your prison grows too big, depending on how good your computer is. I first start to notice it at 750 prisoners and roughly 350 staff, so at just over 1000 individual characters present in the same prison, but my computer is pretty damned good. I know that a lot of people can't even get 500 prisoners to work well.tl:drDamned good simulator/managment game. Buy it, play it, profit. A bit unforgiving if you make a mistake though, but that's the way in a prison.Highly recomended.			",73,14,0,18,19,0,31

								I've had this game 2 days and have already sunk about 10 hours into it. Sor far:- a dog ate 2 prisoners- one inmate has some sort of OCD and keeps smuggling power drills into the showers.- an inmate somehow set his cell on fire. The cell was locked at the time, he didn't make it.- I think one of my guards is corrupt. I watched him open the front door for an inmate comically named ""Hey"". Luckily Prisoner Hey was well behaved and asked to be let back in after a few hours because he was hungry.- my prisoners keep escaping into the toilet for the love of god someone help me10/10			",100,23,1,35,22,0,8

 Prison Architect, How Many♥♥♥♥♥♥Heads Can I Confine In a Tight Space? To make it short and sweet, this game is fun. I really liked it overall. However, it didn't take long before it got a bit boring since you experience everything it has to offer by the end of your first prison. Its not a bad thing I guess since it didn't overstay it's welcome. You have to be careful building around prisoners too because if they see an opening, they will say, ""Peace ♥♥♥♥♥es!"" and book it like hell while your prison guards handle the situation. Prisoners will die and the prison nurses will have trouble sleeping at night but at least the situation was handled. There isn't too much for the controls. It's mainly the mouse with the keyboard to either access the keyboard shortcuts or acts as a way to move around the screen. However, the UI works pretty well. Its easy to navigate, there's a search bar to search for certain assets you want to put into your prison, and you place it in as such. The assets include: Important human beings, not important human beings, chairs, vending machines, TVs, Cameras, automatic doors, non-automatic doors, and more for sure. This game has a surprising amount of depth to it in the building department since you have to build your own water pipe system and even wiring your electricty to certain parts of the prison so you can keep the lights on and get a good view of the prisoners getting brutally beatened or going mentally insane as you accidentally confine them to Solitary Confinement for 2 months when you meant 2 days. Yes, there's no way, that I know of, to revert that. Guess you're ♥♥♥♥ed, buddy. This game also features a ""Escape Mode"" (or something like that) where you can choose a prison you either downloaded from the Steam Workshop or one you made yourself and you try to escape it as a prisoner. The controls are pretty standard but they work for that. Its kind of fun since you can form gangs to help you in it and can even get away with murder if you're good enough. Its also a good way to test how good your prison holds up. You can of course get loans or grants if you fulfill certain tasks given to you so you can keep these unlawful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in longer where they're heavily mistreated. The grants work against you since some of them require that you treat the prisoners good. Why do they need a TV?? ♥♥♥♥ them, they murder someone, here's a ball and some string, have fun,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can read up on what your prisoners did as well and they even have names. Some of the descriptions of the prisoners are pretty funny to say the least. There's so much to talk about, honestly, it'd take forever to cover it all. Just play the game if you're interested at this point but the review will continue.The game looks pretty good. Its a top down 16 bit looking game that belongs on a Playstation 1 or SNES, if you're optimization is good enough. It's really nice on the eyes and it works quite well since you can tell the difference between everything and that's always a plus! The small character models look weird though, they are like all related to Rayman or something because they have no arms or legs. They are just a body, head, and round hands and that's it. It works so whatever.The sound of the game works. This game is quite full of sound, actually. You can hear how angry the prisoners are when they are rioting against your prison guards and you can hear all the cooking and cleaning in the prison kitchen when they are serving the prisoners barely editable food. The prisoners, when they fight, have these cartoon-ish sound effects when they are punching each other God knows where. The sound in this game does make the prison much more alive and that is always much appreciated.As for replayability, that depends on how you feel about the game after the first full fledged prison you make. Do you want to make more stuff, or do you want to put the keyboard and mouse down and move on? I think this game has the potential of having several playthroughs. Its definitely a good game to revisit after you haven't played it for awhile. Its a fun game but I don't know if replaying it directly after your first prison will be quite as satisfying as the first so you may want to take a break then come back to get another bite. Overall, even though people have died and the prison inmates sleep comfortably with their hidden shivs at night, its still quite an enjoyable experience and is quite fun. I got this for almost full price but I can say that this is worth the full price, overall. Get this game if you haven't already. Its worth a playthrough or two.			",193,23,6,16,10,4,15

Posted: January 15, 2016
												There are a few reasons to recommend this game (It's novel and fun at first, if you're into planning and optimizing) and many reasons not to (Bugs, poor design decisions, it's far too easy/lacks complexity, it's not yet finished but ""released"" from EA, balancing issues, ...).I originally planned to write a detailed review, expanding on each issue, but decided against it as to not steal focus from the one big reason I'm writing this non-recommendation: MAJOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES Prison Architect produces a heavy CPU load to calculate its simulations, or the AI decisions of the game's agents. Unfortunately, it isn't multi-core capable and will only use two threads. This results in significant FPS and simulation speed decreases as the number of agents increases. My current prison - which I'm stubbornly completing despite it having become a major chore - holds 300 prisoners, employs around 350 staff, has slowed down to around 12-15 FPS and a proportional simulation speed decrease while idle, and a nigh unplayable 5-6 FPS while building my next cell block of 100 cells. System: i7 5930k, @2800MHz RAM.To put things into perspective: There are achievements for holding 500 and 1'000 prisoners respectively. The achievement here being patience and a tolerance for slideshows, of course.Which brings me to my next, and final point. As other games have proven, it's perfectly possible to have an agent based simulation maintain a smooth, stable simulation speed for most of the game's situations even without multi-core capabilities. The trick is to have a difficulty-induced softcap on the total number of agents the system has to handle. In PA, it's ridiculously easy to keep hundreds (or thousands) of prisoners' needs fulfilled. Once you have the money to build all the necessary facilities, you would need to purposely mismanage your prison for anything ""interesting"" like riots to have a chance of happening. If it weren't for the need to occasionally and manually check for and remove tunnels, or watch out for tagged snitches among new arrivals, you could run the game on full autopilot for days and the only thing that would have changed once you return would be your account balance.Prison Architect has (had) a lot of potential, but sadly, I cannot recommend it in its current state (A sentiment that should be reserved for Early Access reviews). Stay away from this (for now) unless you plan on only building tiny prisons, have a lot of patience, don't mind slideshows and screen tears, or have hypothreaded your CPU down to two virtual cores.

												When I first started playing I only did sandbox. I had no idea you could adjust when you wanted your prisoners to start arriving so they all automaticly came on the second day, so the game went like this.-The prisoners have arrived: QUICK BUILD SOME CELLS-The prisoners need food: HURRY BUILD A CANTEEN-The prisoners are escaping; HIRE SOME GUARDS!!!It took me 20 tries before I learned you were meant to build a prison then add prisoners.That made the game slightly more easy.

Early Access Review
								FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA (UNFINISHED) The game is what you expect it to be, a prison simulation game, where you design and manage a prison.You manage a prison, making sure the prisoners don't kill each other (Or your staff) or run away. New prisoners come in, so if your last prisoners killed everyone, put the new ones in their bloody cells, no problems, lolThe Developers are great and open to any feedback you might have and can only give you a better game in the end over this already amazingly fun game.The game isn't finished yet so you can see some glitches that are actually pretty funny but still really enjoy the game. By buying this you get the full version when it's out and help that full version happen.I will rate the full version when it comes out but I really recommend you get this sometime, I can tell you will probably like it.

								I built an open plan kitchen / canteen, a prisoner stole a knife then rampaged, killing a dozen inmates, several guards and a cook.  Before adding metal detectors, everyone who completed the workshop safety course came away with a shiv.Thinking sprinklers were not necessary in an all-concrete facility, I watched with horror as a vandalized toilet and poorly grounded metal detector caused a raging fire.  Only one prisoner in the block survived.  Accidentally toggling the armed guards to weapons free instead of calling in the riot police, a large riot was stopped very quickly.  It took a while to move the bodies and clean up all the blood. ...and the electric chair hasn't been implemented yet.  :)			",176,28,6,21,21,2,16

Early Access Review
								I decided, after a bit of consideration, to jump the wagon when the game was on sale. After spending some 10 hours or so on this Early Access title, I can't help feeling a bit divided about it.Right off the bat, the longing for a game like the good games of old, such as Theme Hospital, makes you feel right at home. The genre hasn't seen much since then, and that makes Prison Architect a very welcome sight. In my first sitting, I played 5 hours straight. Not a lot of games these days seem to be able to pull that off. Part of the reason behind this, I think, in addition to the mentioned longing, is the discovery of how things work. In fact, you are given very few hints about how to get started properly. There's a tutorial kind of thing, but it touches just a small part of the game (some which I read, are not even part of the game at this point).But, as I keep playing the game and learning more about the workings, I can't help but feel that the game is a bit ""fake"". The speed of the game is rather slow, stretching play time more than necessary (even though there are speed controls available). Then there's the graphics, which are unimpressive, but you would be able to forgive if the gameplay is very good. It's just that the gameplay is very basic. There's very little complexity in it, and nothing very new. In addition, many things don't seem to work very well. The visuals are sub-par. There's no soundtrack. There's no cinematics or voice recordings. There's no campaign mode.Even considering these things, I could be very forgiving. However, for a game that has raised considerable funding of some $10.000.000 and been in alpha for over a year, I would expect more. I'm quite amazed they haven't gotten further. Even so, I do feel I got my 7€ worth.Would I recommend the game? It's a very tough question. I feel I can't quite discredit the game, but on the other hand, it's not very impressive. Another factor is the rather stiff regular price to consider. In sum, I would have to give it a thumbs down. However, you might find it very enjoyable, and eventually it might turn out to be something great. For most people, I would therefore suggest waiting and see how things turn out.2014.05.06: It would seem my review is a bit controversal. I just want to stress the fact that I like the game. I keep playing it. I just wish it was so much more, and I think it could have been. I'd like to commend the developers for Workshop support by the way. Usually that's an afterthought.2015.02.03: I'd just like to point out I haven't played the game for a while now. There has been some additions meanwhile. I don't have a good enough basis to say much about them. I suggest you look at the release announcements if you want more up-to-date information. I'd like to say, however, that my opinion of the game hasn't changed much.			",254,50,2,25,15,2,21

												Having played Prison Architect since the early days of alpha 4 and 5 this game has come a long ways and continues to surprise with each update. The dev team has truly created a masterpiece of a game that will challenge your mind and wits to deal with situations.Overall I give this game a 9 out of 10.Pros -Story mode that keeps you learning but having fun not just bored tutorial.layers and layers of depth that can be turned on or off based on your comfort with the game.Detail detail detail in a simulation strategy this is such as important part of the game that many forget to add, you can see how happy each person is or see how happy everyone is allowing you to control how things go.Workshop and mod support Cons -It can feel a bit repetitive if you don't like this style of game.Audio can be very repetitive and not enjoyable  ",90,18,2,23,28,0,17

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWPrison Architect is two games in one, you can either build and manage your own prison or try to escape a prison as an inmate but, the game is mainly focused on managing your prison. You start with an empty plot with workers and some money that you use to build mandatory buildings like offices for Warden and prison cells. Game itself is not really hard, so even if you make a lot of mistakes on your first run you will be fine. Art style and prisoner varieties are endless, prisoners can have special good and bad attributes that can make them faster, deadlier or even more likely to be killed by other prisoners or guards, to fight these you can employ guards that can either be armed with a more powerful gun or a K-9 until by their side or make the prison swarmed by CCTV cameras. Another interesting mechanic is that you can employ prisoners to do stuff janitor or chief does or you can use them as a manpower in workshop so you would earn additional money. In short, the bigger your prison is you will face more problems.   ═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:Lovely art stylePrison sound effectsPrisoner variety and attributes that will make your life harderIncludes everything you can think about when you say ""prison""Prisoners may form gangs that fight togetherMany community-made prisonsYou can play as a prisoner and:Make your own gangGain reputationSteal thingsBecome stronger and add attributes to yourselfTry to escape your own prisonmuch more!Cons:If your prison become too big you will face lagsThere are some bugs around building foundationsRarely prisoners may stuck themselvesConnecting stuff by wires is unexplained and new players may face difficulties with it═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game is for everyone that loves management games like SimCity and wants everything to be perfect in their ""masterpiece"". I rate the game 10/10!═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												In my first prison while playing this game, I got a max security prisoner, I have had my fair share of max sec prisoners, that was until I figured out it was a legendary. By the time a found out it was a legendary, he had somehow got his hands on a lighter, he then proceeded to start a riot and burn down half my prison. When the riot guards came the legendary prisoner killed both pairs of riot guards. He basically owned the prison, and so after he killed the warden, forman, chief, cooks, lawer, accountent, and guards he then proceeded ( In Badasserary ) to walk out of my prison that was burnt to the ground. It felt as if he planted a bomb and detonated it as he walked away, LIKE A BAWS.			",54,3,0,6,3,0,1

												When I got it? It was good. Some kinks here and there but still playable. Now? Great. Just about every kink I could remember has been ironed out and the game is better than ever. It's something I can play for hours on end and always find things to do. It has a good learning curve, but nothing that should turn down anyone who doesn't usually play these kinds of games from buying it. Every jail I open is always better than the last in some way, and the planning feature is a blessing to help make sure of that.There's so much I can say about this game, and all I could say would be good, but nothing beats the experience you get from just playing it yourself.

												Prison Architect is one of the best games I have played in years. I had it on my wishlist for ages as I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. I purchased it on sale and have currently played around 435 hours so finally getting to grips with my latest prison. Years ago I played games like Theme Hospital and this has all the best attributes of these types of games. I love building new prisons, the prisoners are quite comical but challenging to deal with so this game can keep your interest for weeks at a time. I do have a very good gaming laptop so am able to build vast establishments. I have not fully explored all the scenarios or challenges within the game but wanted to leave a review for anyone like myself that doubted the game - best money I have spent on steam this year! Currently I am challenging myself to stop escapes and get my statistics up and like all good games, this takes time, but is fun to do - nobody has escaped so far.....			",7,6,0,4,1,0,4

								Amazing Game! Bought on a Sale and worth the money!You build your owen prison, you can build it with your owen imagination. For peoples who like strategy games or building games like SimCity and Cities in Motion. game is easy when you understood how it works. Tutorial could be better with more step by step tuts but after playing it a few hours, you know how to handle it. I tried 4 or 5 times to build my prison before I was happy with it. You can do a lot and build a lot, for an early access game it runs realy good. i started to play with Alpha 28.From me 8 of 10 Points for now, I´m realy starting to enjoy this nice gamePro:you can build the prison you likea lot of rooms and buildingsyou can plan the day as your wisha lot of stuff members like doctor, gardener, caretaker and and and ...if your prison is not safe and too much peoples break out you can get firedlong, realy long play timeyou can choose 3 map sizesworkshop more languages then only english (user translations addet to the game, you can choose them on menu)Contra:Tutorial is short and dont explain how to handle your prison or set the plan or how to explore new rooms etc.prisoner continue to attack guards after he waked up from faint, when he get punished and your doctor dont help the prisoner he dieyou can´t choose if you like to sent prisoner to another prisonif you don´t dissable to get new prisoner the bus comes with more prisoner every day at 8 o`clock, no matter if your prison is full			",2188,1028,108,240,351,29,302

												Prison ArchitectGenre: Strategy/Simulation - Real Time Strategy/SimulationRating: 9.5/10Personal playing period: Few monthsIs it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy/sim players collection.Girl vs Game: I think there may have been a few times that I did in fact pick the game. Personal Comment:This is really a great game with a lot of depth and immersion. I have 80 plus hours and still have not felt a need to play the campaign yet. This is that game where you say just 5 more minutes and then 3 hours later you have your girlfriend and the police knocking on your door thinking you died as you were supposed to pick her up for a date 2 hours ago. This is a great immersive game with a lot to do. It is so much fun trying to design the perfect prison. Just make sure you have a lot of time or just have no job or girlfriend;)Short Summary:This is a prison building simulation strategy game. You start off with some money and a few construction workers and a open piece of land. You then need to start planning and building a prison to house prisoners that will be dropped every 24 hours. You can set how many prisoners must be dropped, what danger level they can be, etc. You are in charge of building the prison, managing the money so you dont run out of it, managing the prisoners and ensuring that they get reformed and that  they are kept happy and maintaing staff and cashflow on a day to day basis. If you like strategy/simulation games then get this.Online gaming:Have not played online but you can via steam workshop play other peoples prisons and also use escape mode to escape from prisons created by fellow gamers.Learning Curve and Gameplay:The learning curve to this game is quite intense. There is a lot that needs to be learned and understood. The utilities must be very well managed in order to ensure the prison does not run out of power and secondly to ensure the power stations and their lines don't cross. Then you have the whole physical construction and layout of the prison that you need to design and build. And then there is the management of the prison, the finances and so many more elements. The game just offers so much that you will spend endless hours on this without batting an eye. Fortunately there is an ""unlimited funds""game mode which I would recommend to start off with till you have the game play nailed. Then start a prison with limited funds and then the fun starts as budgeting and finance planning is added to the list of things to do.			",130,13,6,12,25,0,25

												This game is full of originality~According to the name of this game we can know thatthe purpose of this game is to build a prison and operate it.you need to hire employees to make your prison runs properly,then slove the problems in operation you got,it is really interesting to experience that game.If you like to play sandbox game,this game is a not bad choice for you.You can observe the prisoner's every move,and see what they need then according to they need to perfect your prsion.Try more harder to make your prison more safety,make every prisoners got his job,make sure no prisoner can espace form it,and also can get enough profit from this prison.Your prison could be a large one,can keep 300~500 prisoners,or could be a small one,just keep under than 100 prisoners.You can make your prison become a small community,every prisoner got his job,make them live a good live(relatively),safety and comfortable.Or...If you like...or we can say..you are a sadism.you also can make your prison a slaughterhouse~Lock these prisoners into a enclosed room,then train a lot of armed police...Not to feed them,and not allow them to sleep,These prosoners will fight with other prisoners,and attack the police,if you allow these armed police to use they guns,they will shoot the prisoner who attack the police and kill him.after these...just watch them how to die one by one~(this is not the prison,this is nazi concentration camp!In the end, if there is no prisoner die in that day,you can sell this prison and use these money to start a new one.This creative game is worth trying~I hope... in the future,developers can make more games the same as this game into a series~like<Supermarket Architect> <Hotel Architect> or <Restaurant Architect>~I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT VERY MUCH~			",68,10,1,3,11,0,12

												I had a solid prison up and running, I was still expanding but the prisoners I had were happy and everything was going according to plan. Shower time for max-sec when one of the guards operating a surveillance station gets tired and goes for his break. The showers go dark as his screens are unmonitored (no privacy here folks). Someone dies.I scramble the guards but it's too late, another prisoner has his sentence terminated before they arrive. They walk in to a scene of grisly prison r*pe gone horribly wrong. A full-scale riot is now underway with naked, wet and bleeding prisoners running everywhere. I enable free-fire and one of my armed guards wades into the fray barrels blazing, but his efforts are for naught as he gets shanked from behind- one of the naked prisoners grabs his shotgun and begins firing on the other guards. My armed guards arrive in force but the prisoners are angry now and they want vengeance. More prisoners secure themselves guns at a high cost to my guards (and their fellow inmates) and things are rapidly getting out of hand.You like tv shows about prison? They've got nothing on this.

												I original played this when it was release in early access and enjoyed the sandbox prison environment. Now that it has released the game has steamwork support to share prisons, lots of bug fixes a campaign and random events. There is still some roughness to the UI but the game is improved and enjoyable. There is also an escape mode, which I haven't yet played but looks to put you in the place of the prisoner and attempt to escape. If you enjoy building management games, this will be right up your street.			",330,85,8,25,20,3,55

			Res Reviews continues with a review of Prison Architect. For a text version of this review, go here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/recommended/233450/ For more Res Reviews check out our...		

For a text review, the original script has been provided below.Prison Architect is a real time strategy game similar to city builders. You are in charge of building and running a prison. You get to design the daily regime, customize room sizes and contents to your specific likings, control what types of prisoners get in and out of your prison, and try to stay in business.The gameplay of prison architect is what you could expect from city builders. You can designate a certain amount of tiles to a room, place objects in that room to help it function and try to find the perfect size for each room and distance between them. You also have to design your travel-ways, as letting prisoners travel through tiny hallways can lead to a lot of angry shoving and death. Add customizing and caring for your own staff to that, taking care of scheduling, and dealing with gangs? You have a pretty in-depth simulator here. Not to mention there's another game mode where you get to play as a prisoner and try to escape. That game mode is admittedly lacking and completely lacks a tutorial whereas the main game has an entire campaign that serves as an over-glorified tutorial. Overall there's a lot to do in this game. And with all the options? It's very fun and very addicting while you're doing it. This is one of those games where you start up your first prison at 8pm and look up, realize it's 2AM, and think, just 5 more minutes...now oh look its 6AM.The story of the game is actually rather interesting even though it is just an over-glorified tutorial. Unfortunately it suffers because the game also has a lot of bugs, which surprised me for a game old enough that the developers have stopped regularly patching it. The third mission in particular has a nasty one where you have to move riot police around, and if you go the obvious closest route you fail the mission because your riot police get stuck in a doorway and stop moving, defending themselves, and just generally responding. Other than that though, the whole campaign was well written and really tied together nicely while teaching you what you needed to know for sandbox mode.The graphics and sounds are both really lacking. The graphics don't bother me, but the sounds do. This game lacks a lot of specific sound effects and opts for ambience effects based on where your prisoners are and what they're doing based on the regime. That's why the cafeteria clatters and reverberates with silverware and voices during dinner but you'll find your prison woefully quiet during free time and lockup periods. This all does a lot to take away any immersion the game could have had, which is unfortunate, but not the biggest deal for an title in this genre.This game is an amazing simulator, and it doesn't suffer from the same traffic issues most games in its genre do where you build bigger and bigger and suddenly you can't get everyone where they need to go because they all want to take one route instead of the many available to them. It DOES however have it's own critical late-game issue I think you should all be aware of. It's the fact that once you have one of everything and a prison population that suits it, you get to a point where all you have left to do is repeat what you've already done. There's no expansion of districts or ability to connect distant places to make this easier like in city builders though. You are after a certain point of expansion, basically forced to start over in one of two ways. You can continue to expand the same prison by doing the same thing over again in some other chunk of free space you have left, which then brings in the hassle of assigning certain rooms to only service certain parts of your prison and all your funding will come from your own original profits since you've already used all the grants that help you build your prison. Or you can sell what you have made and start in a fresh empty lot with the value of your prison in your pocket, sort of like a new game plus and with all of the grants once again available to you. This process is what eventually had me quit the game. I think this is one of the biggest flaws all district-less builders suffer from though.Overall though, Prison Architect is a fun game. It's definitely above average, but it's not the indie gem everyone says it is.  This gets a 6/10 from me. I definitely recommend you buy it if you enjoy this genre when it's on sale because $30 for something you can experience all of within eight hours is not a good price for your money. If you really love this niche, then you'll love this game, and with modding support and the ability to save and share your prisons, it even has it's own little community of builders you can become a part of.It could have been better, but it's fine as it is. You'll have fun with it.			",180,24,2,40,36,1,42

								I put 8 High Risk prisoners in a 5x5 holding cell with 3 guards Surrounded by a perimiter wall and a fence. They had no food, no beds and nothing to do except poop and pee and sit on the bench. A few of them rioted but were quickly subdued by the guards. They lasted 9 days before they all died.RIP those prisoners Serious Review:~Great game, plenty to do. ~Even though it is in Alpha stages I rarely see any bugs. ~High replayability.~If you want it, buy it. ~Cant go wrong with this game. 10/10			",101,5,14,12,20,4,6

												""Prison Architect"" is a business simulation game, except in this case, the business is a prison, which brings a few more factors into the equation, in addition to the base principle of income-outcome ratio. The name ""Prison Architect"" might be a little misleading, though, as the game is not just about building and planning the prison, but also about running it, managing it, and keeping everything in balance. You're not just the architect, you're also the warden.While there's nothing really fancy about the graphics or the music of the game, the gameplay mechanics are where it shines. As architect/warden, you have to find the optimal balance between the financial limitations and the needs of the prisoners. The fact that we're dealing with prisoners makes everything even more interesting, as unlike the standard business manager or city builder, your ""customers"" are criminals and your job is to make sure they serve their punishment, as decided by the court. Should a convicted murderer have access to a TV? Should a convicted child molester be able to play pool? Those are just some of the moral dilemmas the game brings to your door.After clocking over 200 hours, I can say with confidence that at least according to my taste, the gameplay mechanics are very well balanced, and make this game one of my all time favorites. Having that said, I must also mention what I consider to be the game's one major flaw, which is the lack of optimization. I have decent hardware (Quad-core i7, 16GB RAM and a Geforce GTX465), which handles much heavier and at least as complex games very well. I see no good reason for a game like Prison Architect to lag on such hardware (on prisons with 500 prisoners or more), while games like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Cities: Skylines run smoothly, aside from lack of optimization by the developers.All in all, I consider Prison Architect to be a great game, a must for any fan of the genre.

 PRISONER'S LOG: DAY 31   I woke up extra hungry today... I think the Warden is trying to save a few bucks and cutting our food... which doesn't suprise me. Cell Block D has rioted 6 times in 4 days, and multiple guards and inmates die every day. The Chief placed more patrolls there than anywhere in the entire prison and it still does not work. There have been rumors today that the jail Lawyer is fighting off the feds, who are trying to close the prison down.    But today was different, we didn't hear any screams or gunshots. Everyone in my block looked to see if all of the inmates had died, but they all walked to the showers like normal. But then, everything wen't downhill FAST. We all stood up at the first gun shot. Everyone looked out of the doors but couldn't see anything. Then someone down the hall from me started breaking the door, along with everyone else in the block. I joined for this might be my chance to escape. After most of us broke the doors, we ran straight for the showers. I noticed that the other prisoners in different blocks had joined us. Everyone ran straight for the guards.   I looked around before running in, and could not belive my eyes. There were bodies everywhere, dead guards against the walls, prisoners beaten to death, and a few construction workers were lieing on the floor, bleeding everywhere. Then a gunshot made me jump. I looked up and saw a prisoner from my block with a shotgun from a guard he just killed with a drill... maybe from one of the workers. Then from one of the radios I heard the Police Chief give an order-  SHOOT TO KILL . Then the shots were fired. I looked up to see both Prisoners and Guards shooting each other, everyone dropping like rocks.    But wave 2 came. Prisoners from behind me came running with nothing to loose. Some were bleeding and some had stayed behind like I did. I rand with them right into the enemy.   After a few minutes I had gained a few scratches but was otherwise fine. Everyone came to a hault to realise that we had ended all of the guards lifes. The onslaugh did not wait though, people rushed, prisoners came running into the kitchen, and all you could hear was screaming. Then people ran into the office building. More gun shots were fired and more screaming was heard. I was sure that everyone had died. We heard sirens. Backup had arrived.   More armored guards and guards covered head to toe in kevlar came rushing in. I ran, I was not a killer but I did not wan't to get captured (Or killed). I turned into a hallway I had never been in before and looked around again. Dead cooks, janitors, construction workers, gardeners, medics, and of course- Guards. I rushed around another corner and there he was... the armed guard that ended my life.   ALL EVENTS CAN HAPPEN INGAME! DEFINATLY WORTH THE MONEY ",35,1,0,1,6,1,4

								One of those games that tugs at your mind long after you've walked away from it. And I couldn't wait to get back and try new ideas.I like ""systems games."" Games where one designs a complex mechanism or system and then watches it go, usually to the point of failure, and then modifies and tries again. Prison Architect did this handily.There are some aspects that were either unfinished (Early Access) or beyond my reckoning. E.g. I found myself ignoring the prisoner dossiers, partly because I wasn't sure if it mattered.However, my wife and I spent hours poring over the layout, predicting movement patterns, course-correcting, and scrapping to try again. We would chuckle about ""checking in on our prison"" while away from the computer.I may have put it down for now, but I'm anxious to see where it goes next and pick it up again!

												This game is very fun if you like the Tycoon/Simulation kind of games. It is still in alpha so the game is still improving with new features added every month. The only problem I have found with Prison Arhitet is that there really is no goal. After a while you run out of things to do in the game because you get to a point where there is nothing left to add to your prison except to make it larger. Adding some sort of a campaign would be a good feature.Post-Release Edit: Hey, they added a campaign! I would have recommened it in Alpha, and I'll recommend it even more now that it's out with even more content.Strong 9 to a light 10. ",76,16,0,8,6,0,10

												This game is amazing, simply put. The graphics don't look good at all when you first start playing the game, but as you become used to them they can actually be quite pretty at times. The sound is good as well, though it can become pretty loud if you zoom in on a riot or other large scale events. The gameplay is fun, and it's really satisfying as your workers make the foundations of your next building, especially if it's a large one. The feeling of it slowly coming into existence is just awesome. And then there's the community. This community is one of the best I've ever seen, and it saved me from leaving a negative review and never playing again. I hadn't played in like 5 or so months, so I forgot that I had some mods on, and since those mods had been downloaded while the game was still in early acces, they had a huge negative impact on my game. There was a game breaking ""bug"" happening in my save, where the guards wouldn't move prisoners from the Reception to the holding cell, and I was about to quit the game. I started a discussion on the community home page with just 2 screenshots, and then within 6 minutes I got a response from a very kind individual, who noticed that I had some mods on, which might have been causing the problem. He suggested I disable them and see if that helped, and lo and behold, I had been saved from my own dumbassry. So yeah, I really do recommend this game			",107,28,1,14,18,1,8

Good ThingsThis game is very stylisticly simple, which makes it easy to understand, adding to the simulation/strategy goodness. I was immediately able to understand all of the menus and icons, and navigate it efficiently in a matter of minutes. I especially liked how in the female prisons they include the family cells and nurseries, understandably not in the male prisons because females are much more favored to have custody of children in the eyes of the law, which is a nice touch showing an understanding of law and order and biases inside of it. It also pays attention to the fact that rehabilitation over deturrance is what some people prefer, adding in the Pacifier warden and offering different schedualed rehabs like alcohol and substance abuse recoveries.Now, the story is much different from this simplicity. The first one is very driving and shows lots of different emotions, displaying at least some of the psychology behind murderers and the spirituality touch just made it even better, even though I am not a very religious person. I believe that this game should cost even more because of the sheer quality of it, the stories being amazingly well written and the polaroid photos for just that added visual effect onto the general mood.Bad ThingsWhile there are very few, I find the system for unlocking things such as legal action are too long, and a simple fine would be fine, pun totally intended. The reason is that those things already exist, and while I realize in actuality it would take at least some time to unlock those benefits, you must also understand that waiting in a game simply isn't fun. When amking one, you should assume your player is not playing any other game, while at the same time checking for things like alarming similarities with other famous games to prevent the online community from yelling at you. This prevents things like long wait times, but also overused game mechanics and carbon copy characters ripped from other games.OverallAn amazing game with quite the gameplay and a great story, just some elements might need to be touched up if it is ever changed significantly in the future. I don't know, I'm just some random reviewer. Go ahead, scroll past this, see if I care.			",12,8,0,1,6,0,0

Prison Architect is a top-down simulation game like the ages-old Tycoon games on PC. You're tasked with overseeing all aspects of prison management. The developer, Introversion Software, truly has thought of everything in this regard, too. You build the prison from the ground up, lay water pipes and electrical wiring, hire staff like guards, doctors, and therapists, install surveillance and emergency countermeasures, and if you eventually have the prison running as it should, then you have to keep it that way. This is done by keeping the population of inmates fed, content, nonviolent, and within the walls and fences of the institution. Because you're also operating a private prison, the endgame is to also make money. The introduction to the game's many systems can be extremely intimidating at first. Thankfully, this feeling of being overwhelmed is largely undone using the game's Prison Stories mode that doubles as a structured narrative and tutorial. Using simple cutscenes across several different scenarios, the game slowly breaks down all of its confusing menus and options into something that becomes more familiar. It even has options to quick-build rooms like cells, kitchens, dining halls, and so on. Still, after more than 235 hours with the title, it felt like there was more to learn in Prison Architect.Prison Architect is a deep offering of gameplay elements, interconnected systems, and emergent storytelling, but if all this sounds like more work than fun, you're probably right; this game just isn't for you. However if you're a fan of simulations, Prison Architect is one of the best there is.My personal favorite.THE GOOD- Great gameplay- Emergent story moments and character backgrounds for all inmates- Building/management freedom- Great tutorial- Deals with sociopolitical themes surprisingly well and maturely- Freedom to run the prisons in many different waysTHE BAD- Minimal sound design- Lacks soundtrackDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE ",109,25,0,18,59,0,23

								Why do I like this game so much? Seriously, can anyone explain to me why this game is so bloody addicting? Why I keep finding myself migrating back and starting over on a whole new map? I can't put my finger on what it is about Prison Architect that engrosses me so much.You're building a prison. You can design it however you like. Make the new Alcatraz; or create a low-security retreat for minor offenders, or a prison from hell for murderes and thieves. Will you build a labyrinth of terror from which they'll never escape (unless it's to the execution chamber) or will you develop a cutting-edge rehabilition center full of cats, books, and life-skills classes? It's up to you.TL;DR You build a prison. Wall, rooms, utilities. Then you fill it with prisoners, and try to keep things running smoothly, with the amount of money you have. Pretty standard.You can turn on/off rules (endless money, oh yeah!) and pause prison intake if things are getting a little too difficult. YOU ARE THE NEW PRISON OVERLORD AND YOU CONTROL THEIR TINY LIVES WITHIN THE WALLS YOU HAVE BUILT.			",118,99,0,28,25,3,18

								So you make a jail in this game. Yey. Build buildings and rooms that are used for various purposes all to make your prison... however you want, actually. After moving beyond the premise that you are building this unpleasant place, the game gives you significant amounts of freedom to choose what sort of unpleasant place it is. Will you make a rehabilitation center with classrooms, gardens, and plentiful opportunities to help your inmates? Or will you make an abyssal hellhole of concrete, armed guards, and abusive authority? You can make both in this game, and everything in between. As far as simulations go, the sort of creative freedom this game offers the player is exactly what all games of this genre ought to have. You can adjust everything from deciding what your prisoners do each hour of the day, the types of inmates you have in your prison, to what sort of punishments you deal out when those convicts decide to do something naughty like punching the cooks or trying to dig an excape tunnel through their toilet (eww!). There are nearly an endless amount of possibilities! :oIt's still in Early Access, but the game is very playable right now. I'm looking forward to seeing what else they will add, because what the game already has is excellent. Even if this game is apparently unfinished, you can still have lots of fun with it as you create the jail of your... choosing. XDIf you like simulation games where you build stuff, like SimCity or Tropico, then this is certainly a game worth looking into. Have fun!			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												I can build whatever I want, I even have my own name in the game.They keep adding new updates, weather, heating, new characters, now theres even female characters who bring BABIES into the prison. Yeah.It's fun though! If you just wanna build and not stress yourself out, you can remove things like weather, and random events,so your people are very quiet, and kind (mostly) while you build away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hours played when writing review : 35In Prison Architect you can run and manage your own prison, take in inmates, starve your prisoners and force them to riot, make mods and maps for the steam workshop, and so much more.Pros :+ Descriptive tutorial for newcomers. Very useful if you are new to building/simulation type games.+ Can pause the game, go eat a snack, and come back. Or leave it running to build something huge, whatever works best for you.+ You can experiment with an unlimited funds prison.+ Can work on new prisons without deleting the old ones. Just make sure to name your save file!Cons :- Has sounds, which is nice, but I wish it had a soundtrack.- VERY RARELY staff will glitch at doors running around in circles. (To fix this just save your game, close Prison Architect, re-open it and it should be fixed.) Yes, the game is alpha but I still would like to point it out.Overall :8/10 stars.I played this before it even got onto steam, and I must say I have loved it from the start. Devs are very good at upkeeping the game and fixing bugs, as well as adding in new content when needed.Even the community for this game is very helpful.Need new steam friends? Feel free to add me!* Please comment on my profile you found me from my review. ",361,87,7,29,36,8,52

								Original review still below. I just wanted to point out that after a year of playing they have added tons of new features. Cool. However they have not been able to make proper guard AI.Why skip something so essential to do things that you don't really need?Typical big-studio way of working, and that's exactly why I bought an Indie game. Because I want it to work properly. The other 95% of the game is still amazing, but working guards are extremely essential. This is also the reason I haven't been playing anymore. No real use if the entire game comes down to luck.I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they will fix it, but if this is not fixed by time of release this gets a negative recommendation.--It's all been said before, it's the best tycoon-ish game ever made and the prisoner behavior is very realistic. You can build a 300 people prison or you can build a small cosy hippie prison with reform programs and make sure everybody is in a healthy state of mind. Going big and right-wing will be rewarded with money and going small and hippie will be rewarded with very subtle visual clues that tells you about an inmates substance abuse problem and a low re-offending-percentage.Oh yeah one thing to keep in mind. At this point in the development it's quite easy to build a 150 man peaceful LowSec prison. But building MaxSec prisons is still quite hard for me after 180 hours. I've made some that work and I've made some that were hellholes and I'm not a 100% sure yet what the big difference was. It's not as easy as the Tycoon games of the 90's.Oh yeah one more thing... Big prisons are very demanding on your computer and you'll need 80 guards if you want 40 patrols. Not because they need so much rest, but because you have to put extra guards everywhere because they do not wait untill they are relieved of their duty by a colleague before they split. So sometimes you think you have 5 men patrolling in a yard but suddenly 3 walk away and you got a Fight on your hands. And of course every extra moving entity in your prison is more CPU usage. So for the majority of us a huge prison is nearly impossible because of the chaos and the CPU usage. Guard, Dog and Workman AI has some other big problems too like sometimes they refuse to lay pipes for absolutely no reason and Guard Dog's keep biting unconscious inmates untill their dead, lowering the value of your prison (temporarily but still). But building a 100 person prison is a lot of fun too and I'm guessing within half a year it should be possible for everybody to build a big functional stable MaxSec prison. The state of the game is much better then most Early Access games I´ve played.			",121,16,6,6,10,0,5

								I spent all my money building my first prison and when my prisoners arrived I realized that I forgot to hire guards. Now all of my prisoners are standing in front of my giant prison gate and getting angry because they don't get anything to eat. But not one of them tried to run away yet. I'm curious how many of them will be left when I finally have enough money to hire a guard.10/10			",482,73,16,43,41,5,76

												Don't let the art fool you, it's not an easy game! You have to build a prison, there is a story, they have needs!- Own cell, or dormitory.- Food.- Work.- AA meetings.- Visits.- Chapel.- Extra security.If you don't please them they will riot and kill all of your guards. They can smuggle in drugs, steal key's, dig holes, everything! Make sure they don't smuggle out any spoons out of the cafeteria, they will dig a hole with it.I've been playing this game for some time now but still ill trying to get the hang of it, they keep adding more stuff! Seriously, be prepared because hell will break loose!Now they even got introduced a female prison and they even seem to be more aggressive then males, they killed quite a few guards already.. @_@ Heck, the female even need special treatment while pregnant!Oh man.. I love this game.. 12/10 will let my guards get killed again just for the thrill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I just finished Campaign mode.  It was really short.. more of a tutorial.  I hope that in the future the devs add more to it.  I did find the story very engrossing.

												Have you ever wanted to mercilessly starve hundreds if not thousands of prisoners of food, beat them to death with a variety of weapons, and systematically eliminate the right to privacy throughout your prison?No? Just me? Huh.Well, NOW YOU CAN!Play one of the best games on the market, in which you... um. What do we do again?Oh that's right, WE RUN A PRISON.You could go about doing the nice guy run through, you know, giving them prisoners a way to go back to everyday life and whatnot, but why do that when you can essentially use LEGAL SLAVE LABOR?!Yes, you read that right, you get to force prisoners to work in your prison for as long as you'd like, heck, even until THEY DIE, just so you can make and sell a few extra license plates. Who wouldn't want something like that?So in all fairness, give this game a try, and be the most brutal dictator you can. Have fun, and don't forget: Prisoners never stop wanting things, so it's fine to deny them basic human rights in the first place. Hehe, ""Human"" ""Rights"". Still makes me laugh.			",16,2,0,5,5,0,8

												Awesome game. It is so enjoyable to make a maximum security prison and treat your prisoners worse than the dirt beneath your feet just because you can. You can either be a friendly, understanding omnipresent being or you can be as malicious and corrupt as the warden from Shawshank Redemption. Overall, i'd give it a 9/10 for its addicting gameplay and variety of playstyles. I wish you could have multiple floors on your prison but we cant have everything.			",139,18,0,12,22,1,11

												I built an prison that was pretty well made and to challenge myself with the escape mode. It only took me an week to escape/destroy my prison. My weapon of destruction was a lighter! - I wondered the prison during it's hour-long freetime session and I sneaked an office with the help of am ingnorant guard who willingly let me into it and I founded an lighter.-The next day I was trying to dig myself tunnel to escape through when an guard noticed what I was doing, so I ran out of my cell and was chased by a group of them with one of the armed guards. I used the lighter to attack one of the guards and the armed guard started shooting. Quickly, I started hitting him with it and he dropped his shotgun.-I didn't know whether not I could use the shotgun, but I took the risk and actually picked it up. I started firing and moments later other prisoners were fighting the guards as well until a riot rosed up. I killed the guards with only two shots of the gun and then riot police came in.-With the help of other prisoners who helped me take out two more armed guards and they took their shotguns, holding the riot police at bay long enough to where the floor was covered in the bodies of the police. I wondered off to see if the lighter worked while they were fighting and I set an huge fire that engulfed most of the prison (by lighting a lot of things on fire). - I along with some other guys fled to southern staff hall of my prison, breaking through the staff doors to escape through the southern prison gate. The two armed prisoners managed to shoot down a lot of riot guards, I even took an screenshot if anyone wants to see. - I managed to escape from my prison with luck, though I don't know what was the fate of those armed prisoners.Hope you guys like my story, escape mode is rather hard depending on the prison. I only got lucky that I started an riot when I got that shotgun. I recommend this game because of that mode.			",92,31,2,39,23,0,17

												Heres my thoughts on Prison ArchitectThe Positives*Prison Architect is probably one of the best maintained games I have ever played*The developers are amazing, they listen to the community unlike most other game developers.  *I love the videos the developers make every month describing what new things they added or changed to the game. *The game updates at a consistant monthly basis including a large amount of bug fixes or features each month. *They are always coming up with new ideas like escape mode which allows you to be a prisoner of your prison or other community made prisons. *The gameplay itself has improved massively. There are so many things you can build, change, add, etc... even during the end parts of the game where you have built a massive prison with every aspect of the game included in your prison, there are always problems that need fixed and things need changed.The Negatives*I don't want to be a fanboy here, but I can't think out of the top of my head any negatives to this game.The Bottom Line*Prison Architect is a great game with amazing developers. I would recommend buying this game.			",20,1,0,3,10,0,2

												Had one prisoner who would constantly start fights and kill other prisoners, being new to the game I didn't have execution unlocked yet so I did it the long way. Locking him and some other poor prisoner in a room with nothing. It took a while for them to die but I don't regret a single second of it. But this game is also good for not murdering people, one of my prisoners had two under 7 year old kids so I let him escape because I felt bad. 10/10 can make you want to murder people or reunite them with their family.

								Normally, an Early-Access game would get a Thumbs Down from me however, this one is different!This game is still in Alpha and has been for about 2 years? Anyway, it feels like a complete title to me, they have done a load of ""Bug Bashes"" removing the annoying issues you'd expect, they've allowed full Workshop modding into the game( Every singleplayer game should in my opinion ) and they've also added awesome features to make the game feel personal to you!Now, Obviously, the graphics aren't amazing and they're not meant to be, they're simplistic and that's nice! the art style is beautiful and most importantly for me, this game supports 1080p. ( maybe higher, I couldn't say! ) ...There's only one thing that's annoying me about this game and I wish was fixed ASAP. When walls are knocked down, the Rubble pile won't go away, you have to click ""Clear indoor area"" and outdoor Rubble won't seem to go away!Oh, one last thing I love, You have different ""Classes?"" of prisoners, Min, Norm, Max, Supermax etc. This is nice as it adds  a bigger challenge to the game!Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys logical games and/or building games. You're getting something truely special and this game is another reason why PC gaming is evolving so nicely!			",346,72,24,34,53,5,39

												I find this game to be obscenely fun and have logged almost 100 hours of play time.  However, I can't recommend this game due to performance issues.  The game does not hyper thread and will only run on one core of your processor.  As your prison grows larger your game performance noticeably decreases until it is simply unplayable.  In my current game I have 570 prisoners, 140 staff and a prison worth $1.7 million and get about 2 fps.  I am able to run much more graphics intense games at far higher fps with my rig.  This is very disappointing.  Hopefully the developer will work to correct this issue, if so, I will adjust my review.AMD FX 8350 Eight Core 4GhzDual AMD Radeon HD 7900 3GB32GB Ram ",155,15,4,26,51,1,49

												Kinda got hooked on this game. I learned to play with bugs many of wich are fixed now but It is sometimes hard to tell because you need to do things differently to test if your workaround is still necessary.I'm building a very large prison wich I had hopes to implements all difficulties with counter systems to keep a good score.But my biggest hurdles are :- the lag (frame rate) it did get better but I guess the game was not intended to build big prisons.- the planning tool absolutely need a copy, paste, rotate, flip feature.- building take a lot of time and there is no way to correct mistakes or design adjustements, after spending 60 hours or more on a prison I hate the idea of starting over because I need to move the whole thing 2 rows to the left.Going through the challenge of design, building, managing, troubleshooting, learning the game is super fun.But once you went through it and want to test yourself on a bigger scale the process is just to long and design corrections are impossible.I hope version 2.0 will run faster and have options to facilitate creativity.W7, I5 8Gig Asus Hero VI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								My friend Roughneck keep posting those interesting picture of this game so i decide to give it a try. GOSH.. I got stuck playing this game for 7 hours straight right after the first get go.It's basic a SIM clone in prison setting. But it goes way beyond SIM/SIM City. For indie..The graphic is quite unique and simple. There character movements are really smooth.The music is a bit too simple for my taste but does give you a good feel of the game. The gameplay is great. Prisoner keeps on coming and you need to house them, Search them, Isolation them, Feed them, Clean them, Medical them, Entertain them and even execute them. You need to pause every once a while to check up on everything to see if you missed anything.So far the best i can do is reaching 50 to 60 prisoner then my game start getting out control and riots everywhere. I will play again try to do better.It's a never-ending sand box so there is really no story involved.The game is still in earlly access and there is no achievements yet so you cannot really brag your progress until it;s implemented.The workshop for this game is really active, i havn't installed anything from the workshop but i do see a lot interesting things.This is not a game to pass up if you are a good architect and Sim/Sim City Lover.8.5/10			",2444,944,81,289,309,25,345

												Kinda got hooked on this game. I learned to play with bugs many of wich are fixed now but It is sometimes hard to tell because you need to do things differently to test if your workaround is still necessary.I'm building a very large prison wich I had hopes to implements all difficulties with counter systems to keep a good score.But my biggest hurdles are :- the lag (frame rate) it did get better but I guess the game was not intended to build big prisons.- the planning tool absolutely need a copy, paste, rotate, flip feature.- building take a lot of time and there is no way to correct mistakes or design adjustements, after spending 60 hours or more on a prison I hate the idea of starting over because I need to move the whole thing 2 rows to the left.Going through the challenge of design, building, managing, troubleshooting, learning the game is super fun.But once you went through it and want to test yourself on a bigger scale the process is just to long and design corrections are impossible.I hope version 2.0 will run faster and have options to facilitate creativity.W7, I5 8Gig Asus Hero VI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison Architect is an extraordinarly addicting game. Each playthrough you learn the do's and don't of how to manage a prison. This jourey is definetly a rewarding process. My first playthrough saw 7 of my first 8 prisoners escape through the multiple staff doors the janitors and builders kept leaving open. I fixed this in my second playthrough but by that time I had taken in too many prisoners and riots ensued. This game definetly has that replayabilty desired in a game; each playthrough I improved with tweaks to the designe of the prison. Prison Architect is definetly a rewarding experience for those with the time to invest.			",80,18,5,9,44,2,17

												This game is very easy to get into, and surprisingly addictive. I'm not sure how many times I've sold off my current prison to start another because the layout that I had build wasn't ""quite right"". The different objects, rooms and game difficulties mean there are a lot of different options and setups to keep gameplay interesting after your first prison. There's a lot of experimentation to do in terms of how you deal with prisoners, how many staff to have, where to deploy them etc. The game's main sandbox mode allows you to turn off the failure conditions too, so you can even purposely run a terrible prison just to see what happens!I didn't personally get into the escape mode. Not because it's bad, it just didn't really have any appeal for me because it's completely different from the prison building aspect of the game - but it is definitely worth a go.Overall, the game has a lot of depth for what is essentially ""prison tycoon"", and will definitely be one of my ""go-to"" games in the future.

												It's a shame that they decided not to add anything new to this game, because it's lacking a number of things that would make it a really good prison simulator. Namely, the only way for your prisoners to escape (other than leaving the door open) is to dig an escape tunnel, something only certain prisoners can do. They won't try and attack your guards to steal keys, they won't try to climb fences, nothing. Prisoners also do not exist to each other at all, except as things to beat up if they go on a tear, or murder if they are randomly assigned traits like Snitch and Ex Law Enforcement. These are the only kinds of prisoners that will have hits called on them; they will never be called on any other prisoner. They do not talk to each other, they do not form bonds with each other, they do not band together or dislike each other except as part of the optional Gangs system. The problem with the Gangs system is that gang leaders will frequently be assigned traits that make them extremely volatile troublemakers, rather than subtle string-pullers that never get their hands dirty. They will murder your staff, and then the rest of the gang will riot when they are punished for it, rendering the system more of a nuisance than anything.The game reeks of unrealized potential that was cut short when the dev team realized they had been working on this title for 6 years and wanted to be done with it. It may be released, but it is nothing approaching finished. They didn't even bother to hammer out a flexible, powerful modding API before they ditched it, so these holes will never be filled. Despite this, it's still a very enjoyable, fun game that you should buy and enjoy. But when you've played it as long as I have, you will always have that niggling at the back of your head that it's lacking a lot of important things.			",150,23,1,21,21,1,21

								In the first, i think this game is simply easy and a little bit frustrating. well, i was wrong. This game is REALLY FUN and REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! let me give you a real deal advice: DO PLAY THE TUTORIAL FIRST BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PRISON. Because this game is similarly like Grand Age of Rome or Tropico, some buldings are requiring other building, or some buildings are requiring a blue print which this blue print won't uinlocked unless you hire a staff, and the staffs are won't unlocked unless you hire a warden, and a warden isn't working unless you build him an office, and that damn office won't functional unless you put some requiring stuffs!! what the hell, right?!! So i repeat, DO PLAY THE TUTORIAL, BECAUSE I PLAYED FROM 12 PM UNTILL 5 PM JUST TO REBUILD ALL OVER AGAIN, AND FROM 5 PM TO 8 PM JUST TO REDO WHAT I'VE DONE IN 12 PM TO 5 PM LOL. but i REALLY ENJOY PLAYING IT. 9 / 10 untill the final vesion come out.

												It's surprisingly good. In terms of Steam games that I began playing in Early Access, this is one of three (Terraria and Kerbal Space Program being the others) that I would readily rank ahead of numerous triple-AAA titles.So, let's get the main question out of the way immediately: I strongly recommend this game if you're really into the Tycoon/Sim style of game. I'd probably give this about a 7.8/10, to be honest, which is solid for $29.99, but is a steal if you can get it cheaper.Now to the rationale for my decision:---------------------------------------------GOOD : You can play it on a simple level, or on a complex one, and it remains just as fun. If you enjoy sitting and connecting up elaborate electronic doors, CCTV cameras, and making the most efficient-yet-safe use of space as possible while trying to never have an escape or death, you can do so and find it a genuine challenge. Or, alternatively, you can turn failure conditions and events off, use old-school patrol-planning and little else, and even give  yourself unlimited funds.And the prisoners behave in ways where you can act simply, or really think things through. At first blush, it seems so simple as to why a prisoner kills someone. But if you get informants and look at info, you'll notice that murders occur more often for pretty logical reasons: victim is an ex-cop or snitch... murderer has a violent reputation... murderer was dissatisfied with several of their needs (hygiene, nutrition, etc.). You can ignore all this and just beef up security in general and take 30 seconds just to re-route a patrol and add a guard, or you can form a protective-custody cell block that is more isolated and start putting snitches and other prime-targets in there away from the Max-security cons.And you have the logistical tools to actually do all this... you can set individual schedules for each security-level, lay down specific patrol routes, assign certain blocks to be used only by certain groups of prisoners, and hire staff that conduct reform programs. It's a lot of fun, and you can pick how you want to play. And in the mean time, you can go around clicking on prisoners to see what ridiculous things they did to end up in prison. Great fun.-----------------------------------------------BAD :There *are* issues, however.My main gripe is that too many toys are locked behind tech unlocks. Which at first sounds like SimCity, another game where the neat special buildings have to be unlocked and even then you have to wait a painful amount of time to build them (here, too, money comes in pretty slowly). But here the issue is worse, because I feel like really, *really* basic things are too expensive simply to unlock:Why do I need to unlock being able to assign patrol routes?Why do I need to unlock being able to take out a loan? (though grants do exist for building specific things)Why do I need to unlock janitors and gardeners?And as far as I know, even if I play with unlimited funds, I *still* have to manually unlock these things, which don't just unlock with the push of a button but take time. And, similarly, there's no option for insta-build... if I play with no failure conditions and unlimited funds, why not also allow me to build things instantly rather than having to hire 50 workers and wait for my mega-prison to be built over the course of real-life hours, hours that are added on to whatever time it took to actually lay out everything for them to build?These are fairly minor issues in my opinion, and the Steam Workshop is a great place to go for some pre-built prisons, but doing that takes some of the fun out of building it yourself. Yet when building huge prisons, building it yourself takes you a while to give all the build orders, and then even longer to actually see the place be built. Which is fine when going for realism, but when I want a sandbox mode experience, it slows things up.Really, this game needs a full-out sandbox mode where I can build instantly, rather than just a couple of options that sort of approximate a sand-box mode.Again, not nearly a big enough issue to really hamper the fun for long, but does make it hard to experiment with designs numerous times unless you stay a bit smaller in scale.---------------------------------AND THE UGLY:Tooltips and info are really, really sparse for this game. The info is all there, really, but sometimes it's in a place where you might not think to look, or is so briefly covered that a bit of clarification would have been helpful. Right away, you assign reform programs, but it says no time is scheduled for them. But it doesn't say *why*. So you have to go to the scheduler (under Regieme) and hover over 'Work' to find out that reform programs don't have their own slot but occur during 'Work' time for anyone who isn't working. Which is already obscure, but what's worse is that you don't have an intuitive need for 'Work' time until you unlock 'Prison Labor'... so you might have already removed the default 'Work' time slot prior to deciding your unruly cons need some reform programs. It's a mess, and one that could easily be avoided if it said on the 'Programs' screen that your reform programs aren't scheduled because there is no 'Work' time slot (rather than just saying there's no time scheduled for them). And similar issues, though not always to this scale, exist elsewhere. When a room needs furniture to function, the game tells you exactly what you need... but when the room fails to function because an escape tunnel entrance is in it (mostly in cells), it doesn't tell you this. Which is an issue because the tunnels can sometimes be partially underneath some other sprite in the game, usually a bit of debris a work left in the cell after not throwing out the dummy left in the bed,It's an issue that goes away once you play a bit and learn the ropes, but it's an unnecessary learning curve that could be removed by including just a little more info here and there.The other 'ugly' issue is that a few sprites are unclear as to what is forward and what is backward. TVs, Radios, and garbage bins look surprisingly the same whether looking at back or front. This isn't a graphics issue so much as it is a design issue... the TV screen looks like the TV's back CRT area. Just make the screen blue and white and keep the back part black. It's not an issue for too many objects,  but there are a few where just a slight change of color would distinguish the back from the front.---------------------------------------OVERALL: It's part SimCity, part 'Tycoon', and part 'The Sims Go To Prison'. If you want your convict-sims to be able to kill each other daily, you can make it happen, and if you want a genuine challenge to keep them healthy and alive, you can make that happen, too. If you're into any of the three games mentioned above, I'd recommend this.  ",55,3,0,14,18,2,32

								Excellent game ! It is still in Alpha and the game is playable since a long time. First of all, to see a dev team that dedicated to their game is a plus, they regularly release updates, bringing new elements to the game, correcting some bugs but of course creating news bugs ! But it's an alpha ;)In Prison Architect, you start with your piece of land, some workers and a low budget. You'll have to turn this no man's land into a working penitentiary. Working penitentiary ? No, in fact you need to turn it into an industry that makes profit. Little by little, you and your workers will build your prison. At first it is going to be small and empty but over time and with income, your prison will look better. Your choice, an Alcatraz or a luxuary hostel ? As long as there is a way to make money, all choices are good. Once the basic dentention building is made ( kitchen, canteen, cells, showers and staff room,..Etc ) you are now able to welcome your first inmates. What will you choose ? Calm and nice persons who only made a mistake ? Or the evil men making your guards' lives a misery but who bring a nice federal grant ? Your choice and your responsability ! Then it's up to you to improve your prison, making it safe for everyone, impossible to escape and profitable!Prison Architect is already a big game, with its learning curve but once you get the hand of it ( should not take long ) it lets your with your creativity. You can build the prison th way you want it. You can make it looking like a smiling face or like fortress. But they don't always work and may lead to bankruptcy or to a massive riot that your special teams will not be able to stop,ending with all your inmates to escape. More than that, the game still has plenty of room for improvement and new features. Some are lacking but may be implemented one day ( gangs, ...Etc ). There is already enough to do and hours have plenty of great games. About graphics, well not everyone can like this 2D style but I like it. The graphics are simple but well adapted to the genre. It runs quite well if you meet the required specs. Bugs ? Yes there are bugs! It is still in alpha, but the devs need to fix some of them, those that ruin a prison like delivery trucks never stopping to your prison! The pathfinding for your workers also seriously needs to be fixed and/or improved, it is a pain in the neck to see them stuck in the corners of your walls. Other than that, nothing too serious. If you buy it, keep in mind it is an Alpha, everything is subject to changes and tweaks and so far, the game only improved.Building and managing your prison! For the better or ( and ) the worse, it's Prison Architect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've put a fair few hours into Prison Architect, simply because it's a good game.If you ever played games like Theme Hospital or Dungeon Keeper when you were younger then this should be the exact kind of game you have been waiting for. In fact, if when you look at the videos of the game you think to yourself 'I think i'll enjoy that' then there's a 99% chance that you will.With Prison Architect what you see is what you get.Despite the game being in Alpha it is still full of features and is completely playable if you don't mind facing some rather amusing bugs. The first time I played Prison Architect I was a little apprehensive because despite many games claiming they are Theme-Hospital-Inspired very few manage to capture that level of addicted I felt when I used to play it. However with Prison Architect I was pleasantly surprised. I must have put 6 hours into my first play, building, destroying, restarting, but mostly learning. The tutorial gives you the basic knowledge you'll need to play the game but like most games from this genre, how you play is completely down to you. You'll probably spend your first play learning why metal detectors are important and why you don't need to buy 30 guards the seconds you play. The gameplay itself is solid and enjoyable with enough content to make it worth the purchase and keep you entertained despite it's Alpha tag. The menus are all very basic, and can be a little temperamental (the developers focus on content rather than polish at this point) and the graphics of the game are easy on the eye.  The updates come monthly, and usually bring one or two major new features (at least) and a ton of bug fixes so you're never left waiting too long to know what is going on which I think is an important part of Early Access games.Overall, I think the game is 100% worth buying if you're a fan of MicroManagement style builder games or you have a love as strong as mine for games like Theme Hospital and Dungeon Keeper.

								In its current state, I think Prison Architect is quite expensive for what you get. But it is indeed a good game. As of Alpha 25, maintaining a functioning prison where anything can go wrong is pretty fun. The chaos that could break out in a matter of seconds requires quick player response to the issue, and can lead to some amusing situations which the player can learn from to improve their facility. The want to expand is always present, and it is likely some players will create prisons that are too big for their own good. The attention to details (education programs, the needs system, contraband, etc) continues to surprise me. The fact you are able to tell where contraband comes from, how it got in, where it went, and where it was found is just one of many of the detailed features that can affect the build of your prison. All this said, it is pretty buggy (it is an alpha after all), but I reccomend picking it up when it is discounted if you are at all interested.			",176,33,0,24,22,4,22

												Prison Architect is, well obviously a prison sim. You build and manage a prison which can be quite fun in both building the prison layouts and managing the prisoners as well.It's a great game if you are into management and building (tycoon) sims.The only problem which makes the game less appealing is the poor optimization of the game overall, the game fps drops over time as you build and reach ~300 prisoner capacity even on a high end rig. Frame drops can be noticed on less if you build on large maps or buy a few land expansions. Playing on 15-30 fps can be slow and painful to expand further. I mean why have an achievement for 1000 prisoners when the game simply can’t handle it.If they could fix the optimization issues {which I doubt will happen now), it has a lot of potential.Overall 7/10 ",32,3,0,0,3,2,8

And I lucked out, this is actually a really enjoyable game (kinda feels dirty saying that about a prison sim but it's true), with a lot of depth to it. I played for four hours and I barely scratched the surface so far. The one ""con"" if it can be looked at as that: certain aspects of gameplay aren't exactly intuitive or obvious. You might fumble around in the attempt to do certain things, until you finally get it ""right"". There are wikis and such online however, so nothing is impossible to accomplish between trial and error and outside sources. But the tutorial in my opinion is far too short and I'm hoping it will be expanded to explain certain things better (in my case, I was stumped by how to plan out the power lines/plumbing pipleines).Still though, even at this point in the game's development, I wouldn't call it a frustrating game. Instead I'd classify it as challenging at times, but a lot of fun regardless. Overall, I'd highly recommend it. It's one of the most unique sims I've ever played, and definitely more than worth the $10 I spent on it already.			",24,36,0,4,9,0,3

												An empty plot of land. A handful workmen. A bit of cash...This prison building and managing game is a good one. Start out with nothing, or grab a prison from the steam workshop. Recieve your first prisoners, and panic... Do I have cooks in my kitchen?Enough guards?Metal detectors?An escape proof outer wall?Enough cells?Water and electricity?Hopefully, because you will be needing these things to manage the place, and make your inmates happy, or they might riot, and you might end up with your guardforce killed and your prisoners no where to be seen...(you didn't see that escapetunnel, did you?)This game gives each prisoner a personality, some are better fighters others quicker or more likely to    be violent. Your inmates aren't a bunch of strangers. Most even have a family that wants to come and visit every now and then. There are even some religious dudes in your cellblock, so you bettter asign those workmen to build a chapel rather quick or not only the prisoners but even your staff might suffer.When you think the place is perfection, no one has escaped, no prisoners nor guards have been stabbed to death for weeks, then it's time to change roles for a little while.The game flips around magically, and all of a sudden you find yourself being a prisoner in the prison you just built. Your one goal is freedom, dig a tunnel, cause a riot and escape or have your fellow prisoners do it for you. It's your decision.Enjoy.			",14,1,0,1,9,0,5

												Prison Architect is a game that allows for a bit of insight into how a prison functions. The game is a bit buggy but none the less playable if you follow some strict rules to meet grants. One bug that is annoying is a loan grant that restarts every time you re-load a saved game. Grants essentially are goals that you have to attain in order to receive a lump sum of funding.Game play includes ability to make kitchens, laundry rooms, prison cells, solitary confinement, guard outposts, offices for accountants/warden, close circuit television (if fog of war is on), woodshop (for prisoners to work in), classrooms, yard and a lot of other specific room types. Planning your prison is actually easy as the game let's you overlay a shadow zone for future rooms. When building certain zones such as prison cells, they need to be a certain size as well as need certain furniture to be considered of use. So, a jail cell would need a toilet, a bed, and at least a 2X3 (tiled) area. Variation in staff is also a consideration of the game as prisoners and guards alike can become hurt. Doctors need to be hired to ensure proper health of all pupils within the prison. Other staff is available such as chef's (to cook for the prisoners), accountants, and even K-9 guard units. The game can get pretty serious as shotgun guard units can be introduced. Guards can be given patrol routes or can be assigned to designated zones. This is actually a very nice feature in-game that helps you quickly cover zones that need an increase in supervision. Prisoners themselves need down time and rooms with pool tables, TV's, or telephones to entertain them. As the head of the prison, you are able to put it on lock-down and are able to call a strip search of each prisoner at anytime. They also need conference tables for when they have visitors! If you like small micro-managing things like this, you'll definitely like the game.The art style of the game definitely sets it apart from other games. Triple A graphics aren't here, but doesn't mean there is any shortage of differentiating between a sink and fridge. Sounds are decent; if there is a fight, you'll hear it.Game is fun but can be repetitive after a few times playing. RATING : 7.15/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

Early Access Review
								An absolute gem of a construction/simulation game! Even if it's in Early Access, I would say it's better than some games which have been full released, though this of course, is very subjective. Still though, the concept is incredibly fun and amusing, even though... you're constructing a prison for some hardened prisoners? Particularly in Early Access, you can also come across some bugs, but that's fine, Introversion is doing a great job working on the game, and ironing out these bugs while also adding more new features.The game has a bit of a learning curve, with only a very brief introduction before throwing you into the deep end. Why doesn't this or that work? But that's fine, you can only learn from your mistakes after all. Your prisoners have escaped because you locked your doors open? You forgot to build a perimeter wall? Your kitchen is too small to feed your prisoners? Well, you've learnt from your first mistake, your next prison will be much better! It's incredible just how quickly time slips by when you're building your own prison.The sandbox nature of the game is incredible. Even at this early stage, you are given many options with which to construct and expand your prison. Do you allow or deny your prisoners comfort? Don't worry though, their cells must be indoors and have a bed and a toilet... But the possibilities are virtually endless. You can give cells bookshelves, or windows. You can make paths between different rooms and buildings of your prison. There are a huge number of different rooms and objects you can place to improve your prison, which only makes the game much more fun and interesting.But that's not all! You manage your prison as you construct it, hiring staff (most importantly, builders to you know, build your prison), keeping your prisoners contained and reasonably happy, and completing your To-Do List. It can take a bit of work to figure out what you're doing wrong and what is going right, but the path is always an enjoyable one. Something that is only made better by the Steam Workshop support, offering incredible replayability with mods if you so choose - not that you really need to in order to sink many, many hours into this beauty.

Early Access Review
								This is a fun game, especially when you have good intentions to run a great prison, but then some prisoners have to mess things up. I bet they didn""t know what they where in for by messing with me. They disrespected MY prison, I kindly shut down the power and water and locked it down until half of them had died, and the remaining decided to riot. The riot ended quickly though, especially when the government stepped in and took my prison away from me, and killed the prisoners that were involved in the riot. Would I reccomend this game? YES! That is the point of this review!			",158,25,1,8,13,0,3

												""Our previous warden died or something like that, so now you're in charge. What? Need a tutorial? Sure, here's how you build a house, build utilities, hire people, designate rooms, execute people etc.. What? Oh, the rest of the stuff? Don't worry about that, you'll learn the meaning and the use of it just seconds after you fu*k something up!""So... It's a prison builder. You would think that there would be nothing really to do, other than boss around the inmates, but you are wrong. IVSoftware has made it really, REALLY detailed. And they make you care about your prisoners, especially if you have less ~50 prisoners. This game allows you to manage prisons in the way YOU want, with YOUR political or ethical standarts. And that is what a sandbox should be: the ability to express your creations the way you want and not be forced to do otherwise.Has great mod support and a growing community to make sure, that, even if you somehow get bored, you will be able to find something new to try out. But that is also a negative. After 8-12 hours I have done everything: completed the campaign, built a functioning prison with 300+ prisoners, played the ""Escape"" mode (which is a LOT of fun at first, but after like your third or fourth prison, each new prison becomes a speedrun on ""How fast can I break the shower heads and toilets, stirl up a riot, grab a shotgun and run out"". But, as it's only found in the ""Extras"" section, I believe, that this bare-bone mode is not finished yet, despite the game being released). All that's left is to find those meaningless photos and notes, in which I can't figure out the handwriting.All and all, this is a great sandbox and the price is fairly cheap for a game, that gives content for atleast a day, plus mods, plus replayability with different playing styles. I rate the game with an 8/10- a MUST try-out, with a potential of stealing tens or even hundreads of hours, depending on your taste.			",39,3,0,0,6,2,5

								I got this in the last Summer Sale and I got no regrets. So far one of the most fun games I've ever played.Pros: + Doesn't have many limitations when it comes to build, so set your imagination free.+ You can name a Prisoner :D+ Easy to play, if you think the contrary please replay the tutorial (I was stuck here as well)+ Every prisoner is just a different ""person"" so you'll never encounter the same guy+ Beware of spoons+ Does not require a high end PC to run.Cons:- Doesn't have a soundtrack but yet has very good quality of sounds (Footsteps, building noises, cooking sounds, opening and closing doors so on)- Buggy, after playing 10 hours I came across a few bugs, two of them gamebreaking.I totally recommend this game, but I hope it can get outta Early Access.

												A lot of games in the (city) building genre tend to all have a similar theme - while Cities:Skylines and Planetbase are fundamentally different in terms of gameplay they still offer very similar objectives - building a systainable city/colony where everything works. I know Planetbase is not the best example for this, it does convey my point tho. Here is where Prison Architect enters the field: It offers a completely new take on building something. Rather than managing big-scale cities and traffic you manage a Prison with all it's contents - cells, cell quality, laundry, cleaning, health. The game starts small, as many others, but you can rapidly expand and create huge Prisons. It is one of those games where you inevetably need to take multiple tries before finally getting it right as you usually run into problems. It is entirely possible to build a decent prison first try, but to get it running better you will need more tries and experience. The game has a great pacing, you can begin expansion shortly after getting your first prisoner intake, but at the same time too rapid expansion is effectively limited by staff count and money. Overall I can recommend this game as it is good fun and really enjoyable because it offers a unique concept and implementation.			",63,9,0,4,13,1,11

Penitentiary ProblemsPrisons, an imperfect solution to an imperfect problem.You know it costs an average of £40,000 per year to keep a convict imprisoned in the UK, that's double the average national salary.With regards to financially motivated crime, it’s ironic to think that the offender probably wouldn’t have committed a crime for financial gain if they’d had the money it costs the tax payer to imprison them in the first place.Subsidised HonestyBut what’s the alternative; pay the potential offenders to encourage them not to commit a crime? Whilst I’m sure that would be incredibly popular with the criminal types, even I can see that it’s an insane idea.Then there are crimes of passion, insanity and cruelty to be taken into account, but what is the cost effective solution?There’s always the option of the death penalty, that would help keep the costs down but it is a little on the permanent side, although with regards to re-offenders, the record excellent!Designer Pen... itentiaryWhether the prisoner is going to be walking “The Green Mile” or not, they’re still going to need somewhere to stay whilst they’re in custody, not to mention facilities, food etc. Then there’s the man power required to keep the infrastructure ticking over.Someone’s got to cook the food, keep the facilities running and most importantly, make sure that the prisoners behave themselves and don’t do anything inconvenient like escape.When you think about it, there’s a lot of resource management involved.Before you even open the doors to the wrong do'ers, you need to worry about the design and construction of the prison itself with its own costs and complications.Play Pen...  itentiaryWith the design aspects, people management and juggling of resources, it’s a concept that would make a pretty interesting game and that’s where Prison Architect an early access title in development by Introversion Software comes in.Clean SlateIt seems that the adage “Build it and they will come” doesn’t just apply to baseball fields but prisons too.You’ll start the game with a patch of land and a bus load of prisoners already on their way to check in.It’s time to get building.Fixtures and FittingsThe first thing you’ll need to do is recruit a prison governor, who’s going to need an office, so you’re going to need to design and build that. He’ll probably want some luxuries like a desk and chair in his office too, maybe even a window and a filing cabinet, but all these things cost money.You should probably have a few prison guards to keep the convicts in line when they arrive.The guards are going to expect a staff room to relax in; somewhere they can sit and eat their sandwiches whilst watching re-runs of prison break, so you can add some chairs and a TV to the shopping list too.The TV isn’t going to work without electricity so a generator is a must, then you’ll need to lay down power cables and maybe running water isn’t just a luxury either, time to call the plumbers.OversiteSo your plot of land has now turned into a construction site, the prison bus is nearly here and we’re missing something vitally important. A place to put the prisoners!All in it TogetherYou almost certainly don’t have the time or the resources left to build a wing of prison cells; hopefully a large holding cell will do for now, all the prisoners will just have to be squashed into the one communal room when they get here.Perhaps we’ll spoil them and throw in a bench or two for them to sit on and a toilet for them to...  err... sit on too.Another Brick in the WallYou might want to place some prison walls whilst you’re at it, just in case one of your guests decides to make a break for it.It seems the honour system doesn’t work that well with regards to prisoners trying to escape.Fresh MeatSo the prison bus has pulled up outside and your newly employed prison guard is leading the “fresh meat” to the holding cell, but there’s no rest for the wicked.You’re going to need showers, a kitchen, an exercise area, a cook for the kitchen, etc. and some corridors and security doors to join it all up.Family & FriendsThere will be another bus load of prisoners along soon enough and now you’ve got your first batch of orange jump suited guests, you’re going to get family members wanting to visit them.It’s best they don’t see their loved ones all crowded around the one communal toilet in the holding cell, so it’s time to think about getting the contractors back on site to construct a visitors building too.I Predict a RiotThere is always something to think about in Prison Architect, something new will always need building, improving or changing.You’ll need to employ and manage staff, from physiatrists through to janitors.You’ll need to build a host of different room types, along with connecting hallways, you’ll also need to think about where you want security doors and cell doors positioned, because sooner or later there will be an escape attempt.If conditions in your prison deteriorate too much your inmates will riot, if they capture or kill one of your prison guards, they could well steal his keys, giving them access to unexpected places and likely lead to the death of more staff, still there’s always the national guard to help restore order.The View from the TopThe top down graphics are crisp and the tubby little characters that waddle around the prison in orange jump suits are cute, the simple art style on show here is surprisingly endearing and certainly helps alleviate what could be quite an oppressive atmosphere, I guess orange really is the new black.Busy HandsI stated earlier that there’s always something to think about whilst playing the game and this is true, but after you’ve been playing for long enough, things will start to feel repetitive. Build more cells, hire more guards etc. It can all start to feel a little samey in the late game when you’re prison is fully built and the only challenge left is to trying to squash a relentless influx of convicts into your increasingly overcrowded prison.It’s also important to keep in mind that at the time of writing Prison Architect is an early access game.Having said that, it’s been in early access for a while now and most of the bugs have already been ironed out. It feels like a pretty complete title and one which I’ve enjoyed serving time with.Voyeuristic Micromanager Wanted!Despite still being in early access, Prison Architect is a perfectly playable, absorbing and rewarding simulation, whether you’re the creative type looking to design your own penitentiary perfection, a voyeur looking to watch little fat inmates waddle around prison or just want to wrap yourself up in a blanket of micromanagement, you’re going to find something to enjoy in Prison Architect.A crime is committed every 5 seconds in England, another prison bus is on its way...For the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ ",744,415,35,113,211,8,165

Early Access Review
								I used to be a big fan of management games such as Theme Park/Hospital, Startopia, Capitalism, Transport Tycoon, RollercoasterTycoon and so on. Back to those days i really wanted 2 types of those: a school management and a prison management game. Introversion Software realized some kind of childhood dream here, just thank you for daring to cover this harsh topic!Prison Architect is a 2D prisoner management game. You'll be asked to give each wave of prisoners a place to sleep, to eat, to wash and eventually to learn as well as ensuring the atmosphere is safe enough for them to go out of there in 1 piece. There is always something to do in Prison Architect due to the pressure of the constant wave of prisoners coming. This brings good dynamics to the game.Each prisoner has its own personnality, a good warden will quickly split those petty thieves and those murderers into different level of security within your prison. Treat any of them bad, and they'll soon riot. Give them a place to receive education and visits from their families, soon your prison will be famous for putting criminals back on the right track.Most of the time in Prison Architect, you're buidling. New rooms, electricity, water, fences, the content is big concerning the building part. The gameplay diversifies when it comes to drug enforcement, establish a security strategy, tunnel digging counter measures... I really like the way  it densifies the game. You also need to research to get new features and get extra cash from grants when you achieve certain goals.It's deep and well done. Graphics are unique, check the video above and you'll immediately understand. No technical problems are restraining you from playing the game except for the biggest prisons, but it's no big deal..At the moment of this review (10/2014) the game is still early access. The team is working hard and keeps communicating with the community. I didnt want to play the early access not to waste the experience but at the moment the content is so important that you can really have fun with the game.I strongly recommend you to play Prison Architect!

								Can you compare this to, let's say, Simcity? Not really, but imagine that instead of managing citizens, you're managing prisoners.Instead of drawing residence and commercial zones, you're drawing cells and kitchens.Instead of having UFO's destroying your city, the ''inhabitants'' of your prison are doing the destruction themselfs with no UFO's involved.Now take all of these, and put them all together, and...Congratulations!

Early Access Review
								I actually really like this game and I liked it even more when I saw there was a workshop for it. I won't write a review like this game is perfect, especially when it's still in development, but it was pretty fun. This seems like a cartoonish game but it's actually pretty graphic. Just in the tutorial alone there's already sex and murder in some pretty good artwork (so props to the artist for shocking everyone). I did think this would just be a fun cartoonish game at first until I started playing it, I saw that it was more expanded than that. Each prisoner has their own name, age and story on how they got there. You'll actually feel sorry for some of them and sometimes you just have to put them up for death row. The game is pretty glitchy every now and again. I tried to open the in game browser and came back to everything flashing white. All my objects and staff were deleted and replaced with white blocks. I'm sure it's just a small glitch I can fix but it's still something to be taken into consideration--the game will malfunction every so often. It'll just be part of the risk of buying it early. I should also mention that I got this on sale at Humble Bundle. I've been waiting for it to go on sale before I got it because I don't think it's worth the original price. It's a fun game and all but 30 dollars for this is way too much. I'd say 10 or 20 at the most. So wait for it to go on sale, or get it while it is still on sale.			",117,67,1,21,43,0,13

												I really want to like Prison Architect, it's the sort of game i usually enjoy.That said it just feels like the scope is too narrow, there are obvious, efficient ways to build a prison and the whole thing feels more like a puzzle game than a simulation game as a result. The starting setup is constantly the same as you work out what the game will and won't let you get away with the starting capital. The room system plays back into this as even though you can make rooms larger than strictly necessary your budget rarely allows for this as the number of inmates continues to grow. The result isn't really your own creation but a bland concrete set of rooms of minimum size often back to back so as to minimise patrol spaces and lighting. Unlike Dwarf Fortress, Simcity or other building games it doesn't feel to me like you're building to your vision of a prison but rather the hyper complex and efficient warren the developers intend you to build towards.

								Yeah, you build a prison and do stuff. And there is a lot of stuff to do. With the 1.0 release its also possible to play as a prisoner in a selfbuilded prison and break out.There are a few bugs. But the developer did good work und they will fix it.			",55,5,2,7,12,0,7

												Where do I get off not recommending a game I've played for 240 hours... ??To be clear, there's plenty to like about Prison Architect. It's rated ""Very Positive"" for a reason, so obviously you won't be throwing your money away if you purchase it. So my cavaet here is, if, like -me-, you want a real challenge, you want to have to work hard with your design in order to prevent prisoners escaping, then prison architect isn't really what you are looking for. It's a good simulation, but not really a game in that sense.The initial concept was super exciting. I got in on early access and started playing, and looked forward to fresh updates each month. I'd try out different base designs, figure out the mechanics, and then do it again when it was updated. But over time I started to notice a pattern. The basic framework already in place, most updates involved ""features"", like new room types, that fleshed out what you could do. But I never felt that the game became much more challenging from then on.I was waiting for staff to be given personalities, like sim hospital. Maybe some of them secretly being corrupt and passing on keys and supplies. I was hoping that prisoners would work together in forming their escape plans, maybe one group making a distraction while another made a break for it. I was hoping that we would get an AI which could analyze the points of entry and exit, figure out what weakenesses existed, and try and exploit those if at all possible. Thats a tricky thing to do maybe. And to be clear, what the game -does- do, it does pretty darn well. But it's not ultimately what I was hoping for, so it has left me disappointed.--------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:As of March 2017 the game had been updated a bit since when I first wrote this review, so I thought I would jump back in and see if I could now recommend it. I played with a new prison for a few hours to see if my original issues with the game still held.Unfortunately it was much as I expected. While there are a bunch of nice new features, the core of the game remains an unchallenging sandbox where it is almost impossible to reach any kind of fail state. Seeking a challenge, I tried the following setup and house rules.1. Small map. No trees for selling.2. No grants. No workshops. The only money I would have is what I started with, and what I would be paid for looking after prisoners.3. Permanent intake. As per intial settings, that means mostly medium sec, a few min sec. Inevitably you end up with a few people reclassed as max sec after they turn out to be crazed murders. So basically a nice mixture. 10-16 or so per day. I hoped that at least with these conditions, I could force myself into enough of a challenge that my puzzle solving brain could have some fun. At the very least, when it all went down in flames it would be fun to watch....Well, that was the idea. 18 days in, I've hit a population of nearly 200, and have a daily income of 11 thousand. Then I also have an extra 5-8k per day bonus when the next batch of prisoners come. It looks likely I could easily continue on in this fashion indefinitely, so I quit in disappointment. No challenge here, even using harsh house rules. What happened? Basically, I kept the prisoners indefinitely in holding cells. You stuff a few dozen bunk beds in a single room, add some toilets and showers, and voila, you can stuff a hundred prisoners in there, no problem. As the prisoners can sleep when tired in their free time, it doesn't really matter even if you are hot-seating them. The prisoner to bed ratio was maybe 4 to 1. The shower and toilet ratios far worse. Without the need to build cells for your prisoners, you really don't have much in the way of expenses. You just hire a new guard every day, a new cook ever other day, and here and there build extra beds and stoves. Now and then you make a new room to house more people, or you expand on the canteen. It was mind numbingly simple.Through it all I never had a single real riot. Snitchers were getting killed at a rate of one per day or so, but that had no real negative repercussions, so I didn't mind. Two things were very clear.1. The game remains easy to exploit. And without even trying very hard. Prisoners simply shouldn't accept me keeping them in holding cells indefinitely without getting very angry. However they just don't care. This means the game is fundamentally broken, as it makes many other features redundant. Cells? Not needed. Hence money, abundant. And workshops? Also not needed at all. Grants? Unnecessary.2. Most other game features are also entirely unnecessary as far as keeping your prison going is concerned. Prisoners didn't care that I give them pretty much nothing in terms of services/education/family acces etc. etc. etc. You just put them in a box, give them food, beds, some clothing, heat, etc. and thats it. The only reason to have half of the features of the game (libraries, stores, classrooms, etc. etc. etc.) is for the heck of it. Because you want a better score etc.So, my original problem with Prison Architect remains. It's fine as a sandbox to mess around in, I guess. But it isn't much of a game. You can't really lose unless you massively screw things up, and over half the features aren't technically necessary. By comparison, you can't finish a map in Theme Hospital without carefully and judiciously using all the rooms avaliable to you. You have to be clever to win at Theme Hospital. Prison Architect is maybe more like keeping some gerbils, and giving them some wheels to run in, and little plastic houses, and other fun little decorations for your own amusement. That's fine I guess, but it's not a game. Losing is fun, as they say at Bay12. But the opposite is also true.			",62,20,1,15,20,0,13

								One of the best games i have ever played! I have played over 100 hours of this game only because it is so unbelievably good. And it is also updating every month with new cool stuff. My prisons have changed a lot. When I was playing in the beginning, everything I mean literally everything was hard but after an hour or two I understood the basic content of the game! After that I just played hour after hour.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this gamewhen it was in Early Access, and.... damn is it fun. The mechanics are perfect, and there are a suprisingly small amount of glitches (when it was in Early Access, there were tons of them). They consistently came out with new updates, and everytime they did, I came back to the game and started playing again.Pros: Fun but simple aesthetics Interesting story mode Lots of materials/objects to try, which leads to a very diverse aesthetic in every prison you make. Unlike every other tycoon/management game ever, the game doesn't get easy after you get far into it. There are    random events and gangs that will screw you over no matter how far into the game you are. VERY balanced. I think this is my favorite part about this game - it's not ridiculously hard (like Dark Souls), but it's also not ridiculously easy. Replayable. No matter how many times I start a new prison, I always feel like it's new and different. I'm always excited to see where the game (and my brain) will take me.Cons: Buggy (it's not too bad, but you definetely still get them on occasion). Poor optimization. You would think this wouldn't be a big deal in a game with 32x32 graphics and small-scale prisons, but once you get up to a prison with ~500 prisoners, it starts to get very noticeable.  Incredibly easy escape mode. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, get this game because of the escape mode. You will be VERY dissapointed. The escape mode is a small, side-addition they added at the last-minute for a bit of fun. It's not something you will spend more than 10 minutes on at a time. You can escape any prison, very easily, by just following a simple recursive process:  Destroy > Surrender > Upgrade > Rinse & Repeat. Then you become a god because you have a 40% chance of insta-killing any guard. The only time I use escape mode is to see what my prisons look like from a prisoners POV. Sometimes I try to be as normal as possible when I do it - I just wanna see what it's like. Not much info on women's prisons. It's a relatively new release, but it seems rushed, and there are very few sources that actually explain how it works (wiki needs a LOT of updating). Small (and shrinking) community. Most people bought this game, made one prison, enjoyed it, and then deleted the game. I've been noticing this more and more now, as every time I come back to the game, I see less and less news about it that's not directly from the developers.9/10, would recommend to every single person who has enjoyed a management game sometime in their life.

Posted: October 6, 2015
												Well, Prison Architect is finally released. I've been with prison architect for a while now and let me say. They haven't let me down. The game used to be really bugyy, filled with little loopholes, AI problems, or simply backed up supply coming in. The core game was always there. For that I stuck with the game. I'll give you a little bit of a summary (?) on the game in general.Gameplay: As you can clearly see, I've played this game a LOT. Built tons of prisons, messed around with prisoners, built a sandbox prison. I did almost everything. Thing is, I'm still into it. This game is BIG on replayabilty. Honestly I think I've built near identical prisons and they never end the same. The game has been lately centered on randomness of the AI. You used to be able to run the game overnight and nothing would happen. The game has now made it that you will have to pay attention to everything that happens in the game. Riots, drug overdoses, escaping prisoners, angry prisoners, tired guards, you name it. Mechanics: The game has quite a few interesting mechanics on it. One being that prisoners actually work togethor on trying to escape, or they will constantly try to get contraband. You can choose to let the prisoners sit in thier cells and have the guards deliver food to them or you can let them run around in the yard and potentially get their ""goods"" from the fences. Good food, high costs? Small cells or big cells? Armed guards or normal guards? Lockdown or solitary? The game has a lot of choices for you to make for the prison, and a lot of them have a long lasting effect on your game.Asthetics: The game is very pleasing to the eye to view, eveyrthing is smooth, and they have worked on getting the graphics to work with each other. The prisoners and guards are different from each other; making them not a stereotypical guard or prisoner. Overall I would say that if you are for some reason worried about the graphics/asthetics or whatever you want to call them; you shouldn't have a problem wiht it.Humor?: Yes, I won't say too much, but once you see some of the prisoner's stories you will get a good number of laughs.Realism?: I would say this is a pretty accurate simulation of a prison. Prisoners have basic needs, as well as some extra ones like religion or drugs. Metal detectors detect metal tools and not medicine (duh) while dogs will help you with the actual drugs.Community: The community is a very funny one, and is overall accepting. No infamous sour community calling you a newb or anything. Most people offer their ideas of a ""perfect"" prison, and are usually open to give help or get tips.Sounds: Well, I would say that the sound effects of the game are pretty accurate when you get near a partifcular room. (Eg. Near a cafeteria you hear eating or silverware when near a prisoner working out you hear him working out) I would say they payed attention to detail but I wouldn't honestly expect stunningly amazing music.True Sandbox: Definetly is a true sandbox, variety of starting options as well as giving you unlimited funds.Too Easy? Too Hard?: This one game honestly lets you modify your difficulty. If you want difficult you tell yourself only max prisoners and conditions of losing. New to the game? Take in small amounts of prisoners that are maybe minimum and turn of conditions. It is really up to you how hard you want to make it. If lets say you do ""medium"" difficulty then you might find that its more difficult if you messed things up early on or are new to it. It may be easy if you are a pro at sandbox games. I would say if its too easy or too hard its probably you and not the game.Last comments: Thank you all for reading this review I know it was a lot to take in. I would strongly suggest that you buy this game. The devolpers have worked so hard on this game, they've created hundreds of hours of joy for people and have realeased updates pretty regularily.Rating: 10/10 I will definetly suggest this to someone else and look into their other games.

												This game allows you to build a prison in any form or shape you want and then house the criminal elements of the state for the duration of their sentence. You can be strict and keep your inmates on a short leash. Constantly watching their every move and disturbing their nightly sleep with shakedowns and routine searches. Alternatively you can create a prison where it isn't actually all that bad to spend the next eight years. A place where inmates may work or go to school. A prison where your prisoners get good meals and loads of free time. The choice is yours.Your goal in the game of course is to earn money through your intake of new prisoners to make room for even more prisoners. You need to avoid the 'avoidable' deaths and preferably avoid anyone escaping your prison before their time has been served. Eventually though you probably feel that you have a pretty lean prison with no easy way out and this is when you test out your prison in the escape mode.Once you get into the shoes of an inmate, having to navigate the prison halls that you built, you suddenly get a feeling of how secure your prison actually is.I found that my first prison, one that I was extremely proud of until this point, was far from secure and I could basically trick myself out through the front door and then just make a run for it. I made some tweaks but in the end I decided to start over. My second prison was created with my own escape attempt in mind and I tried to prevent all the things that I had managed to do when I escaped from the last one. I still haven't managed to get out... I do excuse myself with the fact that I have to do it without a mouse though :SSeriously a great game!! And it runs on a MacBook Air of all things!			",2,5,0,6,7,0,2

								This game is fantasticFor 18 hours I played this game loving every minute.I would build my prison to the best of my ability and house as many prisoners as the game would throw at me.It would get to a point where I was unable to provide any more services for my yard birds and they would begin rioting turning my prison into a bloody spectacle worthy of awesome screenshots.I just figured: ""Well, that's why it's early access right now.  The rest of these features must be coming in later updates and then this game will be totally awesome!""What's that?These other features can be easily accessed through research in the bureaucracy menu?Are you flipping serious?!?!Looks like someone's going to be up late tonight!10/10  Would skip tutorial again.

Early Access Review
								Prison Architect (PA) is a brilliant village management / logistics game with unique game mechanics and an intuitive user interface. A new patch comes out at the end of each month which is accompanied by a humorous and informative YouTube video. The game feels rather polished at this point, though a few bugs persist and some systems could use expansion.There is a moderate learning curve, but grants (PA’s quest system) point you in the right direction in the early- to mid-game. You can select the order to attempt them (somewhat) and they don’t ever expire, though you can only have 2 or 3 at a time so it’s wise to plan ahead. The menus are easy to navigate and there are several overlays for displaying different types of information. You can pause and accelerate time freely, allowing contemplative or frantic gameplay as the player wishes.Prison layouts are quite malleable due to clear visual cues which make it simple to understand where the bottlenecks in your system are and correct them. Entirely redesigning sections of your prison is easy and enjoyable to accomplish. I’m not saying it’s a simple game; on the contrary, setting up a successful & profitable prison which is able to reply to situations automatically is quite difficult and rewarding.The logistics element is very robust. Many types of things arrive or leave via truck and need to be moved around your prison (e.g. prisoners, food, exports, garbage, laundry, etc.) and streamlining these processes is engaging and fun. However, there are some types of things that workers can pull out of their pockets, which is a minor quip that I hope will eventually change. Once you have several hundred prisoners distributed between the three security types (min, med and max), creating separate regimes so that they can utilize your facilities at different times is an interesting and fun challenge. Simply watching your prisoners and staff go about their daily business is engrossing and highly enjoyable.I started playing it in Alpha 01 (which was a mess compared to now) and have continued to play on and off since. At 200 hours of play time, it’s literally my favorite game. PA is fun at every phase of play; you are never short of projects to work on, even after the grants run out and you start making your own goals. Fans of city-builders & logistics management will enjoy the detailed interacting systems. Since there are no pre-set building / room structures, PA allows the player to be expressive in their layouts. Creative gamers will enjoy making interesting prisons and publishing them on the Workshop, and a recent patch improved Workshop mod support so it will likely blossom with complexity in the near future.Subscribe to “Fin Lake Correctional” (find it in the Workshop), to play my highly tuned 500 prisoner multi-security facility.

Early Access Review
								You have installed a new metal detector at the exit of the cafeteria to curb the theft of cutlery, inmates are irate at the unnecessary search this yields and just as their anger hits boiling point all of your guards have decided it’s time to take a break or patrol some far flung region of your prison. If managing the incessant needs of digital prisoners sounds like your idea of a fun evening then Prison Architect may have you covered.Prison Architect, from developer Introversion Software, is in early access on Steam and is looking to bring a new edge to the management-sim genre. Now, before we start you are going to have to realise something pretty quickly: The first prison you build is going to be a horrible mess. A horrible, bloody, mess. While I thought I got the hang of the basic controls once I had played through the game’s introduction tutorial, I soon came to realise that actually I had only scratched the surface and my first prison mirrored something similar to the film Bronson – a violent, unmanageable mess – rather than the Shawshank Redemption vision I had in my head.But what sort of Prison Architect will you be? The game leaves that decision entirely on your shoulders once you’re settled with the basics; Prison Architect allows you to feel good about yourself, you will be able to build reform programs through education and enable prisoners to learn vocational skills through a workshop system that improves their morale and ability to reintegrate with society upon release. And, of course, if they step out of line you can chuck them straight into solitary to separate them from the main body of your population and leave them to rot which, in turn, provides a deterrent to the other prisoners who may be thinking of stepping out of line. Each prisoner you take in to your prison provides a revenue stream for you to continue improvements and is, of course, offset by the amount of danger an extra man or overcrowding your prison may cause. This delicate balancing act is how you’ll spend a lot of your game, earning some extra cash to improve but not wanting to throw too many inmates in at once.There is a simple tech tree which allows you to slowly introduce new ideas, staff members and rooms to your prison. You may desperately need an infirmary in your prison due to a riot that injured inmates and your staff or you have had a sudden intake of high-risk prisoners which means Patrol Dogs and Armed Guards are in order. Whatever type of prison you decide to build and how fast you need to expand is all down to how you set up the game to begin with. For a more challenging trial you can set it so you have a prisoner intake every single day at 8am and this means you’ll be focusing on some rapid expansion and introducing new cell blocks constantly while having the ability to switch off Prisoner Intake means you will be able to sit back and think about your prison design and put something together that makes sense and works far more efficiently and safely for your staff. You may have prisoners in with your main population that are awaiting execution – these are the most dangerous and likely to revolt because they have nothing to lose and need direct intervention by your guards on a regular basis. You can decide on the level of management you want on individuals and ensure they’re kept separate to the low risk, short stay offenders who may not need as much of your staff’s time.Prisoners will try and escape or smuggle contraband into your prison, they’ll walk around and take every opportunity to skip out on you by utilising any minor flaw in your prison’s design. But, once the day is over and their time is served, your prisoners will be released, reformed and hopefully willing to contribute to society once again. You can drill down and even micromanage every single need of your individual prisoners. You’ll see how long they have left to serve and and whether they’re likely to reoffend once they are released. You can hire a psychiatrist who will help you manage these needs and build the prison’s daily schedule to ensure everyone gets what they need from their day. It is usually the silly things that tend to foil me in Prison Architect – the prison had expanded so rapidly and I had not thoroughly expanded my kitchen to an appropriate level and, therefore, half my prisoners weren’t eating during the one hour of meal time I had allotted which caused the starving to push back against my guards who struggled to control such a large rabid mob.Prison Architect’s simple two-dimensional art style feels crisp and responsive and allows the game to run on just about every PC or laptop you may have opening up the (Usual resource intensive) management-sim genre to a whole new crowd. The game looks great and brings a slight comedic twist to the violence and dark nature of running a prison full of incarcerated inmates. The interface is simple and so goes a long way into allowing creativity. With a new room or angle in your prison two clicks away creativity is easily embraced.There is so much promise in Prison Architect, everything it already offers and the constant, major updates that are consistently pushed to Steam it’s hard to imagine how far the final game will go in polishing the base mechanics and adding new systems for the player to develop and maintain a large scale, working prison. With Prison Architect already tied into the Steam Workshop system you can download different mods and spend a lot of time looking at other people’s work to inspire the direction of your prison. The ability to share your ideas and designs means inspiration is only a click away when you get stuck or how to get yourself out of the corner you have built yourself in too.

												Someone tell Patrick McGoohan: turns out I was Number 1, not that monkey.This is a great management sim. It's not the game I wanted, but that's on me. I still won't recommend it, though, because as addicting as it is, it's never cathartic.I had fun blue-printing and building my prisons, but maintaining them was a chore. Every aspect of the game is needy, like a nest full of baby birds, gaping their ugly, naked faces at Mommy. Yeah, sure, that's management games for you, but there's meant to be some kind of nirvana when the juggling and plate-spinning all come together, and you impress yourself. Instead, I was the ultimate prisoner, chained to a never-ending series of wants and tasks that only existed to occupy me, not entertain me.By the end, all I wanted to do is exercise every cruel fantasy I have upon a population held captive inside a dystopian nightmare complex, but that's not this game. It's frustrating that is comes so close, but perhaps that's just in my imagination.			",80,19,0,12,6,2,26

								I love this game. First thing I did once I had my simple prison was use bureaucracy to let my guards use tazers. I then Hired 100 armed guards, and had all 18 riot police on sight at all times. This made the prisoners very angry and made them riot. I then enjoyed watching the naked prisoners in the shower room get tazed in the nuts by my guards while they were rioting.9/11 would bang Jerry (the hot black one)-Kworr's Professional Gaming Reviews.

								Personal Rating: I didn't expect so much fun playing PA, happily impressed.Classic Rating: ★★★★☆Main reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because of Early Access. Game is awesome but I had some issues in my last playthrough, so I'll wait the end of this year for full release before starting a new prison (and I already miss it).Suggestions for developers:● The plan tool should be improved letting us mark utilities too, being those a critical planning's characteristic.● Some events, like Bureaucracy unlocks, should be notified via text message, just like cash flow.● Side scrolling speed is way too slow when the visual is zoomed-in.● The clone tool should be able to select a wider area, because copying and pasting piece by piece is not comfortable at all; also I do not understand why RMB copies and LMB pastes, but there will probably be a good reason..Bought this game on Summer Sale 2015; it comes with Trading Cards, a nice Badge and Emoticons but it doesn't have Achievements (not that I do care much about them). Recommended? Absolutely.			",615,225,27,59,46,11,73

								A really good game, it allows you to build and organize your very own prison from scratch, abit like the sims cross between theme hospital, and it also requires you to gain and look after inmates and staff and make money to allow your prison to grow, the size of your prison can be pretty endless and at times it can be hard to look after.As you play the game you need to make sure everyone is happy, and has the right amount of sleep and food etc otherwise you can run into trouble with things like riots, property damage and deaths, which all has an impact on what you earn and lose profit wise, you also have to maintain water and electricity throughout the whole of your prison.Overall an excellent example of a modern day theme hospital style game, with alot more flexibility and fun.Note: At the time of writing this the game was in Alpha stage so there was a lot of bugs and issues.

												Excelent Game! The first chapter, that tells a typical history of a man that kills his wife and her lover when he catches them making love at his home, it's a great beginning of an addictive game that make the players spend hours and hours playing.The basic concept of the game is a prison (as is obvious from the title). You have to create a prison starting from nothing! You just have the help of the grants provided by the game that are four and help you with cash to build the basics of a detention center. With the time you are able to do many more things including put the prisoners working for you, earning and saving you money!And if you are not happy because you don't understand english or because you think that is very difficult to build the prison without the money provided by the grants or even if you want new textures to make the game look better you just have to go to the workshop and download(subscribing) some mods!Overall, the game is exciting and addictive. A perfect strategy and simulation game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't get me wrong by the ""Not recommended"" that the game isn't fun.  It's a very cool game.Problem is, it's broken.  I've been trying to play it for 3 days now, and can't.  Once I get my prison so big (40+ prisoners) and my staff gets pretty big...... the AI just pukes and dies....The maintenance workers and janitors cease to function.  They just pile up together and vibrate erratically.And thus with no maintenance or janitorial services, the prison falls into chaos.It has done this with every attempt.I have gathered this game was programmed by a couple of dudes...  and given the installed game files consist of about 8 files total (a couple dll's, a few dat's and an exe), it is quite obvious.This is a very amature piece of software.   It may play fine for some people, but not for me.I'd probably recommend this game, if it were $5 (about the max price it should be)...  but it isn't, so I'm not.It's just too much money to pay for something that has such bad AI.

								 I've tried a lot of Prison Tycoon games, but all were failures. But this is a true architect game.  Not a easy game to pick up and learn. 6 hours in game and I'm still kinda learning. But very potential game when you manage to make it work. The game was very well developed. I like the fact that i can check the file of each prisoner and see the crime that they did.It's also fun to see them roaming around on their free time, getting some exercise in the yard or suddenly charging out of the prison for an escape. I can say that this game so far been very technical on my brain. But very challenging. The utilities mode is very fun as well, installing electric cables, and water pipes to supply the shower room and toilets with water. It's also fun to watch the prisoners fight the guards.All i can say is that the game was very well thought of and very well developed. Up to date, there are already #13 updates since the launch of Prison Architect. Developers really looking into making this the perfect prison game. Keep it up. Looking into more game time with this game. ",231,32,5,34,23,4,28

								I've put 50+ hours into Prison Architect so far, and I'm incredibly impressed by the amount of content and general stability.First of all, despite being in Alpha, it does not give the impression of an incomplete or unpolished game. Gameplay so far has been smooth, apart from occasional lag when the game has been running for a long time, and I have yet to experience any game-breaking bugs or crashes.What makes Prison Architect unique is the prison-building system. Walls, floors and furniture are not enough; one has to carefully plan out their layout to accommodate for electricity cables and water pipes, all of which have to be laid out by the player - perfect for anyone with OCD-like tendencies like myself. You also have full control of guard patrol routes, prisoner regimes, meals, contraband searches... to name just a few.Integration with Steam Workshop also allows players to show off their prison set-ups, and anyone remotely interested in the game should definitely take a look at the layouts I have linked below, which were inspired by the Star Trek Enterprise and the Tower of London.Updates and fixes are released frequently, and I found the developers to be very responsive. The best thing about Early Access is the opportunity to pitch suggestions and feedback directly to the team while the game is still in development. I've played released games with more bugs - please don't let the fact that it's still in Alpha put you off.It's very exciting to be part of Introversion's new project, and I can't wait to see what will be added next!P.S. Make sure you add the character I submitted (Andre ""Snake"" Silva) to your prison!			",1439,699,40,202,173,16,249

Be fair though, otherwise they will Riot! Get bored an become a prisoner in your own or someone elses prisons. Give it a 9 outta 10, only flaw I see is the AI security an even doctors give the impression theyre working blindfolded. To many times you see injured prisoners and 14 doctors doing nothing!

												Prison Architect is something of a tycoon game that requires the player to build and manage their own security facility.The player is focused on creating a healthy environment for both prisoners and staff. Hiring management staff unlocks new programs through the bureaucracy menu that promote business, health, and security inside your facility. I would compare this game to something like Zoo Tycoon where you're essentially caring for profitable pets.The true beauty of this game, in my opinion, is the vast amount of options and room for creativity. Build a supermax hellhole or build a Scandanavian resort prison. Punish your prisoners relentlessly or spoil them like children. Crowd them into packed cells or build them modular apartments. On and on and on.Included in the game is ""Escape Mode."" In Escape Mode, players take the role of single inmates and must work toward gaining a reputation by starting fights or destroying equipment to recruit team members. Steal tools and supplies to help you escape. Hatch elaborate plans with your recruits and make a break for it.The Workshop content means the game never ends. Escape from your friends' prisons or take on a challenge from the community. Workshop is also endlessly great for use in management mode.8/10			",104,20,2,17,13,0,17

Once you get to that point it might lose some of it's appeal, but hopefully once it's out of early access you will have more challenges and more reasons to keep going. I've encountered no gamebreaking bugs, and very few smaller ones which I could plan around quite easily. If you like to plan and build, get it ASAP.

They were about to breach the last door between them and freedom when I spammed armed guards and hit freefire just as they broke through.There were too many. For every weed dealer and flasher that went down five more took their place. Too many died and escaped.GG42/10 would massacre a horde of internet pirates led by a dwarf again.			",16,3,0,7,12,0,20

												This has to be the best builder to date. You build then manage any type of prison to your liking! Manage or even micromanage right down to the quality of food your prisoners eat. Be fair though, otherwise they will Riot! Get bored an become a prisoner in your own or someone elses prisons. Give it a 9 outta 10, only flaw I see is the AI security an even doctors give the impression theyre working blindfolded. To many times you see injured prisoners and 14 doctors doing nothing!

												So before I go into depth with why you should buy this game, let me just summarize it all in the beginning. 10/10, simple as that.Now this may be a tad biased seeing as I have a HUGE interest in law enforcment and such, but honestly this game is amazing. Believe it or not, there is a story mode. And its really, really, REALLY, heavy. Like seriously, theres no sugar coating. The story mode also serves as a tutorial, where for 4 ""levels"" you have to build certain aspects of a prison, and in the final ""level"" you have to make a prison from scratch and meet a set of goals. The building mechanics are really well done and create a sense of immersion, while still allowing the game to flow. All of the prisoners enter your prison with different traits that determine if they are a force to be rekoned with, or someone's b*tch. There is a gang system, which creates prisoners that have specific gang affilitaions. Sometimes you will get a gang leader in your prison, and if the leader is punished, the members of that respective gang will become upset. Not to mention, there is a WORKSHOP PAGE for this game! So if you were in fear of it being one of those games where you play for an hour, get bored, and never open it again, have no fear! There is constantly new content coming out on the workshop page. Everything from user made prisons, to mods that change the game completley! Anyways, I could ramble on forever about all the little cool features and extra content, because there is a ton of it. But for the price, this game is without a doubt worth the money. If you love creating something from nothing, and watching it grow and earn money, yea, this game is for you.			",46,3,1,6,8,2,0

Early Access Review
								I've put 50+ hours into Prison Architect so far, and I'm incredibly impressed by the amount of content and general stability.First of all, despite being in Alpha, it does not give the impression of an incomplete or unpolished game. Gameplay so far has been smooth, apart from occasional lag when the game has been running for a long time, and I have yet to experience any game-breaking bugs or crashes.What makes Prison Architect unique is the prison-building system. Walls, floors and furniture are not enough; one has to carefully plan out their layout to accommodate for electricity cables and water pipes, all of which have to be laid out by the player - perfect for anyone with OCD-like tendencies like myself. You also have full control of guard patrol routes, prisoner regimes, meals, contraband searches... to name just a few.Integration with Steam Workshop also allows players to show off their prison set-ups, and anyone remotely interested in the game should definitely take a look at the layouts I have linked below, which were inspired by the Star Trek Enterprise and the Tower of London.Updates and fixes are released frequently, and I found the developers to be very responsive. The best thing about Early Access is the opportunity to pitch suggestions and feedback directly to the team while the game is still in development. I've played released games with more bugs - please don't let the fact that it's still in Alpha put you off.It's very exciting to be part of Introversion's new project, and I can't wait to see what will be added next!P.S. Make sure you add the character I submitted (Andre ""Snake"" Silva) to your prison!			",1439,699,40,202,173,16,249

												I have had this game for a while now and have loved it! Although the concept is rather bland the way the developers incorperated so many features is great - I feel like the dificulty is a great level for all ages however there is some blood and death scenes so I would advise 12+. I also love how the installation of mods don't change the game, but add features (more callouts, riot makers, etc). I found this game very satisfying and will be playing more, a lot more! For the £20 it is worth it, honestly. If there was a star system it would be five star to you! Good job, keep the work up!			",7,1,0,1,3,1,0

								--------------------- Intro--------------------Prison Architect puts you in charge of: designing, building and managing a prison.You can build anything from cells for your prisoners, offices for your staff, kitchens, canteens, power generators, solitary confinement to yards, work shops, infirmary, CCTV and so much more.Conduct research to gain access to higher tech, new staff and facility types.Make daily profit from your prison and cash-in big when selling it off for a bigger balance to start your next prison.--------------------- About the Game--------------------While the game is easy to learn and after a few attempts you find yourself doing quite well, it is hard to master the bigger facilities and the many prisoner's needs.The game has a great tutorial which nicely introduces you to the game mechanics, how to build and manage a prison.Ones you passed the tutorial you are placed on an empty map you can start your prison on. You can either just go ahead and build a small prison you are comfortable with or expand and take on the challenges of high security prisoners and high security techs to help you overview you prison.During the game you can take on ""grands"" which are sort of like quests. You get a certain amount of money upfront and upon achieving the outlined tasks get a further monetary reward. You make money every day from the difference between the money you make from housing prisoners and the money you spend on facilities and staff.You also can do ""research"". Some staff when hired or some facilities when build unlock the ability to research new staff roles, facilities or techs which allow you to even further expand your prison and ability to control it.If you get bored of your prison you can, after some time, have it evaluated and sell it for a nice sum of cash you can use when starting your next prison.--------------------- Early Access Note--------------------Personally I have not yet come across a major bug in the earlier stages of the game and the stability of the game is very enjoyably. The only minor bug I came across is when you build a door on a wall before you build the foundation, the foundation will build a wall over the door and you need to remove/re-add the door again but that's nothing to even worry about.I believe only at the higher end of facilities and staff are there bugs/missing features, such as when hiring lawyers and such, they apparently don't do anything yet for you. Though that is so far beyond the starting point of the game that you will have many hours of fun before you even get there.You always can sell your prison before you expand to that level and start again with more cash on your next endeavor until the next game patch/update fixes those issues.

								Its being sold for 2 bucks on sale right now but i do not regret buying it earlier for a full price. Its one of the few early access games that has been updating constantly and at a steady pace. Each version brings something new, better UI, deeper gameplay, extra features and bug fixes. They listen to suggestions and complaints and try to address them asap, they add features when requested and polish everything over and over again until its acceptable to players.At the moment this has to be one of the most intricate simulators, with a lot of micro and macro managing features out there. Every little aspect of your prison population like meals, sleep time, work, study and contraband can be managed.I do wish they added female prisons and multi-cells though. Other than that - its almost finished.This, kerbal space program and craft the world are the prime examples of how early access games should be done and how players should be treated.

												I am a simulation player always looking for the next great simulation game and this title fits the bill.  Many hours have been lost to this game, most of it fun, some of it frustratingly so.  Here is what I enjoyed immensely and what irritated me.The GoodOptions are a real consideration in Prison Architect.  Planning out the overall layout of your prison with the blueprinting tool, choosing if you want one massive complex, many buildings about the place, a nice prison focused on reform or a prison based on hell itself.  Locking all inmates up for their entire stay in a 1x1 cell.  Not only are these ideas actually doable, but they all have pros and cons to working with many other possibilities available as well.  You can even decide if you want a male or female prison, which can change certain requirements, layout and rooms.The details of this game are extremely attractive to me.  Working out which phones to tap for intel, sniffing out contraband, locating escaping prisoners in underground tunnels, hooking up CCTV cameras to watch your prisoners Big Brother style, setting up patrols, schedules, deciding if you want armed guards or not, reform prisoners or not, feed them well or not, luxuries in their cells or not, reward good behaviour or not.  Right down to watching the workman build your latest design, laying water pipes, bricks, electrical cables, hooking up lights, groaning as they moving furniture, the little clinking sounds of laying tiles.  Just so wonderful. Getting bored of this title would be an extremely tough challenge I believe.  There is so much content, from a story mode, sandbox, addition of Gangs, Staff Needs, Modding and prison sharing via the Steam Workshop.  Not to mention Escape mode where you can become an inmate in your prison or someone else’s you download from the workshop and attempt to escape it yourself.  This game is worth every penny, I even paid extra for My Name In The Game 'Nancy 'Ripper' Philips'.I play this game on my Youtube channel and will soon be uploading my attempt at a 1000 inmate capacity prison to the workshop.  LaCorp Jail.  I invite you to escape it.The BadIf you are new to this game then you may find yourself struggling to learn the basics.  There is no real basics tutorial and even an opening menu to the game is missing.  When you start up you are thrown straight into a sandbox prison with workmen, few supplies, little money and inmates arriving soon and no real help on what to do.ESC will help you find a menu and a story mode that will teach you some basics but focuses more on what comes much later in your prison and possibly 'showing off' what the game can do.  While the story is great, it doesn't really help a new player become familiar with the title.  All I can say is, it's worth the effort to learn.  You will be rewarded in spades. ",22,6,0,11,23,2,8

								I struggled with the £20 price tag for an unfinished game but I've been wanting to play this since seeing it at EGX Rezzed.I finally purchased it Intending to play a little during my long weekend, I accidentally played it for 25 hours over 3 days, and don't regret it.I had a prisoner named Simon Young whose name will live with me forever. Each day he would destroy and flood his cell then fight the guards.I let the dogs kill him 9.8 years into his 10 year sentence. I smiled as I watched the hearse take him away. That was the only way you were ever going to leave, Simon.10/10			",141,17,2,11,13,0,27

								For an early access game Prison architect plays surprisingly well with only some problems with the ai, and occasional construction glitches.It is the most highly addictive game Ive played since FTL and Ive truly enjoyed every hour I've put into.Also with workshop content already available to alter textures the community should make the game even more enjoyable in the future.

								The game play is fun and addicting and you'll find yourself losing hours upon hours to this game. The best prison simulator ever made and it hasn't even entered beta stage yet. I seriously look forward as to what Introversion Software do next with this game and will provide a full review upon release. If you have ever wanted to build a maximum security prison, chances are you will want this; although without guides don't expect an easy ride.For my full first impressions review of this game, go to:http://godbomb.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/prison-architect-first-impressions.html ",214,54,5,48,30,2,63

												After spending many hours building a prison, I decided to take a test run as a prisoner and see what damage I could do. This was the result:Have you ever been trapped in an insane asylum, surronded by brutal savages waiting to rip your throat out at any given moment? The only thing protecting you is a small green door that could easily be broken down in a matter of seconds?This is the case of Officer BlackLady (BL for short).The prison was running smoothly on a fine sunday afternoon, all was calm. The prisoners had just gotten off of their three hour work period and were going on a break for lunch. BL and the other staff members chit chat in the cafeteria, but BL steps out to use the ladies room. In the cafeteria, all the prisoners line up to get their daily slop. The newest inmate (lets call him Brick), sits down to eat his meal. He goes to reach for the salt, but as he goes to pour, the lid pops off and all the salt pours onto his meal, ruining it. ""Who the ♥♥♥♥ did this...""Brick's salt levels reached an all time high, never before had anyone seem this form of salt. He leaned over to a snickering inmate, and ripped him in half. His blood spilled onto the ground as the other inmates look on in terror. One of the guards attempts to subdue him, only to be pummeled to the ground. This display started the unforgettable riot. The entire cafeteria exploded into a hellish war zone of flying fists and meat chunks. The guards were all blitzed and had all their weapons taken. Some were brutally beaten into an unconcious state, while others had their heads dipped into the boiling pots of water. They prisoners exploded out of the cafeteria in a hellish manner, inciting others to join the riot. Within minutes the entire prison was being overrun by prisoners with tons of illegal contraband either stolen in the raid or hidden from earlier points.On her way back to the cafeteria, BL saw the riot, and quickly took shelter in the infirmary. There, she saw all the patients assaulting the doctors who were working, some being stabbed in the neck with syringes and others being gutted by scalpals and knives. One young doctor (lets call her Cherry), was being cornered by one especially unruly inmate. BL jostled him down, grabbing Cherry and rushing her into the morgue for safety. They locked the doors behind them, turned off the lights, and hid in a corner, hoping nobody would see them.The riot went on for what seemed like hours, hundereds of guards were murdered, multiple prisoners escaped, even the cooks and janitors were gutted and hung out to dry in the yard. BL and Cherry were the only two survivors in the onslaught. After the noise calmed down, BL looked out of the window to see the horrid landscape. Bodies laid in the yard. Prisoners and Guards alike. Other prisoners simply walked over their bodies, carrying weapons and looking for any survivors. BL knew that some of the more insane prisoners would stay behind, waiting for backup to arrive, just to claim more lives and shed more blood. These were the sick and the deranged, the ones locked up in the basement always forgotten about. She gave Cherry her gun, told her to use the emergency phone to call for help if she didn't return, grabbed her baton and stun gun, and exited the morgue, locking the door behind her. She carefully snuck around the prison looking for anyway for her to safely get Cherry out of the prison. As she turned the corner to the cafeteria, she was ambushed from behind. As she fell to the floor, she whipped out her tazer and electrocuted the man on top of her. Pushing him off she made a dash for the exit, hoping to find someway to save Cherry afterwards. As she turned each corner, she could hear the roars increasing behind her of prisoners out for blood. She bolted out the front doors and headed for the hole in the fence to freedom. With each step she heard them closing in. 20 meters. 10. 5. ""Almost there"" - she said to herself. Only three yards from the hole, she was tackled to the ground. She tried to fight off the inmate, but was quickly surronded. It was no use, she was dead. The prisoners began their assault, kicking and punching her. The life was about to leave her body when she heard the gun fire. A prioner dropped dead at her side. The back up SWAT team finally arrived, and swiftly shot down all the prisoners. They grabbed BL and brought her into the back of their van. She told them about Cherry, before finally falling unconcious.When she awoke, she was in the hospital, Cherry sitting at her side. On the TV she saw that the prison had finally been secured once more, but the body count was in the thousands. BL looked over to Cherry and smiled. That was when the knife had entered her gut. She looked down to see the blood, and looked back up at Cherry. That was when she remembred, the hospital had a psych ward attatched to the infirmary. Cherry was no doctor, she was an insane inmate looking for a way out. And now that BL was dead, there would be no loose ends. Cherry walked out of the hospital, bloody knife in hand, and walked off into the sunset.Prison Architect 8.5/10Would ruin my own prison again.			",106,15,2,12,15,1,12

								This is still in early access but worth the purchase. If you enjoy management/simulation type of games you can't go wrong. There is an economy, there are prisoners, and they love to stab each other. The graphics are lame in a SouthPark kind of way. Where it's so silly you like it.

												Short story:I had to buy a new video card to play this game as my old one couldn't handle it. It was the best $230 I've spent on a game in my life. Long story:8:00pm - You think to yourself, ""just one more room. I'll just build a canteen and stop. My prisoners have got to eat somewhere!"" But you don't stop at the canteen. To supply the canteen, you need a kitchen. But to power the kitchen you have to put down power lines. While waiting for it to build, you notice that the floors are dirty, so you hire some janitors. They're struggling to get through the cell doors, so you replace them with staff doors to save time. By now you've run out of money so you open up to your grants. ""There's a grant to build a hospital and hire doctors,"" you see. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get paid for it? Now you're scouting out a good location for your hospital. How many hospital beds to you think you'll need? Two? Four? A hundred? You get your workers started on the foundation for your hospital. Shoot. You need more guards to patrol the new hospital. Hire a few more guards. The staff is complaining that they're overworked and in dire need of a staff room. Got to keep the staff rested so that they work at top speed! You figure out where you're going to put the staff room and get the workers on the foundation. By then, you're able to go back to the hospital and route power to the new area, not to mention adding the beds and other requirements for a hospital room. You've overtaxed the power station with the new area, and get the workers to add some capacitors to increase the power.  All of a sudden, in the real world, your sister tells you that it's 1:00am and that you should probably go to bed. Rinse and repeat for every session I've played of this game since I installed the new video card. This game is very engaging and there is always something to do. Highly recommended!

												I build a prison that holds hundreds of convicts. Prisoners are happy, except for occasional shotgun sounds that slowly decimate my population.One day, Richard arrives - a legendary prisoner. Sentenced for a total of 10 years. I treat Richard like a king in his own prison mansion. He destroys the door with his fists and kills the gardener. Richard is sentenced to two hours of solitary, but decides to break out of his high security solitary cell, kills 5 armed guards and proceeds to mow down prisoners, guards, and armed guards with a shotgun. He is tazed and sentenced to solitary. Repeat multiple times.Richard is locked into a building without exits. His sentence continues to rise as a regular supply of new cooks that are locked in with him is needed.One day - after killing yet another two cooks - he is sadly assassinated by ten armed guards. He dies after only 8.2 out of 2408 years. His legacy lives on as a new legendary prisoner arrives.2408/10, would sacrifice dozens of guards and prisoners again.No prisoners were harmed during the making of this review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the best of the year, I have been playing since alpha 14 and have not got bored yet. The best part is that even though the game is finished, they continue to update it with new content and bug fixes. I hope they made another game similar to this.			",13,1,0,3,6,0,6

								Think you have what it takes to keep prisoners under control? I surely don't cause those prisoners are big, scary and tough and I'm just the man with the mouse.Building a prison is quiet an achievement I do say so myself. So far i've failed at making 2 prisons in my first 2 games but I learned a lesson on how critical security is around criminals. I was being nice to them but this nice guy is dead now.From here on out, NO MORE MR.NICEGUY!Security guards knocked out, all prisoners escaped. 11/10 Will Play Again!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game, i bought nearly soon as it came out. I have only 69 hours hehe, but the game is truly amazing.\Why? Making a prison sounds boring but seeing the prisioners rush in and watch them continue their prison lives feels amazing! After you have the best prison in the game, your bored. So what do you do? Mods! Endless mods! A sea of mods! Well maybe not that much but there is enough to add an extra few hundred hours onto your total playtime! Want to be a prisoner? Well you can! You can download prisons off of the workshop and play a new mode that allows you to collect weapons, make an army of criminals, and break out! You should definetly buy this.			",96,12,0,20,22,0,10

												In the early access, the game delivers a punch of fun. The simulation raises challenges for the player to balance the game well and manage everything that is going pretty much parallel.However, there is still much potential for Prison Architect to develop. Things such as customization: different walls textures, greater detailed tech tree (tech tree is pretty shallow), storyline: Cell 211 scenario? etc.Simply amazing. 10/10 would play again and again and again. The sound track, the gameplay and dynamics surprises me every time.			",29,4,4,2,8,0,5

												Prison Architect is the game that proves that you don't need flashy 3D graphics to have a great game.   The 2D visuals are still attractive nonetheless.  The only graphic deawback is the people but if you can look past that, you're in for a treat.        Let's start by saying that good prison games are hard to find.  and this one is the best prison simulator we will have for the next 10 years and here's why...    The detail of building your prison is immense.  You can design and build everything from a dormitory detention center to a full blown supermax prison complete with death row (yes, there is an electric chair).   You can even build female prisons!  Some women come complete with babies and need places to care for them.       After you get the prison constructed enough to begin housing prisoners, you then dive into running the place.  This is where the real fun begins.You'll manage food distribution, finances, the daily schedule, reform programs, drug addicted losers, staff, guards, what offences get what penalties,  the list goes on and on.That's not all, there is a full weather system so you'll need to supply heat to your prison or your inmates will complain about being cold.    Find and confiscate contraband from cigarettes and booze to weapons and escape tools.  These people will smuggle in all sorts of stuff from the visitation room from mom and dad to their buddy throwing drugs over the yard wall!     Got a prisoner doing time in solitary for getting caught with a knife?   see if he is willing to be a confidential informant in exchange for his release from solitary (not the prison).   Now he will sing like a bird and tell you who is carry what contraband (that he knows of).   He'll tell you if he knows of an upcoming trade or drug deal.  He'll fill you in on when a drop over the wall was arranged or if Joe Smith has a tunnel started under his toilet!     Best of all are gangs!  The confidential informant will also tell you who are gang members and gand leaders (that they know of).   They'll tell you who is strong, volitile, fearless, etc.   Gangs will take over territory in your prison.  The red gang might have control over the yard and the blue gang grabbed the common room.  The gangs will extort money from regular prisoners to use the room's facilities.  (Charge an inmate to use the weights in the yard for example.)  You must stop these gangs from taking over your prison!   Deploy guards, armed guards, K-9 dog handlers to take back territory.  The K-9 can sniff out drugs as well as find tunnels.      This is so much more than a building game.  The designing and building is very fun but the real fun begins when you get a lot of prisoners and especially if you have gangs enabled and they begin taking over parts of your precious creation!Once you get your prison escape proof,  load it up in ""Escape Mode"" and be a prisoner yourself!   That's right,  you can be a prisoner in your own prison!   Now you can test just how easy (or hard) your prison is to get out of.   Recruit a team of buddies, get in fights,  smuggle a weapon from the workshop,  dig under your cell to find freedom!      There are loads of mods in the Steam Workshop that make this game even better.  There are graphic mods that remove the ""cartoon"" look of the game and add more ""HD"" looks to it.  There are mods that completely add new reform programs, objects, building materials, people and staff,  etc, etc..  The game is very British,  which is ok.  But there are mods for other languages as well as American terminology.    The developers are finished adding new content and will be tying everything up in a few months with a completed, bug-free version, or so they say.   So the game is near completion.The best prison simulator on the market,  hands down.   If you own any (or all) of the Prison Tycoon games,  they have been executed and will rest in peace.   Throw them all away and buy Prison Architect right now.   You will not be disappointed!			",9,0,0,1,8,0,1

Early Access Review
								TL;DR at the bottom.Note: This is an early access review.It needs to be said that I am an Introversion fanboy.I have been following them ever since they first made Uplink, and the diversity of their games just keeps on amazing me(and I'm not using the A world lightly).Now with that out of the way, let's get down to it.There are a few comparisons to other games that I could pull to give a better understanding of what this game is like, but I assume most other reviews have already done this, so I'll skip this for now.Prison Architect is quirky prison design and management game.You start off with an empty lot of land, and a few workers.You design the prison, they build it.The more cells you have, the more prisoners your prison can hold.The more prisoners your prison can hold, the more money you get.This was a very simplified explanation, but in essence that is how it works.You also have to manage the needs of your prisoners, much like in the sims.As long as they have facilities to take care of their needs, they will do so themselves when they can.If these needs are not being taken care of, you might just have a riot on your hands.The MAIN objective of the game, to me at least, is to get a nice and tidy prison with minimal fights, where all the major tasks are somewhat automated and streamlined - leaving me to take care of the expansion of the next wing.Some people like to build care-bear prisons with cake and parties(exaggeration for effect) while others build Guantanamo Bay kinds of prisons with daily probing for hidden items and similar activities.How you play is your own decision, but all in all, we still are building prisons.In this early version of the game, there is enough content to have you forget about the ""outside world"" for a few hours, until you start feeling hungry(unless you planned ahead and brought foor to the PC).There are a lot of hidden mechanics that you will learn by playing the game, and with this knowledge you can improve your next prison and try to avoid the pitfalls you have had to climb out of in your previous attempts.If you for whichever reason were to run out of stuff to do, there's always the Steam Workshop, where more content is just a click away.So for the verdict:Should you buy this game? You've read this far(or skipped ahead, you little cheat, you) - So you must have some interest in it.If you are at all interested in management type games, then this is a game you do not want to miss.Yes. That's with a capital ""Y"", and even it it was in the end of a sentence instead of the start I'd still say it's a Yes.TL;DR - Great management game. Buy this game.			",398,126,24,47,53,3,67

												Short story:I had to buy a new video card to play this game as my old one couldn't handle it. It was the best $230 I've spent on a game in my life. Long story:8:00pm - You think to yourself, ""just one more room. I'll just build a canteen and stop. My prisoners have got to eat somewhere!"" But you don't stop at the canteen. To supply the canteen, you need a kitchen. But to power the kitchen you have to put down power lines. While waiting for it to build, you notice that the floors are dirty, so you hire some janitors. They're struggling to get through the cell doors, so you replace them with staff doors to save time. By now you've run out of money so you open up to your grants. ""There's a grant to build a hospital and hire doctors,"" you see. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get paid for it? Now you're scouting out a good location for your hospital. How many hospital beds to you think you'll need? Two? Four? A hundred? You get your workers started on the foundation for your hospital. Shoot. You need more guards to patrol the new hospital. Hire a few more guards. The staff is complaining that they're overworked and in dire need of a staff room. Got to keep the staff rested so that they work at top speed! You figure out where you're going to put the staff room and get the workers on the foundation. By then, you're able to go back to the hospital and route power to the new area, not to mention adding the beds and other requirements for a hospital room. You've overtaxed the power station with the new area, and get the workers to add some capacitors to increase the power.  All of a sudden, in the real world, your sister tells you that it's 1:00am and that you should probably go to bed. Rinse and repeat for every session I've played of this game since I installed the new video card. This game is very engaging and there is always something to do. Highly recommended!

Early Access Review
								Despite the fact that this game is in alpha I think it is one of the most addictive and fun games around. I really didn't think I was going to like it but I like everything about it. the graphics are perfect for the game, the simple animation, the look of the figures and the items you place on screen look right, triple Yes some games have better graphics but better graphics just wouldn't be right here. There are constant updates and the game feels pretty good despite the fact its in alpha. I have not had any major crash issues, there are some little annoyances but I simply remind myself that this is an alpha so there should be so much more wrong with it. The basic idea of the game is to create a functioning prison that makes money, sell that, make a larger prison that makes more money, rinse and repeat. I have spent hours trying to create the right environment for my prisoners and the staff to make them love being in prison. When I say hours I have played to date over 50 hours and I still make a slightly better prison each time I play. I think this will be a game I come back to time and again and I will review the final version on my site but for now I just wanted to post a little review of sorts here so that I can help you make the decision to BUY THIS GAME, it is absolutely excellent.

								Throughout the course of playing this game right from it's early alpha in October it has been a blast, forcing 20 prisoners to shower in a 4x4 room and finding men in jail cells who had a facial expression I could only describe as 'bench' was the highlight of my day for at least a month solid: but I had to progress. The world of maximum security prisons is a dark place. Guards recieved a shiv at least 3 times per day and I was would have been frankly unsurprised to have seen a large amount of comlaints of destroyed sphincters rolling through my psychologist; by the end of this period, my sphincter actually felt empathy for those smaller prisoners only in for larceny who had come up against homocidal 3 metre tall 400 pound Tyrone the  wife beater in my 4x4 showers. Morale of the story is, this game is a blast, but just stick to the orange prisoners...			",96,11,2,14,34,2,29

												I can't believe I've not reviewed this game. It's amazing. Graphically simple, but it doesn't bother you. It's a really nice game to play.The pesky criminals are always trying their luck... I'm a nice warden as well, I give them nice cells and lots to do and how do they thank me? By murdering my guards and beating my doctors to death.It's really cozy!The developers are great. They've been involved and active from inception to delivery. I bought this as soon as it came out, more to do with loving Uplink that actually wanting it. But when I started playing I was hooked. It's a time stealing game that you will definitely love. Plus, when you get tired, you can mod the hell out of it.			",120,36,1,23,49,1,30

								I love this game! It's a really enjoyable and surprisingly realistic simulation game that forces you to constantly make tough decisions on how to run your prison to maximize profit, security and comfort for the prisoners. I recommend this game if you're a die hard lover of simulation games as it's not really like any other one out there and it's a great, original genre to play through. Unfortunately, since the game is still only in Alpha, it has a LOT of bugs, but they don't really affect the gameplay that much and the game itself runs very well on low end computers aswell as high end gaming computers (take my laptop for example). Obviously these bugs will be fixed as soon as the game hits it's release and with constant updates adding new content and areas of the story, you really can't get bored of this game... So, if you're looking for a fun, sim ple but really enjoyable simulation game to pass the time, Prison Architect is the game for you!			",36,9,0,4,6,0,6

												One of the best building/managing games I've had the pleasure of playing, 10/10Pros:- Too many to mention.Cons:- Escape mode need some work done to it, still a really good idea though.- I would like something that adds some more depth to the game for people who have been playing for a while.PS: Keep the updates coming.

								Despite the fact that this game is in alpha I think it is one of the most addictive and fun games around. I really didn't think I was going to like it but I like everything about it. the graphics are perfect for the game, the simple animation, the look of the figures and the items you place on screen look right, triple Yes some games have better graphics but better graphics just wouldn't be right here. There are constant updates and the game feels pretty good despite the fact its in alpha. I have not had any major crash issues, there are some little annoyances but I simply remind myself that this is an alpha so there should be so much more wrong with it. The basic idea of the game is to create a functioning prison that makes money, sell that, make a larger prison that makes more money, rinse and repeat. I have spent hours trying to create the right environment for my prisoners and the staff to make them love being in prison. When I say hours I have played to date over 50 hours and I still make a slightly better prison each time I play. I think this will be a game I come back to time and again and I will review the final version on my site but for now I just wanted to post a little review of sorts here so that I can help you make the decision to BUY THIS GAME, it is absolutely excellent.

												A very fun and interactive game! If you like city/empire building games, there's a very good chance that you'll like Prison Architect. Aside from just building the actual prison there's many more features included in the game that make it fun. The game has a campaign you can play and multiple options for map creation when you want to start a new prison. Overall, definitley a great game, and absolutley worth it when on sale!

												Update after 160 hours! Prison Architect is ""sandbox"" builder par excellance.I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :PBut what's Prison Architect?You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison. Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox. Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed. Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants. Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death.Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord.Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :PPrisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem.building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies.Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;) Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry. There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc. Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day. While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer.Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful.ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prisonCampaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer.Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else.There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.

Review 13. 04. 2014 v.Alpha20Prison Architect is just a fantastic game. At the beginning taking out grants and building a basic detention centre can be very easy, but you have to make sure that you think of all the factors that could affect your prisoners. One wrong move and you may go in the red.You have to gradually expand your prison, instead of allowing tons of prisoners at once. For example, if you have maximum security prisoners, you cannot accept them all at once in the beginning, because of how the prisoners will react to the little you have in the prison at the beginning, and you have to make sure that you accept prisoners at the right time, or they will just riot.The variety of the rooms and programs the game has is just phenomenal in this alpha stage, all the extra activities and programs the prisoners can do and you can expand on really makes the game never get boring.I highly recommend this game, especially in this stage of development where you can see all the new rooms and interactions being added into the game, because I think that many more things are to be added into the game.Full releaseScore76/100 (date 13. 04. 2014 v.Alpha20)90/100 (date 16. 04. 2017 Full release)			",124,15,6,9,34,1,25

Early Access Review
								I wouldn't have guessed this game was early access if Steam didn't tell me. I'm very impressed by this game, and have sunk way more hours into it than I would have expected. I'm a huge fan of games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, and Sims, and anything else that involves management type ideas.This game is really neat (lol good descriptor, yes?) You control the layout of the prison, completely from scratch. You can make a dank dark prison, or a lofty posh apartment complex for inmates. The inmates are unique and many have quirky names and stories that introduce you to the personality put into this game by the developers. You control the daily schedule for the prisoners, programs and classes, police force and type, patrols, their dining experience, their in-prison jobs (laundry, license plates, cleaning etc.). There is so much I could continue to say - for a game that is about building a prison, it's so inolved and quite frankly just so much fun. My only regret is not buying some of the additional content while it was on sale!My fiance laughs when he can hear a riot break out ""oh, is Featherstone stabbing people again?"" Yes. Yes he is.

I got this when it first came out and keep coming back usually when i cannot get online i load this on up.If you enjoy management sims and watching your game grow and grow as you add and take care of needs this is for you. Reminds me of the days when games were made to be fun not just flashy pretty things that you will be bored of in two hours then they will sell you Expansion pack after expansion pack.

With a workshop full of mods to reskin, add materials, weapons and ways to shape your game into sandbox or a campaign, I say well worth buying the full version and a good game to have in your library.

								For a game officially still in Alpha, it definitely is great and better than some games that claim to be finished. You will notice some bugs and weird behaviour after a few dozen hours played, but usually nothing mayor.The only thing that really needs fixing is the performance in the end game. When constructing large buildings, the game slows down and only runs in slow motion. I had this even though my CPU was only occupied about 30%.I like how each monthly update brings interesting new things that make it worth to start the game again and sometimes even require complete new strategies.The graphic style is also very suitable for a game like this. Anything less comic-like would probably be too realistic. They figures still show off emotions, jump around nervously or walk slow when suppressed.For the price definitely recommended.

								I had to completely blow-up my original review.  This is one of the most-balanced games I have ever played.  It is fairly easy to learn but the challenge seems to grow slightly faster than I can keep up.  I always feel like I am building structures just to keep up with demand.There is a bug or two that the developer is good about fixing but for the most part the game is flawless.  The only glaring omissions from the game are guard towers and a plant operations building (i.e. cooling towers etc.).It's a very solid game in the builder genre.  Although I recommend getting it on sale for around $20 I wouldn't hestiate to buy it at $30 either.			",8,1,0,6,14,0,15

Then I found out about something else and started building another new prison. It keeps going on and on and on and now I'm currently building my 9th or 10th prison. I'm quite satisfied with the current unfinished prison but I might start over again.Good game, hope there will be 10x more objects & materials added, at least.As its current state, this game really has potential.7.5/10			",200,67,21,52,30,3,56

												Prison Architect is a breath of fresh air in today's video game industry which is oversaturated with annual releases and rehashed concepts. Prison Architect puts many current AAA development titles to shame by having lots of replayability. The campaign alone has a lot of meat on it, I've spent 9 or 10 hours on it before going into free mode to build my own prisons (you can do this at anytime and don't need to finish the campaign to do so). While Prison Architect is obviously a game where you can construct prisons, it is also a game where you can play as a prisoner and try to break out of prisons (either your own or one of the many available from the Steam Workshop), this was a welcome surprise to me after being disappointed by The Escapists. The architect mode is a delight as well, you have a whole slew of options when it comes to prison building and management. You want your prisoners locked up 24/7? Go for it. You want to have reform programs such as woodworking, laundry washing, and/or kitchen duty? You can. Want to build a death row and pull the switch on your prisoners? You can do that too, you sadist :P If you like managing, building, or destroying things then this is likely the game for you. While Prison Architect isn't quite my game of the year so far, it comes close and the developers have more plans for the game on the way. Prison Architect is a solid 10/10 in my eyes and is well worth the price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prison Architect: A game where you can choose to make your prison luxorius, with tiled or wooden floors with spacious walls and high quality meals prepared by elite chefs. Or make your prison a literal concentration camp in which fighting results in 7 armed guards punishing you with shotgun shells to the neck. 10/10			",49,5,0,4,10,0,4

								Just a normal day getting another 12 prisoners. Let them all in and a Bobby Bobsen (disclaimer hiding real name for privacy reasons) pulls out some hedge shears and kills all the guards and runs awayfree. That is the story behind why I now use metal detectors. Now this game is amazing and I hope it continues on to when it is realeased unlike some games cough cough citys (another disclaimer not using real name might get this review removed) I recomend you support the alpha and continue to be appart of the ever growing community.

I got this when it first came out and keep coming back usually when i cannot get online i load this on up.If you enjoy management sims and watching your game grow and grow as you add and take care of needs this is for you.

Overall its a great game the Devs are Involved with the Community and new Features are added regulary. Great Campaign It will keep you busy while teaching you the basics then there is the real game Free mode were you build a prison. Any kind you want from a Gulag Style Prison to a Open style prison set on reform if you can imagine it you can built it (May varry from time to time) Moving on to Pro's and Con'sPros.Fun.New Features.Great Dev Team.Supports Modding and has Steam Workshop supportCons.Bugs Lots of Bugs (To be expected the Game just came out of Early Alpha)Thats it for this Review if you liked it Rate it up and Leave some feedback of what you think thanks for reading to al the way down here			",29,2,0,0,13,0,9

												I've watched this game grow for quite some time.  The developers released monthly updates along with videos of them discussing the changes and future plans of those updates.  I had no doubts in them finishing the game when I paid early access.  I wished more developers were like these guys, people would have more faith/patience in early access games if that was the case. I like just about every aspect of the game.  Everything they added I felt was necessary.  PA is a great game, and I still recommend it.  I feel something was missing from the game though. I still can't place what the problem is.  The fact that its just building prisons maybe? Want more depth? not sure... But I really think its the campaign or lack of challenges it has to offer.  I feel like they could've added more or done a lot more, with unique scenarios. Sort of like how roller coaster tycoon did.  Anyways, I've put a lot of hours in, I still come back to play every now and then.  The game is wonderful. The developers are wonderful.  And I hope they keep up with the updates even though this pretty much a finished product. ",31,12,0,2,13,0,4

								Build and run a prison.  Pretty hard to do actually.  Build a larger and larger prison to keep more and more prisoners.  Hire staff, make sure everything is secure, and keep the prisoners content.  Why?  Well if you don't, they riot and people can get hurt or killed.  There are however certain things you must do that will make them unhappy.  For example, you can check everyone for hidden weapons and other things they aren't supposed to have, and you can search their cells.  They don't like it, but you need to do it.  As you play more, you can research things.  New kinds of staff to handle new problems, upgraded security, and so on.  The game is actually fairly complex, there's a lot to it.  I didn't play the full tutorial, I suggest you do.  Also, it's fun to play with unlimited money.  It means you can test all kinds of things, and learn without having to worry about screwing yourself over.Pretty fun game overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know that a game is good when you can get stuck on playing it for almost a full weekend (including friday).I definitly enjoyed this one for the sandbox mode, less for the campaign mode which is more of an extended tutorial honestly. The sandbox mode is like: you start off from zero, good luck with your prison. Without the implementation of grants you wouldn't really have an objective and it also sets you up with money. What I also like is the varation of choices you get like the type of warden you want, the building material, the flooring, the set up of your jails and also which gender that your prisoners have. The last one for me is a little unnecessary because I probably always will pick male prisoners in my prisoners so I don't have to build family prisoners (for females with a baby), besides I kinda find it weird why you would take your newborn child with you to prison. Also sometimes things are a bit buggy so if you come across a bug don't think you are the only one experiencing it. If you like sandboxes or games like city skylines, sims where you have to build stuff and organise it all you should pick this one up. If the idea of running a big prison sounds fun to you you should also get it.EDIT: Did I forget to mention that this game has an amazing amount of humor when you look at some biographics? : http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehteddystyle/screenshot/106228751899944771 ",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												We are finally at the end, what a journey it's been. In the time since first buying it in early access to now I have built large, small and damn right disgusting prisons. The vast amount of content in this game is outstanding and all the way through it's development the team pumped out quality updates in a timey manner, a true example of how to do Early Access.Probably one of the best sandbox games out on the market right now, beautiful art work, vast amount of things to unlock and upgrade (or downgrade!) your prison with.You are only limited by your imagination, only just in these past few days have I got a solid prison up and running without bankrupting myself or having everyone escape because I tried to rush to get money. There is no hand holding through the game, you are given a plot of land and a few nudges in the right direction to get your prison started, you learn by trial and error but like the devs themselves said even when you fail it's quite hilarious and you're not left feeling angry for ""losing"" (You can't really lose, you can turn failure conditions off but more fun with them on ""If X ammount escape then you're shutdown"" kinda conditions) Not only is the game quite realistic on most things regarding prisons they also tackles difficult subjects, and weren't afraid to add them in, like death row, execution process, female prisons including babies etc and have done it very well.Hats off to the devs, loved your videos, love your game.9/10- Old review - Quality game the gets better month in month out, the humour is excellent thanks to the dev team being able to laugh at their own mistakes. Completely playable for hours on end even though it's still in Alpha, soon to be beta. Looking forward to more new features!			",94,4,1,11,20,3,19

												Fantastic Game. 8/10 with the current game content/mechanics.If you're looking for something new to jump into give this some serious consideration.Pros ++Easy to get started and play+Basic skill tree to unlock upgrades+Make a big or small prison, its fun to manage both+Multiple ways of making profit, but requires planning and management+Fun door access systems with logic and timing+Relatively easy to play but not as easy to perfect which adds more depth and creative goals.+Mods+A decent enough amount of content. It takes a while to set up and expand everything.Cons --Not huge on some ingame mechanics being explained in diary notes you find which are hard to read (they're in messy handwriting) but perhaps this info is listed clearly elsewhere ingame.-Game still has a few odd bugs but they are minor. -When placing a foundation near a current building its unpredictable / unintuitive as to whether the new foundation (wall) will break the adjacent wall and connect the rooms, or maintain the wall and keep them separate.-As of current some objects/sprites are limited in their function and orientation / appearance.-Ingame tooltips could provide a little more information.

Well, you can try...I was looking forward to Prison Architect for a while and bought it while in Alpha. Its come a long way from then and has had some great improvements. The gameplay is great if you're looking for a builder or simulator. You can be strict or lax. Have open designs with the courtyard in the centre or closed where all facilities are in the middle surrounded by fences. Combos are endless. Enjoy!			",135,20,3,14,21,1,30

								Day one - Looked into Prison Archithect, about 4pm in the afternoon, saw the images, thought it looked a bit poxy so figured i'd read the reviews.. Reviews were all delightfully outstanding. Figured 9,000 odd reviews can't be a company ploy to get you to purchase the game, so figured I would give it a shot.. Commenced downloading..Day one, download complete, 6.00pm - Started out on the game, completed the tutorial, found the interface, and abilities somewhat endless. Once I sussed out the way foundations worked (easy if you follow the tute) I was building en'mass in the creative mode where money is endless! Dealing with prisoners, throwing the lockdown alarm and searching cells, creating new buildings and solitary confinement, setting the meal plans and daily schedule, deploying response teams and patrols, what an amazing game! - Holy Crap, what's this in the extras, MODS!? Holy crap look at the fancy stuff I can have at the (free) click of a button via the mods page, how amazing! Let's build more!Day two, 11 hours later, 5.00am, meant to be at work in an hour, where the hell did all night go!? - Holy crap this game is sweet! I'm late for work! What the living hell happend to my night? I better get these guys into their cells then go to bloody work before I get fired!!!Weeks later, play this game for hours a day, it's fantastic! Don't judge by the images, you will be sadly missing out! GET IT!			",12,2,1,0,11,0,3

SHOW THOSE UNRULY, UNKIND, MEAN, GRITTY, STANKY, TURD MAGGOTS HOW LITTLE THEY TRULY ARE WITH PRISON ARCHITECT, THE GAME WHERE YOU DESIGN AND RUN YOUR OWN BRAND-SPANKING-NEW- STATE OF THE ART ""CORRECTIONAL"" FACILITYTHE GOOD Build your own prison however you like! Whether you like sending those inmates to 48 hours of solitary confinement for merely looking your direction or whether you believe in unicorns and adorn your prison cells with fluffy bunnies, prison architect allows the player to determine how harsh or soft they want to make it! Witness crazy riots and fights and control them with your guards! Frequent UPDATES! MUCH MORE, BUT IMA KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET, JUST LIKE THE SOUND OF MY PRISONER-WORKERS CRANKING OUT ENDLESS SUPPLIES OF LICENSE PLATESThe Bad I've had some problems with some bugs. They are getting fixed with each update. nothing too major that is gamebreaking, keep in mind. Kinda hard to make really good, efficient prisons that don't riot (but what's the fun in that?) Very addicting (is that a con?) My biggest problem is a part of the game mechanics, let me explain: Time passing= 1 second real time= 1 minute game time. This wouldn't be too big of a problem, but with really spaced out or large prisons, your prisoners begin having major time restraints eating and doing other tasks in the allotted time, and doing anything that involves walking too far. This however, can be avoided by intelligently laying out your prison. (unlike the dilapidated ones I sometimes make)OVERALL, THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME. 10/10 WOULD WORK WITH LADY JUSTICE AGAIN, and ""If you do the crime, ya gotta do the time."" ",57,0,0,2,11,0,3

This game has got you too (It won't end well...). European open prision? You can do that too! Do you want to build an inescapable prision? Well, you can try...I was looking forward to Prison Architect for a while and bought it while in Alpha. Its come a long way from then and has had some great improvements. The gameplay is great if you're looking for a builder or simulator. You can be strict or lax. Have open designs with the courtyard in the centre or closed where all facilities are in the middle surrounded by fences. Combos are endless. Enjoy!			",135,20,3,14,21,1,30

												Ever wanted to build your own prison? Well, Prison Architect takes that idealogy to new heights, featuring realistic requirements for prisons and prisoners. This game could only be better if it was 3D. Oh wait, theyre working on that too! Its easy for anyone to hop right into the game and set up your own prison, however, it takes practice to make a prison that lasts a long time. It seems just as you think you've done everything in the game, more things just get added in. Hot water, 3D mode, deathrow, executions, supermax, weather, map settings, land expansions, prisoner jobs, escape mode and much, MUCH more! I cannot stress enough how much I love this game, and thats not going to change anytime soon. The cost is $30 USD, but its SOOOO worth it. Stop reading this review, and buy this game right now.

												Prison Architect, a game made by an indie company (I think), where you build... A prison. And run it. Oddly, not as the Warden, because he's someone you can hire.You start off with about 30k, take a few grants, you have about 100k. You build up some cells, a yard, and a canteen, you bring in your first 8 prisoners or so, and you continue upgrading. It's as simple as that. Eventually, you sell your prison, and make an even larger one. Then, you make that one into a well-oiled machine, you start up another prison. Occassionally you go back into the old one to update it to the newer updates, and you continue on.As you can see, I've played it a fair bit. Would recommend. Also, I had the water-pump area catch on fire once. 10/10			",74,8,1,5,23,0,4

1-sentence review :Great building game, both for casual and hardcore players, although plagued by a few annoying bugs & issues and an atrophied management part.Pros :- The tutorial is a short story mode, nothing extravagant like the game description would make you think it is, but it's still a very nice way to dive into the game theme- Despite being quite common in series & movies, prison is a rare theme in management games so it's nice to finally see a game using it- Very complete prison building- Interface is mostly easy enough to usePros or Cons, depending of your taste :- Management part can be almost totally ignoredCons :- Visuals can be a bit hard on eyes are 1st, as the artistic direction lacks a bit of unity- Past 60 prisoners, game can get quite repetitive as you'd be doing more and more the same things to expend your prison- Copy/paste size is pretty limited which means you won't be able to copy your big prison wing in 1 time- Some bad bugs ; main one being the Grant state isn't correctly reloaded, which leads to getting too much money to reactivate the current grants, which is game breaking if you want to be challenged- There's basically no difficulty if you understood the tutorial- Might be a bit overpriced : $30 instead of $25, I'd say			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been following the development of Prison Architect since Alpha 15. When it was officially launched today, I gave the new features a try, and have to admit I have very mixed feelings. First, the base sandbox game is TONS of fun! It's a prison management system, where you are free to treat prisoners with downright cruelty or as if they are on holiday. You can focus on strict profit, or on reformation. The basics are fairly simple, yet there is plenty to learn.The sandbox alone I'd recommend to anyone. With the new release, there were two main additions: The campaign and the Escape mode. TThe campaign I DO NOT recommend. For me, it completely threw off the pixelated, cartoony vibe of the early access. It was dark, crude, and downright vulgar. Maybe that's reminescent of the darker side of certain prisons, but it completely threw off the overall feeling of the Prison Architect I knew and loved! It took the game from what I'd consider the upper end of ""E: Everyone"" to the upper end of ""M: Mature"". It is not for children. It's probably not for adults. It's definitely not for me.(Side note: I created a Mod called ""Family Friendly Mod"", which tuned down the adult content of the campaign. It's now at about a ""T:Teen"" level, or about what you find on ""Prison Break"".) However, the Escape Mode is AWESOME!!! You can play it on any saved prison, which allows you to customize your difficulty. It needs a little rebalancing, but playing an an OP legendary prisoner, racking up your murder trials, setting fire to a prison... It's like a whole new game within the game.

								I love any game that lets you create and run your own world, whatever that world may be. Prison Architect seemed silly, interesting and, at first glance, seemed to possess enough versatility over how much of a challenge you can create for yourself that I thought it was worth a try.I can't say I'm disappointed- but I was frustrated when I first started to play. This is because there are a bunch of small things that don't work quite right- for instance, sometimes you are unable to type in a name for the prison you're saving. Sometimes, your workers glitch and won't do a job, even though you have 20 and they aren't doing anything else. Sometimes, if someone dies, their body won't load onto the ambulance or hearse/ corpse wagon, whatever it is, so you literally have one guard who keeps trying constantly to get rid of the body, and does nothing else.Really. Nothing else.Now, having said what I've said, I'll add that yes, this game is in alpha, so it isn't done. Also, yes, bugs exist with any game- this, I fully understand, but there are a few other issues which make gameplay a bit clunky; first, a giant checklist taking over part of the left side of your screen, which can't be minimized. Also, this game seriously lacks guidance- you fly blind for the most part, and that's a bit offputting when you are trying to do something like, say, make a water pump system work, or figure out guard rotations. There's a shortage of tips, and since you hit the ground running when you first start to play, there isn't a great deal of time for learning curves. In addition to that, there's no clear way to understand what goes on with specific aspects of your prison, such as programs and classes- why, I asked myself at least 10 times, am I setting up a class with 7 interested and qualified inmates and the class remains empty, even though they have the time in their schedule for work??I could go on, but this is supposed to be a review, not a rant, and to be honest, all frustrations aside, this game is at least a little addicting. Though the glitches and inconveniences can be offputting, the fact is that the game itself is fun, has great potential, and, as I said before, provides a challenge. It's worth a look, and, yea, sure- it's worth the money, as long as the developers keep moving forward and improving.			",46,6,0,5,11,0,7

								Now you, too can be the mastermind of your own prison complex.Highly recommended simulation game, akin to the old Theme games like Theme Hospital and the like. Even in this early stage of development, Prison Architect offers a fleshed out experience that you'll keep coming back to. The idea of the game is simple: Build a prison that functions well, sell it for profit, and build another prison two times the size with the money earned from the previous prison. Seems simple, right?Wrong. Managing your staff, prisoners, and layout all comes together in a formiddable micromanagement deal. You have the ability to pause time which heals a great deal with managing the nuances of your creation, so all-in-all it comes down to how -you- want to play the game.At the current time of writing, there's a few frustrating bugs that might push some away. You're paying for early access at the time of writing, so frustrating issues are bound to come up. Know that the game's in -alpha-, and you can help the developer by posting these issues on their official forums.The game is -very- playable at the moment, and highly recommended. Give it a try!

												Hello everyone!I have played this game since alpha 21 and i gotta say its changed a lot! First of i saw a lot of bugs back there which kinda stopped me from playing this game but hearing about that prison will be out of alpha in fall, made me come back! Its really awesome game with a lot of things in!Here is a few things i have noticed! + Prisoners throw away items that they may have smuggled in into your land somewhere! You probably never see those items again.+ If its time to sleep and someone goes somewhere they are usually up to something bad and you may risk by seeing what they do+Dogs and armed guards can make canteens really quiet.+People can dig tunnels but you can discover them by doing regular jail investigations while they eat, shower or are somewhere away.+Mods can make you a prisoner or manage your own women jail- My cameras wont work (maybe im an exception)-Doors wont open automatically- My fence was like an harry potter portal in Kings Cross station (step inside the portal and you are escaped- Prisoner duplicated into two+Prisoners can form gangs and you can even have a land wars with them+Prisoners have a black marketAnd lots of other thingsI can say that this game really was enjoyable for me! Since i love strategic games and some 2D games i really loved it! Bugs were the only thing bothering me but maybe they are already fixed? ",69,5,6,9,4,0,7

								Build your own maximum security prison, start a riot by beeing unlovely or let your prisoners do whatever they want. It's your choice!While it's still an Alpha this game runs perfectly smooth since the November'13 update. I would have never thought that designing a prison would be fun at at all. But it is! It took me over 30 hours of playtime to build a prison which is loved by it's containing 240 prisoners. They don't even start riots anymore! Continous cashflow makes me and the financé happy. So why not buy nearby lands to extend the prison? No problem, just do it!10/10!			",77,30,2,4,12,2,15

												I want this to be a very honest review. The game is a ton of fun. I really enjoyed the time I spent with it.  However, there are some bugs and/or glitches where things just dont work they way they should. There are a ton of little things that bothered me enough to stop playing. I felt at times like I was fighting against the mechanics of the game and not the objectives and challenges of the game. From what I have heard, the developers are simply done with this project, they are moving on to other things and will not be updating this game any further. This saddens me because it could be something truely special if they spent a bit more time polishing the experience. Would I recommend this game? Yes. Would I recommend this game for $30? no.

								I can recommend this game simply becase its the only game out there that handles this topic with any sort of success.However, much like SimCity and other management games it can't get around one gameplay issue: the most interesting things that will happen in the game are the most detrimental to your success as a manager.  The successful prison in Pison Architect is one with no incidents, no weapons found, no extra punishment, etc.  You even get extra funding the longer you go without incidents.  The problem is that this is not entertaining or fun to have the prison with no issues because the vast majority of your fun tools as the manager are for reacting to serious incidents.  Bottom line: you're working to make yourself obsolete and you are constantly having less and less to do.  Not fun			",227,74,2,34,29,3,44

												Really annoying game. You do the tute and then the game itself is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. Says you have to enclose cells that are already enclosed. You have to dismantle walls and reinstall doors because the stupid AI doesnt work. (There are posts all over the Internet about this issue). Then doors lock by themselves and you get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about canteens not accessible from cells, even though there's a clear path and none of the doors are locked. Just endless irritation and frustration. Its like playing an early access game but crappier. Total waste of time and money.			",68,14,0,31,5,0,12

												This game is a good time killer but I think there are too many bugs. For example, when I lay down a foundation to build another cell block, kitchen, etc, I get told that it is too dangerous. Too dangerous? My danger level is low, there is nothing going on to make it dangerous. On top of that my staff keeps getting caught up among each other that they cannot move so they sit there in a throng trying to get out of whatever invisible force field that is keeping them there. Play it at your own risk but be prepared to get annoyed. The makers said that they are not fixing any more bugs, so there you go.			",3,0,0,0,6,0,6

I thought I was gona run a small prison for my first one and let it run for a bit, but there are a TON of possibilities for thing you can do, and the developers can add infinitly more at their discretion.

								Highly addictive and entertaining game, well worth it especially on sale. There are still quite a few bugs but you are able to work around them. My only real complaint with the game is that it starts off with a toturial level which gets you to build an execution room, however thats the only toturial you get and you are left to figure it out on your own after that. I had to restart my prison over many times because it is quite hard at first to understand how to build your prison and get it running most efficiently. It would be really helpful if they could add more toturial levels to help new begginers.			",176,81,1,10,17,1,13

								Fun to play but very difficult, Prison Architect is something special among real-time strategy games. The gameplay is difficult, in the best way. You have to really pay attention in order to successfully manage your resources, keeping your prisoners imprisoned and expanding the prison so you can hold more prisoners. It's a tough balancing act, trying to expand your prison while maintaining discipline, health and hygiene. Yes, hygiene. The developers didn't forget anything, and you need to make sure you have enough showers to keep the prisoners clean and enough drains to get the water out without flooding the place. You also need to hire a chef to keep them fed, and a doctor to heal them up after those unfortunate but inevitable fights with guards or other prisoners. Every room needs to be a certain size in order to hold the required commodities, for example an office needs to have a desk, chair, and filing cabinet, while a prisoner's cell needs a bed and toilet. The controls are pretty good, though I had a bit of trouble panning the screen because it moves too fast sometimes. This is definitely a mouse and keyboard game, and I don't think it would even be possible to play this game with a controller. The graphics are nothing special, just some very generic elements that almost look like pixel art in their simplicity. That actually works in the game's favor though, because it adds to the dreary atmosphere of prison life, and it's hard to differentiate between different prisoners which really makes them feel like ""just another prisoner #1234"" and makes the game feel slightly more edgy. Sound is also nothing spectacular, but again, I don't think that really detracts from the overall experience. In fact, you can play the game without sound and really not miss out on anything. I usually like to listen to music while I'm playing games anyway, so the sound isn't a big deal to me. So if you enjoy real-time strategy games, Prison Architect is definitely worth a try. It's not an easy game, but it's rewarding to play and very enjoyable.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												Bought this on sale in the steam summer sale 2016. I'd played Prison Architect in beta, but I usually prefer to wait until games are fully released before playing them properly. While I'm unsure if I think I would play the full £20 for the game, as it is still very buggy, I feel the game would be worth the amount if it wasnt for the bugs. I paid around £10 for this game, which is a complete bargain. I aboslutely loved it from the get-go (once I figured out how to get around the few bugs I had within the game). I spent around 20 hours playing the game within two days of buying it, the campaign mode absorbed my attention completely, and I felt the campagin teaches you well for playing in sandbox or otherwise. To be fair, none of the bugs are game-breaking, generally they were small visual things, but for some people it may be enough to put you off slightly.			",185,91,4,28,31,5,23

												So I've been wanting to play this game for awhile, and I bought it during the summer sale. Honestly, it's good fun for a little while, but I don't think it would have been worth the buy at regular price, so just a heads up. Now, aside from the price, let me describe what I like and dislike about my short time with the game.Pros:Nice, relaxing (for the most part) game, that captures a lot of what a real prison would look like. I would say if your a fan of sims and building games, this is worthy of your time.Sandbox mode is fun for awhile, and the great mods and maps from the community will keep you entertained.Cons:The story mode isn't that great from what i've played so far. It's very boring and simply re-hashes every aspect of prison management that you can learn in the sandbox mode.The game needs more content, better AI, better guard deployment, and just more attention to detail in general. For instance, if you snatch a set of keys from a guard, sure you can open most of the doors in the prison, but you can't free fellow inmates from handcuffs and have them join a riot. Detail and just common sense actions would make the game so much more satisfying.Summary: If you can get it on sale, I recommend it. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys sims and micromanagement games, and I'm looking forward to future updates.			",20,12,0,0,3,0,4

												10/10 - Gamre play and features continue to improve as developers respond and listen to the user community.  Liked this game from the start but it continues to get better.  I feel it is worth the full price, but if it is on sale than it's a no-brainer: GET IT.Essentially, you can decide whether you want to have a female or male prison, different security levels, challenges (To have Gangs or not to have Gangs), etc.  You can decide whether to reform through punishment or fostering development.

												By far a great game. I started playing while still in testing phase and i am still playing now. I often start new games as i love the building process opposed to building massive prisons. however a good massive prison is fun to. The aspect of plyaing as a prisoner to is awsome. I really hope they continue to expand this game and also make other games along the same template as this one. 100 out of 10 for sure			",6,1,0,3,44,0,27

								I remember seeing this game around, a year ago, lets say, it was good then, but it's even better now. Maybe not EVERYONE likes this game but, the amount of DETAIL put into this game is just, amazing.The game is about running a prison, and it sticks by it, your prison is in your hands, BUT, my favorite part, is that it's not FULLY in your control. Sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.The developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfectThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!You dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I think this is a great game even for a beta, however it does not have some of the real-world prison feel. It will keep you entertained for a good 30 hours, but then there really isn't much to do anymore. On a scale of 1-10 it is a 7.5 to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Some will look at this game in what is the 21st century, and be asking themselves if a top down 2D game, like the games of old is any good in an age of 3D HD games. Short answer: YesIf you have ever wanted to play a prison management/building game, then this is the one for you. Its so simple and yet so deep. For such an early alpha game this offers a lot.Sure it has a few bugs. But they are not game breaking. And as was mentioned, it is an Alpha. So bugs are par for the course.Introversion has come back with a whopping bang with this game. And i for one, welcome this game and introversion back with open arms. *Addictive gameplay*Details that you dont expect from your average management game (Full prisoner rap sheets and such)  *Versatile construction that just keeps on getting better*Managment features that really allow you to control your prison (stationing guards, marking areas for security levels, Planning prisoners days*Workshop capabiltiy (hte mod list keeps on growing...)*And not forgetting, it isnt even finished yet. This game can only get better.The prison management sim that we have been waiting for.Play it, and get hooked. More addictive than the drugs being peddled in your prison ;)Its up to you now, warden...			",67,8,0,6,38,1,18

												Prison Architect is a fun builder/management sim.  The best way to describe my fascination with it is that it's like watching an ant farm with all the ants in little orange jumpsuits.+Freedom to design your prison in whatever way you wish.  Nice extras like time-sensitive guard scheduling and automated doors and cameras.  You can reform through punishment or reform programs.  Still has monthly updates even after release.  Tons of mods.-Campaign is pretty short (I don't mind, I'm here for the sandbox).  There is no way to automate searching prisoners or cells.  Depending on your PC, performance can be an issue once you start approaching 1000 inmates.Overall, great sim game.  Hours of enjoyment to be had.			",22,4,0,6,6,0,8

												A strangely addictive game. I can't stop playing it just to see what the inmates get up to next.There is currently only one bug that I've seen that really annoys the heck out of me. Sometimes prisoners will be reassigned from their private cells to the public holding cell for no reason at all and the only way to get them back into their private cells is to remove the holding cell completely. Hopefully they will fix this. Other than that I've been having a blast with this game all weekend! I highly recommend.			",79,15,1,23,20,0,29

You then make some important rooms like a canteen, common room, solitary, and a kitchen. You then begin to gain money and increase your cells and rooms.

												Prison Architect is a very fun game with lots of replay values and customisability which is relatively easy to get the hang of.Pros- Prison setup customisability is very good and you can make men's, women's, strict, relaxed, high security, low security, small, large, anything you like- Endlessly replayable as the sheer number of different options means you may never have the same prison twice- Tasks for money are largely fun and there are lots of them- Different prisoner 'actions' are good, for example some prisoners are well behaved but others are tougher and harder to look after- Escape mode is brilliant and adds something so it isn't just a normal prison builder. Prison Architect meets The Escapists- Easy and efficient support for Steam Workshop enables you to easily try out others' prisons- Customisability throughout the game in more ways than you could possibly imagine- I also quite like the 8-bit animation styleCons- Sometimes things take way too long to get built, get built in a random order, or the builders get stuck. Basically some major problems with construction. There are also some other noticeable bugs- I don't like the thing where other people can throw things over the prison wall, it doesn't seem realistic and you can't turn it off8/10 or A-			",36,8,0,4,14,1,4

								I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes strategy games and grid-based design games. I have had 1000+ hours of literal non-stop fun so far from this game. This game LACKS the ability to be boring, as you can always restart and try again. It's extremely easy to mod and I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to Lua code. It's far more stable and less buggy than Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is a buggy mess outright in itself; I've had one or two bugs ever happen in this game (Prison Architect) over two years of playing it, with over 1,000 hours (steam/normal version combined).This game is great for anyone, and there's tablet versions for those without their computer at hand. Introversion makes enjoyable games, Uplink and Prison Architect being my favorites, then Darwinia. If they continue work with Subversion, and they complete it to full, it could be an amazing game. Or, Uplink 2.0? That'd be cool.Pros/Cons (Cons are exagurated, so take with a grain of salt, but they aren't that bad and the gameplay and replayability of this game is worth more than any kind of con this game has).Pros:Great GameplayMods via WorkshopPrisons via WorkshopCommunity is decent (the website forum is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, especially the moderators, steam community is better)Amazing Lua capabilitiesBuilt in computer logic set pieces ('remote control' research option)Cons:-Starts to lag like hell with 200+ AI's on the map (30-45fps with oc 4.1ghz fx-6300), you're going to need a decent processor (high-end i3, i5, i7, fx-6300, fx-8350)-No multiplayer, but I can see that being a bigger issue than it would be worth (how would pathfinding be handled? servers? host? if peer-to-peer, it could kill the hosts computer from the possibility of too much AI)-Needs better multi-threading, or 64-bit. Lag issues could be killed permanently if either of these were introduced. 64-bit would kill the lag harder than more cores, though.			",72,4,1,3,12,2,9

								Great early access game with monthly updates often including major feature additions and responses to community requests and reports. Extremely addicting, and nice to have in a window while working on other things without weighing down your PC. Highly recommend for anyone, and especially for fans of tycoon style games.

								Prison Architect ReviewProbably the best early-access game ever to hit Steam. Prison Architect is a creative sandbox game in which you build and manage a prison. The addictive concept, depth and easy to use interface makes this one of the most intriguing and enjoyable games I have played in a long time.The top-down presentation is simple yet superb. The user-friendly interface makes navigation simple and easy to use. There is quite a lot of stuff to do in terms of construction and designing so having such a well-designed layout of functions is crucial to this games brilliance. The strategic depth here is also incredible and the way you design your prison and how you manage prisoners happiness can be huge factors to your overall success.The bigger your prison becomes; the tougher it is to manage. Suddenly you have maximum security prisoners at your door and it's up to you to expand and enhance your prison to accommodate the influx whilst keeping people including staff and fellow inmates happy and safe. There is a considerable challenge here particularly when you grow your prison and the population. The level of depth in the design of your prison along with the management strategy aspect is simply staggering.Overall, Prison Architect is an amazing game even at alpha stage. It's polished and incredibly well designed in all areas. The developers have done an amazing job so far and this game will only grow further in months to come.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I thought I was gona run a small prison for my first one and let it run for a bit, but there are a TON of possibilities for thing you can do, and the developers can add infinitly more at their discretion.

												It is a fantastic game, You know something what you want in you prison..? Build it. I dont see any bucks or glitches, but sometimes you get remembered that it is still an early access Game. For example, Not all objects has a goal or does something. I give it a 9/10! And thats very good because it is still Early Access Game! --- Update --- It is still a fantastic game! Everything fits in! Everything has something to do with logistics and running your prison! You can make it totally your own by building it and customise on every kind of aspect! If you dont want to build your own and just want to play? You can do that now with the Steam workshop in-game. There is also a gamemode where you can Escape from your own prison or that one you downloaded from the workshop. I never get bored in this awesome game and can not hate it. I saw every update coming and tried everything and in my opinion it is an finished game! This is truly a 10/10 game!			",111,18,0,12,31,0,24

Even though the game is not fully developed and there are a lot of bugs ... so many bugs it is still a very decent game that feels very polished. As well the developers continually update and roll new features out which add another layer of strategy to the game at the moment as you redesign your prison to include the new elements. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a challenge and a game that will draw you in and keep you busy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of the best games i've ever played. Don't scoff! This is not your typical Alpha Release. Frankly at this point I would be HAPPY to call this game complete. It's sandbox, it's fun, it's DEEP! You know those games that have a suprising amount of calculations and depth behind the actions? Well that's Prison Architect! This game is remenscient to the old Theme Games (hospital, park). Excellent simulator, constantly being updated and so much fun!Added to that it has a great new Modding Ability, you can add in pretty much EVERYTHING. New ROoms, New items, new needs! Want to build a church with a priest that slowly increases a prisoners Spirituality? GO RIGHT AHEAD! Want to create a training course to turn Prisoners into laymen of the Church? Why not? Want to have holy wine and wafers as contraband within the church? SureCurrently on the humblebundle.com for just $10!P.S: I've played this game for hours upon hours on a none steam version.

								Nothing supplies a better power trip then making your solitairy confinement as small and dark as possible. Or how about wrangling the issue of escaping prisoners by erecting a huge fence like some anti-immigrant wet dream?Let's not kid ourselves: this game has been in alpha for a long time and I suspect it won't be leaving alpha anytime soon. But ask yourself this: is it really a glitch that all of your staff can't seem to leave the storage room? Or perhaps its an unintentional commentary on the laxness and incompetence of the American prison system?			",22,7,0,4,3,0,1

								There I was, I had just put some money onto my Steam Wallet to prepare for the amazement that is the Steam Summer Sale, I was pondering for many moments, browsing the front page. I knew I wanted a game but which game. I'm on a Mac you see so not many games are available. Prison Architect was there though. I was questioning my mate  (I later found out that he had no previous experience with the game) and he just said ""If you want."" I responded with, ""Of course I want!"" And thusly proceeded to acquire Prison Architect in the usual fashion.I ordered a pizza and let the game download, presuming it would take my 'terrible' internet a while to download. I was surprised to find that the game was simply 150 MB in size and my 'terrible' internet was able to download it in a matter of minutes. I went onto it. Tried to change around with the settings, being in a Skype call and having the game sounds blaring into your ears wasn't the greatest thing. With that tweak well and truly sorted I moved on to play the game.The first thing the game asked me to do was to build an execution room and I was already excited. Have you always wanted to build a room to kill all those that wronged? Then this is the game for you! Having completed the introduction I thought I was ready to move onto larger and greater things... I've never been so wrong in my life before.I went onto load up a world in all it's default gloryness. Built the usual holding cell, office, canteen and kitchen. Proceeded to hire a warden, one million guards and two cooks. Then the normal risk prisoners arrived. I was there in all my naivety believing the guards would able to handle these prisoners... again, I've never been so wrong in my life before.Trying to pimp out the kitchen when a red sign pops up saying '1..2...3...4..5...6...7 prisoners escaped'. I immediately scanned the area, spotting out the escapees and bringing them back to justice. Turns out, the guards would rather fight a guy inside the holding cell as opposed to capturing those who flee. It was a dead end and I had to plow on.In the end, I just turned out to be really bad at the game and as much as I found it difficult it truly is an enjoyable game. I do recommend you buy it this sale or if not buy it whenever.			",50,4,0,1,5,0,4

												This game has very few rules. 1.  Hold prisoners for thier allotted time.2. Try not to get too many killed in any one day.3.  Profit.This is a management sim/sandbox. Primarily, you will be building and designing rooms, managing your employees, and running an intelegence network.  How your prisoners are treated is really up to you; you can be the reformer or the punisher.Gameplay itself can be changed when you first create a new prison.  You can choose your warden, prisoner genders, gang presence, weather effect, and random events.  Even though Prisoner Achitect is out of early access, the developers still add content every now and then.  Be sure to check the community page when you see an update and check out their announcement and demonstration video.Edit:  Since I posted this review, the developers issued thier final update (giving dev shortcuts).  The game has taken on a different dynamic for me.   While it was in early access, I would essentially be playing a new prison with a new challenge level every month as it was updated.   I think that was the most fun for me.  I still love the game, but expect this to be the finished article.  It's wonderful and challenging, but not as dynamic as an experience as it was in early access.			",67,18,0,11,7,0,6

												Bought this on sale in the steam summer sale 2016. I'd played Prison Architect in beta, but I usually prefer to wait until games are fully released before playing them properly. While I'm unsure if I think I would play the full £20 for the game, as it is still very buggy, I feel the game would be worth the amount if it wasnt for the bugs. I paid around £10 for this game, which is a complete bargain. I aboslutely loved it from the get-go (once I figured out how to get around the few bugs I had within the game). I spent around 20 hours playing the game within two days of buying it, the campaign mode absorbed my attention completely, and I felt the campagin teaches you well for playing in sandbox or otherwise. To be fair, none of the bugs are game-breaking, generally they were small visual things, but for some people it may be enough to put you off slightly.			",185,91,4,28,31,5,23

												I would have to say that this game is one of my guilty pleasures. Why? i love management sims. Rarely, however, do I find a sim like this. As a guy who bought this in Early Access, about five months before release, there's a lot to say about this game.BASICS:Prisoners come in three types: Minimum Security, Medium Security, Maximum SecurityThere are also designations you can add on such as SuperMax and Protective CustodyEach Prisoner type has a monetary value associated with it upon intake. Min Sec is $500, Med Sec is $1000, and Max sec is $1500There are certain things you need to make your prison function properly:Showers (for Hygenine)Cells or Dormitories (to house prisoners)Canteens and Kitchens (to feed them)Yard(s) for excersizeIn addition to these rooms you will also want to keep in mind that there are other rooms such as common rooms, infirmaries, and visitation rooms that either need to be unlocked or can just be placed down given certain criteria. Once you get your prison going, figure out a formula for maximizing space, you'll be fine. There's also something to be said about the recently added Escape Mode. This mode, which allows you to escape prisons made either by yourself or others, is very fun. There are a couple issues, like how workers won't repair power stations or how guards sometimes won't be replenished, but overall it's very enjoyable within the right setting. There are certain failure conditions, such as having too many prisoners die in one day, that lead to you having to cut down on prisoner deaths (5 and you fail). Unlike most games however which will just say ""Game Over"" and not let you continue, the beauty of this game is that you then get to escape your prison. There is a slight downside, in that if there's a riot you'll probably have to deal with that when you're transported in. Otherwise? It's very enjoyable.Pros:+ Indepth Needs Sysytem+ Good graphics (for 2D)+ Events can be fun+ Planning your ideal prison+ Numerous ways to play as a Warden+ Escape Mode+ Unique Failure SystemCons:- Replayability, after your 100th prison, gets low- Music can get repetitive (I like to put on Pandora)- Without frequent security checks, weapons can be brought in- Juggling prisoner needs with expenses			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best management-building games I have ever played, and I only ever play building games or management games or both. It has an amazing art style, with the occasional error but that has already been solved by modders. It has a fantatstic fan-base behind it, constantly making new prisons and mods for everyone to use. The developers used to update every month, with almost all of them being a content update which was amazing whilst it lasted. I've spent many of my days off playin this game and I think you should too.			",69,6,5,7,22,0,4

								Some will look at this game in what is the 21st century, and be asking themselves if a top down 2D game, like the games of old is any good in an age of 3D HD games. Short answer: YesIf you have ever wanted to play a prison management/building game, then this is the one for you. Its so simple and yet so deep. For such an early alpha game this offers a lot.Sure it has a few bugs. But they are not game breaking. And as was mentioned, it is an Alpha. So bugs are par for the course.Introversion has come back with a whopping bang with this game. And i for one, welcome this game and introversion back with open arms. *Addictive gameplay*Details that you dont expect from your average management game (Full prisoner rap sheets and such)  *Versatile construction that just keeps on getting better*Managment features that really allow you to control your prison (stationing guards, marking areas for security levels, Planning prisoners days*Workshop capabiltiy (hte mod list keeps on growing...)*And not forgetting, it isnt even finished yet. This game can only get better.The prison management sim that we have been waiting for.Play it, and get hooked. More addictive than the drugs being peddled in your prison ;)Its up to you now, warden...			",67,8,0,6,38,1,18

												I really enjoy Prison-Architect and I highly recommend buying it if you like building simulators. I have always enjoyed building simulators and Prison-Architect is the most well-built one in my opinion.The game runs pretty great. There really aren’t any graphic controls besides full screen and windowed. I guess it’s not necessary for this type of game. The game starts to slow down for me when I’m playing large and busy prisons.I bought Prison-Architect when it was in Alpha/Early-Access. The game has definitely been improved. Most of the UI has been redone and improved. There’s been lots of new features added. They recently announced they are done adding new features to the game but said they may still do bug fixes as needed. ",102,13,0,9,17,0,15

								Prison Architect is fairly satisfying if you like building games, yet I feel the management / strategy aspect is still in its infancy. It also suffers from noticable bugs and lacks certain 'intuitive' interface features (like being able to zoom in at mouse point) that make the gameplay slightly awkward.But hey, it doesn't deny being a work-in-progress. There isn't much in the way of stopping it being a great game. As always with early access, you have to decide if lack of polish is a deal breaker for you. If not, you've got yourself a fairly enjoyable sandbox game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison Architect is by far one of my favorite games. The developers are always on-point, and release monthly updates which you can find on the Introversion Software site.To sum up a quick review, the recent addition of Death Row has brought some major play changes to the game, along with a few new rooms being added. I go over several key features that have been implemented over the months in my review below.TL;DR:Death RowAutomationMail RoomCells now have a rating from 0-10 which allows prisoners more comfort

								Extremely fun game, I would happily pay the full price for this as I've already put many hours into it (and will be putting in many more). It's currently 50% off which is a massive bargain. The latest update was a 'bug squashing' update, which fixed the majority of the frustrating bugs.  The development team upgrade the game every month adding new features etc, but in saying that - whilst it's still alpha it's in very good shape, has a hell of a lot of features and is great fun.It's very satisfying using the planning tool to design your prison from Day 1, slowly building it and seeing it function as you imagined, it's also fun trying to cram as many cons in a cell block as possible to get maximum efficiency from your space.  Don't feel bad about them either, they are scumbags!			",139,19,6,22,38,2,16

												I have been enjoying this game massively since the Early Access. This was one of my first Early Access games besides Don't Starve and it hasn't let me down. The developer has provided the community with regular updates and the community itself isn't getting tired of providing mods.I really enjoy starting new every once again, just to create a new layout for my prison. I feel like the UI is quite intuitive, creating a prison with the necessary rooms is easy. Tools like ""Cloning"" make it even easier to add already created rooms to your prison layout later on, if you need.There are a lot of different rooms like cells, holding cell, family cells (only for female prisons) and dormitories to ""store"" your prisoners, showers to fullfill their hygiene need, kitchen and dining halls to feed them. You can unlock more rooms later on by unlocking different perks by your staff members like Prison labour. This gives you the opportunity to let your prisoners work as janitors (cleaning the facility) or in a workshop or laundry to clean clothes and make licensing plates which can be sold. This way you can earn some extra money. Of course there are additional rooms just to make your prisoners happy and make sure they are not starting a riot quickly like a library, common rooms, visitor rooms or a shop. This game has a lot to it and if I would have to compare it to another game, it would be Dungeon Keeper. Of course, you are not luring monsters with your rooms, and your are not preparing to fight some white knight. But still creating the rooms and keeping your inmates happy somehow reminds me of the good old dungeon keeper times. I would full-heartedly recommend this game, if you are into building/management stuff.			",69,29,0,21,24,0,8

												Here`s a list of the things I love about the game.The developers are still releasing new updates after release. It has tons of replay value, I only have 100 some hours into the game but some people have thousands. It`s realistic but has funny concepts. The price isn`t bad at all, especially if you bought it in early access. The game is really up to your playstyle. If you want to give the prisoners an easy time in prison you can. If you want them to suffer, go right ahead. It`s all up to you.It has all kinds of backstories for the prisoners along with the convictions and so on. For such a simple looking game, it is more fun than most graphically enhanced games that focus more on story or the looks of it rather than gameplay. Prison Architect is all gameplay. If you like story based games, then it even has you covered with that. Check out the campaign. This review is just the tip of the iceburg, look at the other reviews in this if you still aren`t convinced to buy this game.8.5/10			",7,1,0,3,9,0,2

												I play this game ocassionaly and everytime I do is very easy to get stucked on it hours and hours.It works in both ways, you can do the best prison that makes any paradise island seems a ghetto, or you can do the worst prison that makes the most dangerous undersiege city seems a kindergarden.You can get devious so easily, making dark places at corners and corridors, placing things where inmates can get stuff to be turned in deadly DIY knives.This is not a prison simulator only, it's more a god game, when you handling hordes of maximum security inmates in gangs, you must decide who have more changes to survive by relocating his cell, adding more guards to routes, or simply not making mafia hitmen be with white neck criminals at the same time in the canteen when the kitchen is so easy to reach with its pletora of sharpen stuff.

								While this game is about building a prison, taking care of prisoners and rehabilitating them (as of the last update), to me this game shows everything right about game development. Introversion has taken time to listen to the people who play their game, make videos to show up the updates and highlights of their development process, and try to add as much detail as they can as they go. While it is a ""game in progress,"" it has been an awesome ride this far and I can't wait to see what comes next.As for the game itself, it's a fun simulation that's only gotten better with time. Your options are many, although your starting funds are few. Persistence pays off in the long run, so it helps to put a few hours aside a day to play the game and make one more goal (making room for more prisoners, implementing a better daily schedule, finally building the visitation room, etc). It will hook you if you are into detailed sims, and maybe even if you are not. Just be careful - this game can suck hours away from you without you noticing.			",61,27,0,40,33,1,43

												So, I made a nice prison(and by nice I mean I named used LUXURY Prison in the save name), prisoners were happy, no incidents in 17 days, and the I saw that the Prison needed expanding...Here is the chain of events:-Builds Wall around prison-Forgets to put STAFF doors in the wall and demolishes it in one area-All, and I mean ALL, of the prisoners ran towards the hole in the wall-99.9% of them see the guards there and go back to the Canteen-00.1% of them keep running-The one prisoner escapesAnd now its not a Luxury Prison anymore.

								Now this truely is a game to behold, whether you believe criminals should be taught skills and behaviour in prison so that they dont reoffend when they come out, or if you think that hard labour and strict punishments will deter them from risking a return this game has it all for you.As long as you are not violently alergic to simulation/construction games you should definetely have a look at this			",171,38,2,31,30,1,37

								I've only knocked about 6 hours on this game so far, but I must say that's it's worth every cent.Don't let the top-down basic character look deter you from trying out this title because it makes it up with the unlimited designs and elaborate tools to build yourself a pretty dope Prison.What I enjoyed the most was the option to build a prison with Unlimited Funds, You could turn off accepting prisoners, lay out a magnificant lock-up and have a million workers pound it out.I really need to get back into playing this game.

												It is a fantastic game, You know something what you want in you prison..? Build it. I dont see any bucks or glitches, but sometimes you get remembered that it is still an early access Game. For example, Not all objects has a goal or does something. I give it a 9/10! And thats very good because it is still Early Access Game! --- Update --- It is still a fantastic game! Everything fits in! Everything has something to do with logistics and running your prison! You can make it totally your own by building it and customise on every kind of aspect! If you dont want to build your own and just want to play? You can do that now with the Steam workshop in-game. There is also a gamemode where you can Escape from your own prison or that one you downloaded from the workshop. I never get bored in this awesome game and can not hate it. I saw every update coming and tried everything and in my opinion it is an finished game! This is truly a 10/10 game!			",111,18,0,12,31,0,24

								I quite like Prison Architect, the way the game is designed if you are willing to challenge yourself you almost always have something to strive for, always trying to build that perfect prison. Even though the game is not fully developed and there are a lot of bugs ... so many bugs it is still a very decent game that feels very polished. As well the developers continually update and roll new features out which add another layer of strategy to the game at the moment as you redesign your prison to include the new elements. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a challenge and a game that will draw you in and keep you busy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here`s a list of the things I love about the game.The developers are still releasing new updates after release. It has tons of replay value, I only have 100 some hours into the game but some people have thousands. It`s realistic but has funny concepts. The price isn`t bad at all, especially if you bought it in early access. The game is really up to your playstyle. If you want to give the prisoners an easy time in prison you can. If you want them to suffer, go right ahead. It`s all up to you.It has all kinds of backstories for the prisoners along with the convictions and so on. For such a simple looking game, it is more fun than most graphically enhanced games that focus more on story or the looks of it rather than gameplay. Prison Architect is all gameplay. If you like story based games, then it even has you covered with that. Check out the campaign. This review is just the tip of the iceburg, look at the other reviews in this if you still aren`t convinced to buy this game.8.5/10			",7,1,0,3,9,0,2

												I have been enjoying this game massively since the Early Access. This was one of my first Early Access games besides Don't Starve and it hasn't let me down. The developer has provided the community with regular updates and the community itself isn't getting tired of providing mods.I really enjoy starting new every once again, just to create a new layout for my prison. I feel like the UI is quite intuitive, creating a prison with the necessary rooms is easy. Tools like ""Cloning"" make it even easier to add already created rooms to your prison layout later on, if you need.There are a lot of different rooms like cells, holding cell, family cells (only for female prisons) and dormitories to ""store"" your prisoners, showers to fullfill their hygiene need, kitchen and dining halls to feed them. You can unlock more rooms later on by unlocking different perks by your staff members like Prison labour. This gives you the opportunity to let your prisoners work as janitors (cleaning the facility) or in a workshop or laundry to clean clothes and make licensing plates which can be sold. This way you can earn some extra money. Of course there are additional rooms just to make your prisoners happy and make sure they are not starting a riot quickly like a library, common rooms, visitor rooms or a shop. This game has a lot to it and if I would have to compare it to another game, it would be Dungeon Keeper. Of course, you are not luring monsters with your rooms, and your are not preparing to fight some white knight. But still creating the rooms and keeping your inmates happy somehow reminds me of the good old dungeon keeper times. I would full-heartedly recommend this game, if you are into building/management stuff.			",69,29,0,21,24,0,8

												Top top top top top top fun. If you enjoy a building game then this s the game for you. It gets complicated and busy when you start trying to manage high security prisoners. It is worth every single penny you pay for it. It has some smart mechanics in the game. Very nice and very neat. Like one is having a door open or close to the working prisoners... They will drop their stuff and make a dash for the door to escaple.  Pipes not set nice will cause them to dig a way out and not watching them will make them sneak stuff in and out and plan escapes, seriously love this aspect of the game.So much fun with this game. The graphics might be crap but the gameplay is so fun you forget about it and enjoy it for what it is. At the moment building a prison over 50 people it is a lag fest no matter the PC. I cannot say anything bad about it apart from the lag which is being fixed. I love building, I love managing this, it is funny when the prisoners try to escape. You want you will not regret buying this game.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

I had a prisoner named Heisenberg, and he constantly kept beating up other prisoners, he would get knocked unconcious be brought to a medical bed, get healed by the doctor, get better and take the doctors needles and stab everyone. He now has like 6 murders on record since he's been in my prison. It's just awesome!			",45,14,0,19,23,0,3

								I absolutely must recommend the game, I love it (as you can tell from how long I have played it for) and it is simply great. The development team has consistently released new alphas that have always improved the game massivley. I love the graphics and they can be run easily by most computers well, the interfaces are user friendly and the controls were pretty easy to pick up. Some things I would like to see added to the game would be the ability to select certain personalities for your prisoners, the ability to turn off certain needs (e.g. Spirituality) and some form of iron man mode.  In spite of this this game is still well worth the cost and I am certain it will get ever better in the future.			",50,2,0,4,10,0,6

								This game is a gem! I haven't had this much fun in a tycoon style game since I played Rollercoaster Tycoon in primary school years and years ago.The gameplay is fantastic, next to no bugs that you can't work around, hours and hours of fun getting your prison just right and the fact that a riot can break out and having to bring in the riot team, paramedics and fire brigade is just flippin' ridiculously awesome! The game is not a simple build walls and put the prisoners in their cells, you can segregate Min Sec, Med Sec, Max Sec, Supermax, Protected & Death Row inmates in order to help keep the peace, you can send your dog squad on patrols to sniff clothes for drugs in the laundry room, lockdown the prison and perform a shakedown, recruit CI's from solitary confinement, run appeals for prisoners on death row and execute them if need be and so much more... also the game has workshop so there's a bunch of mods you can play with too, or make your own!I rate this game 11/10, it's brilliant. There's definitely things i'd love to see added to it but let's wait for the game to leave early access, who knows what the devs have thought up.			",246,67,1,41,29,1,16

Early Access Review
 Prison Architect... Is it a master piece or a mediocre game read and find out below!	   First let me start out by saying this game is still in development so this review is bound to change when the game is completed but for now this is going to be my opinion on it. Prison Architect has its good side and its bad side as well i will be starting off by listing the cons first and then the pros afterwards.  Cons.    1.   You will get some extremely trouble some prisoners while you are playing this game. They will kill many of your staff and or prisoners in the process of them throwing their little eveing fits while in solitary for killing 5 of your guards as punishment. There really needs to be a drop down box to change their role from supermax to death row that way their reign of destruction is put to an end.  2. The punishment system is very limited in what you can do to inmates when they commit a new felony or offense. The only two options you have is solitary or locking them down in their cells for how ever long you deem fit.  3.  The U.I is organized but can be troublesome if you dont know where to look for certain features.   4.  The $30.00 price tag is asking a bit much for the content that is provided in game as of right now. Even with mod content the game lacks some crucial items and objects ( no diversity all your prison rooms will look the same in one way or another.)  5.  There is no quick build option for construction of your prison. Even with a worker force of 100 plus buildings can take a few minutes to get up an running. 6.  After building your prison there isnt really much more to do with it other than watch your little ant farm work like clock work.  Side Note. (There is a really annoying glitch where your workers and other members of your staff get stuck and will not perform their tasks at hand.  Only way i know to fix this glitch is by saving and quitting out and reloading the prison.) Pros   1.  Building a working and well functioning prison gives you a sense of accomplishment. Makes you feel like you acheived something great.  2.  Inside Prison Architects  core game there is mini game type stuff that you can do to keep busy (Busy work).Such as tidying wires up so they are not a huge mess  laying down pipes and electrical cables connection for your cameras to your monitors. etc...  3. There is a C.I System within the game which allows you to get prisoners in distress to pretty much spy on other prisoners and rat them out. They will tell you where drugs, weapons, high probabilty assassination targets are that need to be protected. This adds  a new layer of fun gameplay to your expirence.  4. You start off with a good amount of land in the start of your game. Which you can later upgrade into a bigger plot of land if you have enough cash to buy additonal plots to expand your prison.  5. Challenging but solid game play. This game offers a decent amount of depth in the menus for the behind the scenes type of stuff. Such as scheduling classes for your inmates so they stay educated, work shops for prison labor, fully flexible scheduling for all prisoners, grants to earn you money by completeting tasks. ETC..  6. Prison Architect has unique graphics, they are very cartoony and 2D but it does not take away from the actual gameplay of the game it self. It is still grim and gruesome even with cartoon graphics.Now for the final rating of the game... Even though the game is fun and challenging it does get kind of boring after you built your prison and can expand no more.  So i recommend starting a new prison after you are done with one and it will keep you occupied for the time being.Prison Architect is still in alpha and is pretty sturdy but due to the lack of content and the asking price of 30$ as is.. im going to have to give the game a final rating of a 7.5/10 Above Average wait until its on sale though. {UPDATE} The devs added a new random event sytem to the game and gangs since the last post of this review and those 2 major updates along with the shops as well makes me give this game a 9.0/10 an awesome game and a good amount of content.

												Fantastic game.That's the short version. A longer version is that this game has brought me some really good times. It's a very pleasant and satisfying sim with many great features that create huge depth for this minimalistically stylized game.Just when you think that you have the perfect, most stable running prison in the world, the inmates take advantage of your arrogance and point out the flaws in your system and kill the mole that was supplying you with information about gangs and escape attempts. This hurts your prison's value, you walk on the razor's edge of being halled off to jail yourself for criminal negligence. For being a sim game it actually brings a huge element of a power struggle between you and the inmates. No other game has played on my ego as much as Prison Architect.The devs have put in a lot of time and hard work in this game and it doesn't seem like they are about to stop. Even after the 1.0 release they keep updating with new features and balances that make the game more enjoyable, more intricate, and pushes the ""end-game"" portion slowly out of the equation.Each build of this game makes your prison more and more into a living, breathing world. You easily forget about the minimalistic (but beautifully designed) sprites and look at your population and staff as real people.The AI's actions feel planned out and specifically designed for the prison that you built yourself. Back to the drawing board.A must-have for any fan of management games.			",39,1,0,2,5,0,2

												This game has very few rules. 1.  Hold prisoners for thier allotted time.2. Try not to get too many killed in any one day.3.  Profit.This is a management sim/sandbox. Primarily, you will be building and designing rooms, managing your employees, and running an intelegence network.  How your prisoners are treated is really up to you; you can be the reformer or the punisher.Gameplay itself can be changed when you first create a new prison.  You can choose your warden, prisoner genders, gang presence, weather effect, and random events.  Even though Prisoner Achitect is out of early access, the developers still add content every now and then.  Be sure to check the community page when you see an update and check out their announcement and demonstration video.Edit:  Since I posted this review, the developers issued thier final update (giving dev shortcuts).  The game has taken on a different dynamic for me.   While it was in early access, I would essentially be playing a new prison with a new challenge level every month as it was updated.   I think that was the most fun for me.  I still love the game, but expect this to be the finished article.  It's wonderful and challenging, but not as dynamic as an experience as it was in early access.			",67,18,0,11,7,0,6

								This is a really great developed game. PA (Prison Architect), is one of the best prison building games out there.  It is in its alpha state but it is still really good, the graphics are amazing. Better still, steam workshop made it even BETTER, things that are yet in the game yet will be made by other players, for example, a barber shop, not in the game yet, look around the workshop and easily will you find a barber mod. That's how great PA is, I would give it 8.5/10.Cons:The unlimited funds section, when you spend money, it goes into the red. I hope they would remove that, and make our money infinite on unlimited funds settings.Overall, I strongly recommend this game.			",47,13,1,4,44,0,3

While this game is buggy as hell, and often you'll be screaming at the AI for their stupidity, this game is still very fun.

												Prison Architect has been progressing very nicely through its alpha stages (owned since Alpha 14) and I must say I'm always impressed with every new update. New features, new systems, new rooms, new furniture, new models, etc.The name says it all, you design, construct, develop and maintain your prison while housing, feeding, regulating, and disciplining the prisoners, and while managing your staff. (janitors, lawyers, groundskeepers, cooks, accountants, and more). There are a ton of options available to you to customize your facility to be exactly how you want it. Keep up the great work developers![Originally Posted: 8 October, 2013, edited: 21 February, 2015]Edit [October 15, 2015]: Game is now out of Early Access!- Been playing it more now that it's fully released, and I'm still very happy with the game and my purchase.

												I was playing Escape Mod for the first time.it was a normal day in the prison, i already have my gang of 7 people.One day, when the new prisoners came, and of course we were always trying to escape by waiting infront of the main gate that is heavily guarded and so i thought, the moment that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gate opens, we were already free men..As the door opens, i used one of my men to distract an Armed Guard by stabbing him to death, it worked but of course reinforments came and we were already across the hallway getting tazed. A few more steps to the main door...Woke up on bed after being tazed. Lost 2 good men. But that wont stop me from trying again			",46,5,1,4,7,0,3

												One of the most amazing games i have ever owned. Build a prison, try to manage the prison, then get called by the warden that you are fired. If you make your prison too big, then the prisoners will go crazy because they cannot go to the different areas in time. If you make it small they will either be happy or want more space to feel more free. There are a lot of different options and different things you can do with your prison when you feel it is fully builg. You can start programs for the prisoners like teaching them how to cook so they can make food during work time. There are a lot of things you can do with your prison. I would give this game a 10/10 IGN RockPaperShotgun BillGates Obama LordGaben.			",55,9,5,6,10,1,3

								I got to saw I was a little hesitant to intially buy this game being it's still in development and all. But already it could pass off as a finished product. The developers of this game have done an amazing job, and they constantly up date and address feedback to make it even better. For those on the fence about this game or unsure if it's worth it. Get it, it's well worth it. Amazing how easy it is to get into the gameplay where minutes turn to hours without even noticing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison Architect is an early access prison simulator similar to Roller Coaster Tycoon, Simcity, or the like.  It has elements of sandbox/construction with managed tiers for punishment, rehabilitation, kitchen menu etc... right down to micromanaging each hour of each prisoner's day.  You can decide to create the most horrific environment for your prisoners... or maybe you want to excel at rehabilitation & prisoner ""recovery"".  Either way the well stocked options provide freedoms to the user that all simulation games should have... most of the features seem to work already!  Game play is kind of ""real"" ... with comic book style scene transitions & backstories.  However if you can get past the prison thing and just ""play the game"" it is very enjoyable and addictive.  Though this is an early access game it is totally payable in it's current state.If you like simulation/sandbox/management style games... or enjoyed any of the ""Tycoon"" series of games... this is one with a more serious story line/undertones (you can skip the scenes also).  Definitely worth checking out.  ",334,47,23,17,55,2,47

								For those that love building and planning things, Prison Architect let you plan, build and manage a Prison. Start small, with low ""grade"" prisoners, then go up, get better, hire more guards, hire guards with dogs, guards with weapons, make them patrol your prison, we never know when a crazy prisoner may try to break it out, even with a spoon! Get more prisoners, tough ones, make them go into the line, teach them how to act, and, of course, watch out on what you do with them, you don't want to end in your own prison.Prison Architect is developing good, I'm happy to see that they are making progress. I loved to play Theme Hospital, and this one reminded it, just the fact that you still save lifes.... just..... with prisoners now.			",272,33,5,55,57,2,77

								Even though this game is in Early Access, there are very few bugs, but the ones present are actually quite funny. For anyone interested in the Sims or any of the Tycoon games, this is perfect for you and greatly improves on many of the details and realistic aspects of ""manage your own something"" games. The gameplay at first can be a bit challenging, but by your third prison, you will be completely on top of things. The mechanics are great and so is the overall feel of the game. I had doubts about this game and I actually chose it over Call of Duty: Ghosts (I know right), but I made the right call. Prison Architect will NOT let you down and is a must have. For now, because of certain glitches that can be quite annoying (i.e. Workers not doing anything even though there is a bunch of stuff in the Jobs Queue), I give this game a 9.3/10, but when the final product is released, it will definitely deserve a 10/10.

								Admittedly I put off buying this for too long (way too long!).

This game is seriously addictive and the 2D graphics suit the game perfectly! Prison Architect is in depth enough without taking itself too seriously, providing the perfect balance.I can't reccommend this enough!			",40,1,8,8,7,0,3

								Prison Architect, the brilliant and addictive prison building game. Now, this game is the opposite of ""The Escapists"", in the sense that, in this game you build a prison, but in that, you escape one (hence the name, escapists). Prison Architect is one of the more popular games by Introversion Software.In Prison Architect you build and design a prison, but you don't have long (unless you turn off incoming prisoners - but that's besides the point) to build a basic prison. After the first 24 hours, which is about 10-20 minutes on normal game speed, 8-12 normal ranked prisoners will come in. They may bring contraband with them, or they may not. It's best to check everyone just in case. After a while, when you build up your prison a lot, you can start to make the prisoners do manual labour, for example, do the laundry and make numberplates. The laundry is the clothes (etc) of the actual prisoners. The numberplates, you can sell for $100 each (last time I checked).If the prisoners don't like the prison, they can start a riot, try to escape and can make your prison get turned over to the FBI of sorts. If your riot goes on for long enough, you loose and the prison gets taken from you. When riots start, you can call in special forces, ambulances, fire engines and extra police. The fire engines don't really do anything at the moment, seeing as fires are so rare that (I would say) 60% of players don't know they exist, and the destruction they can cause.When you're building your prison, you have to keep in mind that you have a daily income, and if you spend more than said income, you will start loosing money instead of getting it. You can also loose your prison if you go bankrupt for too long, but there is a warning grant that gives you a reasonable amount of money to help you. If your income goes into the minuses, you can get it back up by getting new prisoners, selling items and giving the prisoners worse meals, but giving them worse meals can result in a riot or some very angry prisoners.There are three classes of prisoners, low risk, normal risk and high risk. The low risk people hardly ever start fully fledged fights and never need execution. The normal risk, again, never need execution, but can start a reasonably dangerous riot or fight. The normal risk (to my experience) try and escape more often than the low risk. The high risk are the most dangerous, and may need executions, which you can get by making an execution room. These prisoners got into jail for things like Murder. If you're new to the game, I recommend you stay with low and normal. I don't like having high risk, they're too much of a pain.So, even though this game is in alpha, it is worth a look at. Even at the full price of $25, it will give you hours of fun. During sales this game can go down to as low as $10-$15, which is an amazing deal.			",79,21,4,5,17,1,5

								10/10 one of my favorite games. The graphics are beautiful. The amount of features is immense: not only you can build different rooms (e.g. canteen, cleaning cabinet, morgue, visitors, courtyard..) with varied furniture (e.g. tv, pool table, workshop saw, workshop press, cctv..), You get to fully control the timetable, the research (e.g. psychologist, education, weaponry, finanse..), the police (e.g. dogs, weapons, the raids, punishments..) and overall anything you would expect in a real life prison. What I truly love is that every prisoner has their own story (some truly horrible, some hilarious - which is really fun to read!) and ""personality"" (i.e. violence) that affects the gameplay.Finally, the developers are absolutly amazing, releasing updates atleast once per month, based on community reviews. Every single time they post a video describing the new features - love it! The game is in Alpha, but it feels like it's a full done game. I would recommend this game to anyone - whether it's on sale or not!			",52,36,0,17,34,1,21

												Amazing fun game. I learned how to prepare the population against a martial law situation in the country by taking 1000 prisoners and putting them in ""houses"" than sent the military with rifles to fix the ""situations"" amongst the prisoners which consisted of starving and not getting yard time.No one survived and I was later arrested for Negligence and sent amongst the prisoners.  Sadly I wasn't able to survive either since the second I stepped off the bus I was shot in the face by the military.Moral of the story, don't give up your guns.			",83,24,1,9,15,2,17

												Prison Architect is one of the few managment simulations that I really enjoy. I've been looking a long time for some simulator of this sort and now I finally found it. As the title already says, you build a prison and manage your prisoners. How you do that is completely up to you - will you care for them and treat them nicely to avoid riots? Or will you punish them for every minor offense they do? Maybe you will make them work the whole day and use them for your profit? It's entirely up to you how you manage your prison.And you can actually manage it quite a lot! You can change the day routine and set at which time and how long they sleep, work, eat or just have free time. You can choose to spend more money on healthy food and a bigger selection or let them eat the same unhealthy food to save money.You can expand the land of the prison and build every room on your own, I kind feel like the building of each rooms is pretty poor, there is just too few decorative items you might use in my opinion and makes the process of building just too linear, you will end up building the same rooms all over again just because there is nothing else to put into these rooms.All in all, the game is fun to play, although it might be a bit hard at the beginning, especially if you grow too fast.Besides the prison management, the game also offers a campaign and another mode where you play the prisoner and need to escape. I haven't yet finished the campaign nor have I managed to escape the prison. Both gamemodes are quite nice, but at the time I do not really look forward to finish them, as I like the original prison building more.Although there are a few things I dislike about Prison Architect, I can still highly recommend this game and deep in my heart I hope, even though the game is out of early access by now, that soon I will have nothing to dislike anymore.

												This review is based on the game in development. I have yet to play the completed version, however, considering how amazing the development process was, I can safely assume this game is nothing sort of amazing. Of all the games I've ""pre-purchased"", the makers of this game by far set the gold standard. The timing of the updates; you could set your watch to. The additional features and commentary provided explaining the changes were both humous, entertaining, honest, personal and progressive. I believe they were on update 5.0 when i bought in, and the game at that point was more polished and better developed than some ""finished"" games i've played. Honestly, I'm almost sad to see this game become a finished product. It's like I have empty nest now, no longer able to watch the game grow and unfold. This game is currently at 33% off, and the cheapskate in me thinks that is a great deal. I'd even say the full price of the game is very fair. This game is a complete sandbox that will let you grow at your own pace.  Graphics - clean, crisp, runs well even on lesser machines (even an ipad can take it, those pieces of garbage)Gameplay - fun, you are in complete controlReplay Value - endlessDifficulty - you can make it was easy or as hard as you want it.The ONLY thing i can think of that would make this game better was if you could have 2 players build and manage a prison at the same time... maybe they added that in the last update... maybe they will add it in a future update.... time will tell. If all pre-purchased games were like this, I would have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more games. Sadly this is the last 'pre-purchase' I will make (♥♥♥♥ you dirty greedy developers (not this game, other games)) and thus I can say it was the best 'pre-purchase' or 'alpha' I will ever make.

												This game is quite humorous in its own probably unintended ways.  Despite free food, entertainment, education, medicine, psychologic console, gym, work opportunities and even free camp sites that are regularly groomed by a professional gardener, my prisoners are still suppressed  - until one day I did a shakedown and found 88 jail keys!! Without the keys to heaven, my prisoners became outrageous instead and decided to BBQ themselves - oh well, that's indeed another way to heaven - as the CEO said, ""a lot of people died today, a dark page of the history of this prison"".    But, wait! They were not even escaping with 88 jail keys!!! (￣ε(#￣)☆╰╮o(￣皿￣///) I strongly recommend the developers to introduce religion(s) to the game. Once they understand the whole world is a jail, they will probably just give up escaping and fight with each other instead - or sports, that would do about the same. PS: lesson learnt: do NOT send firefighters into fire, they're not as fire resistant as they look or sound, and they are brave enough to not run away.PSS: I won't tell you i'm updating the review for a badge.

												It's great. Just great. 42 hours of building concrete inescaple (I think) prisons is just addicting. Absolute favourite part of the game is Execution.1. Everyone turns up2. 10 million volts shock through some dork's body3. Everyone's faces are neutral and they leaveSo yah damn fun worth the $30 even though I got it for $7.49 USD cos it was on special:)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison Architect, the brilliant and addictive prison building game. Now, this game is the opposite of ""The Escapists"", in the sense that, in this game you build a prison, but in that, you escape one (hence the name, escapists). Prison Architect is one of the more popular games by Introversion Software.In Prison Architect you build and design a prison, but you don't have long (unless you turn off incoming prisoners - but that's besides the point) to build a basic prison. After the first 24 hours, which is about 10-20 minutes on normal game speed, 8-12 normal ranked prisoners will come in. They may bring contraband with them, or they may not. It's best to check everyone just in case. After a while, when you build up your prison a lot, you can start to make the prisoners do manual labour, for example, do the laundry and make numberplates. The laundry is the clothes (etc) of the actual prisoners. The numberplates, you can sell for $100 each (last time I checked).If the prisoners don't like the prison, they can start a riot, try to escape and can make your prison get turned over to the FBI of sorts. If your riot goes on for long enough, you loose and the prison gets taken from you. When riots start, you can call in special forces, ambulances, fire engines and extra police. The fire engines don't really do anything at the moment, seeing as fires are so rare that (I would say) 60% of players don't know they exist, and the destruction they can cause.When you're building your prison, you have to keep in mind that you have a daily income, and if you spend more than said income, you will start loosing money instead of getting it. You can also loose your prison if you go bankrupt for too long, but there is a warning grant that gives you a reasonable amount of money to help you. If your income goes into the minuses, you can get it back up by getting new prisoners, selling items and giving the prisoners worse meals, but giving them worse meals can result in a riot or some very angry prisoners.There are three classes of prisoners, low risk, normal risk and high risk. The low risk people hardly ever start fully fledged fights and never need execution. The normal risk, again, never need execution, but can start a reasonably dangerous riot or fight. The normal risk (to my experience) try and escape more often than the low risk. The high risk are the most dangerous, and may need executions, which you can get by making an execution room. These prisoners got into jail for things like Murder. If you're new to the game, I recommend you stay with low and normal. I don't like having high risk, they're too much of a pain.So, even though this game is in alpha, it is worth a look at. Even at the full price of $25, it will give you hours of fun. During sales this game can go down to as low as $10-$15, which is an amazing deal.			",79,21,4,5,17,1,5

								If you ask me how good this game is, I'll tell you.When I bought this game, I couldn't stop playing, I played this title about 54hrs straight in two days. I even missed one final because I forgot what day it was !The game is easy to play, user-friendly, very addictive, simple and yet very deep. All the game mechanics are very well made, and this is tons and tons of fun, planning, thinking, improving, testing ...This game, even though it is not finished at the time I wite these lines, is totally worth your attention if you're a bit patient and like management games.Another good thing is that devs listen to feedback and keep us updated very often (one update per month). They fix bugs and add features until they're satisfied.I won't describe the flaws the game have because I enjoyed it so much that I don't see any worth noticing, or that can't be improved.Have fun !

												This game is quite humorous in its own probably unintended ways.  Despite free food, entertainment, education, medicine, psychologic console, gym, work opportunities and even free camp sites that are regularly groomed by a professional gardener, my prisoners are still suppressed  - until one day I did a shakedown and found 88 jail keys!! Without the keys to heaven, my prisoners became outrageous instead and decided to BBQ themselves - oh well, that's indeed another way to heaven - as the CEO said, ""a lot of people died today, a dark page of the history of this prison"".    But, wait! They were not even escaping with 88 jail keys!!! (￣ε(#￣)☆╰╮o(￣皿￣///) I strongly recommend the developers to introduce religion(s) to the game. Once they understand the whole world is a jail, they will probably just give up escaping and fight with each other instead - or sports, that would do about the same. PS: lesson learnt: do NOT send firefighters into fire, they're not as fire resistant as they look or sound, and they are brave enough to not run away.PSS: I won't tell you i'm updating the review for a badge.

								For an early access game still in it's alpha stages, Prison Architect has a lot to offer. If you have ever been a fan of any Sim City style games where you build your city (in this case a prison!) then this is a game I highly reccomend you try to get your hands on. It offers hours of gameplay currently, and only has room to improve from here. Building a prison and managing it's day to day operations from having enough meals cooked to letting your prisons have family members visit. Chasing escapee's, calling in SWAT for riots, or watching your prison burn to the ground.... there are just so many possibilities. Since I have purchased the game I have seen the numerous updates from the developers pushing out new content, improving old content, and fixing bugs. As far as the team behind this game goes, they really seem to care about their game and the people who play it.Personally, I feel the 29.99 price tag is a little steep if you ask me, so I would wait until it goes on sale to buy this. Thankfully the developer seems to be more concerned with having a good product that more fans get to enjoy than making money so this game ends up on sales pretty often.			",111,7,0,6,9,0,15

								Some wonder, why play a 2D game about constructing a prison? Prison Architect has that magic that keeps you playing on and on. Perhaps it's that you want to do a little more better the next time. You build your first person, all hell breaks loose. Build your second prison, you learned from your mistakes. On your tenth or eleventh prison, you'd have things running like AlcatrazGreat thing about games like these is that they don't hand out a tutorial on how to do everything, just the basics. The joy of playing games is to discover on your own what you could do and what could work and this game does just that. As in it's current alpha state, the game has quite a lot to offer and a lot more features being added in the near future.			",165,24,1,11,13,0,18

Being an early access game there are a few bugs, such as people getting stuck in walls, but that can be easily sorted out by just telling them to move. A few things could be added to the game to make it more managable; a guard shift regime would be perfect! Overall a fantastic game!			",107,6,4,21,13,1,24

								Have you always wanted to be a warden? Well now's your chance, but it's fleeting if you cant control the populace. AMong the biggest things i must advise, if you have Death Row inmates, MAKE SURE THEY GET AN APPEAL, else you will face a 50k fine..... file that under 'lessons learned the hard way'. Also on that list, dont make a jump from 16 to 40 inmates in one go, space it out and e gentle. Helps to have the taser rollout once you get a large population.Positioning is key, and you must ensure the space is used to the best you can. CCTV and Automated doors are very useful, the latter especially to open doors for builders and workers without waiting for a guard to go get it. Additionally, a fence(not perimeter wall until much later) and road gates is helpful if an inmate does manage to escape the building. My experience with the game, albeit limited, is very highly enjoyable, and i recommend this game 10/10			",8,1,0,1,11,0,17

All three games are supported by their creators and their (sometimes dumb) communities, and every release adds something more that continues to bring the games closer to a 1.0 release.This game (as I am writing this) has enough to keep you entertained, but there's no major ""end game"" goal. You can build a prison, sell it, and build a larger prison with money you earned from the last sale. That's it. If you're okay with that, and the game is on sale, I'd easily suggest a buy. If you aren't, wait a few months for a patch or two and look again. These guys will impress you.			",421,69,13,82,92,3,157

								In the words of my Norwegian friend Teddy, ""This game really rustles my jimmies.""..and we're talking about the good kind of jimmy rustling here.  All the nostalgia of the old school SimCity or Tycoon style games wrapped in a modern and hilarious package, the updates only seem to be making it better and I very much look forward to playing this game as it is developed.  Highly recommeneded in its current state, especially if you enjoy the style of game. 10/10, will Prison again!			",92,21,2,21,25,2,16

								Its early access so it still has time to work out its kinks. Its fun making you feel like you have the world in your hands(actually just a bunch of shmos that either killed,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stole, attempted killing/robbery♥♥♥♥♥♥etc), and you can make there life a dream or a nightmare. Help support the gaurds and keep the prisoners in check, or Just watch them go in ANARCHY. I highly recommend this game.....but thats my opinion.			",360,29,10,28,17,1,22

								Nothing supplies a better power trip then making your solitairy confinement as small and dark as possible. Or how about wrangling the issue of escaping prisoners by erecting a huge fence like some anti-immigrant wet dream?Let's not kid ourselves: this game has been in alpha for a long time and I suspect it won't be leaving alpha anytime soon. But ask yourself this: is it really a glitch that all of your staff can't seem to leave the storage room? Or perhaps its an unintentional commentary on the laxness and incompetence of the American prison system?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then learning tricks to build and maintain a supermax prison.After about 3 hours though, you know the basics. Once you spend some time testing, so many another 6 hours. You probably know some tricks.In depth gameplay, good graphics, fluent gameplay. Best prison game here on Steam.8/10			",97,8,1,11,26,1,15

												Prison Architect is a wonderful game, and hands down the best ""Prison Management"" simulator out there. Will you be a strict authoritarian, dealing violent or even lethal punishments to your inmates? Or are you a laid back Scandinavian, who under no circumstances wants their inmates to be treated poorly? However you choose to run your jail consequences will eventually arise depending on whatever kind of prison you wish to build.

												I didn't want to thumbs-down this one, but I'm afraid it has to be. There's just too many bugs.For example, one level in the campaign asks me to increase my prisoners' happiness. It suggests building a Common Room for that, so I do. Then later on, it asks me to build a Common Room with some chairs. I do, but the game then fails to progress. Apparently, multiple Common Rooms break the level.Unfortunately, the game seems to be riddled with this sort of thing. It feels like it should still be in Early Access.It's not a bad game, it's just blatantly unpolished. Because of that, I can't recommend it at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is STILL very buggy. I have fun playing this, but I can't play a cessation without seeing a bug.The campaign works like a tutorial, but still dosn't explain much. I had to wiki half the time and look on youtube. I want this game to work and for all to enjoy, but my take on Prison Architect is this - If you dont mind working with bugs and learning from other sources I would buy. If so, I wouldn't spend the money. I got this during steam sale and kinda wished it was a little bit cheaper because it's STILL not complete.			",16,1,0,3,11,0,3

								This game is good, but it's so slow moving that there's no telling if it will get any better.After building 2-3 prisons, you'll get the hang of the game and all challenge is thrown out the window.  Oh, and don't expect anything crazy when you intentionally destroy your prison by not feeding your prisoners.  You'll be left disappointed.At the moment, I can't recommend this just based on the development speed.  I've been keeping my eye on it and watching each patch, but they're never anything substantial and only amount to:1. Bug fixes2. One new feature (e.g. Alpha 15 implemented guard dogs, and an entire forum post was dedicated to dogs.)These sorts of patches are fine, but they come at a pace of one every 1-2 months** , so one has to wonder how much actual work gets done in the office. Mods are advertised with the Steam Workshop, but unless you want to add more money (grants) or change how the game looks, you'll be disappointed.  I scanned through the prisoner files in hopes that I could change prisoner behavior (Random riots from unstable prisoners, anyone?), but I was left disappointed.I would wait a long time on this one.  At the current pace, the game won't be finished for several more years.  Side note:  This is one problem with Early Access.  This game is potentially very good, and people see that: It has already sold well.  Now the devs are free to take their time, which is great.  But you can't count on everyone to have a strong work ethic when they have no deadlines to meet and they've already been paid.**Update:I had some misinformation in my original review.One to two months was slightly incorrect, but the game has a monthly update cycle.http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/builds.htmlThere has been only one instance where updates took two months, so I apologize for my incorrect statement.Here's the list of new features over the past 6 months:Aug13- Prisoners dig out, punishment settingsOct13- Guard dogsNov13- Mods, staff fatigueDec13- Segregate prison, share mods.(It's worth noting that segregation of prisoners was completely useless at the time)Jan 14 - Shotgun guardsFeb 14 - Rehab programs for prisonersThat is the pace of this game, and it's a fact.  I find the updates to be incredibly slow from a feature standpoint.  Some may disagree, but I find the game to be barebones when taken as a whole.  I am NOT disputing the game's alpha status.  It is definitely that.  I firmly believe the game will be a solid title at some point.  It's just that, considering the rate of development of this title, I cannot recommend purchasing it at this time.			",185,34,2,30,13,2,27

								+ A game with a lot of potential. As its name implies, lets you manage your own prison. You can try various layouts for your buildings and be as nice or as mean as you want to the inmates. You can try to reform them or drive them to suicide/rioting, and the number of guards and the necessary equipment for them will vary based on what you want. In my first prison, riot police, armed guards and firemen ran over the bodies of an immense bloodbath that had broken out due to me generally being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the inmates. In my second one, the most that happened negatively was that a guy got tazed every other day or so, and most of them were on the path to being rehabilitated. There's satisfaction in both approaches.- As an early access player I ran into a lot of bugs with pathfinding and general game slowdown that made it less satisfying the more time I put into it, but this will hopefully be fixed in future patches. The content itself is also there, but lacking in sufficient depth for the time being. Some more explanations would also be useful to make it more evident where certain items work or not. The room system makes everything organized, but it also makes some things confusing where the purpose of a room is more general, i.e. what will inmates use in a yard and not in a common room and vice versa?++ Tazed my ingame self.

ReviewI have had this game for a while now, and it is one of my favorites. It has strategy elements and combat, and you can also build, which sounds somewhat weird for a game, but it is actually really good. You have to build and manage your prison, which after you get a bunch of prisoners can get very difficult. I think of it as a prison management simulation because that is what it feels like, except you get to build your prison from scratch. A big downside though is the price. $29.99 is a bit too high in my opinion for this type of game. But, it is definitely worth it for what you get, hours of fun. Even if you don't like simulation games, you should try this out anyways because it is so much more. Introversion has executed this game perfectly.BugsUnfortunately, this game has had many bugs. When I first got it, it was nearly unplayable, so I didn't play it for a few months until they ironed out most of the bugs. Most of the major bugs have been fixed, from what I have noticed, so it is safe to buy the game now.Overall8.5/10If you like simulation, building, strategy, or management games, then this one is for you. It combines all of those together in an amazing way. I think most people will have fun with this game, even if you usually don't like this type of game. I had to take off points for the high pricetag and the bugs. If this game goes on sale, definitely don't pass up the opportunity to get this amazing game.			",45,5,1,6,23,0,1

								So, i have this game for like, umm, 2 hours and i have like one hour played? Yeah, sounds about right. Well, i was interested in this game since it's announcement, however, i didn't back it back then. And with this purchase, i realized how stupid it was not to back it / preorder it back then. 'Cause this game is absolutely stunning. For a comparison, it's more complex Sim City, but prison themed. When you start the game for the first time, you'll be welcomed with a 10 minute introduction which will show you how does the game system work.

(A tutorial of any consequence is an incredibly rare thing in sim games, one that places you in a moral dilemma even more so.) Even though I have barely scratched the surface of the game, it's not hard to tell that Prison Architect is a labor of love and that the devs are dedicated to delivering an interesting and original sim.

								I played this game for 2 hours last night, and I fell in love with the game straight away! It's such a fun game and the start to it is really fun to do; you get to know how the game mechanics work and a brief understanding of what you are supposed to be doing! This game is in early alpha which means there is a lot more to come. So this game is going to keep getting better and better plus their updating it every single day to check bugs or glitches!I would reccomend this game to any one who likes to control how you want to do things and you enjoy the challenge of building the best prison you possibly can. Plus lots more features you have to find out for yourself! But trust me, it's worth every penny! If you want to save some money, I would reccomend getting it now (1/5/14) for 66% off which is £6.79 or normal price of £19.99!Rating - 10/10			",14,9,0,8,5,0,1

								I was skeptical when I first bought it, but after hearing it was similiar to theme hospital, it was an instant buy. Even now, aside from one or two bugs I feel like the game is already finished and could in theory be released now for the price. Luckily it hasn't and the devs are still working on it. I had fun all the time while playing and although a main menu would be nice, it's fun to start your prison from scratch again and again. I am not  really sure with what they could add too it, maybe a competitve multiplayer in which the more prisoners you holdthe more points you get and you need to beat another prison. But from the current state I would say it's a good buy and if anyone liked theme hospital, they would love this,			",23,4,1,8,13,0,14

								This game is loads of solitary fun. The joys of sending someone to their personal hell for days on end is non-stop greatness. Riots ensue, drugs are used, Shawshanks are created. It's the hollywood movie of prison management. If anyone escapes, punish the rest of the prison with a lockdown that lasts for days, and when the riots come, and they will, bring in the riot police and squash the uprising with lead and electricity. The only thing I wish was a way to use the games electric chair after the initial tutorial. I know it's not my role to decide the life or death fate of my prisoners ,(shotgun shells are pretty fatal, so IDK) but when Frank ""The Shank"" Williams has killed eight of my guards, his time has come. Get it. Make North Korea look bad.			",111,13,4,18,31,2,29

								So, i have this game for like, umm, 2 hours and i have like one hour played? Yeah, sounds about right. Well, i was interested in this game since it's announcement, however, i didn't back it back then. And with this purchase, i realized how stupid it was not to back it / preorder it back then. 'Cause this game is absolutely stunning. For a comparison, it's more complex Sim City, but prison themed. When you start the game for the first time, you'll be welcomed with a 10 minute introduction which will show you how does the game system work. However, it doesn't show you everything, but this is compensated with the ingame wiki, but still, you will have to search for some guides on the internet. But that's just a minor problem as the game is still in the alpha stage. And that's what surprises me at most. I've never seen a game in the alpha stage that is polished like this one. Everything seems to work so far and there aren't any major bugs or glitches. The graphic style of the game is also awesome - it's little bit cartoonish and cellshaded - and i like that. The detail of every single prisoner is absolutely outstanding, too. You can view prisoner's bio, which is impressively detailed and so on. Every prisoner also has a name and traits, so the game gets really personal in this branch. Also with the new update, the riots have been added to the game, so if you won't keep your prisoners happy, there is a chance that your prison will change into a warzone. I also like the building system. Remember how in the games like Sim City, Prison Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon and many other games was the building only a matter of the single click and no waiting? Well in this one, you can forget it. First, you have to wait for the material to arrive, second, you have to wait for the workers to obtain it and unpack it and actually BUILD IT. This improvement adds that realism feeling to the game, and that's how i like it. Well, to end this review - it's hard to judge the game now, in the alpha stage, as the developers can ♥♥♥♥ it up or make it even better that it is right now, but in this state, the game is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME AND YOU SHOULD GET IT!

								This is an enjoyable sandbox game and is very fun and i think it is a very good idea. I think this game is in good shape for and alpha and is very well coded and i can see the team worked really hard on it. There are a few things that would make the expreince much better. I think its quite annoying how fog of war is automatticly checked on when you create a new prison, and that you cant switch it off once youve created it, mostly becuase you dont notcie that its on up until youve already built youre prison. And i think that not having the ability to decide on how many prisoners you want to take in is also an issue, becuase they always come in batches of eight or more, and it makes it very annoying when you only have room for a few more, sometimes they even come in at 24 prisoners at once, even when you dont have that many cells in the first place. Other than those two big issues, i think the game is fun and enjoyable, and that anyone who enjoyes sandbox games should try it out.Here are some of my ideas for content in the game:-The ability to make multy floored buildings-Work camps for your prisoners-Therapy rooms-Pools-A theater for your prisoners to express theyre creative side-And an indoor workout facility			",27,0,0,2,6,0,1

								The game is quite fun. That's about it :D. It kept me busy for hours when I started, trying to figure out how to run the prison without everyone stabbing everything. Once I got that down, money was the next problem, but that gets sorted pretty quick with licence plates. Then from there on in, it becomes a bit of a waiting game for money. Not the worst wait as you can watch your handy work being stable, but does become a bit dull.All in all though it's a decent game, and is worth the money. I think in future this game will become a favorite, but for now it still needs some time. It is alpha after all :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game scratches the sim/management game itch perfectly. If you enjoy games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, SimCity, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Railroad Tycoon, ect.. you will definitely like this game. Don't let the price scare you, if you like these types of games, you will get many hours out of this game. My hours played with this game on Steam does not reflect how much time I've actually put into this game, I first got the game through the dev website early in alpha, most of my hours are on non-steam version. I come back to this game every couple months for over a year it seems like.			",158,22,3,22,65,2,45

								This is an enjoyable sandbox game and is very fun and i think it is a very good idea. I think this game is in good shape for and alpha and is very well coded and i can see the team worked really hard on it. There are a few things that would make the expreince much better. I think its quite annoying how fog of war is automatticly checked on when you create a new prison, and that you cant switch it off once youve created it, mostly becuase you dont notcie that its on up until youve already built youre prison. And i think that not having the ability to decide on how many prisoners you want to take in is also an issue, becuase they always come in batches of eight or more, and it makes it very annoying when you only have room for a few more, sometimes they even come in at 24 prisoners at once, even when you dont have that many cells in the first place. Other than those two big issues, i think the game is fun and enjoyable, and that anyone who enjoyes sandbox games should try it out.Here are some of my ideas for content in the game:-The ability to make multy floored buildings-Work camps for your prisoners-Therapy rooms-Pools-A theater for your prisoners to express theyre creative side-And an indoor workout facility			",27,0,0,2,6,0,1

								The game is quite fun. That's about it :D. It kept me busy for hours when I started, trying to figure out how to run the prison without everyone stabbing everything. Once I got that down, money was the next problem, but that gets sorted pretty quick with licence plates. Then from there on in, it becomes a bit of a waiting game for money. Not the worst wait as you can watch your handy work being stable, but does become a bit dull.All in all though it's a decent game, and is worth the money. I think in future this game will become a favorite, but for now it still needs some time. It is alpha after all :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison Architect is obviously still a beta, and the price point may prove ridiculous to some. However, there is a lot of fun in planning out your prison, learning what is needed and where to put it, and managing all your prisoners. It can be overwhelming, but the more you play, the more you learn what you need to do to maintain control.			",86,25,3,8,13,0,7

								Prison Architect. Well, where do I begin? If, like me, you're quite nostalgiac when it comes to gaming, then the time management, maintenance and building-block type games will be very familiar to you. Remember Theme Park, Theme Hospital and the original Sim City? Well this is an updated version of all of those games set around a prison. And it's been made wonderfully! The level of detail put into this game actually surprised me. The fact you actually have to plumb the water system around the prison as well as electrical cables to make sure the facility is kept running is quite impressive, not to mention all the different rooms and sections of the facility you can actually create in order to make your very own supermax. This game is incredibly fun and addictive and you can easily find yourself hibernating in a darkened room, headphones on and playing this well into the early hours of the morning. If when you first play it, you're put off by failing your first prison, don't let it discourage you. It won't be until your fifth or sixth prison where you actually start to flow into prison building and adding all the essentials and actually having a functioning and beautifully constructed penitentiary. This game is well worth the money and well worth playing if you're into these types of games. I'm glad I bought it and backed it up and I'm happy it has it's own place on my games list.

								I was skeptical when I first bought it, but after hearing it was similiar to theme hospital, it was an instant buy. Even now, aside from one or two bugs I feel like the game is already finished and could in theory be released now for the price. Luckily it hasn't and the devs are still working on it. I had fun all the time while playing and although a main menu would be nice, it's fun to start your prison from scratch again and again. I am not  really sure with what they could add too it, maybe a competitve multiplayer in which the more prisoners you holdthe more points you get and you need to beat another prison. But from the current state I would say it's a good buy and if anyone liked theme hospital, they would love this,			",23,4,1,8,13,0,14

								Although this game is still in Alpha stage, it is really cool. I am not really a fan of tycoons, but this one is really cool.  Making the prison however you like, keeping your prisoners under control, or let them run around. It already has a lot of things, you can play with, and I am sure there will be a lot more when the game is fully released. 'Realistic' mode is cool, but it is taking a long time to build all stuff you want, if you are creative - so I found more enjoyable 'Sandbox' mode, in which you have unlimited funds, so you can build whatever you want, no matter how big or complex it is going to be.

								Hold on, hold on...you're telling me this is in ALPHA? Where are the bugs? Because I've found absolutely nothing that's buggier than a full release game.With that out of the way...Prison Architect is an incredibly addictive game about building and managing your own prison. It's surprisingly open-ended. Following is a list of things you can (but, in some cases, probably shouldn't) do:-Cram a hundred prisoners into a single holding cell with only one toilet.-Replace a prisoner's cell door with a wall while he sleeps, leaving him with no way out besides digging a tunnel.-Place someone guilty of, say, mere shoplifting, in a SuperMax cell.-Place someone guilty of triple homocide in a minimum security cell.-Allow your prisoners to attend AA meetings.-Set all 24 one-hour blocks to work time; your prisoners will never sleep!-Have K-9 units patrol the cells, sniffing for contraband.-Order full-prison shakedowns whenever you want.-Execute them!-Dude acting up? Give the order to freefire. BLOOD! EVERYWHERE!-DON'T TAZE ME, BRO!-Feed your prisoners only one meal a day.-Or zero.-Or twelve.-Kill a particularly troublesome prisoner by setting up isolated supermax cells and setting the supermax's regime to 24-hour-a-day lockup. They will die of starvation after a few days. (Hopefully, the as-yet non-functional electric chair will later expedite this process)-Buy trees for $100, and, through prisoner workshop labor, sell the end products for $800. Better yet, automate the entire process for ludicrous profits!			",99,23,0,61,14,2,31

								I put this game in the same category as the old games like Rollercoaster Tycoon and Theme Hospital. It's all about managing a company and making a profit, only this time you're not trying to make people laugh and scream in your rollercoaster or treating strange diseases. It's about making sure that your inmates are cared for and don't escape or riot.I love this game and I've put about 45 hours in it in only about a week, but I think there are much room for more features and improvements. We can't know what the game will be like in the final version but so far it looks really promising. The game is absolutely playable in its current state and if you like this building and managing a company kind of games I'll gladly recommend you to buy it.			",124,35,2,13,24,1,16

								So with the latest Humble Bundle. I finally got Prison Architect. I was ready for a Theme Hospital like experience. What I wasn't expecting was ""feels"" right off the bat. I mean seriously, that intro/tutorial already makes me question my humanity. I can't really stop that from happening. I had to hover the prisoner to find out that he was indeed in that state because I couldn't beileve the flashing red sign on my lower right screen. Bravo! You got my attention on the very first 5 minutes of the game. If you can continue to make a Single Player story experience like that, you have my full support!			",195,65,5,32,16,2,25

								Prison Architect is a great way to see how difficult managing a prison can be. The more prisonners there are, the more security has to be really developped. Riots, Black market economy, Prisonners' labour, every update brings new features that enhances the gameplay and makes this game so much fun.Building your first prison can be overwhelming, but the games makes a decent job to explain everything in detail and the new grants system is much more ""noob""-friendly and allow you to make a better start.Also, the introversion forum and wiki is top notch, any information can be found there.There's a whole financial aspect in this game too: salaries, maintenance costs, all this for the well being and the good treatment of the prisonners. Speaking of prisonners, every one of them has a personnal file, explaining why they are here, how much time do they have to serve, their mental state, well being etc.Prison Architect is a game where you can spend a lot of time to construct the optimal detention facility. But at the end, there is always something that will go wrong and you learn from your mistakes.A really well polished early access with frequent updates and a awesome dev and production team.

								Best Early Access game I have ever played. The game gets updates each month, and the updates are always major new game elements, not just little bug fixes. The goal of the game is to make a prison as large as possible that easily, safely and efficiently maintains your prisoners with as little rioting and death as possible, this is not an easy task.There is no way to win, but you are able to sell your prison to make your next one larger, more creative and more fun.The modding community is excelent and if you ever get bored with the game you can find a mod that will spice things up until the next update which is usually less than a month away.This game has been constantly updated for 31 months, introversion rocks, you wont get ripped off with this early access game!The lies about the bugs in the other negative reviews are false.... every month the few bugs that exist are patched, and in my time since alpha 13, I have yet to encounter so called ""game breaking bugs""			",89,16,1,3,26,1,13

The early game requires most of the brain power and strategic skills.			",40,0,1,4,10,0,10

												A fantastic game. Utilising all of the typical gameplay characteristics of simulation games. Prison Simulator opens up a little touched theme within the genre. Prison Simulator has enjoyable but challenging mechanics. The game like many other simulators is a game about balance. A close relative to this game would probably be theme hospital. You begin with an empty lot, and a small budget to build your own prison. You can be given grants for opening specialty rooms within your prison.  Building a room requires a minimum amount of furniture/facilities in that room for it to operate as such. Budgeting your prison correctly is a constant care of the player. Having to create the harmony of price and functionality within your prison while growing it for more intake of prisoners (your income) is the game.This game would be recommended for those who enjoy pop culture prison jokes, as well as those who enjoy construction and simulator games in general.

								I wasnt expecting too much when i bought this game, but man, did it hook me! the challenge is there, the freedome to choose a load of ways to conduct business in your prison is awesome and the game has a nice feel to it overall. all i would like to see is the option to plan prisoner-scedules for a week, instead of just a day:) great game, deffinately worth getting in alpha!(the game feels quite finished allready)			",83,6,0,11,4,0,8

								I got some great hours of enjoyment out of this. Track down the wiki because it helps a lot with the current stage of the game. Game is very playable and is one of those ""Why the hell do I find this so much fun?"" kind of games. If you attempt to put any effort into this game you wont realize what is going on around you until your parents file a missing persons report.			",201,28,10,42,22,4,40

								Ok, first of all, buy this game. Ok? Thank you.Now that that's over with I'll tell you what to expect. An alpha game that is more fun to play then countless big budget finished games. My friend bought me this game when it was on sale, and I was pretty hyped because I had seen sjin play it. First, you start off with a bit of cash and a few workers to build the prison which will grow very quickly into something unique. You hire some guards, you get the first few prisoners, build the essentials and wait to get some income from keeping those prisoners. More prisoners, more money. Then come the choices. Do you build massive 5x5 cells for each prisoner with TVs and an en-suite? Or do you cram fifty of them like animals into a small holding cell with only a cold metal bench to sleep on? Not only that, I can choose the exact size of the room, and the exact placement of the bench. Total controll. But there is always the worry of money. The afformentioned 5 star rooms cost a lot, but if you do go the second route, you could risk angering your Prisoners. In a riot, they may break all of your stuff and cost you far more then a single room would have. They could kill someone. The fines could finish your prison off. But these perils make it all the more fun to play. Think minecraft. You want to build something awesome, but you may starve to death. But in creative mode it gets a little boring. Survival gives you that balance. Same in  prison architect, it gives meaning to what you build.I have barely scratched the surface of this game, watch some videos to see more of this amazing lock 'em up.Anyway, buy this game. If you have £20 to spend, this is one of the best ways to. Otherwise, if it is on sale you MUST BUY IT. OK? Thank you.			",84,10,1,7,14,1,10

								Been playing this game quite extensively and I am very fond of it. Has almost everything you could want from a simulation of a prison management.You can choose a small or large map so plenty of options, even then if u choose the large map and feel ""this is too small"" you can research expansions and get even more land and truly get a massive prison going.It is a lot of the little things for me though. Like you get a boost of income for every hour and day that passes without incident. This truly motivates you to keep check on your prisoner and makes you feel happy seeing this income boost increase like a highscore but with meaning.All the different backstories for prisoners, their various personalities or attributes, all the needs they have and the challenge to meet them all is very enjoyable. The programs and work you can have running, seeing the effect of also great fun. While there is already a lot of fun objectives to achieve as you play, I would definitely like to see more of it, because when you start to clear them all up, you find yourself slightly aimless, which is good for some but I would like the chance to fufill more complex or difficult objectives as my prison grows.Another downside is there are still no gangs in the game to my knowledge, but I believe it may be implemented at some point, which will make me feel there is nothing left besides minor tweeks to make this a dream sim game of its theme.This is at least to me, one of the best simulation games I have ever played, it really sucks you in, keep you engaged and invested and even offers moral choices. Will you have death row or will you refuse it? Will you offer parole and if so, how much time off?Not to mention you get a grading system after 10 prisoners have been released, you see the % of chance of committing crime again on each prisoner which gets affected by your choices and what facilities you have. You can decide the amount of punishment on many different things like finding drugs, tools, weapons and even actions like assault or escape attempts.All the modifiers, stats and how you can alter the 24 hour schedule as you see fit, it has so much creative potential so I would recommend this game, especially now on sale, to anyone who likes simulation management games with a prison theme. You won't find a better game in this theme and in my opinion, one of the best sims of all times.			",83,30,0,42,32,2,48

								Love this game to death. The developers are easily some of the best around, and they have turned a great game into a lasting classic. The only minor quibble I have about the game is long-term goals (or lack thereof), but frankly, it's not a big deal. I have a blast simply starting a new prison every time I load the game up, and if I ever do get one running and feel like there's nothing more to do, I never feel bad starting up a new one the next day. (Although, I would enjoy some goals added to keep a persistent save going, and have that missing element.)This is a must buy, and I will buy all of the new games they make if they're anything remotely like Prison Architect in quality and fun. Do yourself a favor, commit a crime and put yourself in prison. You'll be glad you did!Wait, what?			",232,59,1,74,102,4,81

								This is one of the best games I have ever had the privelage of playing! The dark feel to the whole ""choice you get really draws me in. The ""choice"" you have to make as a architect is either Hard Punnishment or Peaceful Reform. And I like that in games, where you decide people's fate, is that too dark to even say? Well, this game is amazing and really shows the reality that prison can be. Tons of fun, but please wait for a sale, because in my opinion its worth $15.00 or $20.00 not $30.00.

												Warning: Game is highly addictive...Wish I would have read that one review sooner...But honestly if you have any doubts about buying this game, let me enlighten you on the fact that your doubts need not even exsist. This game is insanley fun and has some rather hilarious and rage quit worthy moments. I know I held off on getting this game for a few months because I ""wasn't sure"" but I swear to god that was a huge mistake. I've only played 11 hours on this game (as of writing this review) and i'm probably about to go play it the rest of the night, rage on a prison gone wrong, and go restart another one. There are some aspects you really wish they would have informed you about as by time that issue comes up it's too late to reverse it but there's a whole bunch of answers to those issues on reddit and the forums so no worries. Extra Bonus: I just find the grapics cute/hilarious. I love watching a good fight and their fists just fly all over. It's nice to see that the devs really fixed this game up and I can't wait to play it more. 11/10			",15,14,0,6,20,0,7

												I enjoyed it for what I paid for it. I got it on sale for $10. I appreciate the devs staying in touch with their game and not pulling a DayZ. They care. Ingame you essentially are the manager of a prison and need to build it from scratch with a small startup grant. It can be challenging at times to build up your money, but you can successfully jump that hurdle. The gameplay was rather simple. Prisoners enter, some have♥♥♥♥♥♥ some don't. They go do their daily things. You find♥♥♥♥♥♥on them. They go to solitary. This got very boring very quickly for me. There is nothing new that is pulling me back into the game. Perhaps changes will come in the future for me to bring me back in. I am optimistic about this game. Overall, I'd get it when it was on sale if I was you. I do recommend it, and I did enjoy it, it just didn't keep MY interest. However, I see plenty of people who have a fun time playing it, and I feel there is certainly a market for it.  8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game.  It's a well designed and well executed foray into designing and running your own prison. The mechanics are deeper than one might guess at first glance, and there's lots of tools at your disposal with which to either build your dream reform-based prison, or your dream complex of human-rights violations (or somewhere in the middle). I only played for the tail end of Alpha (the last 6-8 months or so); but I can safely say Introversion has been active and engaged with this game, even after making the final push from Early Access to full release. Their monthly Alpha development videos can still be seen on Youtube (along with their funny, self-depricating early alpha trailer that was initially what attracted me to the game).Now delightfully bug-free (or bug-minimal), the full release includes a campaign in addition to the core sandbox-style prison builder we've come to know and love.  The campaign serves as a tutorial to the game's mechanics, as well as giving an overall frame to the ""world"" of prison architect.   While much of the campagin's gameplay is a bit same-y for people who have been extensively building their own prisons, the story itself is compelling and keeps you treking towards the next snippet of story. Having said that, one chapter included gameplay I hadn't actually experienced due to my play style, which was a nice change of pace. For newcomers it is an excellent addition to give some scope of what the game can do.No game AI is without its issues, but the rate at which I find myself cursing my prison staff or wishing something had been designed differently is pretty minimal. The vast majority of issues my prisons have experienced have had something to do with something I've personally overlooked, which is exactly the experience you want to be having. TL;DR -- Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes contruction/management sims. An excellent experience. Well designed. Engaged development team.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Absolutely love this game. One of the best games Ive ever played. I put this right up there alongside Red Alert, Rise of Nations, Half Life and Team Fortress 2. The complexity of the game gives you plenty to do, and with mods added theres a ton of things to do. And whatsmore? There are no limits to what you can build or how big to build the prison. Just for kicks I tried seeing what the limits are: there are none; you can build practically infinite amounts of objects, utilities or staff. You can go as big as the sky if you want. With the Alpha's coming to a close in December, and the game to be released in full, I was hoping for a few extra features in the game itself to allow for mods like, trucks taking a different route into the prison, or multi-floors. Im sure someone will figure out how to manipulate the game code to do that. But for now, I give this game two thumbs way up for its creativity and fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Truley an awesome game, I've spent many hours building my prisons, ensuring every detail is perfect and highly secure, only to watch everything go down in flames and riots as my prison falls apart thanks to a spoon or a lighter... But you learn something everytime, you get better and always have a fresh idea for the next time you want to try a new prison. An instant classic in my book.			",107,20,0,35,19,0,18

								Prison Architect, from Introversion Software, is a game I’ve played an unreasonable amount lately, to the point where I’ve been playing through scenarios in my head of what I would do when I’m in jail (all of them involve become the toughest guy’s ♥♥♥♥♥).The tutorial which is surprisingly amazing and complete. You have a new prisoner for which you need to build some new facilities. All the little figures are little cartoony heads floating above little cartoony bodies with little, detached, cartoony hands holding shivs or batons. But then you constantly reminded by Polaroids that you are in fact running a serious prison which will ultimately keep murderers at bay and occasionally put the worst to death, which you did in the tutorial’s case.The game is fairly well-planned out, though definitely in its alpha as it’s still very buggy. You nominate the rolls of each room and the characters seem to act appropriately, except when my workers decided to go on a smoke break with an indefinite ending.For the small segment on Prison Architect, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/10/11/early-access/ ",256,105,4,31,22,1,39

								The game can be a little finicky at times about how things works eg. Al anon meetings can only cake place during ""work"" hours in your regime which I will admit, I googled it. The game is pretty hard off the bat and unless you have played similar games before (I have not at the time of writing this) your first prison will most likley fail horribly. At the time of writing this the devs release monthly updates for the game with bug fixes, new content etc etc. It gets somewhat easy at your third prison but the game is still very fun.

												SANDBOX:It's fun throwing a prisoner into permanent solitary confinement, stationing 2 armed guards ouside his cell, and then killing him when he gets angry over a lack of a bed or toilet. Would reccomend to any sadist.ESCAPE MODE:Last time I played escape mode, I grabbed a knife in the kitchen and proceeded to shank 15 cooks. Guards responded and were promtply stabbed in the neck. I grabbed a taser and took out an armed guard. Picked up his gun and went on a rampage, killing 200 guards/prisoners before burning down 2 cell blocks and escaping with about 1000 other prisoners in a riot after we killed the responding riot police and firemen.

												I love this game.  No really, I really, really love it.  I have spent hours and hours and hours in sandbox mode just trying to build beautiful, efficient maximum security prisons only for them to burn down when I went to get another drink.  The number of saved, not quite finished prisons in my save file is ridiculous.  I am so very much looking forward to campaigns. That will privide a whole different motivation.  And then there's the new escape mode.  I can see the next 4 weeks of free time just dwindling into a small dot on the horizon.  I won't eat, I won't sleep, I will BUILD. And then, you know, riots, gang warfare, contraband, general messy destruction.Please keep this game going or my life will be meaningless.  Er...more meaningless.  But FUN.

								This game is awesome, definatly buy it and get the name in the game edition if you can spear the extra money, the developers are really dedicated and it shows they have worked hard over the last few years to make this game just amazing, honestly one of the only early access games worth buying on steam (although it is coming out of earlt access in october 2015) this is clearly not another rust, ark, ect. that will live and die in early access infact i can imagine the more feature they bring and they continued work on the game after launch that this game will only gain more of a following if not for only loosing the stigma attached to being an early access game. In short if you like planning, designing, building, this is a game for you also if you like games sutch as roller coaster tycoon, sim city, cities skylines, or simiar games then you will also undoubtedly love this game and sink hundreds of hours like i have into this game.

								I was playing for ages, built a pretty big prison, hired loads of gaurds, and was coming up to having 100 prisoners. Then, all of them decided to riot- they killed 60% of all gaurds, so I then called the riot police to calm it down (who went on to killing the prisoners). The ones who werent killed escaped through the broken door, leaving me with a couple prisoners in solitary and hospital beds full of gaurds and janitors.It took me the next half an hour or so to get back to normal, when another riot occured.10/10, would recommend.

								Prison architect is a unique, different and highly enjoyable game. I personaly have never played a game like prison architect and i can only wish that it came out earlier so it could save me from the boring fps games that i was so acustomed to playing. Prison architect has a unique feel about it. It is relaxing at times but there are moments that really do get your blood pumping (bloody riots). The game is very user friendly and it doesn't take long to get comfortable with the controls and how the game works. In the trailer it keeps mentioning about bugs and glitches etc but i haven't encountered any big ones! (i have encountered a few small ones which were fixable without even leaving the game!)  The game play is great and the creativity is awsome but the best thing for me about the game is watching it develop. Every time i start it up i wonder if there is something new and most of the time there isn't which is understandable, but every so often there is and it makes it even cooler! it could be a big cheange like a new type of gaurd or a small colour change but what ever it is, it makes the game even epicer (i don't think that that is a word but oh well). To sum it up.... AWSOME this game is unique and pure gold, 10/10. There are many games where you shoot stuff but none like this (that i know of). It is a must buy!!!			",256,88,1,17,58,4,39

												SANDBOX:It's fun throwing a prisoner into permanent solitary confinement, stationing 2 armed guards ouside his cell, and then killing him when he gets angry over a lack of a bed or toilet. Would reccomend to any sadist.ESCAPE MODE:Last time I played escape mode, I grabbed a knife in the kitchen and proceeded to shank 15 cooks. Guards responded and were promtply stabbed in the neck. I grabbed a taser and took out an armed guard. Picked up his gun and went on a rampage, killing 200 guards/prisoners before burning down 2 cell blocks and escaping with about 1000 other prisoners in a riot after we killed the responding riot police and firemen.

								This is one of the best games I have ever had the privelage of playing! The dark feel to the whole ""choice you get really draws me in. The ""choice"" you have to make as a architect is either Hard Punnishment or Peaceful Reform. And I like that in games, where you decide people's fate, is that too dark to even say? Well, this game is amazing and really shows the reality that prison can be. Tons of fun, but please wait for a sale, because in my opinion its worth $15.00 or $20.00 not $30.00.

								Prison Architect is fun enough, even in its Alpha stage, that I've already sunk 24hrs into playing it. You design a prison, you take in prisoners and keep them happy, or not. I really like this game for the planning. This game allows you to draw up plans before you build. You can set out your whole architect before the game begins and slowly build your way to a full prison. There is a lot of stuff that is unimplimented yet and the menu designs are a bit difficult to find the items you want, but it's just an Alpha. Oh and riots are a lot of fun, esp when a few prisoners sneak guns into the prison... Ahhh good times.. Good times..			",386,137,2,93,46,4,74

												Loving this game! there are a few things that could be improved..first il start with the negatives..your builders are typical english builders constantly drinking tea and not doing much :Pthe electrics are abit sketchy and doesnt really give u a distance or power output limit so will just cut out regardless of how many capacitors you have around it.I have also noticed that the education programmes dont really work well and only one person out of 25 will pass the foundation course. the only course that gets completed is kitchen safety and parol :P lol To be completely honest i mainly bought it for the building aspect.. which i cant complain too much about i have lots of fun building have uploaded a few prisons too the workshop too.it is a good overall game if you enjoy building managment games and will definatly be worth the money :D Enjoy locking up those weirdos!! orrr be a weirdo and try too escape them dirty screws....

								+ A game with a lot of potential. As its name implies, lets you manage your own prison. You can try various layouts for your buildings and be as nice or as mean as you want to the inmates. You can try to reform them or drive them to suicide/rioting, and the number of guards and the necessary equipment for them will vary based on what you want. In my first prison, riot police, armed guards and firemen ran over the bodies of an immense bloodbath that had broken out due to me generally being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the inmates. In my second one, the most that happened negatively was that a guy got tazed every other day or so, and most of them were on the path to being rehabilitated. There's satisfaction in both approaches.- As an early access player I ran into a lot of bugs with pathfinding and general game slowdown that made it less satisfying the more time I put into it, but this will hopefully be fixed in future patches. The content itself is also there, but lacking in sufficient depth for the time being. Some more explanations would also be useful to make it more evident where certain items work or not. The room system makes everything organized, but it also makes some things confusing where the purpose of a room is more general, i.e. what will inmates use in a yard and not in a common room and vice versa?++ Tazed my ingame self.

								This is a very solid simulation/tycoon game, however it does suffer from a few setbacks. There isn't much in the way of a tutorial, so it might take a few trys before you find your stride. My first prison ran more like a concentration camp, but by the third I had the game figured out. That being said, there wasn't much motivation to create a fourth. Once you've established a prison that can run essentially without any input from you, there is the option to sell the prison and begin anew with the profits. Do this once or twice, of course, and you've really done everything the game has to offer. Still, the same argument might be had for a large majority of the tycoon games out there, so it's not enough of a drawback for me to not recommend the game. Four Stars.			",96,51,1,4,18,0,11

								I'm a fan of builder-sims in general. I think giving players a large set of digital tools and then giving them the freedom to create to their hearts content stimulates higher brain function and makes for high game replayability. Prison Architect delivers a rather unique experience--I can't think of any other prison building games--that's thoroughly enjoyable regardless of whether its your first prison or your 61st. Even better, the devs continue to actively update the game with content, tweaks, etc. I highly recommend giving this game a shot.			",62,11,0,24,13,0,29

								8.5/10For a game so early in the development stages, this game will suck  you in for hours, encouraging you to build the best prison you possibly can. Starting with a quite creepy introduction on the basic mechanics of the game, it leaves you with nothing but some workers, pieces of paper telling you what to do, and a ton of steel and concrete. Get to work!The game slighty guides you on the basic needs and necessities of your prison by giving you goals with grants, accessible through the reports menu. If you manage to get the ball rolling by smoothly following the grants, you will be left to earn money for yourself by holding prisoners, which is definately a not-so-fun option compared to getting money by grants. After this stage, your development will help the prisoners become more comfortable, passive, or even helpful in some cases. This game, being very early in development, is very buggy at sometimes, and can frustrate you if you don't catch it soon enough. The devs are ironing out the game very periodically though, so I am quite sure bugs will be a thing of the past sometime soon. A great game recommendable to anyone, especially with the small price tag and amount of sales on this game. Get out there, beat your prisoners with batons, and make them do the dishes in Prison Architect!			",153,23,0,20,12,0,18

Until I had two weeks off work and I was bedbound. This game has taken over my life.  This game, from the last time I played it, has progressed and grown into such a beautiful, enjoyable simulator. Honestly, if you're on the edge of buying this game - just buy it. It's worth it So worth it.			",314,67,10,29,55,3,22

								At this current time this game is in a early access state as it has been for some time now. I have played around 50 hours on this game so far and can safely say that i will be playing many, many hours on this game. It is highly addictive and is great to be able to make your own prison where you get to map it out, hire your staff, choose in sandbox whether to have low, medium or high risk prisoners. The higher the risk the more money they bring into your prison. You have to be on the ball and plan your prison out quickly as prisoners can quickly riot, smuggle weapons/tools/luxuries and attempt to escape. I had one enjoying but challanging instance where i had 100 high risk prisoners rioting at once, killing all my guards before doing a big break out. At that point i needed to sell my prison to start again. A thing about this game is that in time you will learn from a lot of mistakes but it has great potential and requires minimal graphical requirements to play this game, which i think is great! Awesome game, highly recommend it as it is very addictive. xD			",159,25,0,17,32,0,45

								So when i first started playing this at around alpha 14? i didnt really think much of it and kept having constant riots and such but i kept at it and its become such an addicting game now. its an amazing bunch of guys who make it and they respond to community feedback awsomely and the advancements they have made to the game have completely overhauled the way you play and interact with it again and again with new prisoner AI's, grant amounts and different ways or making money. the game is constantly challanging you to build the 'perfect' prison and i cant stop playing it (have 102 hours at time of writing this) so i reccomend getting it the game is awsome and thats not even including all the mod options for it.

												There's tons going on in this game. You can play it for hours, days, years. But you are always starting over from square 1. There are no other squares. There is no variety- only male, female, normal, cheating, and increasing difficulty levels. The tutorial is long and story heavy, unlike the rest of the game, which is pure sim/building/management. And you can't really fiddlefaddle your way to victory. A lot of careful decisions need to be made.			",185,78,1,43,47,0,22

								This game really deserve all the attention it is getting at the moment. I get flashbacks to Bullfrogs Team Hospital wich was great. This game is a sim on the same track. You start of building a prison and continue with completing checklists with small quest. If you are in to building and micromanagement sims, this is the game for you.Keep in mind that this is still an Early-Access game and have some minor bugs, but very few in my opinion. The control mechanics are also a bit dodgy, but when you get use to them they work.			",19,9,2,17,35,0,11

												   In Prison Architect you build and manage a prison. The game is pretty basic but complete and with nice artwork. There is a short campaign that also serves as a tutorial. The game is not very challenging in itself and seems pretty hard to really mess things up. I also believe that the inmates get ahold of ""contraband"" too easily.   Version 1.0 comes with ""Escape Mode"" where you get to play a prisoner. It's a very fun experience to try to escape from a prison that you built.Rating: What are you in for?

								Summary: A wonderfully created and well thought out game. There is obvious love in this series with the sky being the limit with the type/amount of content this developer could add. I highly recommend anybody interested in creating their own prison, or even thinking about ""hey I need a new building game,"" to give this little gem a shot.Post 8 hour summary: Prison architect is an easy to learn, but harder to master, game that involves delicate manipulation of prisoner populations in order to run a successful and profitable prison. The indie nature of the game is apparent but adds to the charm of this title with the easily animated ""circles"" of characters happily whistle and glide throughout the lengths of your prison in comical fashion. Donot, however, feel like this game will be a walk in the park for even experienced sim users. If you do not quickly address your prisoners needs you will soon learn that beneath the ""friendly"" nature of the game lies a darker system of violence, blood shed, and even death. I mean, who wants to see their favourite K9 get killed in a mass riot?(review to continue)Positive:+ Wonderfully complex prisoner mood/attitude system+ Moderate learning curve with steep learning curve to mastery+ Regular content updates to keep things fresh and bugs minimal+ Graphics are delightfully comical considering the ""dark"" nature of the gameNegative- Certain tools, such as cloning, could use additional work- Worker AI still manages to trap themselves in rooms- Tutorial could be expanded to cover more topics ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hire and fire the staff, manage the finances, rehabilitate (or not) the prisoners. Now for the release you can also attempt escape mode in which you can load up any of the thousands of steam workshop designed prisons and break out.Inspired by all the great sim games of the 90's. A game I would heartily recommend for your steam library and for once at a reasonable price. I look forward to putting many hours into this. Good going guys.Edit - spelling			",190,31,1,59,36,2,77

								Very addictive and fun but after a big time investment you'll find yourself a little burnt out.  It's like this amazing song you want to listen to over and over until you make yourself sick of it.  I guess that's my own fault.  When this happens I step away, wait for the very active dev's to keep pushing new stuff and features, then I jump back in to revisit it.  I've got a lot of hours in it but I left it open to see how my prison would fair overnight many times.  Overall its a great game at a fair price and I'd recommend picking it up.

								Amazing Early Access Game!Here is the summary:Start with an empty plot of land with $30000 (Or infinite money, if you turned on sandbox)Choose your first government grants and start building.Get a perimeter and holding cell, along with required standards (canteen, shower, etc.) up. Bring in prisoners.Now that you have a basic infrastructure, do WHATEVER YOU WANT with your prison. Make it a resort of happiness, a max security box of death, a balanced prison, etc. you can add a death row block too. A great modding system (thanks to steam as well) lets you add more things to do in your game, as once you have a maxed out prison it gets more boring. Mods help fix the boredom. If you want to make it even more fun, you can save your game then start a riot. YEAH! Then, reload your save if you want to still have functioning prison. Or, try to rebuild AFTER the giant riot (extra challenge!)If you go bankrupt, too many people die, or you do have an uncontrollable riot, if you enabled 'failure conditions' you can actually lose the game!Negatives -Even now, there are still some bugs leftEven with mods, once you have built everything, it gets a little bit boring. Overall - 9.5/10-ALPHA 36 NOTE-They have added in gangs! If you enable gangs, they add a huge amount of fun and challenge to the game. Once a legendary prisoner joins a gang and becomes leader, all hell breaks loose. The prisoners will start controlling areas. Your guards can still enter those areas, but you cant edit those areas (e.g. placing objects) until you evict the prisoners, which starts a huge fight! AWESOME!Also, the dev team has added in new rooms and features since my original comments! Buy the game and CHECK THEM OUT!			",13,8,0,1,12,0,7

								Summary: A wonderfully created and well thought out game. There is obvious love in this series with the sky being the limit with the type/amount of content this developer could add. I highly recommend anybody interested in creating their own prison, or even thinking about ""hey I need a new building game,"" to give this little gem a shot.Post 8 hour summary: Prison architect is an easy to learn, but harder to master, game that involves delicate manipulation of prisoner populations in order to run a successful and profitable prison. The indie nature of the game is apparent but adds to the charm of this title with the easily animated ""circles"" of characters happily whistle and glide throughout the lengths of your prison in comical fashion. Donot, however, feel like this game will be a walk in the park for even experienced sim users. If you do not quickly address your prisoners needs you will soon learn that beneath the ""friendly"" nature of the game lies a darker system of violence, blood shed, and even death. I mean, who wants to see their favourite K9 get killed in a mass riot?(review to continue)Positive:+ Wonderfully complex prisoner mood/attitude system+ Moderate learning curve with steep learning curve to mastery+ Regular content updates to keep things fresh and bugs minimal+ Graphics are delightfully comical considering the ""dark"" nature of the gameNegative- Certain tools, such as cloning, could use additional work- Worker AI still manages to trap themselves in rooms- Tutorial could be expanded to cover more topics ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So with the latest Humble Bundle. I finally got Prison Architect. I was ready for a Theme Hospital like experience. What I wasn't expecting was ""feels"" right off the bat. I mean seriously, that intro/tutorial already makes me question my humanity. I can't really stop that from happening. I had to hover the prisoner to find out that he was indeed in that state because I couldn't beileve the flashing red sign on my lower right screen. Bravo! You got my attention on the very first 5 minutes of the game. If you can continue to make a Single Player story experience like that, you have my full support!			",195,65,5,32,16,2,25

								I made two prisoners sit in a shower until they had s3x or fought to the death. Then I proceeded to light the whole prison on fire with just a few short circuits, water, and a spoon. Then I ordered a guard to shoot every prisoner who tried to leave my now broken walls in my prison. After all the manslaughter and hopeless means of escape, I sat down with a cold one and played prison architect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The tutorial/intro sets a pretty dark tone and serves great as motivation to actually play the game. (A tutorial of any consequence is an incredibly rare thing in sim games, one that places you in a moral dilemma even more so.) Even though I have barely scratched the surface of the game, it's not hard to tell that Prison Architect is a labor of love and that the devs are dedicated to delivering an interesting and original sim. The fact that they aren't afraid of making a statement (through game play) sets it even further apart from most modern sims and is both nice and refreshing.			",451,118,17,37,40,7,64

								I played this game for 2 hours last night, and I fell in love with the game straight away! It's such a fun game and the start to it is really fun to do; you get to know how the game mechanics work and a brief understanding of what you are supposed to be doing! This game is in early alpha which means there is a lot more to come. So this game is going to keep getting better and better plus their updating it every single day to check bugs or glitches!I would reccomend this game to any one who likes to control how you want to do things and you enjoy the challenge of building the best prison you possibly can. Plus lots more features you have to find out for yourself! But trust me, it's worth every penny! If you want to save some money, I would reccomend getting it now (1/5/14) for 66% off which is £6.79 or normal price of £19.99!Rating - 10/10			",14,9,0,8,5,0,1

								So, i have this game for like, umm, 2 hours and i have like one hour played? Yeah, sounds about right. Well, i was interested in this game since it's announcement, however, i didn't back it back then. And with this purchase, i realized how stupid it was not to back it / preorder it back then. 'Cause this game is absolutely stunning. For a comparison, it's more complex Sim City, but prison themed. When you start the game for the first time, you'll be welcomed with a 10 minute introduction which will show you how does the game system work. However, it doesn't show you everything, but this is compensated with the ingame wiki, but still, you will have to search for some guides on the internet. But that's just a minor problem as the game is still in the alpha stage. And that's what surprises me at most. I've never seen a game in the alpha stage that is polished like this one. Everything seems to work so far and there aren't any major bugs or glitches. The graphic style of the game is also awesome - it's little bit cartoonish and cellshaded - and i like that. The detail of every single prisoner is absolutely outstanding, too. You can view prisoner's bio, which is impressively detailed and so on. Every prisoner also has a name and traits, so the game gets really personal in this branch. Also with the new update, the riots have been added to the game, so if you won't keep your prisoners happy, there is a chance that your prison will change into a warzone. I also like the building system. Remember how in the games like Sim City, Prison Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon and many other games was the building only a matter of the single click and no waiting? Well in this one, you can forget it. First, you have to wait for the material to arrive, second, you have to wait for the workers to obtain it and unpack it and actually BUILD IT. This improvement adds that realism feeling to the game, and that's how i like it. Well, to end this review - it's hard to judge the game now, in the alpha stage, as the developers can ♥♥♥♥ it up or make it even better that it is right now, but in this state, the game is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME AND YOU SHOULD GET IT! YOU WON'T REGRET, I PROMISE!My verdict as of 2.5. 2014: 99% (-1% because of the short tutorial)			",434,57,12,28,32,7,53

												Definitely one of my favourite games. If you are like me and love strategy games, resource management games, tycoon games, and upgrade games, then this is the game for you. The replay value in this game is insane. I have built dozens of prisons for prisoners with different levels of security and with different goals for my prison in mind but (in my opinion) the best part of Prison Architect is managing your prison. Monitoring the prisoner's needs to prevent riots, assigning prisoners like snitches and ex-cops to protective custody, sweeping for controband, adding security precautions where needed, and hiring guards and staff are all things you can do in Prison Architect. Also, for an added layer of difficulty, there is not an option to have gangs in your prison.			",11,5,0,0,8,1,1

								Promising and already very fun in the current state.Typical tycoon game, for those enjoying the genre it's a must have.Pros:+ A lot of options and choices+ Freedom of playing how you want+ Immersive+ Good balance / difficulty+ Modding (this doesn't interest me but it's there)Cons (advices for the dev):- Badly lacks hotkeys, too much clicking- No storyline or built-in objectives- Could get use of ever more choices, some are not finished (electric chair)- Some bugs around (sometimes items stacks and block each other’s from being removed ; can't remove tunnels at the extreme border of the map)- Had some lags in certain situations (might be linked to above bug)- Staff and Inmates management a bit lacking. Menu not very effective in that regard, clicking doesn't select the profile of the person, etc.- Buy menu (items, walls, ...) needs inside categories (ex. by room for items - in/out door for walls, etc.).- Need more control over workshops and other activities, as well as worker path, and stuff like that.- Positioning of items a bit strange (pre-build highlight unclear regarding to orientation), visuals bugs (doors opening on other stuff)Tbh I could go on and on with stuff ""to improve"" but it's entirely because I love the game and it shows potential and opens all of those great ideas and asks for more.

												Wow! 3 Years it's been since alpha 1. I bought this about alpha 3 and have never regretted buying it once since then. Sure, I haven't put hundreds of hours into it but its loads of fun. This is one of the few early access titles to actually finish and do it well. The V1 is vastly improved since I last played it back in Alpha 30. There is now a fully complete story mode and a feature where you play as the Criminals and esacape on player made maps or your own (Its really fun and unique).Overall fun and enjoyable since the start and this Introversion should be always known as a trustworthy company for this over used early access crap.

								Back in the day I was a huge city builder fan. I loved the old SimCity games where you could focus more on the outline of your city and make everything ”feel” good for you. Than the later games have added plenty of tiny functions that I never really liked that much. The micro management was never really THAT fun there. Prison Architect gives me that awesome feeling that those older city builders did, focusing on building and having fun rather than micromanagement. I can build a prison that have a layout and style that I like. And once you've finished a huge chunk of the prison you can start to micromanage the different sections and rules of the prison and even though I didn't like that in the citygames I love it here! Becuase everything you change have an almost emediate effect on your prison. I also love that this is one of those games that actually keeps getting updated! You get new things and new game rules to play around and the game is even getting a bit harder (and that's a good thing). Truly my only complaint about Prison Architect is the fact that once you've gotten far enough with your build it can be a bit slow. You're prison is safe, you're guard do their job and you keep getting money to advance babysteps forward. And that means waiting for that money you need to keep building. Some time ago you could even let the game run by itself to just get money and not really losing anything for doing so. Overall a great city bu.... prison building game that will bring you hours and hours of gaming fun. Recommended. / Nurgleprobe ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought this game because it was on winter sales on steam. Sincerely, I do not regret this purchase. There are some bugs, like to pipes connection or those awful servo doors, CCTV cameras but you can enjoy the game. Developers should integrate circular auto-save that saves the last 5 days or so, you can then roll-back.It's more a community game than a regular game you can play by yourself.Pros:- Balanced difficulty between missions, management- You do whatever you want on the map, research...- You become an architect only if you build at least 4 prisonsCons:- Pipes, CCTV, servo doors do not seem to work- Some mission are weird and I did not find how to complete them- Lack of tutorial, wiki is too empty- Some menus are not explicit: logistics, deployment...

								Prison Architect has kept my attention as it has been fun to ""build"" the prison, figure out what inmates need to prevent riots, murders, and escapes, while also using different strategies for grins. This is Alpha, but it's pretty solid; There are a few non-intuitive things like Education but overall the experience is great fun. I assume an Early Access game will never make it to GA, so even as an Early Access game, I can recommend it when it's on sale.			",129,34,3,23,13,0,18

								I think the game is very good, especially considering that it's an Alpha. Yes, there's a few bugs, and developement is slow (it is literally one guy doing the programming.) Some people complain about the price, but we are buying the finished product. As a thank you, for pre-ordering it, we're allowed earlier access than having to wait for the ship date. When the game is released, since we already bought it, we'll get the full version automatically. All of which whom Chris, the Developer, is up front with from the very beginning.  If pre-ordering doesn't suit you, I understand. Many games I will not, and have disappointed from time to time, but I believe in IV, and have been a fan since Uplink. Planned to join in long ago since I got the very first newsletter, but other obligations kept me away. Looking foward to the finished product, and watching the game evolve as I enjoy playing it.

								Prison Architecht is one of those games i could play for hours and hours. In its current state i would still say its worthwile, there are many annoying bugs, a lot of which appear to have been fixed, since the ""bug bash"" last month. it is a very playable game and doesent have many game breaking bugs that i have seen. At the moment it lacks an endgame, however its updated monthly (most of the time) and everytime they release a new feature it keeps me going for several hours straight until ive had my fill, where i leave it for the next update.There are features at present which dont get used much it would seem, my prison has never caught fire for example. The prisoners used to tunnel every day to escape. They no longer bother at all. I put this down to how i play. This shows the quality of the game as what you do affects the game in a manner that you would expect - i treat my prisoners right, give them what they need and they dont kick up a fuss unless something changes. its difficulty is interesting. its pretty easy to get the hang of it i would say, one of those trial and error games for a few hours, but its not annoying, your learning and having fun with the game, its not a problem to start over and your prison gets better each time. its quite clever, becuase you only have to expand as much as you want to. The layout of your prison is important, but it doesent mean you cant have a great working prison if your layout is rubbish - its great to run a prison and find out why your prisoners are getting annoyed, so you can fix it. The ways you can do this are numerous. You can just have more guards in certain areas, or armed guards, to really quiet them down. but if you have a good layout, and good schedule for them you dont need to. i would say im pretty good at the game, this has actually led to the game being a bit boring as my prison runs very nicely, and requires little to no help from me. The rehabilitation side of the game, has a lot of promise in it, and is causing me to rethink my prison layout once again, in oder to rehabilitate as many of the prisoners as possible. Some may think its rather pricey, and thats understandable, and with the simple graphics and what might appear to be limited gameplay there is a chance youd be annoyed with your purchase. I followed the game for sometime before buying, so i knew more of what to expect and i wasnt dissapointed. You will probably find yourself playing for a large stint at first as its quite addictive. You will soon grasp the game and play it more efficently. Eventually you will hit the early access wall where you wait for new features to come out. this for me at least, is the trend of early access games. I have confidence the endgame portion of prison architect will round off the game very nicely, but until then, i am content with the monthly updates. If you dislike early access games for being incomplete, this is no different, its not finished, but if you like strategy/simulator games you will enjoy this for many hours before you hit the ""wall"" i talked about, the other thing is that this early access model allows for more playability, as you often have to change aspects of your prison each time there is a new update. i got the game around the tunnels update. after that was the dogs, and now the budget and rehab stuff. Overall, if you like sims and strategy games even in its early access form its worthwhile. To score it is tricky, as im expecting the game to be finished eventually, which leads me to the score of 7/10, in its completed state i imagine it to be an 8 or even a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I enjoyed expermenting to create optimal buildings, rooms and planning configuration. The game is really worth buying and while it still lack some depth I still strongly recommand.I wish there would be more room in the game for some kind of crazy prisons relying on exploited mechanics, maybe something like using fear or propaganda to increase hapiness or organizing smuggling routes to make money.

								This is a fantastic game.  I didn't use an explanation point because it's just a fact.  I've put in my hours on this and any game ever made in the - sim-city / civilization / building & simulation genre since the originals Civilization & SimCity on a Mac SEII.  This game is so simple, and yet unrestricting, that it comes out as an absolutely wonderful piece of gaming which will inevitably stand the test of time.Of course, there are always things you as a gamer would like to see added; the top of my list for desired features is being able to set an area within the prison as ""Shared Only Between Low & Medium Security"" etc.  as opposed to the current functionality of Low OR Medium OR High OR Shared.  Additionally there are a few glitches still in the program wherein workers, guards, etc. end up grouping together and not doing much of anything.Outside of these, this is a must experience for any true gaming afficionado.  Here's a prison of mine :)  http://i.imgur.com/wrv6K8o.jpgPS - It turns out forestry can be a nice side income when you're already in the prison business!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison architect is your regular build and sruvive game with very intersting setting aka building perfect prison and keeping inmates safe and calm. Game is of course in early access so it will definetely change and evolve so keep that in mind.Tutorial - I really like the idea to make it something more like intro and letting player get immersed with whole prison setting, But for now I feel like creators had interesting idea but let it go and it feels lackluster. The tutorial part is too shallow and confusing and the story is too short. This can be much more interesting, especially with follow up in form of story driven missions/scenarios.Gameplay - considering this is work in progress I'm very satisfied in the way how the game works. So there is a nice UI with prison planning, clone tool. The AI works fine and gets job done for majority of time, be it prison personel or inmates themselves. Graphiscs are basic, quite clearly protrating everything with some artistic feeling.There is one major issue I have - you can build too nice prison without any challenge by chaining various projects that doesn't require any prisoners. I feel that game should have slower buildup with lower funds at the beginning so you have to put some compromises, instead having it all. My 2nd prison got to 100 capacity with absolutely no problems - no riots, escapes and no difficulty. Too easy too fast.I like the idea to make some inmates unique with various hidden perks and having nice background story and even graphics. Yet I think it's prisoners ""psychology"" that should be the major feature. As much as it's fun to have big prison full of inmates operating flawlessly I'd love to have more micromanagment of various prisoners(and guards), that react differently to cookie-cutter treatment. This will not only make game much more challenging but also each playtrough will be more unique with most favorite and hated personalities.The game is currently in great spot, easily worth the purchse already and it's really interesting to see and experience how it developes.

												Prison architect is fun. The main game mode is, as the title suggests, being a prison architect. However, you can also be a prisoner in a megaprison of the computer's design. At first, I thought the game was insanely hard. I had a bunch of criminals waiting on the sidewalk while I tried to make a dorm room with no cash at all. Over time, however, the game got easier. The money I got from the inmates flooding in meant I rarely had to worry about bankruptcy. I expanded my prison to house hundreds of inmates, including dozens of super-maximum security prisoners, and added doctors, guards, and more cooks so the prisoners stopped dying of starvation, fights, and wounds inflicted by guards. This was going swimmingly until I realized that more than 40 prisoners had escaped through a tunnel, causing me to get fired. This game has a ton of options for how you want to run your prison, such as a single concrete depressing building or a expansive grassy enjoyable paradise. You can do whatever you want with this game. 10/10.			",35,1,1,3,14,0,6

												Great game but buggy. Certain game mechanics need more feedback or explanation in-game. The campaign explains some things, but leaves some frustrating details out (I can't have 2 power stations next to each other for what reason?).			",6,2,1,2,8,0,3

								A rather compelling sim game which initially looks simple but the deeper you delve in the more there is to it. An easy going open ended style has you try to get grants based on how you wish to run your prison, gaining half up front while the other half comes when you complete the objectives. A bit of a steep learning curve and sometimnes your mistakes are not easily fixed. I restarted a few times once I realize dmy mistakes weren't worth correcting, once you understand the flow of the game and make sure you understand th reqs for the rooms and how some of the slightly more complex items work you will begin to construct your mega prison or clubhouse for felons, either way. Got this on sale for 5 bucks, great deal. For 30.00 I may wait for a few of the bugs to be worked out. The ONLY complaint I have was when the vehicles on the road stalled out when prisoners were in the road and after several days of trying to tget them to move I realized I will just have to start over, I am truthfully not that disappointed to start off and make one even better.

								Prison architect is a game that allows you to play out your wildest dreams and submit your wildest nightmares upon unsuspecting inmates. You are the designer, builder and warden of a prison where you get to control every aspect of the prisoners lives from the food that they eat, to when they get to take a sh*t to the kind of punishment they'll receive when they sass one of your guards. You have complete control and the power is in your hands to either create a peaceful rewarding prison that encourages rehabilitation, or a nightmarish hell-hole where your prisoners are restrained at all times in a tiny cell and fed through a hole in the door.

								Prison Architect is a very cool Sandbox game. [WARNING!] IT IS JUST IN ALPHA, SO DONT GET MAD FOR BUGS IF YOU BOUGHT IT ! As i said, it is only in Alpha stage, but a LOT of progress has been done. So, you start with a road, bunch of workers, and a field, that your prison will be on. You (atleast should) start with a holding cell for your first peeps, then you build a canteen and a shower. Then you can start to build individual cells, and then a yard, and then a visitation room and i could go, and go, and go with those thing but it would be so long, that it would took so much time, and nobody likes such long reviews. Anyway, the game lets you put in your custom prisoner. YES, you can even create Gabe as i saw that someone sent his apply, and he will be in-game after the next update. You can find lots of cool prisoners. There is even Snoop Dogg, CJ from GTA:SA and lots of cool prisoners. This game could really suck your time. We shouldn't care for the bugs ATM because it's just Alpha and we know that they'll eventually fix 'em.+Really addicting+Very Cool+Not complicated (well, it is but only a little bit)+Graphics are cute+You can put in custom prisoners-Bugs (As i said, it's only Alpha, so we shouldn't care about them)-The music in the background feels like... Like it's just not there-Sometimes, if you don't pay atention, your prison could be a giant mess.Overall : 9/10[Alpha overall, if they release the full game i might change it]			",118,9,2,8,10,2,11

Early Access Review
								Prison architect is your regular build and sruvive game with very intersting setting aka building perfect prison and keeping inmates safe and calm. Game is of course in early access so it will definetely change and evolve so keep that in mind.Tutorial - I really like the idea to make it something more like intro and letting player get immersed with whole prison setting, But for now I feel like creators had interesting idea but let it go and it feels lackluster. The tutorial part is too shallow and confusing and the story is too short. This can be much more interesting, especially with follow up in form of story driven missions/scenarios.Gameplay - considering this is work in progress I'm very satisfied in the way how the game works. So there is a nice UI with prison planning, clone tool. The AI works fine and gets job done for majority of time, be it prison personel or inmates themselves. Graphiscs are basic, quite clearly protrating everything with some artistic feeling.There is one major issue I have - you can build too nice prison without any challenge by chaining various projects that doesn't require any prisoners. I feel that game should have slower buildup with lower funds at the beginning so you have to put some compromises, instead having it all. My 2nd prison got to 100 capacity with absolutely no problems - no riots, escapes and no difficulty. Too easy too fast.I like the idea to make some inmates unique with various hidden perks and having nice background story and even graphics. Yet I think it's prisoners ""psychology"" that should be the major feature. As much as it's fun to have big prison full of inmates operating flawlessly I'd love to have more micromanagment of various prisoners(and guards), that react differently to cookie-cutter treatment. This will not only make game much more challenging but also each playtrough will be more unique with most favorite and hated personalities.The game is currently in great spot, easily worth the purchse already and it's really interesting to see and experience how it developes.

								(Review of the Alpha version)It's an interesting managment game.There isn't any scenerarios currently but they certainly will be added later.The graphic style isn't that bad, and the sounds of the game are well made (especially when you zoom-in to hear the sounds of your prisoners).There currently is a lot of bugs, which may annoy you a lot (when builders can't find path to build something, even if there  obviously is one) but once this will be fixed, and once more stuff will be added to improve realism, i am sure this game will be an excellent choice for any managment games lover.If you do not want to buy it know, keep an eye on this game at least.

												I love this game. I've spent dozens of hours trying different variations of prisons to optimise efficiency. Personally i love the riots, fights and great escapes conducted by in-mates. There are some irritating bugs but not game breaking. One example is workers or staff getting stuck between walls or clipping edges. It's like the game doesn't know what to do with the worker/staff so they just sit there till you sack them. You can always employ more staff. I expect more features and bug fixes by the time it is released. This review is written for Prison Architect Alpha version 16.Update Alpha version 28 / 27 Dec 2014:After tracking this game for a year the developer is still contantly releasing improvements and patches to previous issues. I've logged nearly 90 hours into it and still find it extremely fun to build my prison and then watch the inmates and staff do their thing. I loved shaking down the prison and seeing what kind of contraband will be found. I found an inmate collecting 22 spoons and he wasn't even trying to escape. Watching your prison burn down is also hilarious. The community /steam workshop also bring out mods which help improve the functionality and aesthetics of the game which is a big plus. I think PA is very playable in its alpha build and you should definitely pick up this game this Christmas!Update 7 October 2015:It actually left early access! 11/10.			",498,118,13,79,52,2,75

Until I had two weeks off work and I was bedbound. This game has taken over my life.  This game, from the last time I played it, has progressed and grown into such a beautiful, enjoyable simulator. Honestly, if you're on the edge of buying this game - just buy it. It's worth it So worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Solid entertainment and great value for money. Very addictive. This game will steal many, many hours from you.However.. despite all the great things that can and have been said about this game, remember it is an alpha. There are bugs. Lots of them (more than 3000, according to the latest alpha release video). I haven't experienced crashes or corrupted save games or anything like that, but sooner or later you will run into bugs that are really annoying. Like the fact that garbage dropped in a jail door tile will keep the door open at all times, and because the game doesn't recognize drops in a door tile, the garbage will never be picked up by a janitor. Imagine what a permanently open jail door can do for a prison. So yeah.. stuff like that..The UI isn't great, and it's obvious that the more new features the developers add, the more cramped and unintuitive the UI gets. It really needs an overhaul to be efficient. But it's an alpha, so maybe it will get one at some point.There's little to no guidance for new players to introduce them to the game mechanics. All it offers is a useless tutorial where you build an electric chair, that isn't really used for anything in the actual game. If you want to know what the various buildings does (what purpose they have) you have to look it up on the wiki. For end game players there's a distinct lack of feeling of progress. The tech tree is pretty small, it doesn't take long to max everything out.But, having said all that: buy this game. It's great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I LOVE this game, these are the reasons why-The updates are so often-For an Early-Access game it is one of a kind-It is difficult and easy YOU decide-The Gangs and contraband make it very difficult yet more in depthThe things I've learned-There are a lot of criminals-Guards enjoy being shanked-Prisoners can just walk in with a knife, some alcohol and some drugs and nobody asks questions-I do not want to go to my prison its more of a concentration campThings that need to be added-Easier to use Intelligence Panel-More reasearch options and more members of staff-more types of guard including the Correctional Emergency Response Team who are armoured and have only batonsThings that need to be fixed-Guards and Priosners being stuck on doorsOver all this game is very good.Nyu			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really great time consumer. It's great for those who like designing and creating things while also having to deal with the needs of society.The artstyle for both ingame and with cutscenes looks intriguing and interesting, and plenty of challenges to keep you occupied.The prisoners in this game will usually try their hardest to screw you over, going as far as shoving power drills up their rumps after being escorted to reception.The only real complaint I would have is the regular price, $30 is pretty pricey for this kind of game, so i'd reccomend buying it when it's on sale. But even then, the game does live up to it's expectations.			",95,2,0,5,15,2,0

												As a huge sandbox genre lover Prison Architect has been on my to-play list for quite some time, and I wasn't disappointed after getting it. It's literally what it claims to be - you are an architect of a prison, with the added pleasure of getting to manage it as well. One would think that there is only so much you can do with such an idea, but in this game it has been executed really well so far.I honestly did not expect what this game actually offers from it. Apart from a few silly problems the mood and psychology of each individual prisoner in your prison are a very nice touch. Some are more troublesome than the others (and you don't usually know that right away, you have to learn it throughout the gameplay) and some may be something like ex-law enforcement and that will make them get in trouble with other prisoners a lot should they not be watched at all times. Unhappy prisoners obviously cause trouble, and that includes the need to see their family, sleep, entertainment, comfort, so on, but even greatly unsatisfied they will be hesitant to do anything if you put armed patrols around them. Or snipers. That creates a great variety of ways in which your prison can be ran - Do you want to have a luxury Swedish prison with bacon and eggs for breakfast every day or would you rather be in charge of a war prison where your prisoners don't even have beds? It's all there.Your prisoners will also make greater efforts to escape if they feel unhappy in your prison, while, if you treat them well, they almost can't be bothered to do so. They will take the opportunity if the door is open, but can also attempt things like digging tunnels, or even causing riots. It is essential you design your prison well, because a strategic placement of things like main entrance, armoury or door-control systems actually matters in case things go really bad. You can also assign patrols, put metal detectors in chokeholds, instal phone taps, all sorts of things to ensure your prison is secure and contraband-free (because your prisoners will attempt to smuggle it in A LOT).There is also a campaign mode but there is not a whole lot to it, really. There is a story going on that one could be interested in but it didn't really catch my attention that much; it's basically a tutorial where you learn how things work. I, myself, just stick to the sandbox.The game obviously has its flaws, but it's constantly getting improved and it's already more than I expected from a would-seem-simplistic sandbox game. I'd say that if I can get 50 hours into just sandboxing and placing walls around without any purpose then somebody had to do something right.			",83,7,9,1,5,0,7

												Almost feels likes it should be in early access there's so much polishing needed to be done. Nonetheless, a satisfying game with a story that expresses the two competing models of crinimal justice, the retribution/deterence and the medical model, mostly competently. Something almost laughable if it wasn't so tragically accurate was that there was no regulation whatsoever on the placement of family cells and nurseries in female prisons. Whatever your view on criminal justic, you cannot be putting completely innocent, vulnerable children so close and at farily easy access to dangerous convicts. C'mon world.			",49,15,0,26,14,0,20

												Want to explore the morality of the prison industrial system? If so, this game is for you! Don't want to get into the issues of for-profit-prisons? That's fine too! Design your prison to be efficent with the goal of rehabilitating criminals... or just go all out cruelty with ""tough on crime"" tactics! The choice is yours! Fortunately, the premise of Prison Architect is matched up with well designed strategy mechanics which challenge you to expand your prison as your budget grows. Reinvest those profits to make even more profit! Or just go all out with sandbox mode where you have unlimited funds. One thing of note, you might want to watch some basic tuitorals in order to figure out how some of the UI works. Simple things like building foundation instead of walls to make an ""indoors"" area might not be obvious when you first start playing. Other than that, Prison Architect is fantastic!

												Good fun startegy/simulation type game. This isn't your simple minded Theme Hospital though. There's a shed load of gameplay to be found in what is a suprsingly deep prison simulator that has everything from simply housing prisoners and taking care of their basic needs, to reforming them with an effort to subside re-offending.Play through the campaign to begin with to get small but helpful story that acts as a backdrop to help you learn the ropes. It's a tad more than your typical tutorial but is arranged in such as way to not have you feel like you are being inundated with detailed systems. After that go wild in an open sandbox starting with a small prison and ramping it up to a large one containing multiple levels of security and a crazy amount of staff who are all unique and required to assist your prisoners and prison itself function.

Prison Architect ReviewSimualtion and tycoon game based on prison.Prison Architect is a must-have in your Steam library. I absolutely love games with the ""Play God"" like style. It means you control everything and manage everything. It also is unbelievable how fun it is to create riots, fire and commotion inside your own prison. Especially if you've built it yourself. You hire staff, you tell them what to do, they do it. Guards, riot police, doctors, dog handlers, firemen, managers, workmen, gardeners, janitors and all that jazz. Brilliant game and a must have, yes, it's in Alpha and contains a few little bugs but the game is playable and very enjoyable. Thumbs up to developers!I love this game so much that I have infact, to support the developers, bought all of the developers games and bought the expansion for Prison Architect so I can have myself as a prisoner in the game.

								This is by far one of the most updated, well-made games I've seen in a while.  The creators frequently fix bugs and are constantly adding the new stuff that modders put in.  They listen to the community and the game is simply SUPER moddable if you know how.  I would recommend this to anyone.			",52,10,0,2,10,0,18

								Love this game to death. The developers are easily some of the best around, and they have turned a great game into a lasting classic. The only minor quibble I have about the game is long-term goals (or lack thereof), but frankly, it's not a big deal. I have a blast simply starting a new prison every time I load the game up, and if I ever do get one running and feel like there's nothing more to do, I never feel bad starting up a new one the next day. (Although, I would enjoy some goals added to keep a persistent save going, and have that missing element.)This is a must buy, and I will buy all of the new games they make if they're anything remotely like Prison Architect in quality and fun. Do yourself a favor, commit a crime and put yourself in prison. You'll be glad you did!Wait, what?			",232,59,1,74,102,4,81

								A fantastic game for when you are bored of actually concentrating whilst gaming.However, I would not pay £20 for this game.  I got it externally for about £5 which was far more reasonable.  There is nowhere near enough content for it to be worth £20.  Until it is on full release I would not buy it unless you find it cheap elsewhere.			",51,0,1,2,9,0,4

								I have become a huge fan, I have always been a fan of simulation games especially all out builders like this For an early release game I am amazed at the quality this is already the mechanics just FEEL right it feels balanced and feature full with plenty to do to manage your population. It has a real nice dificulty curve making it easy to step in and dificult to manage at scale (just as a game should be) overall it has become one of my favorites to play even with it being early access I do have a few things that I wanted to note these are by and large little items figured this would be an avenue for communication they are at WORST annoyances and probably already in the development packagesThings they could fix:1) Some building bugs (Thing like builders getting stuck can make the game a bit frustrating)2) Dead body removal process overall annoying a bit more so one game (I had a firefighter die in a fire on the road blocking traffic with his body and truck never leaving so blocking further emergency vehicles)3) Power generator not being able to be tied into the same grid (this is a mechanic not a bug fix) this totally confused me for a while not knowing that plugging two into the same grid results on both shutting down Overall the game is highly recommended by me its a tone of fun and really looking forward to the next patch to see what more they bring!

												Iv'e almost completed the campaign (and it seems to be a tutorial, a very good one that had me laughing a couple times) and it is wonderful. i've not played the pre release and picked this up for 33% off. All i can say based off of the campaign is that there is an incredible amount of things that you can do to run your prison and that it should be hugely considered where you will build buildings (so that everything runs a lot quicker and smoother). Im really new to this game, only played about 3 hours or so but i cant wait to start sandbox and the other game modes because you honestly will never truley know what the prisoners are up to (unless u do a good ol shakedown. As i said im new so this review is based off of my short experience. Pick it up, buy it, do it NOW....NOWWWW			",54,9,0,5,10,0,20

								I acquired this game without really knowing too much what it was I was getting in to. What I got was an oddly thought-provoking sim/management game that leads you through a fairly brutal introduction to the prison system, then follows it up with a game that presents you options in surprisingly subtle shades of gray. Your best intentions of providing your prisoners with a fair quality of life and a prison experience must be balanced against the need to handle more and more prisoners, and a finite amount of money to pay for it. Sacrifice the quality of prison life at your peril as unhappy prisoners are more likely to re-offend, and cause disruptions to prison operation. Run out of money and you are in real trouble. The game is incredibly clever in this regard making each and every choice one that impacts the next and you can quickly snowball to failure rather than successfully walk the tightrope of keeping your prison functioning at peak efficiency.

								So, this will be my third review of this game as it has developed and since we have received the announcement that it won't be in Alpha come October, I think its time for an update. I would just like to say that this game, is the only game that has kept my faith in Early Access alive. The developers have been amazing with on-schedule, monthly updates accompanied by videos that are HILARIOUS to watch. Anyway onto the game...Prison Architect, the name says it all, you build a prison. Simple no? No...Game play 8.5/10Its a sandbox game so there are really multiple ways of playing the game with several starting options to increase or decrease ""difficulty"". However, starting out brand new you have minimal cash and must work your way up from the ground. Worrying about everything from walls to food to Bubba getting a chance to speak to his mom, I was definitely unprepared when I opened my gates to prisoners for the first time with a small holding cell a kitchen and some showers. And that was before they added advanced contraband scripts, traits that allow prisoners to maul your guards with ease and gangs. Needless to say the game play is amazing with so many more factors to worry about other then surrounding some Sims with walls. And while Prison Architect is rather hard to ""fail"" if your prison gets to out of hand, say bye bye to your prison.Graphics 10/10Ok, the graphics aren't super high end amazing, but ♥♥♥♥ you I love that simple♥♥♥♥♥♥ Basic sprites with minimal animations but I find it classic, nostalgic and endearing.Sound 6/10Soundtrack is nothing special, simple sounds for certain things like building and vehicles but you aren't walking around talking to your prisoners anyway, you're watching them from above like a god.Replay value 9/10For me, this game is mainly about the replay. Your first prison is going to suck, hopefully it will make you some money however because you can sell it once you reach a certain point in the game, and have that cash to build a new one. So unless you want to just keep renovating the same prison and slowly grind away for cash, its the only way of getting a larger prison. Particularly in Alpha I found this game highly repayable due to the monthly updates with new toys, but I doubt it will drop much as a finished project.			",62,12,0,21,10,0,14

								Prison Architect is a very detailed game with a very creative aspect, The only thing that is bad about this game is that it has a lot of bugs in need of fixing e.g. workers have trouble getting through the doors, the workers stugle to place cables and pipes and they get stuck on walls too.But this game does have everything a prison would have including shower rooms, a yard and even an electric chair, and you can really see how much a player cares for his prisoner by adding design and detail.

Early Access Review
IntroductionPrison Architect is a game about creating a prison (well duh). You must build all of the offices, all of the cells, water and electricity lines, and hire staff! The game at first may not seem complicated, but when you first play it... wow do things change! You start out with a clever tutorial that puts you in the place of a prison that is already built, but you must build an execution building. There is a short storyline to the tutorial, but it does not transfer over to the normal game after. CustomizationAs of the time writing this review you are given eight different options when creating your prison.Size - You are given the options small, medium, and large for your prison size.Fog of War - You will not be able to see into your prison where you do not have guards or CCTV camerasContinuous Intake - Prisoners will arrive every 24 in-game hours You can disable this in-game later.Generate Forests - Trees will generate on your land. You must clear these before building.Generate Lakes - (Experimental) Will generate lakes on your land that will block construction.Generate Buildings - Random deserted buildings left on your land. You may use this as you wish.Failure Conditions - You will lose the game if you let things get too bad, like riots, bankruptcy, too many deaths or escapes, etc.Unlimited Funds - Sandbox mode! You can spend as much money as your heart desires, and you do not need to worrySteam Workshop is integrated. I have not personally tried it, but I have heard that it is fantastic and has a great modding community!You can build your prison however you like it! I'm not going to tell you what you can or cannot do, as that is part of the fun of the game! Look up prison architect timelapse videos to see what you are able to do in the game!GameplayEvery prisoner has their own status. Some require drugs, others just want freedom and wanting to talk to family. Some want to just play games, eat, sleep, or exercise. You can fulfill all of these. You can choose to keep your prisoners happy or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. If they get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, then they may try to smuggle spoons or forks out from the cafeteria. They may start fights when in the yard or when taking a shower. Some may try to escape, attacking your staff. You'll have to call a riot police if things get out of hand.When building your prison you are given several materials to build with. You can make concrete and brick buildings. There are a variety of different floors you can build with. You have different objects like Staff Door, Large Prison Door, Prison Door, TV, Bed, Table, Chair, and even more (There's a plus button on the menu to show more items). You have to hire your own staff. You start out with the Warden, Chefs, Guards, and Builders. To unlock more staff, your warden must research other people, who then may research other people. An example would be the warden researching the foreman. Then the foreman would research the janitor. Now you can clean up your grimy floors. Electricity and water don't come from no where, you must connect the power consuming objects to power supplying utilities. You start out with one power generator and one capacitor, which increases the amount of power you can supply to your prison. You use electric cable underground to connect different parts of your prison together. Water supplies are also fulfilled by a water pump, large pipes, and small pipes. There is also a planning function, which will allow you to sketch on your prison and get an idea on how your prison will look. This is a very important feature if you want to make sure your prison works good.Something you should nowWhile this game is very fun, it is still in Alpha! There are quite a few glitches and bugs that may make your game unplayable. The things for me have been builders not wanting to build things, the game saying there is no route to the object they are in fact able to get to, and prisoners getting stuck in solitary. I do have a working save, however, and it is very fun.Should You Buy It?I highly recommend this game, as it has so much to offer! And with it being in Alpha, there are many new features to come! Look past the bad side of the game, and enjoy it!Now I'll stop talking and you go play this game!			",65,5,1,3,10,0,3

(u know like ones in Norway where you would ask to be checked in..All those work, you can choose how you want to run your prison, game gives you nice freedom of direction you are gonna run your facility..Lots of rooms, objects, staff.. connecting doors, cameras, remote control (like redstone in Minecraft ;) ) Even tho it's alpha, there's a lot to do in game, prison labor, education programs, high,med,low risk prisoner blocks, staff management, patrols and just looking at your ""ant"" colony function is quite interesting and satisfying..And who can leave riots out?? :D Contraband and misbehavior keep you and your staff on your toes.I sometimes save the game, then try to encourage a riot just to see how it will unfold, test your security, watch mayhem, fires, panic and destruction! if it's too devastating, just load to last save ;)Those were all pros, only cons for now would be performance issues (not optimized well, my macbook pro retina get really hot even tho it has very high specs..) didn't try playing on windows yet..of course there are bugs and some facilities, objects, staff etc don't work yet, but they will soon.Regular updates and change notes videos for every one show that devs care and are working hard to make this awesome game into a fully functioning 1.0 one day..Bottom line, if you love building, management, simulation games and prison stuff; and have patience to go through alpha, beta stages, then you will love this game and you should buy it! Development is going the right direction.I will add that it has a lot of tiny cool stuff hidden in the game and you realise it's actually much more fun than just a prison building game.. it has it's own character.I bought it as a part of a bundle, but would love to name one of the prisoners myself! :D (you can buy this as a dlc, but it's not cheap :/ )			",67,9,0,5,14,1,11

								Great game, even though it is still in early alpha stages, it is still a good game to pass the time while having good entertainment. There are some improvements that can be done, but I'm not going to judge the game by that due to it being in early development. I simply cannot wait to see what they have in store for us in the future.The mod support for this game is great, it is linked to the steam workship and is quite popular, I'm sure there are mods on the internet for the game, but I haven't really looked, so it is worth a shot.I highly recommend this if you're into creating huge advanced prisons to punish those who break the law, dealing with the social and economic problems that come along the way, which just makes it a hell of a lot more fun.The awesomeness of deploying armed guards and K9 units in your prison, watching as they stalk your prisoners, watching their every move. Ordering random shakedowns, just to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your inmates, but to help keep your prison secure, because we don't want a prisoner having the ability to stab one of the guards with a spoon now do we?

								This birds-eye view game offers a lot of variety of differant ways to make a realistic functioning prison (all whilst still keeping an eye on your money). From laying down founations to setting up a electonic security system this game always kept me enjoyed all whilst still givivng me challenges to overcome and make my prison a safer and more efficant place. I would highly recommened this game to any of my friends and especailly to those who love the building type of games (excluding minecraft).The original price I bought it for was £25 which I thought was a bit expensive for what it is but I believe the price has gone down. If you ever get this game always remember, never let bob the custom made prisoner (custom mad, theres another cool feature) go near the other prisoners!			",20,5,0,8,3,0,7

No seriously since I was kid I wanted to be nasty prison warden that torture and treat inmates so drasticly bad they think twice before commit crime again.So as you see this game holds particular interest for me :DWhen I build my first prison it was disaster I had no clue what am I to do (partialy coz I think my self above any stupid tutorials) half of inmates escaped almost imidiately (well now we know why there are walls around prisons do we!?!). After going trough tutorial I set to build the cruelest,meanest prison out there that it will put CAMP 22 (north korea) in shame.My cells were small, food break was one time day for 1h (sadly cannot be shorter or it would be 5 min) meal quality and variaty was low, shower was once day and shortest time in confinement was 48h (for possesion of luxurious goods) inmates had well deserved 4h of sleep and rest of day was either work or lockdown. On top of all that armed guards were alowed shoot on sight all the time. And you know what? My re-offend rate was 2%. 2%!!!!! I mean NO prison in world have that! So yes this game taught me one thing. I would be GREAT prison warden!Now as games go if you like building strategies with loads of micromanagement this is really for you.It has all the goodies and devs made several lovely updates to it as well as steam workshop is booming with mods.I havent had so much fun with building strategy since SimCity 2000.WELL DONE!Verdict  9/10  ",166,30,5,22,23,0,17

								Don't confuse this with the abysmal ""Prison Tycoon"" series. This game is still alpha, but it's getting updates monthly and already is highly playable. You build and manage a prison. How you do it is up to you, from left-wing utopia to right-wing hell hole. I'm usually aiming for the latter while somehow drifting towards the former. Oh well, that's what happens to me in most games with moral choices.The graphics are fine and do their jobs. The biggest downside are controls and the cluttered interface. Building cell blocks is unnecessarily tedious. Since the game gets improved with every patch, it is safe to assume that that we haven't see it nearly at its best yet.Highly recommended for everyone who likes tycoon games and The Sims.8,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison architect is your regular build and sruvive game with very intersting setting aka building perfect prison and keeping inmates safe and calm. Game is of course in early access so it will definetely change and evolve so keep that in mind.Tutorial - I really like the idea to make it something more like intro and letting player get immersed with whole prison setting, But for now I feel like creators had interesting idea but let it go and it feels lackluster. The tutorial part is too shallow and confusing and the story is too short. This can be much more interesting, especially with follow up in form of story driven missions/scenarios.Gameplay - considering this is work in progress I'm very satisfied in the way how the game works. So there is a nice UI with prison planning, clone tool. The AI works fine and gets job done for majority of time, be it prison personel or inmates themselves. Graphiscs are basic, quite clearly protrating everything with some artistic feeling.There is one major issue I have - you can build too nice prison without any challenge by chaining various projects that doesn't require any prisoners. I feel that game should have slower buildup with lower funds at the beginning so you have to put some compromises, instead having it all. My 2nd prison got to 100 capacity with absolutely no problems - no riots, escapes and no difficulty. Too easy too fast.I like the idea to make some inmates unique with various hidden perks and having nice background story and even graphics. Yet I think it's prisoners ""psychology"" that should be the major feature. As much as it's fun to have big prison full of inmates operating flawlessly I'd love to have more micromanagment of various prisoners(and guards), that react differently to cookie-cutter treatment. This will not only make game much more challenging but also each playtrough will be more unique with most favorite and hated personalities.The game is currently in great spot, easily worth the purchse already and it's really interesting to see and experience how it developes.

If you are a fan of Dwarf Fortress or love spending hours finely tuning an incarceration machine then you will not be disappointed with Prison Architect.			",91,13,0,12,11,1,35

								All was working well in my maximum security prison until one day Paul Barton arrived. Paul is: Extremely tough (can withstand many beatings and even a taser shot), deadly (can sometimes kill a man with one punch) and fearless (not intimidated by armed guards). One day Paul met with the three armed guards and his therapist. The session can't have gone well because Paul decided to end the meeting early by putting all three armed guards in the morgue and injuring his therapist. Paul has now been moved to an isolated area and has been placed in supermax, permanent solitary.10/10 would bring in more Pauls to spruce up the prison			",15,1,0,2,4,0,8

								Its a pretty good game in my opinion. They are still adding alot of stuff and i wish there was more to do, because i mean you try your first time, 100 people leave and kill each other you quit, retry and the same thing happens. you repeat that for like 4 times untill you have it down then your done. So it kinda depends on the new updates for a longer gameplay.			",132,24,0,25,20,0,11

												This game is a most definently worth a purchase if you ask me, I like the way you can either play as the police or as a prisoner, it has really comical stuff that happens in game such as some of the prisoners are made by the community and you can find some pretty funny things if you play for a bit, Build your own prison and test it in escape mode, or download other peoples prisons off of the workshop and try and escape from them.

								(Review of the Alpha version)It's an interesting managment game.There isn't any scenerarios currently but they certainly will be added later.The graphic style isn't that bad, and the sounds of the game are well made (especially when you zoom-in to hear the sounds of your prisoners).There currently is a lot of bugs, which may annoy you a lot (when builders can't find path to build something, even if there  obviously is one) but once this will be fixed, and once more stuff will be added to improve realism, i am sure this game will be an excellent choice for any managment games lover.If you do not want to buy it know, keep an eye on this game at least.

												Started playing this game a while back, began very glitchy and quite frustrating at times, but as the alpha grew and grew, the game became loads of fun and full of opportiunties for both large success and great failure. Overall I love this game, and I probably play it most out of all of my games. It has come a great way from where it has started and never seems to let me down when I'm looking for a challenge, or browsing the steam workshop just to find a prison I can download that looks like a turtle. One bad thing about this game though is it can be very difficult to start out playing if you have no clue what you are doing and/or have no help, youtube does help a lot though in that case.  11/10			",42,1,1,5,9,0,3

												I was recommended to try this game by friend. And rightfully so. There's so much to do, so many ways to build (or fubar) a prison. By turning on all variables sense of chaos and impending doom is always constant when prisoners are about to kill eachother, stuff, rioting or something else disastrous... Fires break out and random stuff keeps on happening always challenging and forcing to make decisions... When each prison build is different, inmates are random and random things occur every now and then it's very unique game experience each time. You just wondering when you will do too much mistakes and end up being prisoner yourself, trying to break out from the very prison you build...Only small downside is that rarely pathfinding gets confused and in few occasions it's been nigh impossible to clear/fix certain areas when game claims it's ""too dangerous"" to fix it - but doesn't give a hint WHY it is too dangerous to do so... Luckily those things happen really rarely and are bypassable with little thinking and tinkering.This is addictive, big, fun and very satisfying game to play, definitely recommended!

												So is Prison Architect fun to play? Well I believe it is once you have got in to even though the game is not with out it's flaws a rough gem if you will, some will love it and carve it out to be the shiny gem it is meant to be others will scoff at it and throw it back for ever being the dirty dingy gem is long to escape. The game has a lot of potential and is quite deep in the building of your prison even with it's simplified graphics that add a nice charm to it that will excited some and put others off. We even get to play as an inmate trying to escape getting in to fights etc, if we want from our very own prisons or even any ones prison who has been uploaded to the workshop if you want to.Pros --Graphics have a nice charm being simple-Building and running your own prison -Being able to try and escape your own prison-Story is quite good in game-Seems to have a lot of depth the more you play it-police Dogs-can get very bloody stopping riots or even causing them if your the one fighting-quite an easy interface to use when building etc once you got use to it-A lot of information give about your prison and inmates etcCons --Graphics very simple-comes across a bit more complicated then it should (But thanks to being able to pause and speed up as well as 5 campaigns/tutorial works well)-only 5 campaigns would like more since they seem a good quality  -Can get a bit boring waiting for some things to build (but has speed up time is in as as mentioned above so is not as big of negative as it could be)-Big prisons lag a little not much but a littleSo all in all a good game that is right for some but not others.Well here is a link to a video I did reviewing this game if you want more information below -

								Very fun game with typical 'city' building elements.positives - Once you understand the concepts, pretty easy to keep expanding and growing. - fun elements when you've 'obtained' all the capabilities like locking down the prison, sending prisoners you don't like to solitary, etc.- balance is pretty good. Didn't have to restart while trying to figure out first round, was able to adjust as I went. Might be easy for some, but made it fun for me.cons- in-game tutorial doesn't teach you much. Had to search the web to understand how to play.- some wierd mechanics (bugs?) where prisoners don't go where you expect during yard & shower time.			",75,44,0,15,21,1,9

												Prison Architect is totally addictive to play, planning your prison, making sure everything runs smoothly and dealing with all the dangers in between. Gangs rise up and will cause you to react with armed guard or more so. Design the perfect prison with the game having a fantastic stylistic graphic style, a wicked little soundtrack and runs as smooth as butter. There is tons of depth to the game and tons to get stuck into, highly recommend.

												I love this game.  No really, I really, really love it.  I have spent hours and hours and hours in sandbox mode just trying to build beautiful, efficient maximum security prisons only for them to burn down when I went to get another drink.  The number of saved, not quite finished prisons in my save file is ridiculous.  I am so very much looking forward to campaigns. That will privide a whole different motivation.  And then there's the new escape mode.  I can see the next 4 weeks of free time just dwindling into a small dot on the horizon.  I won't eat, I won't sleep, I will BUILD. And then, you know, riots, gang warfare, contraband, general messy destruction.Please keep this game going or my life will be meaningless.  Er...more meaningless.  But FUN.  ENDLESS, CAPTIVATING FUN.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have just finished my first prison. I started with a minimum security wing followed by a medium security. I then moved on to a large max security wing. This went well untill i started reveiving max security prisoners, and forgot to stop receiving max security prisoners. Instigated by a legendary prisoner, the carnage spread to the rest of the prison. The legendary prisoner was killing guards left, right and center with his kung-fu while a horde of max-secs broke into the armory and armed themselves with shotguns. I called in riot police, paramedics and gave my armed guards permission to open fire.  Many died that day. The storm has now passed and I have created a super-max building dedicated to the most insane who enter my prison and everything is running smoothely.10/10 would shakedown again.

								I love Prison Architect! I stumbled across it one day while browsing the store, and simply thought, ""Meh, this is dumb. It's not even complete yet!"" A month or so later, one of my friends got is, and he let me play a little. I LOVED IT! As soon as I got home (really, I hadn't even taken off my shoes yet) I ran down to my computer, then bought, installed, and started playing the game before you could say ""Prison Architect"". I honestly think this is a very nice Alpha phase game, so there are still some bugs, but the graphics and sometimes pure hilarity of this game make it worth buying down to the last penny.

												Very fun game. You have all the tools to find illegal items, to punish prisoners or to make them somewhat happy with all reabilitation programs. Nice and simple graphics, easy to install mods. Doesn't judge you if you haven't fully completed tutorial and went straight to sandbox, because it says to you whats wrong in prison and it's (most of the time) easy to find how to fix it and it gives you time to do so. It's not kind of those real time strategies when game says something is wrong and it's already too late to fix it, unless you're expert on it. Also, while playing I saw a lot of fun things happen, for example prisoner sleeping handcuffed near his pickaxe and he was smilling :DSo yeah, but there are also some flaws, for example on some places game feels unfinished, for example it's too little of explanations on buildings and things you can build, but there is a mod which brings all information from official wiki to the game and it doesn't feel like something is off. Also I spent like a few hours when I finally find out why my prisoners can't make beds, this wasn't written any in game, but I found it on official wiki (before installing mod). So you may stumble upon some things which feels not finished or smth, but overall this game is awesome simple indie realtime strategy.One more thing, it's to expensive for it's price, so get it on sale. It's nothing new after like 10 hours of gameplay, so only thing that will make you play will be that you'll want to sell your prison and build another, bigger, greater, safer etc.			",114,17,4,8,48,1,12

								At this current time this game is in a early access state as it has been for some time now. I have played around 50 hours on this game so far and can safely say that i will be playing many, many hours on this game. It is highly addictive and is great to be able to make your own prison where you get to map it out, hire your staff, choose in sandbox whether to have low, medium or high risk prisoners. The higher the risk the more money they bring into your prison. You have to be on the ball and plan your prison out quickly as prisoners can quickly riot, smuggle weapons/tools/luxuries and attempt to escape. I had one enjoying but challanging instance where i had 100 high risk prisoners rioting at once, killing all my guards before doing a big break out. At that point i needed to sell my prison to start again. A thing about this game is that in time you will learn from a lot of mistakes but it has great potential and requires minimal graphical requirements to play this game, which i think is great! Awesome game, highly recommend it as it is very addictive. xD			",159,25,0,17,32,0,45

								The tutorial sucks, but don't do what I did and give up on the game for awhile because of that issue. The game doesn't take too long to figure out and is worth it as a charming and addictive building game. It has few bugs for early access, though it needs polish (including simple things like grammar). The one thing I've noticed so far as a problem is that your own success tends to lead to a less interesting game. I suppose this may be true of other 'build' games as well, but I've noticed it more with this one. Hopefully there will be more challenges added in, but either way it's a neat little concept that is well-executed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you get bored you can always just start a prison riot. Mods add more features into the game as well. Management of prison not too complicated and neither is the construction of prisons themselves. Not the best game ever but it's still lots of fun to play. Would rate 8/10 overall.			",27,4,1,7,16,2,8

								Great, addicting game. My only problem is that every time I try to get my staff to do something, they go there and just walk away. For example, there was a riot, and a few people died. I have made a moruge and there is a herse outside my prison, but none of my staff is doing anything, even when I specifically command them to. Also my guards do not guide prisoners to their cells on most occasions. For that reason, that the AI is quite unresponsive.			",24,3,0,2,3,0,1

								Great game, even though it is still in early alpha stages, it is still a good game to pass the time while having good entertainment. There are some improvements that can be done, but I'm not going to judge the game by that due to it being in early development. I simply cannot wait to see what they have in store for us in the future.The mod support for this game is great, it is linked to the steam workship and is quite popular, I'm sure there are mods on the internet for the game, but I haven't really looked, so it is worth a shot.I highly recommend this if you're into creating huge advanced prisons to punish those who break the law, dealing with the social and economic problems that come along the way, which just makes it a hell of a lot more fun.The awesomeness of deploying armed guards and K9 units in your prison, watching as they stalk your prisoners, watching their every move. Ordering random shakedowns, just to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your inmates, but to help keep your prison secure, because we don't want a prisoner having the ability to stab one of the guards with a spoon now do we?

								I am currently playing the game during Early Access. The game doesn't normally crash or anything, but it does feel incomplete. You get to do lots of things, but at the end of of the day there isn't any real reward. I did also took a gamble buying it at full price so that has been the biggest let down. II don't think the game is worth $30 or so much, but if the game was in the $10-$15 it would totally be work all the money.			",225,9,7,10,19,1,21

												SANDBOX:It's fun throwing a prisoner into permanent solitary confinement, stationing 2 armed guards ouside his cell, and then killing him when he gets angry over a lack of a bed or toilet. Would reccomend to any sadist.ESCAPE MODE:Last time I played escape mode, I grabbed a knife in the kitchen and proceeded to shank 15 cooks. Guards responded and were promtply stabbed in the neck. I grabbed a taser and took out an armed guard. Picked up his gun and went on a rampage, killing 200 guards/prisoners before burning down 2 cell blocks and escaping with about 1000 other prisoners in a riot after we killed the responding riot police and firemen.

								Absolutely love this game. One of the best games Ive ever played. I put this right up there alongside Red Alert, Rise of Nations, Half Life and Team Fortress 2. The complexity of the game gives you plenty to do, and with mods added theres a ton of things to do. And whatsmore? There are no limits to what you can build or how big to build the prison. Just for kicks I tried seeing what the limits are: there are none; you can build practically infinite amounts of objects, utilities or staff. You can go as big as the sky if you want. With the Alpha's coming to a close in December, and the game to be released in full, I was hoping for a few extra features in the game itself to allow for mods like, trucks taking a different route into the prison, or multi-floors. Im sure someone will figure out how to manipulate the game code to do that. But for now, I give this game two thumbs way up for its creativity and fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is an enjoyable sandbox game and is very fun and i think it is a very good idea. I think this game is in good shape for and alpha and is very well coded and i can see the team worked really hard on it. There are a few things that would make the expreince much better. I think its quite annoying how fog of war is automatticly checked on when you create a new prison, and that you cant switch it off once youve created it, mostly becuase you dont notcie that its on up until youve already built youre prison. And i think that not having the ability to decide on how many prisoners you want to take in is also an issue, becuase they always come in batches of eight or more, and it makes it very annoying when you only have room for a few more, sometimes they even come in at 24 prisoners at once, even when you dont have that many cells in the first place. Other than those two big issues, i think the game is fun and enjoyable, and that anyone who enjoyes sandbox games should try it out.Here are some of my ideas for content in the game:-The ability to make multy floored buildings-Work camps for your prisoners-Therapy rooms-Pools-A theater for your prisoners to express theyre creative side-And an indoor workout facility			",27,0,0,2,6,0,1

								The game is quite fun. That's about it :D. It kept me busy for hours when I started, trying to figure out how to run the prison without everyone stabbing everything. Once I got that down, money was the next problem, but that gets sorted pretty quick with licence plates. Then from there on in, it becomes a bit of a waiting game for money. Not the worst wait as you can watch your handy work being stable, but does become a bit dull.All in all though it's a decent game, and is worth the money. I think in future this game will become a favorite, but for now it still needs some time. It is alpha after all :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Prison Architect scratches that itch that was left behind by roller coaster tycoon.  It's wonderfully simple. You build a prison. How you manage that prison is entirly up to you. Want to build the prison out of hell, you can. Someone smuggled in a cellphone, Guess he's not seeing the ligt of day anytime soon >:D. Or you can be more forgiving. Both ways offer different chalenges. Be advised it's still only alpha build right now but with the recent update there has been a lot of improvements performance wise. However it's rather stable. I haven't had any crashes, the ocasional bug, but it's still in it's development cycle. Most AAA games get released with more bugs stil present. Also, DOG AI (apparantly that's a selling point for AAA games these days).I recommend this game, it's not everyone's cup of tea but it sure can be entertainig.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Promising and already very fun in the current state.Typical tycoon game, for those enjoying the genre it's a must have.Pros:+ A lot of options and choices+ Freedom of playing how you want+ Immersive+ Good balance / difficulty+ Modding (this doesn't interest me but it's there)Cons (advices for the dev):- Badly lacks hotkeys, too much clicking- No storyline or built-in objectives- Could get use of ever more choices, some are not finished (electric chair)- Some bugs around (sometimes items stacks and block each other’s from being removed ; can't remove tunnels at the extreme border of the map)- Had some lags in certain situations (might be linked to above bug)- Staff and Inmates management a bit lacking. Menu not very effective in that regard, clicking doesn't select the profile of the person, etc.- Buy menu (items, walls, ...) needs inside categories (ex. by room for items - in/out door for walls, etc.).- Need more control over workshops and other activities, as well as worker path, and stuff like that.- Positioning of items a bit strange (pre-build highlight unclear regarding to orientation), visuals bugs (doors opening on other stuff)Tbh I could go on and on with stuff ""to improve"" but it's entirely because I love the game and it shows potential and opens all of those great ideas and asks for more.

								Prison Architect is just a fantastic game. At the beginning taking out grants and building a basic detention centre can be very easy, but you have to make sure that you think of all the factors that could affect your prisoners. One wrong move and you may go in the red.You have to gradually expand your prison, instead of allowing tons of prisoners at once. For example, if you have maximum security prisoners, you cannot accept them all at once in the beginning, because of how the prisoners will react to the little you have in the prison at the beginning, and you have to make sure that you accept prisoners at the right time, or they will just riot.The variety of the rooms and programs the game has is just phenomenal in this alpha stage, all the extra activities and programs the prisoners can do and you can expand on really makes the game never get boring.I highly recommend this game, especially in this stage of development where you can see all the new rooms and interactions being added into the game, because I think that many more things are to be added into the game.

								This is a very solid simulation/tycoon game, however it does suffer from a few setbacks. There isn't much in the way of a tutorial, so it might take a few trys before you find your stride. My first prison ran more like a concentration camp, but by the third I had the game figured out. That being said, there wasn't much motivation to create a fourth. Once you've established a prison that can run essentially without any input from you, there is the option to sell the prison and begin anew with the profits. Do this once or twice, of course, and you've really done everything the game has to offer. Still, the same argument might be had for a large majority of the tycoon games out there, so it's not enough of a drawback for me to not recommend the game. Four Stars.			",96,51,1,4,18,0,11

Treat them bad however and you will be tormented with constant riots, and a blood bath as your armed guards you set to 'shoot on sight' kill 90% of your prisoners.

								Good fun, addicting and regularly updated. Something a lot of other games (mostly early access) need. Some of the workshop conversion mods make the game just that more interesting if you ever feel you need something a tad different.Its a tad pricey at 20 euros, more than I would comfortably pay for an early access game, but its 100% worth getting in the sales, in which it participates regulary.Graphics-wise, its not exactly next-gen crysis-beating stuff. but it is well polished. You can lose hours in it very easily, and if your one of the people who doesn't mind playing something that isnt bleeding edge graphics but is a solid game, this one is for you.8/10, would be 9 if the price was better.

								This is a good game. GOOD not great. I first got the game and played it for about 1 week practically non-stop, then realised the annoying things about it, Awful texture bugs like refridgerators that sit out in the middle of the floor when you want them on the wall, stupid patrol times, when you set a patrol route half the time the officer on it is taking a break so to get an officer on it at all times you need like 4 officers on the same route, and not to mention the lazyness of the construction workers. I have had a wall sit there and ask for it to be demolished or removed multiple times and only find out that the only way to get rid of it is to destroy an entire building. This is overall a good game, but for all the bugs it has $30 is not the right price. I felt stupid after buying it only to see that one week later it was only $10. maybe they should keep it that way until they fix it up. The review says yes but by that I mean BUY IT IF IT IS ON SALE!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's tons going on in this game. You can play it for hours, days, years. But you are always starting over from square 1. There are no other squares. There is no variety- only male, female, normal, cheating, and increasing difficulty levels. The tutorial is long and story heavy, unlike the rest of the game, which is pure sim/building/management. And you can't really fiddlefaddle your way to victory. A lot of careful decisions need to be made.			",185,78,1,43,47,0,22

												Very fun game. You have all the tools to find illegal items, to punish prisoners or to make them somewhat happy with all reabilitation programs. Nice and simple graphics, easy to install mods. Doesn't judge you if you haven't fully completed tutorial and went straight to sandbox, because it says to you whats wrong in prison and it's (most of the time) easy to find how to fix it and it gives you time to do so. It's not kind of those real time strategies when game says something is wrong and it's already too late to fix it, unless you're expert on it. Also, while playing I saw a lot of fun things happen, for example prisoner sleeping handcuffed near his pickaxe and he was smilling :DSo yeah, but there are also some flaws, for example on some places game feels unfinished, for example it's too little of explanations on buildings and things you can build, but there is a mod which brings all information from official wiki to the game and it doesn't feel like something is off. Also I spent like a few hours when I finally find out why my prisoners can't make beds, this wasn't written any in game, but I found it on official wiki (before installing mod). So you may stumble upon some things which feels not finished or smth, but overall this game is awesome simple indie realtime strategy.One more thing, it's to expensive for it's price, so get it on sale. It's nothing new after like 10 hours of gameplay, so only thing that will make you play will be that you'll want to sell your prison and build another, bigger, greater, safer etc.			",114,17,4,8,48,1,12

												Prison Architect offers an incredibley in depth game. Not only do you need to build a secure, Well thought out prison you have to take in to account of and plan for the tiny details from guard patrol routes to drug rehabilitation programs.Run the prison with an iron fist and expect riots.No kitchen and expect your prisoners to slowly starve to death.Educate the prisoners and help them become fully functioning members of society less likely to re-offend. Build all the key elements of a prison, cells, solitary, visiting rooms, kitchens, workshops, classrooms and much more.Sim-type games are always overlooked,Within the first few minutes of playing, The cartoon-like prisoners and environments set you up for what you think will be a fairly lighthearted game but the first few tutorial levels soon contrast this and turn fairly dark (you need to build an execution chamber).There are cut scenes of a fashion covering with plenty of swearing in the dialog (hence the age 16 rating).The soundtrack is also well suited with atmospheric music kicking in at all the right times in the missions.By this point you already know if this game is of interest to you.It's a rare simulation game.

												Not since Tropico, and Dungeon Keeper, has pain and suffering been so much fun. Watch in horror as your ideas for a safe, clean, well-equiped facility are replaced by a terrifying fortress of squallor and oppression as you struggle to keep your budget in the black. Give into temptation, and quell that disgruntled mob by hiring armed guards who crush complaints under the jackboots of tranquility. Laugh the first time you give the ""weapons free"" order during an uprising and watch as your guards simultaneously solve the rioting and crowding problems. And then feel bad because you are a monster. Also be prepared for a never ending stream of spoon murders throughout your prison.After 4 years this Early Access gem has finally hit the big time. The only bad thing, is that by departing Early Access, the average quality level of EA has dropped.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was recommended to try this game by friend. And rightfully so. There's so much to do, so many ways to build (or fubar) a prison. By turning on all variables sense of chaos and impending doom is always constant when prisoners are about to kill eachother, stuff, rioting or something else disastrous... Fires break out and random stuff keeps on happening always challenging and forcing to make decisions... When each prison build is different, inmates are random and random things occur every now and then it's very unique game experience each time. You just wondering when you will do too much mistakes and end up being prisoner yourself, trying to break out from the very prison you build...Only small downside is that rarely pathfinding gets confused and in few occasions it's been nigh impossible to clear/fix certain areas when game claims it's ""too dangerous"" to fix it - but doesn't give a hint WHY it is too dangerous to do so... Luckily those things happen really rarely and are bypassable with little thinking and tinkering.This is addictive, big, fun and very satisfying game to play, definitely recommended!

												Warning: Game is highly addictive...Wish I would have read that one review sooner...But honestly if you have any doubts about buying this game, let me enlighten you on the fact that your doubts need not even exsist. This game is insanley fun and has some rather hilarious and rage quit worthy moments. I know I held off on getting this game for a few months because I ""wasn't sure"" but I swear to god that was a huge mistake. I've only played 11 hours on this game (as of writing this review) and i'm probably about to go play it the rest of the night, rage on a prison gone wrong, and go restart another one. There are some aspects you really wish they would have informed you about as by time that issue comes up it's too late to reverse it but there's a whole bunch of answers to those issues on reddit and the forums so no worries. Extra Bonus: I just find the grapics cute/hilarious. I love watching a good fight and their fists just fly all over. It's nice to see that the devs really fixed this game up and I can't wait to play it more. 11/10			",15,14,0,6,20,0,7

								This game is wonderful sim game that keeps getting better with each update. It has great humor and level design flexible. If you're a fan of sim city genre games this is must to own to round out your collection. The only issue I have at the moment is it is very hard to not ""fail"" at managing a prison. Riots, murder, escape and general disorderal prisons are a given seemly no matter how you design your prison. Then again it would be pretty boring without any action.			",78,15,1,14,12,0,6

								I made two prisoners sit in a shower until they had s3x or fought to the death. Then I proceeded to light the whole prison on fire with just a few short circuits, water, and a spoon. Then I ordered a guard to shoot every prisoner who tried to leave my now broken walls in my prison. After all the manslaughter and hopeless means of escape, I sat down with a cold one and played prison architect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Best Early Access game I have ever played. The game gets updates each month, and the updates are always major new game elements, not just little bug fixes. The goal of the game is to make a prison as large as possible that easily, safely and efficiently maintains your prisoners with as little rioting and death as possible, this is not an easy task.There is no way to win, but you are able to sell your prison to make your next one larger, more creative and more fun.The modding community is excelent and if you ever get bored with the game you can find a mod that will spice things up until the next update which is usually less than a month away.This game has been constantly updated for 31 months, introversion rocks, you wont get ripped off with this early access game!The lies about the bugs in the other negative reviews are false.... every month the few bugs that exist are patched, and in my time since alpha 13, I have yet to encounter so called ""game breaking bugs""			",89,16,1,3,26,1,13

												Definitely one of my favourite games. If you are like me and love strategy games, resource management games, tycoon games, and upgrade games, then this is the game for you. The replay value in this game is insane. I have built dozens of prisons for prisoners with different levels of security and with different goals for my prison in mind but (in my opinion) the best part of Prison Architect is managing your prison. Monitoring the prisoner's needs to prevent riots, assigning prisoners like snitches and ex-cops to protective custody, sweeping for controband, adding security precautions where needed, and hiring guards and staff are all things you can do in Prison Architect. Also, for an added layer of difficulty, there is not an option to have gangs in your prison.			",11,5,0,0,8,1,1

												I absolutely love Prison Architect! When I first saw it on 'early access' I didn't think I'd like it. But when it was on sale I decided to give it a shot, and I'm absolutely glad that I did. Yes, there are some performance issues, especially FPS when you have more than 1,000 prisoners, but Introversion has been working on the performance and making improvements.There's also a bit of a learning curve in the beginning, but you can watch videos on YouTube to help you with your initial design - from there you can use your imagination and learn from your mistakes.Catch PA on sale and buy it if you enjoy sim games - you won't be disappointed once you learn the basics! Also, the player made mods are fantastic and add a new level of enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really good management game. You manage all aspects of a prison, from the rooms layout, electrical grid, and water distribution, to prisoners schedules, guards deployment, punishment policy, etc. You can choose to punish a lot your prisoners or make them feel at home with nice cells and reform programs to help them go back in society, it's all your choice.Furthermore, the game offers a lot of technical items you can play with to fully automatize your prison, enhance security, etc.With all that, it's still noob friendly, and you won't have to play long to get the basics.Pros :-Quite deep prison management : You control everything, from buildings layout and electrical grid to prisoners schedules, guards deploymlent, etc.-Can be extended further with mods.-Only decent prison management game I know.-Short, yet nice campaign that teach you the basics really well.-Prisons can be shared easily through steam.-Devs are still updating the game, and currently working on a more polished 2.0 update.Cons :-Can't really think of anything, maybe some little bugs.

One of the Best Prison SimulatorsThis is an addictive simulator in which you are tasked to manage a prison. There is a decent tutorial at the start which brings you up to speed on the basics of running the prison, as well as having a story with it which was a nice touch. If you are a player that enjoys micromanagement, then this game is definitely one that you'll enjoy, as you have control over almost every aspect of the prison. However, this can also be a deterrent for those that can't quite be bothered because if you don't keep some particular things in check, it will lead to problems in your prison which you'll end up having to solve and deal with the consequences. The graphics are simplistic but suits the style, as is allows for easy tracking of what's going on, and the sounds are nice to. There are many online guides to this game which is good because after the tutorial, the game doesn't hold you hand. In addition to this, they have integrated steam workshop which has allowed for many mods and prebuilt prisons to be experimented with. The developers have been great since early access, constantly pushing updates for the game that fixes issues for the game and adds new features. If you're looking to get sucked away for many hours into a simulator, then i'd definitely recommend this one.			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

Or you could do as I did and buy this game. Prison Architect is one of the best made micromanagement based games in the entire 'city builder' genre. One of the games greatest strengths is that it is both deep and also very easy to learn to play. This ables you to squeeze many hours out of a simple concept while not finding it difficult to find your own style of play. The developers seem committed to continuing to build this game and even in its current state it could be considered a fully fledched game with more content only adding to playability.Let's face it who doesn't want to keep muderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s locked up in a prison shaped like a giant falic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know I do.

What you will get is early access to a bullfrog-style Prison Management Sim that over 30,000 gamers have already thought is worth a look at.  they will send me out the game on disk as i got name in the game pack i say get the game ifs fun ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing this game since early development. (I didn't own it on steam, so my hours are very low compared to what they should be)If you like sims, or any type of create/design game I highly recommend. You can change and manage every little detail of your prison, like food, punishments etc… Or you can leave it at the default settings and still do very well. I don't know what to say about this game but i keep coming back to play.Works best if you play while watching wentworth or orange is the new black.			",73,16,0,14,22,1,20

												Started playing this game a while back, began very glitchy and quite frustrating at times, but as the alpha grew and grew, the game became loads of fun and full of opportiunties for both large success and great failure. Overall I love this game, and I probably play it most out of all of my games. It has come a great way from where it has started and never seems to let me down when I'm looking for a challenge, or browsing the steam workshop just to find a prison I can download that looks like a turtle. One bad thing about this game though is it can be very difficult to start out playing if you have no clue what you are doing and/or have no help, youtube does help a lot though in that case.  11/10			",42,1,1,5,9,0,3

												If you enjoy stategy and simulation games, as I do, there is no reason not for you to own this game. Here is a list of the things you will find yourself doing while playing this game...- Designing massive and ambitious additions to your prison and filling it with prisoners, only to find out it has massive flaws- Micro-managing random things such as who does the laundry for witch parts of the prison, scheduling classes for your prisoners, and setting up a schedule for where your guards are deployed for each hour of the day etc.- Freaking out because 100 prisoners just started to riot and are one their way to the armory- Freaking out becasue you power supply/kitchen just went up in flames and is spreading fast- Freaking out because without your knowledge all of Cell Block D has been digging tunnels for two weeks and 20 of them are making an escape attempt- Looking up on the wiki how things work10/10 Worth your money			",3,2,0,0,4,0,1

												I absolutely love Prison Architect! When I first saw it on 'early access' I didn't think I'd like it. But when it was on sale I decided to give it a shot, and I'm absolutely glad that I did. Yes, there are some performance issues, especially FPS when you have more than 1,000 prisoners, but Introversion has been working on the performance and making improvements.There's also a bit of a learning curve in the beginning, but you can watch videos on YouTube to help you with your initial design - from there you can use your imagination and learn from your mistakes.Catch PA on sale and buy it if you enjoy sim games - you won't be disappointed once you learn the basics! Also, the player made mods are fantastic and add a new level of enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning: Game is highly addictive...Wish I would have read that one review sooner...But honestly if you have any doubts about buying this game, let me enlighten you on the fact that your doubts need not even exsist. This game is insanley fun and has some rather hilarious and rage quit worthy moments. I know I held off on getting this game for a few months because I ""wasn't sure"" but I swear to god that was a huge mistake. I've only played 11 hours on this game (as of writing this review) and i'm probably about to go play it the rest of the night, rage on a prison gone wrong, and go restart another one. There are some aspects you really wish they would have informed you about as by time that issue comes up it's too late to reverse it but there's a whole bunch of answers to those issues on reddit and the forums so no worries. Extra Bonus: I just find the grapics cute/hilarious. I love watching a good fight and their fists just fly all over. It's nice to see that the devs really fixed this game up and I can't wait to play it more. 11/10			",15,14,0,6,20,0,7

								I was playing for ages, built a pretty big prison, hired loads of gaurds, and was coming up to having 100 prisoners. Then, all of them decided to riot- they killed 60% of all gaurds, so I then called the riot police to calm it down (who went on to killing the prisoners). The ones who werent killed escaped through the broken door, leaving me with a couple prisoners in solitary and hospital beds full of gaurds and janitors.It took me the next half an hour or so to get back to normal, when another riot occured.10/10, would recommend.

								This game, still in Alpha, has plenty of bugs to go around. That said, I didn't find any to be game breaking, and most of them fixed themselves after some experimentation on my part. It's all part of early access!Now the game itself. Part builder, part management game. A Sim City of prisons, and I mean the old style sim cities. It has charm, humor, strategy, and pure excellence. Herein find my pros and cons!PROS-Cute minimal graphics-Lots of room and material options-Stories on all inmates-Good strategy inside-It's as difficult as you make it to beCONS-Bugs (a given)-Lack of polishBare in mind that the only cons are basically due to the fact that it's in Alpha stage, which we know going in.

												Prison Architect is basically Sim City. But, instead of a city you manage your prison.Your job is to make sure, that no one escapes your prison.  An important part of that is keeping your prisoners happy and fullfilling their needs. That means you have to make sure everyone has enough to eat, can be visited and read etc. For me this game has a nice balance between complexity and the freedom to build the prison you want.Sadly the GUI is very complex and split up and the new added Escape Mode is not very fun, at least for me. Mostly you grind reputation through starting riots until you and your team are strong enough to get out.But after all, the normal gameplay mode is very fun and provides hours of tinkering with your prison.

												Awesome little game and the shining light for any aspiring EA developer.  The game does exactly what you expect, you can build a prison and then manage it.The campaign functions well as a good tutorial to the game.  I wish there were more grant objectives in the main game, but there are enough to keep you interested for a long time.There are a few bugs that crop up every now and again, but I've found that they usually right themselves if you save and reload the map.  This happens to me maybe once every 30-40 hrs and only on my largest prisons. Also, if you want multiples of some buildings in your prison, the AI can do some stupid things (like have 20 cooks at one kitchen, instead of 10 working in each of the two kitchens.  I would like the ability to assign staff to certain work areas (the same way you can assign prisoners to certain work areas).  But these really are minor gripes.If you like management sims or even city builders, you will probably get a lot of enjoyable gaming hours from Prison Architect.8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My one regret in this game is not making two exits to each of the kitchens. My prison caught fire, and I had to stand idly by and watch as the one exit to the kitchen and cafeteria went up in flames. Slowly, as forty prisoners and six kitchen staff huddled desperately in the corner as the blaze approached, many of their mood bubbles popped up thinking of their families in their last moments of despair. I doubted my capabilities of a responsible human being because of a 2d prison game. The guilt plagues me to this day.			",333,137,2,60,34,2,42

Early Access Review
								Solid entertainment and great value for money. Very addictive. This game will steal many, many hours from you.However.. despite all the great things that can and have been said about this game, remember it is an alpha. There are bugs. Lots of them (more than 3000, according to the latest alpha release video). I haven't experienced crashes or corrupted save games or anything like that, but sooner or later you will run into bugs that are really annoying. Like the fact that garbage dropped in a jail door tile will keep the door open at all times, and because the game doesn't recognize drops in a door tile, the garbage will never be picked up by a janitor. Imagine what a permanently open jail door can do for a prison. So yeah.. stuff like that..The UI isn't great, and it's obvious that the more new features the developers add, the more cramped and unintuitive the UI gets. It really needs an overhaul to be efficient. But it's an alpha, so maybe it will get one at some point.There's little to no guidance for new players to introduce them to the game mechanics. All it offers is a useless tutorial where you build an electric chair, that isn't really used for anything in the actual game. If you want to know what the various buildings does (what purpose they have) you have to look it up on the wiki. For end game players there's a distinct lack of feeling of progress. The tech tree is pretty small, it doesn't take long to max everything out.But, having said all that: buy this game. It's great.			",24,3,0,1,12,0,10

The mechanics are deeper than one might guess at first glance, and there's lots of tools at your disposal with which to either build your dream reform-based prison, or your dream complex of human-rights violations (or somewhere in the middle). I only played for the tail end of Alpha (the last 6-8 months or so); but I can safely say Introversion has been active and engaged with this game, even after making the final push from Early Access to full release. Their monthly Alpha development videos can still be seen on Youtube (along with their funny, self-depricating early alpha trailer that was initially what attracted me to the game).Now delightfully bug-free (or bug-minimal), the full release includes a campaign in addition to the core sandbox-style prison builder we've come to know and love.  The campaign serves as a tutorial to the game's mechanics, as well as giving an overall frame to the ""world"" of prison architect.   While much of the campagin's gameplay is a bit same-y for people who have been extensively building their own prisons, the story itself is compelling and keeps you treking towards the next snippet of story. Having said that, one chapter included gameplay I hadn't actually experienced due to my play style, which was a nice change of pace. For newcomers it is an excellent addition to give some scope of what the game can do.No game AI is without its issues, but the rate at which I find myself cursing my prison staff or wishing something had been designed differently is pretty minimal. The vast majority of issues my prisons have experienced have had something to do with something I've personally overlooked, which is exactly the experience you want to be having. TL;DR -- Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes contruction/management sims. An excellent experience. Well designed. Engaged development team.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My only complaint is sometimes you can get 'One punch man' in your prison and he quite litrally, 1 punches everything. Other then getting annoying inmates this games Normal mode and Escape mode are fun as hell to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy stategy and simulation games, as I do, there is no reason not for you to own this game. Here is a list of the things you will find yourself doing while playing this game...- Designing massive and ambitious additions to your prison and filling it with prisoners, only to find out it has massive flaws- Micro-managing random things such as who does the laundry for witch parts of the prison, scheduling classes for your prisoners, and setting up a schedule for where your guards are deployed for each hour of the day etc.- Freaking out because 100 prisoners just started to riot and are one their way to the armory- Freaking out becasue you power supply/kitchen just went up in flames and is spreading fast- Freaking out because without your knowledge all of Cell Block D has been digging tunnels for two weeks and 20 of them are making an escape attempt- Looking up on the wiki how things work10/10 Worth your money			",3,2,0,0,4,0,1

												ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE GAMES!If you rolled around in the joy and happiness of PC Management and building games in the late 90's/early 00's then you will love this game.  It has the depth and wonder that games like Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 and Theme Hospital (to name just a couple) had.Even if you never experienced the joy of that period this game will blow your mind.  It is stocked with amazing features, wonderful AI and immence potential to do EVERYTHING you can possibly think of.  Honestly, buy this game and you will not be disappointed.

								Prison Architect is the first game that got me into buying Alpha/Beta games.  What a joy it has been to progress with this game and its updates.  This game pretty much has it all.  You get the simulation by building your own prison.  This can be done very easily or (if you intend to have alots of prisoners who are hard criminals) this can be very hard.  The game includes fincial managment, but not to a level of frustration.  You start off in a small prison where one of the prisoners is being put to death.  Your first job is to make a death row cell for them.  You easily learn the basics of the game as you start to build.  Once this is done, you're left on your own to build, create, destory, and exapnd.It is up to you if you want to reform your prisoners and give them jobs, education and other skills.  Or as Warden you can keep them locked up tightly unable to have any freedoms.  Gangs fight often and snitches get stiches real quick!  Find a few CIs to help you keep the hard to handle prisoners under control.Train your guards, hire some guard dogs, and build a nice security system.  Your limits are boundless, truely.  And don't let the Alpha scare you away.  The game bugs are fixed quickly and any updates make you seem like you've gotten a brand new game.Enjoy!			",11,10,0,19,49,1,13

												If you want to lose sleep, this game will do it - not because it's scary, but because it's so incredibly addictive, you'll lose track of time and become a mindless zombie, glued to the keyboard. There are different ways to play - you can run a men's or women's prison but no co-ed. The women's prison comes equipped with nurseries and sad little inmates carrying babies around. It's a little stressfull, worrying about babies in cages with murderers, but what can you do? You can choose to be a cruel and harsh warden, or the coolest warden ever. You can make a prison where people are dying to get in, or dying before they get out. The possibilites are great and the game is well worth the money.			",5,4,0,1,5,0,4

								Game's got a long way to go, but for an Early Access beta, it's pretty good. I easily dropped about several hours worth of play into it, but eventually wasn't sure what to do after that. Some aspects are more annoying than helpful in my personal opinion, and there seems to be a glitch where objects get built in a funky order...and causes problems. But, all in all, quite a fun game.

								This game has the minor details of managing a prison.  From  fighting contraband, tasking gaurd dogs, building an execution room.  The first mistake I made was placing trust in the hands of the prisoners.  I made a prison with no perimeter wall, no fences, no cell doors, and the prisoners one by one walked out of the prison.  If you dont build a fence, to pen them in, they will escape.  Congratulations game developers, you exhibit an understanding of human behavior, that provides an entertaining amount of detail to the gameplay.  I look forward to seeing the persistence of these prisoners overtime.			",93,31,1,18,13,0,20

								I'm an old geezer that rarely gets hooked by games, I've tried a few lately; and though recommended by many people they just didn't get hooked to them for to long. But Prison Architect was a completely different story!------First of all - Don't be afraid its ALPHA - in fact this game has more depth than many completed titles, updates are delivered regularly and all of them seemed to bring more and more fun after looking back at their introduction videos on youtube. Second of all - Don't be afraid that the game looks a bit ""cheap"" visually. It really has nothing to do with the game quality itself (except for the graphical part of course). The UI though is well sorted and you won't have problems finding any controls. ------Now the game itself is a blast, the mechanics behind the prison construction are super cool and you can set up almost everything even manually if needed. What is good for the start you're limited to a few building options so you don't get lost. As you progress with development of your prison, you can research additional options and learn the game on the fly.The way you construct the prison brings a lot of possible situations, there are dozens of valid prison designs that work well - they're only limited by your fantasy and building skills.------Now I cut it short for the end of the review telling you  what all you can do in your prison - accomodate different security prisoners- each prisoner has different needs, behavior etc.- dozens of rooms to choose from (kitchen, canteen, workshop, classroom, armory etc. and in the end all are needed for a perfect prison- at least 10 different staff personell to rent- some prisoners can get paroled, sometimes you get legendary prisoner that beats the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta everyone and you need to contain and treat him differently- you can force prisoners to work so that they make you more cash- you organize various classes for prisoners so they get reformed and increase your prison rating- riots- fights- escaping tunnels- etc- etc- etcnuff said :)			",23,6,0,9,7,0,7

								Love this game to death. The developers are easily some of the best around, and they have turned a great game into a lasting classic. The only minor quibble I have about the game is long-term goals (or lack thereof), but frankly, it's not a big deal. I have a blast simply starting a new prison every time I load the game up, and if I ever do get one running and feel like there's nothing more to do, I never feel bad starting up a new one the next day. (Although, I would enjoy some goals added to keep a persistent save going, and have that missing element.)This is a must buy, and I will buy all of the new games they make if they're anything remotely like Prison Architect in quality and fun. Do yourself a favor, commit a crime and put yourself in prison. You'll be glad you did!Wait, what?			",232,59,1,74,102,4,81

												Although the game is still badly synchronised and the grid-based GUI is annoying as hell to use without inducing some cyber-OCD here and there, the depth and charm of the campaign's storyline blew me away. Aside from following the same general procedure of prison tycoon games, the inner micromanagement workings of the game would challenge your sense of morality and humanity more than your favorite crime investigation/thriller film. Come for the tedious yet inspiring gameplay, stay for the true meaning of the name ""Introversion Software"".			",30,0,0,1,16,0,7

												Although the game is still badly synchronised and the grid-based GUI is annoying as hell to use without inducing some cyber-OCD here and there, the depth and charm of the campaign's storyline blew me away. Aside from following the same general procedure of prison tycoon games, the inner micromanagement workings of the game would challenge your sense of morality and humanity more than your favorite crime investigation/thriller film. Come for the tedious yet inspiring gameplay, stay for the true meaning of the name ""Introversion Software"".			",30,0,0,1,16,0,7

								It's a good management sim, and good builder as well. Gets a little boring after a while, but they have monthly updates with new content, so it is being actively improved. It may be in Early Access, but it is complete enough to play and enjoy, so I would have to say it is a pretty good game all in all. If you are against Early Access, then just wait for it to come out at 1.0.			",9,0,0,3,13,0,23

								Great game, but the fact that it's in alpha shows. At the moment I can't get my builders to build anything without having to hold their hands through it. I started my game able to build twenty cells at a time, now I have to manage oen cell at a time to make sure that the walls are valid to build. The workers don't get trapped inside, they just refuse to build a wall and shows a big ""x"" on where they should be building it. It's a great game until you reach that bug, then it becomes a convoluted mess and is frustrating as hell. Also, some more work or information needs to be given regarding work and reeducation programs, I had no idea what to do and took me forever to figure out, though that might just be me.But, as I said, the unbugged version of the game is great, but it's frustrating when alpha like bugs are still present in a core element as essential as the builders. 7/10 debug the builders and I'll make it a 9.

Prison Architect ReviewSimualtion and tycoon game based on prison.Prison Architect is a must-have in your Steam library. I absolutely love games with the ""Play God"" like style. It means you control everything and manage everything. It also is unbelievable how fun it is to create riots, fire and commotion inside your own prison. Especially if you've built it yourself. You hire staff, you tell them what to do, they do it. Guards, riot police, doctors, dog handlers, firemen, managers, workmen, gardeners, janitors and all that jazz. Brilliant game and a must have, yes, it's in Alpha and contains a few little bugs but the game is playable and very enjoyable. Thumbs up to developers!I love this game so much that I have infact, to support the developers, bought all of the developers games and bought the expansion for Prison Architect so I can have myself as a prisoner in the game.

												Started playing this game a while back, began very glitchy and quite frustrating at times, but as the alpha grew and grew, the game became loads of fun and full of opportiunties for both large success and great failure. Overall I love this game, and I probably play it most out of all of my games. It has come a great way from where it has started and never seems to let me down when I'm looking for a challenge, or browsing the steam workshop just to find a prison I can download that looks like a turtle. One bad thing about this game though is it can be very difficult to start out playing if you have no clue what you are doing and/or have no help, youtube does help a lot though in that case.  11/10			",42,1,1,5,9,0,3

								Hold on, hold on...you're telling me this is in ALPHA? Where are the bugs? Because I've found absolutely nothing that's buggier than a full release game.With that out of the way...Prison Architect is an incredibly addictive game about building and managing your own prison. It's surprisingly open-ended. Following is a list of things you can (but, in some cases, probably shouldn't) do:-Cram a hundred prisoners into a single holding cell with only one toilet.-Replace a prisoner's cell door with a wall while he sleeps, leaving him with no way out besides digging a tunnel.-Place someone guilty of, say, mere shoplifting, in a SuperMax cell.-Place someone guilty of triple homocide in a minimum security cell.-Allow your prisoners to attend AA meetings.-Set all 24 one-hour blocks to work time; your prisoners will never sleep!-Have K-9 units patrol the cells, sniffing for contraband.-Order full-prison shakedowns whenever you want.-Execute them!-Dude acting up? Give the order to freefire. BLOOD! EVERYWHERE!-DON'T TAZE ME, BRO!-Feed your prisoners only one meal a day.-Or zero.-Or twelve.-Kill a particularly troublesome prisoner by setting up isolated supermax cells and setting the supermax's regime to 24-hour-a-day lockup. They will die of starvation after a few days. (Hopefully, the as-yet non-functional electric chair will later expedite this process)-Buy trees for $100, and, through prisoner workshop labor, sell the end products for $800. Better yet, automate the entire process for ludicrous profits!			",99,23,0,61,14,2,31

								Prison Architect is a very well designed game. You don't just build a prison, you also manage one. You can have multiple save profiles active at once and the fact that the game can last for a very long time due to no end to the game. There are thousands of options when it comes to modding from the steam workshop.The only negative I have is not everything like contraband is as clear as it could be. Also there are only male prisoners at this point but the game is an alpha and there are many forums for your suggestions and to talk with other players.I reccomend prison architect but it can get a little bit repetitive if you play it a lot.

One of the Best Prison SimulatorsThis is an addictive simulator in which you are tasked to manage a prison. There is a decent tutorial at the start which brings you up to speed on the basics of running the prison, as well as having a story with it which was a nice touch. If you are a player that enjoys micromanagement, then this game is definitely one that you'll enjoy, as you have control over almost every aspect of the prison. However, this can also be a deterrent for those that can't quite be bothered because if you don't keep some particular things in check, it will lead to problems in your prison which you'll end up having to solve and deal with the consequences. The graphics are simplistic but suits the style, as is allows for easy tracking of what's going on, and the sounds are nice to. There are many online guides to this game which is good because after the tutorial, the game doesn't hold you hand. In addition to this, they have integrated steam workshop which has allowed for many mods and prebuilt prisons to be experimented with. The developers have been great since early access, constantly pushing updates for the game that fixes issues for the game and adds new features. If you're looking to get sucked away for many hours into a simulator, then i'd definitely recommend this one.			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

The depth of thought and work put into this game makes it worth it, as is, at full price I might add. Aside from being a testament to Bullfrog, and in my opinion, it's right to do so, this game is just fun, plain and simple.			",220,27,6,19,21,2,27

												Really fun and interactive game.  I've consistently played this game both legitly and with the sand box mode and I can honestly say that this game is very easy to stay in to.  With the large variation of things you can do it is hard to get bored.  I've found myself experimenting with tons of different types of prisons, from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones that give no freedom to prisoners to lush and lavish ones.  Great game and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a game they can just chill out to and play for hours ",20,3,0,2,4,0,4

												Prison architect is fun. The main game mode is, as the title suggests, being a prison architect. However, you can also be a prisoner in a megaprison of the computer's design. At first, I thought the game was insanely hard. I had a bunch of criminals waiting on the sidewalk while I tried to make a dorm room with no cash at all. Over time, however, the game got easier. The money I got from the inmates flooding in meant I rarely had to worry about bankruptcy. I expanded my prison to house hundreds of inmates, including dozens of super-maximum security prisoners, and added doctors, guards, and more cooks so the prisoners stopped dying of starvation, fights, and wounds inflicted by guards. This was going swimmingly until I realized that more than 40 prisoners had escaped through a tunnel, causing me to get fired. This game has a ton of options for how you want to run your prison, such as a single concrete depressing building or a expansive grassy enjoyable paradise. You can do whatever you want with this game. 10/10.			",35,1,1,3,14,0,6

Early Access Review
I am reviewing this game during Early Access in February of 2015. At the time of this review the most recent update is Alpha 29.Right up front I will say this: If you enjoy tycoon, management, and building sims then you will most likely enjoy this game. It is definitely worth purchasing, especially if you manage to catch it on sale. I highly recommend it.Prison Architect is a prison building and management sim wherein you manage a prison from on high as a sort of prison god. You are given planning tools to plan the layout of your prison. You have access to building tools that allow you to directly place walls, floors, doors, ligths, and equipment. You can hire staff. You can set patrols for your guards. You can order searches and shakedowns. You can set schedules for your prisoners to follow. You can institute educational and work programs. And you can have your guards run phone taps to discover when a prisoner may be expecting some illicit goods to be thrown in over an exterior wall. There are of course the expected shower shankings and prison riots as well.There is a ton to do and a lot to like about Prison Architect. Planning and managing successful prison is a rewarding experience that comes with a fair number of challenges. Those interested in a more easy-going experience might run a lightly secured prison for minimum security (white-collar crime) prisoners. If you're interested in a real challenge you can turn on ""continuous intake"" and load up on maximum, or super-max security prisoners until your prison is consumed by a full on riotous bloodbath that must be quelled by the military.Honestly the game is one of those that you can tweak to suit your playstyle, which is one reason why I find it so appealing. Heck, if you're into logic puzzles or programming you can even combine timers and logic gates to control your doors and make your prisons even more secure through automation.If I have any complaints at this point they are these:First, with the game still in development there really is no tutorial to speak of. If you're new, you'll have to spend some time learning what it takes to make a good prison. The grants do a good job of giving you goals to work towards to set up your first prisons, and they are helpful. But the logic circuits and pressure plates controlling your doors, the confidential informants, and some rooms like the library and the chapel are all examples of new(ish) additions that do not yet have in-game tutorials. I'm certain this will be fixed in time, but for now if you want to learn about these things checking let's plays on YouTube or exploring the wiki are your only options.And second, there are some performance issues. This is Alpha, and I admit my computer is behind the times, but in the utilities screen especially I experience significant slowdown in comparison to the rest of the game. It's still completely playable, but something to note. Certainly not extreme enough to be a deal breaker.Those are my only gripes. And I can easily overlook them because A) This is an Early Access title, and B) The developers are very communicative, provide regular updates, and are clearly putting every effort they can into making this game excellent.I can easily, unabashedly, recommend Prison Architect. It's incredibly fun already and continues to improve. Even if for some reason the developers suddenly vanished from the face of the earth Prison Architect would still be worth purchasing and playing in its current state.			",92,40,2,26,37,1,37

								This game is a really good way to pass some time or to get sucked into it. Build your personal prison, manage your inmates and your staff. Earn some money by producing numberplates, timber or beds and build more prison.It,s not very time consuming to get the game mechanics and i doesn't take too much power of your PC. Easily playable while on the move, so u can waste some time during a car ride or waiting for your plan to board.Highly recommended 10/10			",329,50,10,23,28,2,33

I highly recommend this game.THE GOODIt's fun to manage what goes on in the prison. You get to view the daily lives of your prisoners and enforce punishments on them if necessary. You also get to experience events like riots, gang wars, floods, fires, etc. Most of them are optional. It also gets better: mods. You get to spice up your gameplay or add cosmetics with mods made by the players themselves. The only issue is that certain mods don't work well with others, forcing you to deactivate one of them, but that type of stuff is supposed to happen. If you ever get bored of managing, you can play Escape Mode. It's exactly what it sounds like. You play as the prisoner and try to escape a prison of your choice by any means necessary. Finding weapons, boosting your rep to make you stronger, forming a gang, BURNING DOWN THE PRISON WITH A LIGHTER, anything!If you get tired of working on your prison, you can go to the workshop and view prisons uploaded by the players. Some of them are even from the devs.They even have a hidden feature that allows you to switch to 3D. Not sure if this is being added soon or if it's just an easter egg. I wouldn't recommend playing the game with this feature because some objects remain flat and haven't been converted to 3D yet, but it is nice to use when you want to see how your prison would look in 3D. Don't try this feature out if your PC isn't good because you will experience a lot of lag depending on how big the prison is.There are features to make it harder for experienced players. The game can either be easy or hard depending on how you like it. You can enable weather, disasters, gangs, etc. to make the prison even harder to manage. There are even mods that you can get that make it even more hard to keep you on your toes.The best part of it all is that the devs care about the players. They're constantly updating this game with new features that we can enjoy.THE BADWith every game comes bad aspects.For starters, apparently this doesn't sync your prison save files. With that being said, make sure you backup your files. Once it's gone, it's gone (unless you upload it to the Workshop, but it will be public for everyone to use).Another issue is fps drops. It doesn't matter if you have the best $10,000 custom homemade PC, you can still drop frames. This only happens when you put the game under a lot of stress: 1k+ prisoners, having a crap ton of stuff in storage, etc. Hopefully the game will be better optimized in the future.The staff can get confused at times. Say I have a hole in the wall that leads to the road beside the prison. If I fill that hole up while a worker has a planned route that goes through that hole, that worker will continue walking into the wall for some time (about 15-30 seconds) until they realize that they need to form a new route. This doesn't occur often and you will only really see this when you make major structural changes to your prison.Closing a door while someone is going through it will make it continuously open and close on them until you reopen it so they can get through. It's not a major issue, but should be fixed.Emergency services can sometimes get stuck in place even after you disband them. Not sure if this is because of one of the mods I'm using or the game itself.When you want to dismantle a utility like a water pipe or an electric cable, it dismantles everything that's placed with it. Say you have a water pipe running through the walls and an electric cable stacked on top of it. If you want to dismantle a certain part of that cable, any water pipe on it will also get removed, forcing you to rebuild that pipe. Hopefully the devs will make seperate ultility dismantle buttons for electric cables and water pipes.There's not really anything else I can say about the game that's bad. Maybe there's more issues that I haven't come across yet, but for now my issues with this game are few.SUMMARYAll in all, this is a highly addictive, fun micromanagement game that simulates you being the warden of a prison. You experience hardships, riots, gang wars and more, but you can lay down the iron fist when necessary. You get to play an escape mode where you're the prisoner and there are even mods to make the gameplay better. The game has it's bugs and glitches, but they aren't too bad. There's tons more than what I mentioned, so if you want more, watch some YouTube videos on the game or try it out for yourself. If you find yourself disliking the game, I suggest giving it a chance up to the point where you have a few prisoners. Having prisoners is what really brings it all together, so don't expect to find yourself enjoying a prison management game when you haven't gotten any prisoners or staff yet. I've seen people complain about learning how to play (mainly dealing with building), but this is the type of game that you have to mess around with in order to learn. If you still find yourself confused, there are boxes in each tool labeled with a question mark that gives you extra information on how to use that tool. If that doesn't help, there are tutorials available on YouTube.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Get some min sec prisoners, unlock patrols, get med sec, get dogs, get cctv, max sec prisoners, etc, etc. But remember to pay attention to your bank and if your balance drops low... you complete some grants and make some more money.

												You dont like agressive prisoners? Me too.For this reason I got guards, dogs, guns and an electric chair. And if the prisoners get agressive, hit them with a stick, bite them with dogs, shoot them with guns or put them on an electric chair.Now they are nice and friendly... no, they are probably dead... but HEY! No more problems!Just kidding, there are alway as**oles who want to make trouble :) 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've been playing this since Alpha 12 and have watched it become more complex with each update.While playing a standard game is still harder than it needs to be with the prices of objects versus the amount of money you can make in a day before any of the prisioners get through the class needed for them to work for you in the workshop, playing with a unlimited money map downloaded from the Steam Workshop is a joy.You can build a prsion however you see fit and allow in whichever of the three custody levels you want (or two or all three levels). You find how you build and how you treat the prisions with the regieme you set and the food levels you set, etc. changes how they act. You can cause riots or prevent them by changing how your prision works.Currently there are bugs that can be annoying. The reform programs are crippled in the Alpha 23 update for example. Do I think they break the game or make it not worth playing? No, not at all. You can get around most of them. And since the save game you are on will still work with the next update there's no reason not to play while you wait on a patch/update. I loaded up an old prison from Alpha 16 just to see if it'd go in Alpha 23 and it plays fine. There are a few things I want to see improved or fixed. How kitchens work, making it so the prisioners will sleep in the day if their regeme says to sleep instead of only sleeping from 11pm on, the deployment screen needs revamped to where I can say two custody levels can share a space without saying all three levels can go there, and I'd like to see more two square wide doors. My current pet peeve is that it sometimes takes a prisoner 20 mins to decide what they are doing once they arrive at the canteen to eat and they usually pick another activity than eating even if it is the most critical need they have. I'd like to see prisoners actually use the common room instead of walking past it to go halfway across the prison to use an item that's also in the common room. I'd like to see the cells dropdown tell you how many cells you have desginated in each custody level out behind the prisoners number instead of having to remember what you've marked with what. At the rate the developers have been going I expect they'll improve on all the things that currently annoy me. Even with the annoyances this is my go-to game to play.Do I think you should pay full price? Nope. Do I think you should stick this on your wishlist and wait for a sale? Totally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have played this on and off for a little while now and i am so glad the developers are sticking with it.The updates have been great, the latest incarnation (alpha28 at time of writing) has enough in it that I spent a few weeks trying to make the perfect prison.As always in early access there are rough edges, the in game help isnt really there yet, probably because a lot of features will change again before release.However there is enough that with some trial and error, a few runaways, a couple of injured guards and a shanked snitch, you will figure most of the features out. There is also a pretty active community on the forums and such.The game has humor and is well on its way to being a proper little gem.			",98,12,9,21,56,3,61

												This is hands down my favorite management game of all time. Something about constructing a prison piece by piece and just watching it function is absolutely amazing. To me, at least, it's a little bit like building a giant ant farm - give it all the resources it needs to survive, and then watch the prison go through its routine, changing some things around every now and then. There are fewer rules and challenges compared to something like Rimworld but the tradeoff is more creativity and more freedom.I've spent about 140 hours as of writing this review and I'm not as into it as I was in early hours but I really didn't expect to get so much out of such a small game. I can't exactly place what makes the experience of Prison Architect so interesting to me but I love it. There's a balance of whackiness and potential seriousness that makes the setting fun too. Oh, and you can try to escape your own prison, so that's pretty cool, though I prefer burning it down.			",103,7,0,9,14,1,8

												The devs at Introversion simply did a great job improving the game continuously and listening to fans since they first released the alpha back in 2012, and even after they released the game in 2015. I guarantee that even if sim-building games aren't usually your thing, you will have a lot of fun managing your own prison full of potentially (not so much potentially more as certainly) extremely hostile and totally uncooperative inmates with complicated yet surprisingly simple needs. Whether you just want to let out your dark side and suppress a bunch of prisoners with shotgun-wielding guards in every corner of the prison, or if you want to try and build a prison of reform, efficient production, and order (that will inevitably involve a hefty network of contraband that will force you to let out your dark side), you will enjoy Prison Architect, and for such a reasonable price (even out of sale), what are you waiting for?

								Prison Architect is a game where you construct and manage your own prison.You need to ensure prisoners don't escape or die, as these get you penalized, while also fulfilling their needs so they won't riot.At the same time, you'll be almost constantly expanding so you can hold more prisoners (though this does make any potential riots more destructive!) and earn more income.To help you out, you can take out grants which give you a lump sum of money on acceptance and more upon completion of stated requirements, such as hiring a certain number of staff members or building up capacity for a set amount of prisoners.The game is fun and challenging, although there's currently not enough content to justify the full price in my opinion.If you can get the game at half price, it's well worth it; otherwise I would wait for more content to be added.

								This is one of them early access games that comes along and absorbes you totally into its world and the best thing about it is that you let it. This is a work in progress but right from the first day i got it i was amazed at how much was available and managed to loose hours of my day to creating a perfect prison only for the next update to come along and render my previous prison redundant, but i loved the fact that each time i have to restart beause there is a massive charm to this game that makes u fall in love with it and just keep trying again. I dont think i could convey to you the love i have for this game and the joy i found by mearly stumbling across an article describing this new early access game that people should play but jump in with both feet cause the fun, the trial and error, the comedy and the love that the guys at introversion have put into this is well worth the money you will pay for it. god bless the fact that this is an independant company cause it alows them the freedom to do want they want and not be forced into doing something that others tell them to, which makes this game fantastic!

								Prison Architect is a fun game where you build a pirson, fill it with prisoners and employee and watch as your prisoners try to kill themsevles while in solitary confinement and guards detour from their patrol-paths to stare at sleeping prisoners for an hour or two.Then you proceed to search every inmate, cell and place they could hide stuff into and find out two prisoners have connected their cells with a tunnel. And that begins a lovestory in your prison.- That is, until the other one got stabbed in the shower and later died because your doctors are lazy as♥♥♥♥♥♥and unless you directly command them, they'd rather leave the inmates to die.Also, technically you could run a sweatshop, have the prisoners work trhoughout the day and night. If you want, they don't even have to get sleep. Though they'll probably die after rioting against you, but with enough guards, I'm sure it'll be fine.I do recommend on getting it. But, I personally wouldn't, and didn't get it for the price of 27,99-45,99. If you have a good amount of income/money and such amounts feel like a small amount to you, sure, buy it for the full price. If you're usually a bit short on money, I'd say wait for a sale of at least 50% off.			",146,28,3,30,35,0,31

								*Note: At time of writing I have mods installed: Call-in Army, Bomb mod, glass walls, and GuardsUseGuns*They become angrier and angrier, but I can't let them out, them out. Everything in there is ruined, and I have  one option left. Four vans roll in, men jump out, ignoring the guards I sent to brief them on the mission. They run over to the prison block, and go through the back door, hidden in the Kitchen. They don't bother to unlock it, they just shoot it down. I sit outside, hearing the sound of gunfire, screaming, shouting and the sound of pure fear.Five minutes later, the six men walk out, ignoring me, and they walk back to their vans. Me and my bodyguard detail go inside.The former prison is now a sea of blood and corpses, the prisoners I once tried to reform, to help, dead at my feet.Two days later I'm fired, all my work bulldozed to make flats. Will those who live there in the future know about the massacre that happened on the ground where they live? I don't think so.			",122,12,0,13,12,1,5

I highly recommend purchasing while in early access so you can provide input and help guide the development process.  Now if I could only find a way to keep my snitches from getting shanked all would be great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I pirated this game when it wasn't on steam (Please don't judge me it was expensive((It still is)) sorry). Back then it was a super fun game but really flat, was done with it in 2 hours. I have to say congratulations, the improvement is real. I bought the game and have been playing it nonstop, so much fun! It has a lot of stuff to discover, and when you first buy the game, a lot of it is just discovering and starting again because you messed up. Even when you think you know everything, you probably don't.Also keep reminding yourself to always keep an eye on your prisoners, things go south very fast. I recommend this game because it's a lot of fun, but not for this price. Seriously the price is way too high. I bought it on the steam summer sale for 5 euros, so I would suggest waiting for a sale.Overall a very nice game!EDIT: It's good to see that Indie developers care about their game and always work on it, instead of just asking a hell of a lot of money for it and making minor improvement (we all know which games I'm talking about) It's expensive, but with all the major updates and Prison Architect being out of Alpha, it's damn worth it. Congratulations developers!Definitly recommend it!			",55,10,0,3,12,0,3

								As a sandbox and sim game lover, I would recommend this game to anyone with similar gaming interests.  It is challenging in many ways, with multiple possiblilities, and countless hours of entertainment attempting to not only keep prisoners happy, but also keep them from escaping, killing other prisoners, killing staff, breaking things, overdosing on drugs, etc. For an early access game I have been absolutely impressed and I am looking forward to the coming improvements as the game gains popularity and interest.  Never before did I think I would be so excited to play God with inmates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

 TMB Reviews   Prison Architect  Prison Arcitect is great game, allowing the player to go in dept with what they are creating, not only does it give the feel of a good old Sim City like game, it allows the user to immerse themselves into the role of a warden like character, setting the regime that can differ for each security level, it allows the user to create jobs for the prisoners in places like the library and laundry room, it allows you to be a complete D*** and throw some poor guy in solitary for the rest of his stay.The game is a work of art, so stop reading my rambling and go and get it already.Oh and it has workshop funtionality, where users like myself can post maps for you to use and improve upon.

								This game pushes you to human rights violation. And it is all about this.Jokes apart it is one of the most beautiful (and funny) game of this kind I have ever played. It has many aspects to follow and your prisoners will try to escape whenever they get the chance to do so. They can even use water pipes to build tunnels!Graphics and Audio are acceptable, the audio is pretty good but this game has no soundtrack. Graphics on the other side have their own style and are enjoyable to watch.The Gameplay is always new and sometimes challenging. Nothing else to say about this little masterpiece. You'll have lots of fun playing it, even if you don't actually like these kind of games.81/100			",157,30,4,17,19,1,29

								Very buggy but to be expected from an early access game. I have also seen that this has been updated quite alot and I expect alot from it in the future.I suggest you wait for it to go on sale,like I did (I got it for £6.67).I'm having alot of fun and the workshop makes it greater.

								This game has an odd attraction about it. I can't figure out WHY I play it, all I know is that I love playing it. Every time, I get bored, walk away, and come back to it a few weeks later. If you find it on sale, you should definitely pick this game up.			",141,19,7,17,29,2,24

												Fun, In-depth, and always being updated!Prison Architect is easily a game you can lose track of time playing. Not a complaint in the least. Needless to say in simulation games peak your interest give this game a solid try. It can usually be found on sale, however it is worth the full price tag if you rather not wait.			",78,9,0,9,9,1,10

								I read another review that said ""just buy it all ready"" so I did. That was a great decision.Brilliant: The game runs great; it’s really fluid and entertaining for an Alpa. I get little bugs here and there, like doors don’t set themselves in after placing them. It’s really rare and I can fix it by destroying resetting the door. I treat every alpha update like a free DLC.Graphics: At first I thought I wouldn’t like it because of the graphics. However, I’ve grown to like the cartoony look and I don’t think any other way would be better. After all it’s the gameplay that makes this game. I dig it now.Predictability: I find it really fun when a prisoner does something I wouldn’t think he could do. They are very smart and will try and escape whenever the opportunity arises. They’ll steal items from the prison and if you don’t have effective metal detectors, you’ll have a dead body in a cell block come morning time. Value: For $30! I feel like I’ve gotten a good deal. I didn’t pay to get a prisoner named after me, I wish I did. Overall: 9/10. It’s a great game, it’s fun, and I feel like it has a lot more room to expand. It’s not for everybody, but if you like sims: Grab it now! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've done everything there is to do in PA thus far. That being said I still find myself coming back to this addicting game every month for their update. And the devs do not dissappoint, they listen to gamers ideas. And come out with a video explaing what they have been up too for the month.In short PA will keep you playing for hours and hours without a break (except for letting pizza guy in and bathroom breaks) With updates every month and a solid bug report system that allows us (the gamers) vote which ones should be addressed first. I cant think of why you wouldn't want to buy this game.Devs interaction with community 10/10Game itself (for a alpha) 10/10			",37,2,0,2,9,1,7

								Double the quantity of meals served, sparkling a riot, and see 300 rioting prisonners get shot by your unrestrained armed guards, ending the said riot.11/10 would riot again.Be nice and participate to the program so the devs can actually end developing this cute prison simulator.

								I love this game, and to still call in 'early access' is almost a joke. This could easily be sold as a full game in its current state and I'd be totally happy with that.This is a god-interaction game in which you send builders in to build the foundations and walls of your prison, delegate the furniture, pick what 'upgrades' you want (CCTV, hightened security, informants, and much more) if you have the money, decide the routine (time to sleep, time to eat, time to work, time to sit in your cell and be bored) etc.You can manage it right down to the quality of their meals. Plan the staff, give them dedicated routes, automatically increase the security at high risk times such as meal times or free time.If you want to play the standard mode then you have to work with the budget you have. Take on contracts to boost your pot and increase your prison. Are you a labour-driven workaholic who focuses only on his prisoners suffering? Or are you a 'second chance' person who equips their prisoners with knowledge and gives them the tools to prepare them for returning to a working society?If you ever get bored of the standard mode, drop by the PA Steam Workshop and pick up new elements of gameplay - make your prisoners work a vegetable patch as well as the standard workshop, open up a mil sorting office to give postal happiness to prisoners and staff alike, or subscribe to the 'sandbox mode' mod which opens up a basic starter plot with $999,999,999,999 and lets you on your way.I love PA - I recommend it to everyone.

												Early Access done right.What Introversion made is one of the best 'tycoon' style games ever made.The sandbox mode is utterly amazing with almost limitless ways of designing and managing your prison layout and the campaign missions give you a creatively written storyline as well as giving you subtle tutorials on how to play the game in sandbox mode as each of the campaign missions focuses on specific elements of prison building and management.9/10			",46,13,0,19,16,0,14
